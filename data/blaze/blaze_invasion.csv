"Delano Squires: LeBron James, Serena Williams, activists athletes should publicly defend women athletes against transgender invasion","Professional sports have been completely taken over by politics. What started with athletes protesting during the national anthem and demanding team support for political causes has culminated in the leagues themselves using courts, fields, and jerseys to promote ""racial equity"" and major corporations weighing in on proposed state legislation.

Conspicuously absent from the list of causes worthy of increased awareness are the girls and women who have publicly opposed the inclusion of biological males in women's sports. State laws that attempt to restrict girls' sports to biological females have been characterized in corporate media outlets from USA Today to ESPN as attacks against transgender athletes. The Biden administration withdrew from a federal lawsuit in Connecticut that tried to limit participation in girls' sports to female athletes. The passage of the Equality Act by the House of Representatives early this year further demonstrates that the girls fighting for athletic fairness have as little support among elected officials as they do in corporate media or pop culture.

I find it fascinating that no professional leagues, high-profile players, or social justice activists have spoken up to say anything about how these changes will impact girls and women who have trained from a young age to compete at the highest levels. The WNBA has carved out a reputation for being very active in protesting racial justice causes, but it has been completely silent on an issue that could have a direct impact on the league. The same can be said for Jemele Hill, Serena Wiliams, LeBron James, and Megan Rapinoe. Each one has argued for using their platforms to speak for the voiceless and advocate for the marginalized.



This issue shows the limits of activism in sports. Players and sports journalists know that engaging in social justice causes, whether on or off the court, can improve their public profile as long as the issue is in line with the cultural zeitgeist. What's more difficult, and much less culturally rewarding, is to come out against a policy that many see as the latest frontier of justice for an oppressed group.

This type of selective activism is a sign of cowardice.

The most elite female athletes know that their male counterparts are bigger, stronger, and faster and that no amount of hormone therapy can totally eradicate those physical advantages. They are afraid of saying anything that would offend the transgender community or bring them criticism on social media. They sit by as girls suffer the public indignity of standing on the podium and smiling as a biological male walks away with medals and prize money that is meant for female athletes.

The left's radical views on sex and gender are the types of changes that destabilize societies. While they focus on race — which is literally skin deep — they completely ignore the long-term physical, emotional, and societal impacts of rejecting the body'snatural design and telos. People who think their bodies and minds are in conflict with one another need care and compassion, specifically because I believe that God created males and females equal in dignity and worth but different in composition and function. People who don't share my Christian convictions should at least trust science enough to know that while much of the public debate about gender identity focuses on what people feel and believe, athletics are largely an exercise in what the body can do. Thinking you were born in the wrong body doesn't change the physical advantages that body provides. Unfortunately, too few people are willing to acknowledge that fact. Activist athletes want to be seen as revolutionaries ushering in a new age of social equality. They're not. The only thing radical about them is their conformity to whatever opinions the cultural gatekeepers deem acceptable.

"Squires: America is learning: Countries that sow self-hatred, narcissism, and feminized masculinity reap self-destruction","One of the most fascinating developments over the past week has been watching political pundits and social commentators celebrate virtues in Ukraine, from armed resistance to national loyalty, that are frequently criticized in America.

My sense is that the ruling class assumes our citizens would have the same response to a hostile foreign invasion. They may be right, but the biblical principle of sowing and reaping suggests a very different outcome.

A recent tweet from NPR is one example of the type of seed that finds fertile ground in our culture.

“Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system. Here are 5 ways to cope.”

The entire thread was completely on-brand for NPR, from the thumbnail illustration of an androgynous person of color laying in the fetal position to the language of personal therapy emanating from the subsequent tweets.

It was an easy alley-oop for the conservatives on Twitter who shared the post to the followers, but the post was an important snapshot of the character traits being cultivated in our society.

We have become a fragile nation increasingly unable to deal with the realities of life. The 2016 election of Donald Trump made this crystal clear. Colleges across the country offered students play dough, coloring books, hot chocolate, and bubbles to cope with the stress of an election outcome.

Previous generations of young men between 18 and 22 stormed the beaches of Normandy, fought the Viet Cong in Da Nang, and were beaten during Freedom Rides for civil rights in America. Early adulthood now is characterized by safe spaces and comfort animals.

The NPR post wasn’t just a window into American fragility. It was also another example of our most popular faith – the cult of self. One Army recruitment ad in 2021 followed the story of “Emma,” a soldier who talked about being inspired to join the military after reflecting on the activism of her two moms and adventure-seeking sorority sisters.

The video is a perfect distillation of America in the 21st century – the ultimate act of self-sacrifice has been transformed into a personal vanity project of self-fulfillment. Recruitment ads from China and Russia show young men leaving their families, engaging in physically demanding training exercises, jumping out of planes, scaling walls, and driving tanks. The virtues being promoted in their ads – bravery, sacrifice, honor, discipline, patriotism, courage – transcend language and nationality.

What makes things even more difficult is the extent to which the left uses every organ of culture, from sports to movies, to sell the message that America is irredeemably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic. Who would want to die for such an evil country? Alienating your citizens from their nation is not a wise move when our adversaries in other countries are willing to exploit every perceived weakness to expand their own power.

These weaknesses have been exacerbated by the left’s forward assault on manhood. A Christian professor named Karen Swallow Prior tweeted a video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a small group of men who committed to stay and fight for their country. She said, “I doubt these guys tweet about ‘manliness.’” The subtext was that conservative evangelical American men talk about masculinity more than they embody it.

What she failed to mention is that American society has been grinding away at men and manhood for decades. A desire to help men get more in touch with their feelings has morphed into something much more ominous. Every few months a new man in a dress is being upheld as brave and courageous for pushing the boundaries of gender. Men who object to the fashion choices of Harry Styles, Billy Porter, or Kid Cudi are seen as toxic and regressive.

This erosion of masculinity extends into the home as well, and not just through depictions of bumbling, incompetent dads on television sitcoms. The one tactical advantage women have in the gender wars is their words. Women who berate and disrespect their husbands are doing untold damage to both their mates and children. We went from mothers saying, “I don’t need a man” to daughters saying, “I don’t want a man” to sons saying, “I don’t want to be a man.”

The domestic power struggle that feminism has been encouraging for decades has led to men who are less assertive and more indecisive than their forefathers. Women who reject male leadership in the home often fear the misuse of authority, but that abdication also removes responsibility. It’s a package deal, in the same way the sun provides both light and heat.

I know many women who object to rigid gender roles, whether in the home or broader society. I don’t know a single one who wants to take on the role of protecting men from harm or the responsibility of being the sole provider in a household that has an able-bodied man present.

This contradiction is captured by a famous quote from C.S. Lewis.

“In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”

One historian’s new book claims that white evangelicals corrupted Christianity in America with the rugged masculinity embodied by John Wayne. Reading contemporary cultural norms into the Bible can certainly lead to bad doctrine, but the reason some pastors feel compelled to speak about biblical manhood is because they understand what happens to a culture that embraces the church of Jesus and Elton John.



A country that promotes national alienation, paints masculinity as inherently toxic, and rewards fragility, neuroses, and anxiety is in no position to fight external battles. It must first address the corrosion that is occurring within its borders. It’s hard to envision bravery from people who crumble under the weight of microaggressions or go into a state of panic when they see someone without a piece of cloth covering their nose and mouth. War creates a fog for those in it, but it is clarifying for people fortunate enough to live in peace.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-is-learning-countries-that-sow-self-hatred-narcissism-and-feminized-masculinity-reap-self-destruction,2022-03-01
"Whitlock: ESPN is sleeping with your enemy, and so are you","American essayist Charles Dudley Warner coined the phrase “politics makes strange bedfellows.” It was written as an observation in the mid-1800s. Christians should have interpreted it as a warning.

The adoption of a political identity will eventually align you with your enemies and inevitably detach you from your faith.

We can see this process unfolding in the sports world in real time. The ultimate example of American meritocracy and exceptionalism, competitive sports, is no match for politics’ ability to divide, corrupt, and conquer. Politics is always about power and money. It cannot coexist on equal footing with faith. Politics is about the rulership of earth and has no concern with salvation in an afterlife. It is short-sighted, greedy, and unethical.

It obeys Caesar’s creed: “If you must break the law, do it to seize power; in all other cases observe it.”

Just six short years ago, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made arenas and stadiums platforms for political expression of dissatisfaction. He said he kneeled during the national anthem because police officers killed black men without consequence.

Soon after, soccer star Megan Rapinoe and others joined Kaepernick in protest. And soon after that, on-field protests were about far more than the value of black lives. It was about equal pay for female jocks, LGBT rights, Trump resistance, LGBTQ rights, MAGA resistance, LGBTQ+ rights, voter ID laws in Georgia, and now, finally, LGBTQIA+ rights.

Late last week, ESPN employees called for a moment of silence because Florida governor Ron DeSantis plans to sign a law that, among other things, places limits on what Florida schools can teach young students about gender and sexuality. HB 1557 is the Parental Rights in Education bill. Its critics claim it discriminates against the LGBTQIA+ community. Critics call it the “don’t say gay” bill.

ESPN anchor Elle Duncan, aka light-skin Jemele Hill, took to the airwaves to express displeasure with Florida lawmakers.

“We understand the gravity of this legislation and also how it is affecting so many families across this country, and because of that our allyship is going to take a front seat. And with that, we’re going to pause in solidarity.”

ESPN basketball broadcasters Carolyn Peck and Courtney Lyle were up next.

“There are things bigger than basketball that need to be addressed at this time,” Lyle said. “Our friends, our family, our coworkers, the players, and coaches in our community are hurting right now. Our LGBTQIA+ teammates at Disney asked for our solidarity and support.”

Parents having authority over what their kids are taught in public schools is a threat to the LGBTQIA+ community? Let’s say that it is. Why is this threat being analyzed, discussed, and combatted on Disney’s sports network? Why can't it be covered exclusively on Disney’s ABC news network?

Are there any Disney employees who see abortion as a threat to babies in the womb? And will those employees be allowed to call for a moment of silence?

Sports and religion used to be partners. Teams took knees together in pre- and postgame prayer. Churches sponsored baseball, basketball, and football leagues. The best coaches saw their profession as ministry.

Politics does not leave room for religion. Coaches now prioritize making political statements rather than religious ones. Nick Saban appearing in a Black Lives Matter commercial is good for recruiting. So is hiring female assistant football coaches. In the not-so-distant future, Saban will need to appear in a commercial vowing support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

BLM and LGBTQIA+ are the same organization, the Alphabet Mafia. They’re making offers ESPN, Nick Saban, Gregg Popovich, the NFL, and the NBA can’t refuse.

Black Lives Matter was a Trojan horse for imposing secular values on popular culture. Sports had been the most powerful tool supporting traditional, Judeo-Christian values in American culture. Men’s sports celebrated the patriarchy. That is no longer the case. Kaepernick led the invasion of politics into sports. He gave Disney and ESPN the excuse they needed to overhaul sports culture into something that pleases the Alphabet Mafia by disavowing Christian principles and values.

Securalizing American sports is the gateway drug to overthrowing the U.S. Constitution. That’s a big statement. Let me explain.

Like sports, our Constitution is infused with Christian principles and values. Live sports programming is the strongest content force in American culture. The NFL is the most popular show on five different TV networks – CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN, and the NFL Network. If you want to communicate with a large audience, football (college and pro) is the only product that works consistently at a high level. Basketball works to a lesser degree.

Changing sports to a celebration of secular and Marxist values is preparing American minds for politicians to call for a reimagining of our Constitution. We’re deep into the process. Over the past month, corporate media pundits have called anyone who questions our strategy related to war in Ukraine as “treasonous.” How can an opinion about a war between Ukraine and Russia be treasonous for an American?

The definition of America and American sovereignty is being redefined right now. If an American doesn’t criticize Vladimir Putin loud enough, corporate media says you’re committing treason. But Elie Mystal can go on national TV and call our Constitution trash without being labeled a traitor.



It does not make sense. Unless you recognize that the social engineers are intentionally manipulating the American mind. All things infused with Christian values are under attack. Sports are a battlefield for the attack. A political identity, whether red or blue, will put you at odds with a Christian identity.

Our bedfellows aren’t strange. They’re evil.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-is-sleeping-with-your-enemy-and-so-are-you,2022-03-21
Whitlock: ESPN isn’t man enough to even discuss transgender Penn swimmer Lia Thomas,"Lia Thomas is why I have so much animus toward ESPN, the self-described worldwide leader in sports.

Thomas is the biological man competing on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team. His parents named him William. He originally competed on Penn’s men’s team. Lia is the most disruptive athlete perhaps in the history of sports.

He is Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, and Colin Kaepernick rolled into one gender transition. Thomas is crushing his new peers in the pool. He’s pissed off his female teammates. They’ve been forced to anonymously complain to Outkick and the Washington Examiner about Thomas’ illogical and immoral invasion of their sport.

Yesterday, an anonymous Penn swimmer spoke to the Washington Examiner.

“Yeah, it’s definitely really stressful,” Thomas’ teammate told the Examiner.

“It definitely weighs on my mind a lot because it’s definitely hard to overcome the feeling of feeling completely overlooked, as if the NCAA just does not care about us at all. And nobody cares about how this is affecting us at all.

“It just seems like if you say anything, everyone is just going to attack you and call you transphobic, and it’s not even true. We just want to have what we were promised by joining the swim team, which is fair competition and equal opportunities. It’s been really frustrating because we all agree, and I have yet to meet anyone or talk to anyone who thinks what is going on is OK.”

I’m unaware of Lia Thomas’ name ever being uttered on ESPN, the self-described worldwide leader in sports. I can’t find his name or story mentioned anywhere on ESPN.com.

A week ago, the Ivy League released a statement supporting Lia Thomas. In part the statement said, “The Ivy League reaffirms its unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all student-athletes while condemning transphobia and discrimination in any form.”

The richest, most powerful and influential universities in America issued a statement defending Lia Thomas. ESPN said nothing, pretended it didn’t happen.

Thomas is not the first biological boy to compete against girls, but he is the most important, polarizing, and the highest-profile. In a normal world, ESPN would be analyzing and discussing the impact of Thomas’ swimming career twice as much as the network debated Tim Tebow kneeling in prayer, Kaepernick kneeling in protest, Michael Sam kissing his boyfriend on draft day, 65-year-old Bruce Jenner transitioning to Caitlyn, and George Floyd dying from a combination of drugs and police misconduct.

Women’s sports are being transformed and,quite possibly destroyed right before our eyes. ESPN is ignoring this dramatic change. Michael Sam’s kiss was a bigger deal?

Cowardice is the only explanation.

The deafening silence throughout corporate media makes me think of the 1996 Tupac Shakur song “Heartz of Men.” I can’t lie. I used to love Tupac’s music. I used to listen to it virtually every day. “Heartz of Men” is a hyper-masculine song that warns men about the wickedness and weakness of many of their peers.

When I think about Lia Thomas, his dominance of female swimmers at Penn and in the Ivy League, and how corporate media are intentionally ignoring this story, I think about wickedness and weakness.

I’m embarrassed for men. I’m embarrassed by how far we have fallen.

Men used to take pride in protecting women. Now we take the most pride in protecting our social media brands, our paychecks, and our popularity with the in-crowd.

Social media has led us to believe that protecting career criminals is more important than protecting college women. ESPN talking heads would riot rather than remain silent over law enforcement’s treatment of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Rayshard Brooks.

Yesterday, I released a video spoof mocking the deification of Floyd, Blake, and Brooks. The spoof points out the absurdity of the attention, concern, and love we lavish on men who spent their lives wreaking havoc on others. Professional athletes, ESPN broadcasters, politicians, celebrity entertainers, and alleged civil rights activists pretend they defend Floyd, Blake, and Brooks as a way of being a voice for the voiceless.

Every TV network and media platform in America has discussed the plight of Floyd and company. College female athletes? We’ll leave their struggles to fringe websites.

Did Floyd, Blake, and Brooks earn a louder voice than female athletes? Why are male athletes silent about the plight of their female peers?

LeBron James has a daughter. All of the activist athletes have nieces, female cousins, sisters, and friends. Stephen Jackson, Matt Barnes, Ryan Clark, Randy Moss, Colin Kaepernick, Malcolm Jenkins.

Cowards. All of them.

Moss cried on national TV because Jon Gruden said DeMaurice Smith has big lips. Moss has three daughters. They are and/or were athletes. He should have an opinion on what’s transpiring in women’s sports. So should all the other athletes – male and female – who appear on ESPN. Maybe they think what Lia Thomas is doing is great. I’d love to hear their reasoning.

We’ve listened to them second-guess and condemn police officers the past six or seven years. They know nothing about policing but talking endlessly about it.

It’s sickening what has happened to the hearts of men. They have shriveled and disappeared. Our hearts pump Kool-Aid. We spend our energy, emotion, and resources fighting to protect criminals who resist arrest and have no genuine concern for victims of crime, the safety of law enforcement, or competitive spaces reserved for women.

In 2012, I lost a family member I loved to what my family and I believe was police misconduct. His name was Anton Butler. He had a criminal record that included drugs and guns. I’m not unsympathetic to George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Rayshard Brooks. But I’m also not a fool.



I have far more sympathy, concern, and passion for law-abiding citizens who are harmed by crime or have their hard-earned opportunities undermined by biological men who feel like women.

As Tupac would say, I’m “on this side, the real side.”

On the real side, what Lia Thomas is doing is stop-the-presses newsworthy. It’s worthy of vigorous debate and analysis. It could change the course of history and undermine the rights of biological women.

ESPN isn’t man enough to enter the discussion. America isn’t man enough. We’re a nation run by cowards.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-isnt-man-enough-to-even-discuss-transgender-penn-swimmer-lia-thomas,2022-01-13

USA Today fact-checks clearly satirical Babylon Bee report that Biden sold Alaska to Russia,"Big Media just can't help themselves.

The scolds in the liberal press can't hide their disdain for popular satire site Babylon Bee. The site is funny, insightful, punchy, and can be cutting-edge. But the big problem, it seems, is that the Bee, which is conservative and Christian, is effective at driving home points using the power of satire.

So the media have gone on the attack. For example:

The New York Times was forced to retract what the Bee called defamatory and misleading statements about the satirical site when the paper referred to the Bee as a ""far-right misinformation site"" that ""sometimes trafficked in misinformation under the guise of satire.""

Snopes beclowned itself when it fact-checked a Bee satire piece that was clearly a joke to anyone who read it and had at least a room-temperature IQ, but the humorless Karens at Snopes couldn't help themselves.

USA Today actually fact-checked a Bee piece that said the liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the death of late SCOTUS Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

And now USA Today, the nation's biggest newspaper, is at it again. On Tuesday, the paper posted a fact-check of the Bee's recent piece saying that President Joe Biden sold Alaska back to Russia.

In the satirical item, the Bee mocked Biden's refusal to drill in the U.S. (because he wants to satisfy the green agenda) but willingness to push Saudi Arabia and Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro to increase their oil output.

""The deliberate and premeditated invasion of Ukraine by brutal dictator Vladimir Putin has forced the US to reassess the importance of energy independence,"" the Bee wrote. ""With this new resolve, the Biden Administration has taken its first step toward increasing oil production for Americans by selling Alaska back to Russia so we can start drilling for oil there again.""

""Folks, nobody wants to ruin America’s beautiful Alaskan wilderness with oil trucks and drilling rigs, come on!"" Biden said in a made-up quote by the Bee. ""But I’ve never had a problem getting oil from Russia, so there you go, go get him.""

The ""news"" was clearly a joke — as anyone with any sense understood.

But USA Today wasn't sure people were smart enough to see through the Bee's nefarious ""reporting.""

So the paper ran a fact-check to make sure everybody understood: ""There is no evidence Biden said he plans to sell Alaska.""

Thankfully for all the rubes in America, the newspaper was able to determine that the Bee piece was satire.

""Based on our research, we rate SATIRE the claim that Biden plans to sell Alaska to Russia,"" USA Today ruled.

Oh, and if you're wondering, ""Who pays for this nonsense?"" the paper has this note at the bottom of the fact-check: ""Our fact-check work is supported in part by a grant from Facebook.""",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/usa-today-fact-checks-clearly-satirical-babylon-bee-report-that-biden-sold-alaska-to-russia,2022-03-10
Does Idaho's new bill banning trans-athletes from women's sports REALLY allow 'invasive genital testing'?,"In her most recent episode of ""Pseudo-Intellectual,"" BlazeTV host Lauren Chen talked about Lindsay Hecox, a trans-athlete at Boise State University, who has filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's recently passed law banning transgender and intersex athletes from participating in women's school sports.

In a Teen Vogue op-ed, Hecox said Idaho's House Bill 500, named the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, is unconstitutional because it ""invades young people's privacy and because it discriminates based on sex.""

The bill ""not only banned trans girls and women athletes from competing on their school teams, but exposed all girls and women to invasive, intrusive genital testing if anyone challenges their gender. I joined activists and community members in speaking out against the bill at the statehouse, but it passed anyway. On the eve of March 31, Trans Visibility Day, Governor Brad Little signed the bill into law,"" Hecox wrote. ""I decided to fight — for myself and for all the trans and intersex student athletes across Idaho, as well as for all Idaho girls and women athletes.""

After questioning the likelihood that Idaho lawmakers were even aware of ""Trans Visibility Day eve,"" let alone intentional using that particular date as a slap in the face to trans people, Lauren addressed Hecox's claim that biological female would be subjected to ""invasive, intrusive genital testing.""

""Sounds very scary,"" Lauren said. ""But it turns out that's a pretty uncharitable interpretation of what the bill actually says.""

Lauren explained that the bill clearly states that ""if disputed"" a student can simply show gender with a doctor's note. She also pointed out that requiring a physical exam or testing through urine or saliva samples, is already established procedure in athletics.

Crowder: Top 6 reason CNN's Chris Cuomo deserves the 'What a Piece of Sh*t' Award,"In the latest installment of ""Louder with Crowder,"" BlazeTV's Steven Crowder detailed the top six reasons why CNN's Chris ""Fredo"" Cuomo is this month's undisputed winner of the honorary ""What a Piece of Sh*t"" Award.

Here's the list:

POS Reason #6: Cuomo argued that Native American activist Nathan Phillips just ""wanted to diffuse the tension"" by banging his drum in Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann's face during the viral video clash in front of the Lincoln Memorial earlier this year. He also claimed that Sandmann chose to ""turn it into a standoff."" However, a full-length video of the incident revealed that it was Phillips who approached the students and targeted Sandmann, probably because he wore a MAGA hat.

Image source: Blaze TV screenshot

POS Reason #5: Cuomo claimed that the phrase ""America first"" and the term ""Nationalist"" are ""stained words"" that are somehow on par with calling border facilities ""concentration camps."" When a guest on his show disagreed, he flatly stated, ""You are wrong.""

""No, I'm not wrong. You don't get to define what nationalism means for me,"" said the guest.

""Yes, I do,"" came Cuomo's ""fair and unbiased"" response.

Image source: Blaze TV screenshot

POS Reason #4: Even as he took President Donald Trump's now-famous ""on both sides"" comment out of context, Cuomo flip-flopped and argued that Antifa is ""true to a cause that is a good cause. They want social justice. They want whatever they want -- in that context."" What context he was referring to, the world may never know.

He also tweeted out a meme that likened Antifa to the hero soldiers who fought during WWII's D-Day invasion. For the record, more than 9,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded on that day on the beaches of Normandy, France.

Image source: Blaze TV screenshot

POS Reason #3: Cuomo mocked the rape victim who appeared in an NRA ad to advocate her right to protect herself and her two children with a firearm.

Image source: Blaze TV screenshot

POS Reason #2: Cuomo stated that offering ""thoughts and prayers"" is the equivalent of mocking mass murder victims. But apparently it's okay to mock rape victims on Twitter (see POS reason #3.)

Image source: Blaze TV screenshot

POS Reason #1: Cuomo tweeted the intolerant assertion that any 12-year-old girll ""who doesn't want to see a penis in the locker room"" is the daughter of bigots who need to ""teach tolerance.""

Elon Musk and SpaceX thwarted a Russian electromagnetic attack on Ukraine,"SpaceX — a company founded and owned by Elon Musk with the express intention of colonizing Mars — successfully stopped a Russian electromagnetic attack in Ukraine.

In March, Musk’s company worked at a breakneck pace to shut down Russian efforts to disconnect Ukrainians from the internet by jamming the country’s access to its Starlink satellite constellation.

Starlink is operated by SpaceX and provides internet coverage to 32 countries. The constellation consists of more than 2,000 mass-produced small satellites that reside in low orbit and communicate with designated transceivers on the Earth’s surface.

At the outset of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, when it became clear that the Russian government was going to target the Ukrainian people’s ability to communicate, Ukrainian officials pleaded with Musk to intervene and provide them with relief.

Dave Tremper, director of electronic warfare for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, lauded SpaceX’s ability to turn on a dime and swiftly stymie Russia’s efforts to jam the Starlink satellite’s ability to provide broadband.

Defense News reported that Tremper said, “The next day [after reports about the Russian jamming effort hit the media], Starlink had slung a line of code and fixed it, and suddenly that [Russian jamming attack] was not effective anymore. From [the] EW technologist’s perspective, that is fantastic … and how they did that was eye-watering to me.”

Tremper noted that it would have taken the American government considerably longer to counteract the Russian electromagnetic attack than it did Musk’s company.

Tremper said, “We need to be able to have that agility. We need to be able to change our electromagnetic posture to be able to change, very dynamically, what we’re trying to do without losing capability along the way.”

Noting that electromagnetic warfare requires very finely tuned machinery and highly skilled operators, Tremper said the Russian invasion of Ukraine indicated how important it was to make sure that American personnel were properly trained in electromagnetic warfare operations.

He said, “It is a very hard problem, if you don’t have well-trained operators. The degree of coordination and synchronization of these types of operations is such that the undertrained operator will have a harder time pulling off those types of events successfully.”

This is not the only time that Elon Musk has thwarted the Russians’ plans in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

When the Russian government threatened to drop the International Space Station on the Earth by ceasing to provide it with resources and technology for propulsion, Musk said that he would keep the station from falling onto the planet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657206014,2022-04-24
Japan's prime minister is expected to participate in an upcoming NATO summit,"Fumio Kishida, the Prime Minister of Japan, is considering attending a summit of leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to discuss the potential of Japanese collaboration with Western leaders over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The Strait Times, a daily English language newspaper published in Singapore, reported that Kishida’s move marks an “unusually aggressive stance for a Japanese leader.” The Times also noted that Kishida has repeatedly condemned the Russian military and the country’s leadership over perpetrating what he has described as a “war crime” against Ukraine.

The leadership of Japan has a long-standing practice of carefully maintaining their country’s relationship with Russia as the two countries have a long history of territorial disputes.

A spokesperson for the Japanese government said that officials will be unable to offer comment on the Kishida’s discussions with NATO allies. Kishida’s attendance of the upcoming NATO summit was first reported by Japanese media outlets this past Saturday.

The NATO summit will take place on June 29 and 30 in the Spanish capital city of Madrid. The meeting is expected to overlap with the Kishida and other Japanese politicians campaign efforts as the meeting will overlap with the upcoming Japanese election cycle.

Kishida is expected to make a final decision as to whether or not he will attend the summit in the coming days as he must take into account the rapidly approaching elections.

NATO leaders have invited officials from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea to attend the summit as its partners in the Asia-Pacific region.

Should Kishida attend the summit, it is expected that his presence will be welcomed and send a strong message of international solidarity during a period of heightened geopolitical tension.

The potential of an increasing Japanese presence among NATO allies could also be a result of China’s potential invasion of Taiwan.

According to leaked audio from a top-secret meeting of Chinese officials, China may soon launch an extremely aggressive invasion of its island neighbor.

Voices on the leaked audio recording discuss the need to secure strategic entry points to crucial economic hubs in mainland China and how many pieces of military equipment and personnel will be required to pull off the invasion.

This past May, it was reported that China’s economic regulators held emergency meetings in April to discuss how to insulate the Chinese economy from Western sanctions should the West use economic isolation to discourage and punish China in the wake of a Taiwanese invasion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657460454,2022-06-05
Biden plans to break with his own precedent as he moves closer to buying oil from Saudi Arabia,"President Biden is expected to extend an olive branch to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after promising to make him a ""pariah"" and working to isolate the Saudi regime for months.

On Monday, the White House confirmed that Biden is planning to visit the oil-rich nation this summer, marking the culmination of an 18-month standoff between Biden and the crown prince. Biden is trying to wind up back in the crown prince's good graces as gas prices soar amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Insider News reported that attempts by U.S. officials to convince the Saudis to increase their oil production have thus far been unsuccessful. Reportedly, the crown prince has repeatedly ignored phone calls from Biden when the president has sought to discuss issues of oil availability.

Displaying how vulnerable and dependent the U.S. is on foreign oil, Biden recently directly asked the crown prince to increase Saudi Arabia's oil output.

The Biden administration has previously made an active attempt at keeping the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at arm's length as the president refused to meet with the crown prince for months. The Biden administration may have even issued a personal offense to the crown prince when it said that Biden should deal directly with the crown prince's father.

The U.S. also has a history of sanctioning Saudi officials. Following the circulation of a declassified intelligence report regarding the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Khashoggi's murder was likely ordered by the crown prince.

Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia signals that it is no longer tenable for the Biden administration to adamantly oppose nations that could help alleviate domestic policy woes.

Adam Ereli, a former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, said, ""Do you hold a relationship hostage to human-rights concerns or you can move forward while not abandoning your moral high ground? In his mind, Biden can move forward.""

Despite receiving heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and domestic activists, Biden and the White House insist that any meeting between Biden and the crown prince would serve the immediate interests of the U.S.

Last Friday, Biden said, ""Look, I'm not going to change my view on human rights. But as president of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657497848,2022-06-12
Egypt and Israel are increasing oil exports to Europe to compensate for the EU's embargo on Russian fuel products,"On Wednesday, the countries of Egypt and Israel penned a deal with the European Union to increase liquid natural gas sales to EU member states that are hoping to reduce their dependency on petroleum-based fuel products from Russia.

The deal, which was finalized in a ritzy Egyptian hotel, will require Israel to send gas to Egypt for it to be liquified and then shipped to EU member states, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ABC News reported.

“What a special moment,” von der Leyen proclaimed in a joint press conference alongside representatives of the Egyptian and Israeli governments. “I very warmly welcome the signing of this historic agreement.”

It is not currently clear how much gas will be imported by EU member states from either Egypt or Israel.

Von der Leyen indicated that this new agreement is part of Europe’s ongoing efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russian imports. It highlights an active attempt by the EU to import hydrocarbons from what is labeled “other trustworthy suppliers.”

Von der Leyen indicated that Israel and Egypt are ideal suppliers because of their good relations with EU member states and since both countries discovered large supplies of natural gas off shore.

This new deal will also help Egypt and Israel increase their gas production and drilling explorations in their territorial waters.

During a separate press conference with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, von der Leyen said, “It is known that the Russian war against Ukraine has exposed our European dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and we want to get rid of this dependency.”

In 2021, the EU imported roughly 40% of its gas from Russia and has had immense difficulty imposing sanctions on Russian fuel imports since Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated his country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Israeli Energy Minister Karin Elharrar said the new arrangement was a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in a widespread European energy crisis. She said that the agreement also highlights the increasing cooperation and further strengthening of relations between Egypt and Israel, two nations that used to be enemies.

Elharrar said, “This is a statement to those who see in our region only negative forces such as division and conflict. This (memorandum of understanding) shows us that we are paving a new path of partnership, solidarity, and sustainability.”

Egypt’s Petroleum Minister Tarek el-Molla said that the deal is “an important milestone” for cooperation between the three parties.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657514790,2022-06-15
10-year-old girl played dead as man lined up her family and killed them in horrifying Houston massacre,"A 10-year-old girl said that she survived the massacre of her family by playing dead as a gunman lined them up and shot and killed them, according to authorities.

The harrowing incident unfolded Wednesday in Houston.

The family told WTRK-TV that the child saw her mother, father, and her 6-year-old sister be shot and killed, and then she waited until the assailant left so she could call her grandmother.

The child called her grandmother through the FaceTime video app.

""She said, 'Granny, someone came in and shot me, my mom, my dad, and my sister, and they dead,'' said Angela Ervin to WTRK.

The family said that the girl told them a masked man knocked their door and grabbed her 1-year-old baby brother out of the arms of her father. He tossed him onto the couch and then began shooting them. The girl suffered a gunshot injury to the arm, but pretended that she had been killed.

After the man left, the girl said she locked the door, grabbed her surviving brother, and called her grandmother.

Police are looking for a suspect they describe only as a black man in his 20s. The authorities believe the man knew the victims and said that there was no evidence that the incident was a robbery.

""This was probably not a home invasion ... there was no damage. There was possibly a known disturbance of some sort,"" Assistant Chief Patricia Cantu said.

""But right now, we don't have all the details, and right now, we're just looking for a suspect to see what happened,"" she added.

The couple had four children. An 8-year-old boy was not with them at the time of the shooting.

Family said they have no idea who could have done this. The couple just moved to the apartment from Spring a couple months ago, WTRK reported.

11 Philadelphia college students robbed at gunpoint and locked in basement by masked intruders,"A group of Philadelphia college students living in an off-campus apartment stated that armed robbers broke into their home, robbed them at gunpoint, and locked them in a basement early Friday morning, reported WPVI-TV.



Around 7 a.m. on Friday, police were called to an off-campus student apartment building for a reported home invasion and robbery. Eight female and three male residents were inside the building at the time of the incident.

The Temple University students told WPVI-TV that they were woken up in the early hours of the morning by a knock at the door by two masked men.

The students stated that one of the roommates decided to let them in because she thought they might know someone in the building.

According to Philadelphia Police Captain Michael Goodson, at least one of the suspects had a gun.

""We were all just woken up. There was a guy with a gun. He came into a couple of our rooms. He made one of us go and wake up the rest of the roommates with the guy with the gun,"" one of the students stated.

The victims said they figured the men were not at the correct address because they kept asking, ""Where are the drugs?""

When the robbers did not find any drugs in the apartment, they locked all 11 residents in the basement.

""We were all kept in the same room together for over an hour they were there,"" one victim said.

""I think the sad part is, we all talked in the room, we all realized once they came into the room, everyone was kind of like 'oh, it's our time now,'"" another student said.

The victims were forced to give the home invaders their cell phones, debit cards, and car keys. According to authorities, the robbers made off with a 2015 Lincoln MKZ sedan.

None of the students were physically harmed, but they were shaken over the terrifying robbery.

""You never think it's going to happen to you, but when it does, it's like a shock,"" one student stated.

While in the basement, some of the victims were able to get access to their laptops and message someone to call the police.

Another similar home invasion occurred early Wednesday morning involving Temple University student Kayla Barone.

According to Barone, three masked robbers broke into her home and forced her and her two roommates into a room at gunpoint. The crooks stole Barone's cash, debit cards, cell phone, and other items.

Jennifer Griffin, Temple University VP of Public Safety, said in a statement Friday, ""Violence against one of us affects all of us. Any incident affecting a member of our community is treated with the utmost care and concern.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/11-philadelphia-college-students-robbed-at-gunpoint-and-locked-in-basement-by-masked-intruders,2022-11-12
12-year-old fatally shoots home invasion suspect after armed robbery seriously wounds the boy's grandmother,"A 12-year-old boy is being hailed as a hero after fatally shooting one of two armed robbery suspects.

What are the details?

Goldsboro, North Carolina, police say that two armed robbery suspects entered 73-year-old Linda Ellis' home on Saturday demanding money, WTVD-TV reported Sunday.

One of the suspects reportedly shot Ellis in the leg, prompting Ellis' 12-year-old grandson to retrieve a handgun in the home and fire on the two suspects, causing them both to flee the scene.

Police discovered one suspect, 19-year-old Khalil Herring, near an intersection by the home while responding to the scene. From there, they transported him to a local hospital, where he succumbed to his gunshot injuries.

Randolph Bunn, Ellis' son — as well as the 12-year-old boy's great uncle — told WTVD that the child likely saved lives.

""[The suspects] came in the house, I open the door, I open it, and they came in here,"" Bunn recalled. ""One guy had a gun. They just put me down on the ground.""

""I don't know why they shot her,"" he said of his mother. ""He would've shot him, too, he would've shot me too. He would've killed us all.""

A press release from the Goldsboro Police Department stated:

During the course of the investigation, it was determined that two masked subjects forced their way into the residence located at 402 S. William Street, demanded money, and subsequently shot Ms. Ellis. During the robbery, a 12-year-old juvenile occupant of the residence shot at the suspects with a firearm in self-defense, causing them to flee the area. Preliminary evidence suggest Khalil Herring was one of the two masked intruders and was shot during the robbery. Charges against the juvenile occupant of the residence that fired the aforementioned gun are not anticipated by the Goldsboro Police Department. The investigation into the armed robbery and subsequent shootings is on-going.

Ellis and the unnamed suspect were transported to Wayne UNC Health Care hospital.

Authorities say that charges against the 12-year-old boy are not anticipated, and the investigation remains open.

WTVD's Michael Lozano tweeted about the happening, writing, ""A 12-year-old Goldsboro boy fired off shots at two masked robbers who broke in & shot his grandmother, Linda Ellis. One of those robbers died from their injuries.""

There is no further information on the second suspect at the time of this reporting.

12-year-old forced to shoot and kill armed home invader who was threatening his mother,"A 12-year-old protected his mother by shooting and killing an armed home invader at their home in East Feliciana, Louisiana.

The East Feliciana Parish Sheriff's Office released details about the chilling incident that unfolded on July 1 at about 7:30 a.m.

Deputies said that Brad Leblanc, 32, and two others encountered a woman outside her home and forced her inside by threatening her with a pistol. Once inside the woman and the man got into a physical altercation.

That's when the woman's 12-year-old child retrieved a hunting rifle and shot LeBlanc. He later died at a hospital.

Police arrested the two alleged accomplices, who were identified as Jonathan Barker and Jennifer Bond. Barker was charged with second-degree murder, principal to aggravated burglary and principal to aggravated kidnapping, while Bond was charged as an accessory after the fact.

Officials said no charges were planned against the child, but that the final decision would be made by a district attorney.

""At this time, the East Feliciana Sheriff's office has no evidence — whether it be physical evidence at the scene or testimony from witnesses — that would incriminate the 12-year-old, and therefore, at this time, we have no plans to bring charges against the 12-year-old child,"" said Sheriff Jeffrey Travis to the Advocate.

""I don't know what you tell a kid like that,"" said Travis to WAFB-TV. ""I mean that is such a horrific incident that I tried to put myself in that position, this week thinking, when my children were twelve years old, if they were to have to do that what would I have told them?""

Travis said the mother was seeking treatment for the child over the incident.

"2 innocent cheerleaders killed in high-speed chase, cop and suspect both charged: 'If it involves putting human life in danger, stop the d**n pursuit'","Two teenage girls in Louisiana never got to see 2023. They were tragically killed in broad daylight on New Year's Eve after a cop car supposedly slammed into their vehicle while in pursuit of a suspected car thief.

Around noon that day, 17-year-old Maggie Dunn and 16-year-old Caroline Gill were driving along with Maggie's brother, 20-year-old University of Louisiana Lafayette student Liam Dunn. The group was about to turn onto Louisiana State Highway 1 when 42-year-old Addis police officer David Cauthron supposedly ran a red light and ""T-boned"" their vehicle with such force that it was pushed onto the highway median, Law and Crime reported.

Louisiana cop charged for crash that left two high school cheerleaders dead nypost.com

Maggie and Caroline, both cheerleaders at Brusly High School, a few miles southwest of Baton Rouge, died at the scene. Liam was rushed to the hospital, where he remains in critical condition.



District Attorney Tony Clayton claimed that Cauthron demonstrated ""sheer negligence"" with his decisions that afternoon.

""I just can’t put my arms around why he was driving at that rate of speed in pursuit of this vehicle,"" Clayton told reporters. ""This officer is facing some serious issues.”

“If it involves putting human life in danger, stop the d**n pursuit,"" he added later.

According to investigators, Cauthron topped out at 86 mph and did not even apply the brakes when he reached the red light at state highway 1 and Vaughn Drive. The light had been red for approximately 20 seconds when Cauthron ran it, witnesses reported.

""Sirens and police vehicles only give an officer permission to request to cut through a red light,"" Clayton argued. ""You must slow down or come to a complete stop when human life is in danger.""

Cauthron, who previously worked for the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office and who has been with the Addis PD for less than a year, has been charged with two counts of negligent homicide and one count of negligent injury. He was booked into the West Baton Rouge Parish Detention Center on $100,000 bond.

And Cauthron is not the only one facing serious charges regarding the crash. The man Cauthron was allegedly chasing, 24-year-old Tyquel Zanders, is also facing a bevy of charges, including manslaughter.

Earlier that morning, Zanders allegedly stole his father's car. When police began following him, he took off at high speeds, reaching 110 mph while on the highway, reports claim. He also supposedly ran several red lights along the way. According to police, he never even slowed down after the deadly crash that killed the young girls. He allegedly stopped only when his vehicle stalled as he crossed the Mississippi River into Baton Rouge.

""[Zanders] put the chain of events into play,” Clayton claimed. ""He’s responsible for all the reactions to his actions. He’s facing two counts, and if that poor kid [Liam] doesn’t survive, he’ll face another.""

Zanders has been charged with manslaughter, theft of a motor vehicle, home invasion, and aggravated flight from a police officer. Where he is being held and when he is expected to appear in court are both unclear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2-innocent-cheerleaders-killed-in-high-speed-chase-cop-and-suspect-both-charged-if-it-involves-putting-human-life-in-danger-stop-the-d-n-pursuit,2023-01-04

A prominent law firm that defends liberal media stars and celebrities is currently representing Russian oligarchs tied to Putin and the Steele dossier despite Western sanctions,"Update: In a statement to TheBlaze, Clare Locke LLP indicated that the firm's business relationship with the Russian oligarchs ""has concluded.""

In the immediate aftermath of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Western nations and institutions moved to cripple the Russian economy through the swift implementation of thoroughgoing sanctions.

In late February, the European Commission — the executive branch of the European Union — along with leadership from France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement declaring their intention to prevent Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT communications network.

In doing so, Western leaders effectively made it impossible for Russia to participate in international trade using the necessary financial infrastructure established by the SWIFT network. Western leaders also took it upon themselves to sanction “the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine” and to “limit the sale of citizenship … that let wealthy Russians connected to the government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.”

Western governments locked arms and declared their opposition to Russia’s invasion, and Western companies began to divest and terminate their dealings within the Russian marketplace. These sanctions and divestments led Russian oligarchs to seek refuge outside of Russia and its new Western rivals’ borders so that they might not have their wealth drained by them.

However, these oligarchs are not without any allies in the West.

The well-known US-based law firm Clare Locke LLP has maintained its relationship with Russian oligarchs Mikhail Friedman, Petr Aven, and German Khan.

The oligarchs repped by Clare Locke have been sanctioned by both the European Union and the United Kingdom for their close ties to Putin and are “locked in litigation against D.C.-based research firm Fusion GPS over allegations in the infamous Steele dossier,” reported the Daily Beast.

Aside from alleged allies of Putin, the Daily Beast also reported that former clients of Clare Locke include “60 Minutes” Executive Producer Jeff Fager, who hired the firm to “effectively neuter” a Washington Post investigation into him; former “Today” show host Matt Lauer; and New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush.

The firm consists of a husband-and-wife duo who established themselves by providing legal defense for men accused of misconduct during the #MeToo era and aggressively pursuing suits against media institutions.

Clare Locke’s website proudly proclaims that the firm’s client list also includes, “Fortune 100 companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, professional sports teams, CEOs, journalists, and other prominent individuals who – by virtue of their success, public profile, and nationally recognized brands – are unfairly targeted by the media.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-prominent-law-firm-that-has-represented-liberal-media-stars-is-currently-defending-russian-oligarchs-tied-to-putin-and-the-steele-dossier,2022-04-02
A top US general suggested there could be a 'military component' if NATO helps Ukraine export grain,"A top U.S. general recently suggested the U.S. military conduct operations to help Ukraine export grain that is being held up as a result of Russian blockades along the Black Sea Coast.

Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who has been nominated to the next commander of NATO, told U.S. senators at a hearing on Thursday that he would consider offering military options to allow for grain exports to resume, the Epoch Times reported.

When asked what he would do, Cavoli said that if he is to be confirmed he would “provide the military options required by our civilian leaders.”

He told lawmakers present at the hearing, “Clearly the way we would approach that would have to be a whole-of-government approach, which may or may not include a military component.”

It’s unclear at this time what Cavoli’s approach would entail. Whether Cavoli would encourage sending U.S. troops to directly engage with Russian forces or the military being involved with alternative means to ship grain remains to be seen.

Ukraine is one of the world’s top exporters of wheat, sunflower oil, and canola oil and due to Russian forces blockading a Ukrainian port in the Black Sea Coast there is a burgeoning global shortage of these essential supplies.

Cavoli noted that U.S. sanctions against Russia in response to Russia President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine have contributed to global shortages of grain.

“The grain s hortages that we’re experiencing from both Russia and Ukrainian production being unable to come out of the countries in large volumes or being sanctioned and not being sold are being felt on the African continent,” Cavoli stated.

About a week ago, an analyst warned the United Nations Security Council that the invasion of Ukraine is adding “fuel to a fire that was long-burning” and that there are only about 10 weeks of worth of wheat supplies left across the globe.

The analyst, Gro Intelligence CEO Sara Menker said, “I want to start by explicitly saying that the Russia-Ukraine war did not start the food security crisis. It simply added fuel to a fire that was long burning. A crisis we detected tremors from long before the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of our supply chains.”

Long before the invasion of Ukraine commenced this past February, there have been intense droughts and weather issues across the globe contributing to the now intensifying grain shortage.

Menker said, “I share this because we believe it’s important for you all to understand that even if the war were to end tomorrow, our food security problem isn’t going away anytime soon without concerted action.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-top-us-general-suggested-there-could-be-a-military-component-if-nato-is-to-help-ukraine-export-grain,2022-05-29
Aaron Sorkin slams Facebook political ad policy in NYT op-ed — Zuckerberg uses Sorkin's own words on free speech to dismiss him,"Aaron Sorkin, writer of ""The Social Network,"" wrote an open letter in the New York Times on Thursday criticizing Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook for a policy of not fact-checking any political ads — and Zuckerberg quoted Sorkin's own words to dismiss the attack.

The two men have a contentious past, as ""The Social Network"" was a wildly successful movie that portrayed Zuckerberg's rise in an unflattering way, which Zuckerberg resisted at the time and called inaccurate.

Zuckerberg has defended Facebook's hands-off policy toward political ads by appealing to the First Amendment. He said, and Sorkin quotes in his NYT piece, that ""in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves.""

""I admire your deep belief in free speech,"" Sorkin wrote to Zuckerberg. ""I get a lot of use out of the First Amendment. Most important, it's a bedrock of our democracy and it needs to be kept strong. But this can't possibly be the outcome you and I want, to have crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together. Lies that have a very real and incredibly dangerous effect on our elections and our lives and our children's lives.""

Sorkin accused Zuckerberg of ""assaulting truth"" rather than defending free speech by not removing ads that are determined to be false.

Zuckerberg's response was brief, and used words Sorkin would quickly recognize — because they came from another movie Sorkin wrote, ""The American President"":

America isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say: You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then, you can stand up and sing about the land of the free.

Sorkin apparently got a bit sloppy with the facts in his open letter to Zuckerberg, forcing the Times to issue a lengthy series of corrections after publication. The correction reads:

An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which ""The Social Network"" was released. It was 2010, not 2011. The nature of the major lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker was misstated. It was an invasion of privacy lawsuit, not a defamation suit. In addition, information about Americans' use of Facebook as a news source was misstated. In 2018, over 40 percent of Americans said they got news from Facebook; it is not the case that half of all Americans say that Facebook is their main source of news.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aaron-sorkin-slams-facebook-political-ad-policy-in-nyt-op-ed--zuckerberg-uses-sorkins-own-words-on-free-speech-to-dismiss-him,2019-10-31
Abbott hands Biden letter calling his 'photo-op' border visit '$20 billion too little and two years too late',"Millions of illegal aliens have beat President Joe Biden to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) won't let him forget it.

On his way to Mexico City to meet with Mexican and Canadian leaders for the North American Leaders' Summit, Biden stopped off in El Paso — his first visit to the beleaguered southern border since taking office.

Abbott was waiting on the tarmac for the president with a strongly-worded letter in hand.

The letter made clear that Biden's ""visit to our southern border with Mexico today is $20 billion too little and two years too late.""

Predictably 'sanitized'

During his stopover in El Paso, Biden managed to avoid meeting or interacting with any one of the millions of illegal aliens who have poured over the border during his time in office.

Congresswoman Mayra Flores (R-Texas) shared images on Twitter intimating that the consequences of Biden's actions had been hidden from sight:

The New York Post reported that authorities in the Democrat-run city had covertly torn down illegal alien encampments and hidden migrants from view.

The Border Patrol Union tweeted, ""El Paso being cleaned up as if nothing unusual ever happened there. Just in time for Biden's 'visit to the border'. We suggest just landing in Des Moines, Iowa and telling him it's El Paso. He'll never know the difference.""

A senior Biden administration official suggested to CNN that this was merely ""coincidental.""

Abbott, however, predicted this ""coincidence"" in the letter he handed to the president.

The letter noted that Biden's visit ""avoids the sites where mass illegal immigration occurs and sidesteps the thousands of angry Texas property owners whose lives have been destroyed by your border politics.""

""Even the city you visit has been sanitized of the migrant camps which had overrun downtown El Paso because your Administration wants to shield you from the chaos that Texans experience on a daily basis ... the direct result of your failure to enforce the immigration laws that Congress enacted,"" wrote Abbott.

The Democratic El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser, allegedly instructed by the White House not to declare an emergency over the border crisis, did so in last month after his city was overwhelmed by illegal aliens.

Leeser noted that neither asylum-seekers nor the El Paso community were safe.

Nearly 500,000 illegal aliens had already been encountered at the border by November this fiscal year. 2.37 million criminal noncitizens poured over the southern border last year and millions more stole over in 2021.

Abbott underscored in his letter to Biden that ""under President Trump, the federal government achieved historically low levels of illegal immigration. Under your watch, by contrast, America is suffering the worst illegal immigration in the history of our country. Your open-border policies have emboldened the cartels, who grow wealthy by trafficking deadly fentanyl and even human beings.""



According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl — frequently made with Chinese precursor chemicals and trafficked by Mexican cartels — is the leading killer of American adults ages 18-45.

A job to do

Abbott further accused Biden of failing to ""defend the States against invasion through faithful execution of federal laws,"" and told him, once finished with his ""photo-ops in a carefully stage-managed version of El Paso,"" that he has a job to do.

The Texas governor outlined five policy initiatives Biden should take on:

""Comply with the many statutes mandating that various categories of aliens 'shall' be detained, and end the practice of unlawfully paroling aliens en masse"";

""stop sandbagging the implementation of the Remain-in-Mexico policy and Title 42 expulsions, and fully enforce those measures as the federal courts have ordered you to do"";

""aggressively prosecute illegal entry between ports of entry, and allow ICE to remove illegal immigrants in accordance with existing federal laws"";

""resume construction of the border wall in the State of Texas, using the billions of dollars Congress has appropriated for that purpose""; and

""designate the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.""

Axios characterized Biden's stopover in El Paso as an effort, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, to showcase a modicum of interest in law enforcement and to take ""a possible Democratic vulnerability head-on.""



Ahead of the visit, Abbott said it was nothing more than ""a photo op and a game of pretend.""

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) wrote, ""As soon as he took office, President Biden stopped enforcing America’s immigration laws, rolled back effective border policies, & offered the world a clear incentive to illegally enter the US. His overdue visit to the border is solely a poor attempt to score political points.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abbott-hands-biden-letter-calling-his-border-photo-op-visit-20-billion-too-little-and-two-years-too-late,2023-01-09
Actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher pledge $3 million in donations to aid Ukraine,"Ukrainian-born actress Mila Kunis and her husband, Ashton Kutcher, have pledged to donate up to $3 million to aid Ukrainian citizens fleeing from their war-torn country as Russia continues its deadly invasion.

What are the details?

In a Thursday video shared to his Twitter account, Kutcher and Kunis said that they were ""proud"" of Kunis's heritage and intended to provide aid for Ukrainian refugees.

“I was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine in 1983. I came to America in 1991,"" Kunis explained. ""I have always considered myself American, a proud American, I love everything that this country has done for myself and my family. But today, I have never been more proud to be a Ukrainian.""

Kutcher added, “And I’ve never been more proud to be married to a Ukrainian.""

“The events that have unfolded in Ukraine are devastating. There is no place in this world for this kind of unjust attack on humanity,” Kunis continued, and vowed to match up to $3 million in donations for refugee relief via GoFundMe.

Fox News reported that the funds will be distributed to necessary causes through Flexport.org and Airbnb.org, which have been assisting needy and fleeing Ukrainians.

“While we witness the bravery of the people of the country that she was born in we’re also witness to the needs of those who have chosen safety,"" Kutcher explained. ""We’re raising funds to support a relief effort that will have immediate impact and supply much needed refugee and humanitarian aid in the area. The principal challenge right now is logistics. We need to get housing, and we need to get supplies and resources into the area.""



Kunis added, ""The people of Ukraine are strong and brave but being strong and brave doesn’t mean you’re not worthy of support. We need to support the people of Ukraine. Please help us.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/actors-mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-pledge-3-million-in-donations-to-aid-ukraine-in-fight-against-russia,2022-03-05
Actress Emilia Clarke creates comic book hero whose superpowers come from menstruation,"Actress Emilia Clarke created a comic book superhero whose superpowers come from menstruation and said that the character will swing from her armpit hair like Spider-Man.

Clarke told Variety that she was inspired to enter the comic book industry after seeing the gender disparity among comic book creators and readers.

""Something did not sit right with me in that exchange, and all these signs were telling me to go make my own,"" said Clarke.

She assembled a team of female comic book creators and produced the ""M.O.M."" comic book with the superhero character Maya, a single mom.



""She's a single mum that's got to get s**t done. This was born from the idea that single mothers are superheroes. You need superhuman strength to do that. When you get into your 30s and your friends start having kids, you're like, 'Oh my god. I was not aware of what it took. Holy s**t,"" explains Clarke.

Also her superhero powers are manifestations of the side effects from menstruation.

""The bloating, the hair growth, the mood swings, the [acne], all of it,"" Clarke explains. ""We hate that when it happens, speaking for myself and everyone I've ever met who has had a period. What if we turned that around and made the period something that we can feel as this unique, crazy, superhuman thing that happens in our body? When Maya is scared, she goes invisible, when she's angry, she has superhuman strength. She can swing like Spider-Man from her armpit hair.""

She added that the comic aims to normalize menstruation so that it has far less of a social stigma.

Clarke is most famous for her starring role in the HBO epic fantasy mini-series ""Game of Thrones.""

Her comic book, ""M.O.M.: Mother of Madness,"" is scheduled to be released by Image Comics on July 21.

"Actress Georgie Henley discloses prior infection, surgeries","Actress Georgie Henley, who played the role of Lucy in ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" movies, has publicly revealed that at the age of 18, she underwent ""gruelling invasive surgery"" to avoid an arm amputation after getting a rare infection.

""When I was eighteen years old and in my sixth week of university, I contracted necrotising fasciitis, a rare and punishing infection that nearly claimed my life and wrought havoc throughout my body. In order to prevent the amputation of my left hand and arm I received gruelling invasive surgery, and later extensive reconstructive surgery which resulted in a series of skin grafts and scars,"" Henley wrote in an Instagram post.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes the condition of necrotizing fasciitis as ""a rare bacterial infection that spreads quickly in the body and can cause death.""

""There are many types of bacteria that can cause the 'flesh-eating disease' called necrotizing fasciitis. Public health experts believe group A Streptococcus (group A strep) is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis,"" according to the CDC.

""It has taken me a long time to heal both physically and mentally but I hoped that one day there would be the right time to talk about what happened. Today is a start,"" the 27-year-old actress noted.

""For the last nine years I have been open about my scars in my personal life, but have hidden them entirely in any professional context: wearing bandages or coverings, makeup on set and stage, long sleeves whenever I might be photographed, trousers so I could put my hand in a pocket,"" she noted. ""But my scars are not something to be ashamed of. They are a map of the pain my body has endured, and most importantly a reminder of my survival. They do not affect my capacity as an actor, and I'm proud to be a person who has visible scars in this industry.""

"Rep. Kinzinger calls for the establishment of a no-fly zone above Ukraine: 'The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west'","As brave Ukrainian citizens battle invading Russian forces, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is calling for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.

Kinzinger described the situation in dramatic fashion: ""The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt. Disrupt Russias air ops to give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight. It’s now, or later,"" he tweeted.

""History teaches that taking a stand is inevitable and gets more costly with time. We own the skies, Russia cannot hold a candle to our Air power. Do this. Putin is too dangerous to hope he is satisfied with 'just Ukraine,'"" he added.

Some people on social media pushed back against the idea.

""This psycho -- held up as some Profile in Courage by establishment liberals who still wake up every morning distraught about January 6 -- is now demanding direct US military hostilities with Russia, which Putin said would precipitate nuclear war. So that's where we're at,"" one person wrote in response to Kinzinger.



Kinzinger fired back, ""Putin threatening nukes is a good reminder that Putin must be stopped. <side note Putin will NOT use nukes over a no-fly zone>. The legit govt of Ukraine has a right to defend their skies with help. Full stop.""

The congressman, who is not seeking reelection, was recently chastised by the Republican National Committee, which passed a resolution censuring him and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.



The two lawmakers, who have both been vocal critics of former President Donald Trump, were among the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump last year in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. They are also the only two Republicans serving on the House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 episode.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-kinzinger-no-fly-zone-ukraine,2022-02-26
Adam Kinzinger introduced a resolution authorizing the US military to engage Russia if Putin uses WMDs,"On Sunday, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said that he introduced a resolution to authorize the U.S. military to engage in combat with Russia should the Russian military use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Kinzinger said while on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that any such attack in Ukraine would be a “clear red line.” He said that if his proposed resolution was passed by Congress, it would give President Joe Biden the authorization to allow the U.S. to provide military assistance to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Kinzinger said, “I don’t think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, giving the president basically congressional leverage for permission to use it if [weapons of mass destruction] — nuclear, biological, or chemical — are used in Ukraine.”

Kinzinger said the authorization would provide Biden leverage while also serving as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kinzinger said that his resolution wouldn’t ""compel the president to [use military force]. It just says if [WMDs are] used, he has the leverage. It gives him better flexibility, but also it is a deterrent to Vladimir Putin.""

Shortly after his appearance on CBS, Kinzinger released a statement on his official Congressional Twitter account that said, “Words matter, but so do our actions. I’m introducing this AUMF as a clear redline so @POTUS can take appropriate action if Russia uses chemical, biological, and/or nuclear weapons. We must stand up for humanity and we must stand with our allies.”





In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress passed an AUMF. In doing so, the national legislature authorized former President George W. Bush to use the U.S. military to launch military campaigns in the pursuit of punishing the terror groups that launched the attacks.



Congress approved a similar AUMF for the 2002 invasion of Iraq.

Kinzinger said that the U.S. must similarly be ready to engage in military conflict on behalf of Ukraine.

Kinzinger said, “Prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don’t get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-kinzinger-russia-war,2022-05-01
'Adolf Putin': Images of Russian president looking like Adolf Hitler pop up as protests against invasion of Ukraine quickly spread,"As protests and pushback against Russia's invasion of Ukraine are picking up steam in a growing number of nations, the Daily Mail reported that images of Russian President Vladimir Putin looking like Adolf Hitler are popping up all over the place — and that even ""Adolf Putin"" graffiti has been scrawled on Russian buildings.

Here are a few other ""Adolf Putin"" examples from around the globe:

What are the details?

The outlet noted that the the ""Adolf Putin"" epithet was written on a wall in Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg as demonstrators have demanded the Russian president end the escalating invasion of Ukraine.

Demonstrators also have taken to the streets of Moscow:

Protests against Russia's invasion also broke out in New York City, as demonstrators held signs showing Putin's face adorned with a blood-stained hand:

Similar sentiments were expressed by protesters in Washington, D.C.:

What else?

A European Union spokesman said Friday that Putin's actions are comparable to the Nazis' in World War II, the Daily Mail noted.

""He is talking about de-Nazifying Ukraine, but he behaves like Nazis,"" Peter Stano told reporters in Brussels, the outlet said. ""So this is all in his head.""

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to blast President Joe Biden and others in an early Friday morning video, saying that Ukraine has been ""left alone"" to defend itself against invading Russian forces while Biden watches ""from a distance.""

Russian troops moved into Ukraine's capital city Kyiv on Friday, as officials urged residents to stay indoors and ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend against the advancing enemy force, the New York Times reported.

"After call with Putin, French PM warns 'the worst is yet to come' with Russia","French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron was left convinced that ""the worst is yet to come"" with the Russia-Ukraine war after speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a lengthy phone conversation on Thursday.

What are the details?

A senior Élysée Palace official told reporters following the 90-minute phone conversation, which Putin initiated, that a diplomatic breakthrough is nowhere in sight. It was the third call between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.

Macron, in fact, believes ""the worst is yet to come.""

""Without making a prediction, we should expect the worst is yet to come. The (French) president said so yesterday as well. There is nothing in what Putin said today that should reassure us,"" the French official said, CNN reported.

The French official also revealed that Putin told Macron he plans to ""continue military interventions and to go all the way"" — meaning Putin wants to take over Ukraine.

""Our analysis of the military operations is that the Russian ambitions are to take control of all of Ukraine,"" the French official said.

Macron warned Putin against continuing military operations, reportedly telling his Russian counterpart that Russia ""will pay dearly because it will end up as an isolated country, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.""

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported on the call by saying the ""the special military operation"" — the propaganda phrase Russian officials are using to refer to their illegal invasion of Ukraine — ""will be fulfilled in any case,"" and warned that ""attempts to gain time by dragging negotiations will only lead to additional requirements for Kyiv,"" the Washington Post reported.

Anything else?

Putin's threats to intensify his war come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Wednesday that a third world war would involve nuclear weapons.

The threat was particularly jarring because Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert last week, and Russia's plans could involve attacking other countries in eastern Europe, thus provoking a response from western allied powers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-call-with-putin-french-pm-warns-the-worst-is-yet-to-come-with-russia-take-control-of-all-of-ukraine,2022-03-03
"After seventh child dies in UK from strep throat complications, experts warn parents to be on the lookout for serious complications","Every parent with a child in school is likely aware of the scourge of strep throat, the highly contagious bacterial infection that regularly makes the rounds throughout schools and households, and usually causes mild symptoms including fever, sore throat, and rash. But a recent wave of deaths due to complications from the bacteria in the UK has experts warning parents to be vigilant about the potentially fatal complications of this usually mild infection.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed last Friday that at least six children had died of strep A complications since September, and the Guardian reports that another child in the UK was reported to have died over the weekend, raising the total to seven.

Health experts in the UK cautioned that, sadly, children are always at a very small risk of death from strep complications, and that some deaths do occur every year. However, they did note that this year's total was higher than normal, prompting the agency to issue a rare alert asking for parents to be vigilant regarding the signs of potentially serious complications.

Parent vigilance regarding potentially serious complications is especially important, the agency said, because even doctors can have a difficult time predicting which cases will turn into serious ones. ""Even if you had all the time in the world and you weren’t pressed or hurried, it’s still difficult to tell which child is going to get ill,"" said Dr. Helen Oxbury, a GP in Oxford.

Oxbury said that parents who have a child who is ill with strep should become concerned if their children display ""continued raised temperature, lethargy or floppiness, not eating or drinking as usual, and lack of urination.""

The CDC states that strep A can become serious when strep A causes ""invasive disease,"" which means that germs invade parts of the body that are usually free from disease. Although the CDC has not yet issued an alert for this year in particular, it does note that an estimated 14,000 to 25,000 cases of invasive strep A occur each year in the United States, and that in the last five years, a total of between 1,500 and 2,300 people have died annually from complications due to invasive strep A diseases.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-seventh-child-dies-in-uk-from-strep-throat-complications-experts-warn-parents-to-be-on-the-lookout-for-serious-complications,2022-12-04
Alabama Democrat introduces bill requiring men to get vasectomies after age 50 or after third child,"An Alabama Democratic lawmaker is retaliating against the state's pro-life law by introducing a bill that would require all men to get a vasectomy shortly after turning 50 years old, or after the birth of their third child, according to Yellowhammer News.

State Rep. Rolanda Hollis filed House Bill 238 in an attempt to place reproductive restrictions on men since the state voted to criminalize abortion. Because the law in Alabama (which is not in effect due to legal obstacles related to Roe v. Wade) makes the killing of unborn children illegal, Hollis apparently believes that men should not be able to father children after a certain point in life.

""Under existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men,"" the bill's synopsis reads. ""This bill would require a man to undergo a vasectomy within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first.""

The bill specifies that the vasectomy must be obtained at the man's own expense.

The bill is clearly an attempt to make a point about so-called reproductive rights and not a legislative proposal with a serious chance at passage, and the apparent comparison of a vasectomy to an abortion is imperfect, to say the least.

Alabama's law criminalizes the performing of an abortion on the basis that a child in the womb is deserving of the same right to life as a child outside the womb, and that an abortion unjustly ends a human life. The law does not require a woman to pay for an invasive, life-changing procedure. In fact, it does the exact opposite.

In theory, a law requiring men to get vasectomies after a third child or after age 50 would hinder the reproductive rights of women nearly as much as men, considering women may also want large families or may desire to have children with a spouse or partner who is 50 or older.

During debate over Alabama's abortion law last year, Hollis made another comparison when she read a poem titled, ""If my Vagina was a Gun,"" to express her opposition to the law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alabama-democrat-introduces-bill-requiring-men-to-get-vasectomies-after-age-50-or-after-third-child,2020-02-14
"Alaska governor fires back after Russian MP demands 'reparations' from US, including Alaska and part of California","A top member of Duma, the Russian parliament, wants the United States to pay reparations to Russia for sanctions imposed for the Ukraine invasion — including the return of former territories of the Russian Empire.

But Alaska's Republican governor said Tuesday his state is ready to defend its borders.

What are the details?

Russian MP Oleg Matveychev appeared on Russian state TV on Sunday, where he boasted that Russia is ""going to raise the stakes"" after ""our victory,"" the Daily Beast reported.

Those new stakes will include the ""dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way"" and the ""extradition of all war criminals,"" citing current and former top Ukrainian leaders.

Then Matveychev demanded territorial reparations, which would include Alaska and a part of Sonoma County in northern California.

""We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that, too, costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties — those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia — which has been seized in the United States, and so on,"" he said.

The TV host then asked, ""Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?""

Matveychev responded in the affirmative and added, ""As well as the Antarctic ... we discovered it, so it belongs to us.""

What did Alaska's governor say?

Reacting to Matveychev, Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) said that Alaskans are prepared to fend off the Russians.

""Good luck with that! Not if we have something to say about it,"" Dunleavy said. ""We have hundreds of thousands of armed Alaskans and military members that will see it differently.""

What about Alaska and Ft. Ross?

The U.S. purchased the Alaska territory from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million. The purchase, according to the State Department, ""ended Russia’s presence in North America and ensured U.S. access to the Pacific northern rim.""

Russia had been eager to unload the territory to further separate Russian territory from the British Empire.

Meanwhile, Russia established a colony in northern California — what is today part of Sonoma County north of San Francisco — at Fort Ross in 1812. Russia sold the land in 1841.

Some Russians today claim the land still legally belongs to their country, claiming that the purchaser, John Sutter, never paid the sell amount of $30,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alaska-governor-fires-back-after-russian-mp-demands-reparations-from-us,2022-03-16
VIDEO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) slammed at town hall event,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was blasted over her voting record on sending weapons and aid to Ukraine. AOC was confronted by protesters during a sparsely attended town hall event in New York City on Wednesday.

A man is heard on video telling Ocasio-Cortez, ""You voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine!""

In May, AOC and all Democrats – including all of the ""Squad"" members – voted in favor of sending $40 billion in aid to Ukraine following the invasion by Russia.

During the ""Legislative Victories & Opportunities for Constituents"" town hall event, the man then asked why Ocasio-Cortez doesn't leave the Democratic Party like former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

On Tuesday, Gabbard announced she was departing the Democratic Party because it is an ""elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution."" Gabbard also declared that the Democratic Party is ""dragging us closer to nuclear war.""

The man said Gabbard left the Democratic Party ""because they’re a bunch of war hawks.”

""You ran as an outsider,"" the man said. ""Yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine. You've been voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China.""

He asked, ""Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?""

Another man chimed in, ""You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.""

He yelled, ""You're a coward!""

The man questioned how AOC could be a ""progressive socialist"" while voting to send American funds to Ukraine.

He screamed during the town hall event held in the Bronx, ""You have done nothing!""

The man declared, ""Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts while you have shown cowardice.""

""I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against,"" the alleged supporter said. ""That's what you've become. You are the establishment.""

He continued, ""And you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war, unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.""

The man ranted, ""We could be in a nuclear war at any minute, and you continue to fund it. That's what's going on.""

AOC refused to address the man's claims, but she did call him ""rude."" He retorted, ""You're the liar here. Nobody has held you accountable.""

The man concluded, ""And it is time for you to stand up and realize that what you've been saying has been lies. Let your conscience come through for once.""

One of the protesters shared a screenshot of an email he allegedly sent to Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, in which he was hopeful that the up-and-coming New York politician would assist him in a dispute with his landlord.

At the time of publication, AOC – who is extremely active on social media – has yet to address being confronted about her voting record on funding Ukraine.

Regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, Ocasio-Cortez has never mentioned the conflict on her massively popular personal Twitter account with more than 13.5 million followers. On her much less popular government Twitter account, she has mentioned the conflict three times – the last being in March.

""As Ukraine fights against the Russian invasion, we have a moral obligation to assist any way we can,"" AOC tweeted on March 28. ""The Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act would work to support the immediate suspension of Ukraine’s debt payments, help coordinate comprehensive debt relief, and more.""

In April, Ocasio-Cortez voted against the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act. The bill that passed in the House gives the president the power to ""seize and confiscate assets belonging to any sanctioned foreign person whose wealth is derived through support for or corruption related to the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

In January 2020, Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed that ""war is a class conflict.""

""The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions,"" AOC tweeted. ""It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence. It is often the vulnerable, the poor, & working people – who had little to no say in conflict – who pay the price.""

Previously, AOC declared that ""the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable.""

""Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo & advocate for concrete policy changes,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in December 2020. ""Popular support often starts small & grows. To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that’s the point.""

Editor's note: Due to a typo, the original version of this story incorrectly identified Ocasio-Cortez as (R-N.Y.) rather than (D-N.Y.).

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Trump's immigration rhetoric is 'directly responsible' for El Paso massacre,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Monday that President Donald Trump's rhetoric on immigration is directly responsible for Saturday's mass killing at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.

Ocasio-Cortez made the remarks during an evening vigil In Brooklyn for victims of the El Paso massacre, as well as those killed in Sunday's Dayton, Ohio, mass killing.

A gunman opened fire on El Paso Walmart shoppers on Saturday, killing at least 22 people and injuring dozens more. Another gunman opened fire on Dayton bargoers early Sunday morning, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more.

Trump has since condemned the violence, calling for unity and love.

What are the details?

According to the New York Daily News, Ocasio-Cortez placed the blame for the violence directly at the president's feet.

In her Monday night remarks, which were given at a vigil held at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, the freshman congresswoman brought up claims of Trump's white supremacy.

""There are so many different issues that are weaving themselves into a braid of violence into our country,"" she told the approximately 500 congregants at the vigil. ""One of them is white supremacist terrorism.""

""White supremacy is an international terrorist problem,"" she continued.

During her later remarks, Ocasio-Cortez insisted that the president's immigration rhetoric is responsible for the El Paso massacre.

""We need to address the immigration rhetoric in this country because it is directly responsible for what happened in El Paso,"" Ocasio-Cortez declared. ""When we allude to people as an invasion, as an infestation, we are directly pulling from the language of white supremacy,"" she said, ""so i don't want to hear the question 'Is this president racist?' anymore. He is.""

What else?

The 29-year-old congresswoman included a word of advice to young men and women across the country who are getting ""radicalized"" toward white supremacy.

""I have to say to the young men — and increasingly some of the young women — in this country that are falling into the grips of white supremacy that find themselves getting radicalized in a funnel of vitriol towards Latinos, towards immigrants, towards African-Americans, towards black people, all Jewish people, all people of different faiths,"" she added, ""what I have to say to you is 'Come back.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-trump-rhetoric-directly-responsible-for-el-paso-massacre,2019-08-06
Alyssa Milano: Giving birth to my first child reminded me 'of being sexually assaulted',"Left-wing activist and actress Alyssa Milano said giving birth to her first child reminded her ""of being sexually assaulted,"" People magazine reported.

What are the details?

Milano — who two years ago said ""my life would be completely lacking all its great joys"" had she not gone through with two abortions in 1993 — appeared this week on the magazine's new podcast ""Me Becoming Mom"" and reflected on her experience giving birth to her son Milo Thomas, now 10.

""I remembered at one point [during childbirth] really not enjoying the fact that lots of people had access to my vagina and thinking to myself, 'Why does — I don't like this. Why does it feel so familiar? I've never had a baby before. Why does this invasive feeling feel so familiar?'"" Milano recalled, People reported. ""That was just a fleeting moment, a tick in time, but I didn't forget about it.""

Milano added to the podcast that going through therapy for her postpartum anxiety and depression helped her connect the dots.

'Very reminiscent of being sexually assaulted'

""After going through therapy after giving birth to Milo and remembering that one moment of feeling like I was being held down and had things being done to me that I didn't want, to me, was very reminiscent of being sexually assaulted,"" she said, according to People. ""It triggered all of these memories that I thought I had dealt with. I think anyone who has dealt with trauma has the moments where you're like, 'Yeah, I'm fine. I've dealt with that.' Versus the moments where you go, 'Oh, no I didn't. I just tried to tuck it away so no one could see them or I couldn't see them or feel them anymore.'""

Milano — who also has a 7-year-old daughter, Elizabella Dylan, with husband David Bugliari — also said part of her childbirth emotion was feeling ""like I wasn't in control,"" the magazine said.

More from People:

Back in 2018, Milano was one of several celebrities who spoke out about surviving sexual assault using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport on social media to protest then-President Donald Trump. She wrote on Twitter, ""I was sexually assaulted twice. Once when I was a teenager. I never filed a police report and it took me 30 years to tell my parents.""



Weeks later, the actress recounted her experience with sexual assault during an emotional speech at Sen. Susan Collins' office. Milano recalled that while at a concert as a 19-year-old, there was a stampede with people ""smashed against each other"" to the point she ""couldn't breathe; I thought I was gonna die.""

""From behind me, I felt a hand up my skirt, and I was punched repeatedly in the vagina,"" she explained at the time, according to the magazine. ""I couldn't turn around. I looked to the stage, and I looked to the security guards, and I said, 'Please help me,' and they couldn't help me. They shook their heads. I managed to break free, and I climbed up the stage to get away from my predator. I turned around, and I didn't know which one it was. I looked to the sea of people, and I couldn't find him.""

Anything else?

Milano has been actively promoting left-wing causes for a number of years — arguably eclipsing her acting notoriety — and her outspokenness against sexual assault and harassment has been a big focus.

But it hasn't always gone well.

In 2019, Milano defended then-presidential candidate Joe Biden against allegations from two women of inappropriate and unwanted touching and emphasized his claim that his actions carried no bad intentions.

""Just as we must believe all women that decide to come forward, we cannot assume all women's experiences are the same,"" the #MeToo activist said.

Yet when Christine Blasey Ford claimed without corroborating evidence that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, Milano had no problem believing Ford and said Kavanaugh's confirmation to the high court served to ""institutionalize sexual violence.""

Then Tara Reade — a former Biden staffer who in 2019 accused him of sexually assaulting her — ripped Milano for hypocritically supporting Biden despite Reade's credible allegations.

Milano said in an interview around that time that she ""never thought [#MeToo] would be something that was going to destroy innocent men"" and that ""we have to find this balance in the 'Believe Women' movement, and also giving men their due process.""

But after Reade called her out and media backlash hit, Milano changed her tune, tweeting that she was ""aware of the new developments in Tara Reade's accusation against Joe Biden. I want Tara, like every other survivor, to have the space to be heard and seen without being used as fodder. I hear and see you, Tara.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alyssa-milano-giving-birth-to-my-first-child-reminded-me-of-being-sexually-assaulted,2021-11-05
American intelligence says that Russia will invade Ukraine as Western allies scramble to find a diplomatic solution,"The United States has intelligence that Russian commanders received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine, CBS News reported.

CBS News host, Margaret Brennan said, “The president was very clear that he is convinced by U.S. intelligence that this invasion will happen, that President Putin [has] decided to do it. How was he that certain?”

CBS News correspondent David Martin responded by saying, “The intelligence says that Russian troops have actually received orders now, to proceed with the invasion. So, not only are they moving up closer and closer to the border into these attack positions, but the commanders on the ground are making specific plans for how they would maneuver in their sector of the battlefield.”

Martin said that the Russian forces are doing “everything that American commanders would do once they got the order to proceed.”

On Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters that he was “convinced” Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine and that he expected Russian forces to invade Ukraine in the “coming days.”

Previously, Ukrainian leadership said that Russia was working to destabilize Ukraine from within to create circumstances that would justify an invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s top national security adviser, said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia given the size of Ukraine’s military and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight.

Danilov also speculated that West continuing to pressure Russia would cause Russian leadership to shy away from conventional means of warfare and pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and economic pressure.

However, as tension in the region continues to escalate, the Russian military announced that it would be conducting military drills involving the country’s strategic nuclear forces.

A spokesman for the Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin would watch the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches in person.

Moscow continues to deny that it has any plans to invade Ukraine and demands that the United States and NATO allies withdraw their military forces from territories near Russia and make legally binding commitments that Ukraine will not join NATO. Leadership in Washington and Brussels refuse to meet these demands.

The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed that he was interested in meeting with Putin so that they could come to a diplomatic consensus that would end the ongoing conflict.

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris met with European leaders in Munich, Germany, to discuss the conflict and strategize with Western leaders on how they might deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

"Award-winning American filmmaker killed by Russian forces in Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv say. White House adviser vows to 'execute appropriate consequences.'","An award-winning American filmmaker was shot dead while covering the war in Ukraine, according to authorities in Kyiv. Ukrainian police said that an American video journalist was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, Ukraine, approximately 18 miles west of Kyiv.

""A 51-year-old world-renowned media correspondent was shot in Irpen today,"" Kyiv regional police force chief Andrey Nebitov wrote on Facebook, adding that ""another journalist is injured.""

Nebitov claimed that the fallen journalist was Brent Renaud – a video journalist and award-winning documentary filmmaker.



""Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but U.S. citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty, and ruthlessness.""



Initially, Renaud was believed to be covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine for the New York Times since he had press credentials issued by The New York Times. However, the official New York Times communications account on Twitter noted that Renaud formerly worked for the media outlet.

We are deeply saddened to hear of Brent Renaud’s death. Brent was a talented filmmaker who had contributed to the New York Times over the years. Though he had contributed to the Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at the Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago.

The Independent reported, ""The Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, working alongside his brother Craig as the Renaud Brothers, also produced films for HBO, NBC, Discovery, PBS and Vice News, among others, while reporting from Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and across the U.S. and elsewhere.""



PBS correspondent Jane Ferguson wrote on Twitter, ""Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket. Ukrainian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage. Outraged Ukrainian police officer: 'Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.'""

PBS ""News Hour"" special correspondent Simon Ostrovskysaid, ""Gutting to hear of the death Brent Renaud in Irpin, Ukraine today. A filmmaker without parallel who was working on a global film project about refugees. My thoughts are with his brother and his friends and family.""

""Chronicle 5"" correspondent Nicole Estaphan tweeted, ""Today Brent Renaud was killed while documenting the story of Ukrainians fleeing Irpin. He was talented and fueled by the need to shine the light on people who might otherwise go ignored. Here is some of his work.""



On Sunday morning, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the reports of Renaud's death ""obviously shocking and horrifying.""

""I will be consulting with my colleagues, we'll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it,"" Sullivan said during an appearance on ""Face the Nation.""

""I will just say that this is part and parcel of what has been a brazen aggression on the part of the Russians where they have targeted civilians, they have targeted hospitals, they have targeted places of worship and they have targeted journalists,"" Sullivan added. ""And the United States has been working hard to hold Russia accountable through the imposition of the most far reaching- far reaching sanctions ever imposed and through the provision of military assistance to the Ukrainians to be able to blunt the Russian advance. And we will obviously be tracking this latest development very closely and responding accordingly.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-journalist-killed-ukraine-filmmaker,2022-03-13
American military and diplomats flee Ukraine fearing an imminent Russian invasion,"The United States has partially moved its forces out of Ukraine and ordered the evacuation of most embassy staff, according to CNN.

The American government is worried about the safety of American citizens remaining in Ukraine as the likelihood of a Russian invasion of its neighbor continues to grow.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered members of the Florida National Guard to leave Ukraine and stationed them “elsewhere in Europe.”

In an official statement, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, “They are departing Ukraine and will reposition elsewhere in Europe. The Secretary made this decision out of an abundance of caution — with the safety and security of our personnel foremost in mind — and informed by the State Department’s guidance on U.S. personnel in Ukraine.”

He noted that the Pentagon still supports Ukraine’s military despite pulling American troops out of the country.

Kirby said, “This reporting does not signify a change in our determination to support Ukraine’s Armed Forces, but will provide flexibility in assuring allies and deterring aggression.”

On Saturday, the State Department issued a travel advisory saying that it had “ordered the departure of most U.S. direct-hire employees from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action.”

The State Department indicated that the embassy’s consular services will be suspended during this time of heightened tension, and it emphasized that a small diplomatic presence would be maintained, but not in Kyiv. This diplomatic staff will “handle emergencies,” per CNN, and is stationed in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv – about 50 miles away from Ukraine’s shared border with Poland.

CNN reports that on Saturday morning, a Senior State Department official said that it is “past time for U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine” and that “there are limits to what the U.S. can do to assist them in a war zone.”

During an afternoon phone call, on Saturday, President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that if Russia invades Ukraine there will be “swift and severe” costs to Russia and “widespread human suffering.”

The New York Times reported that, according to senior officials in the Biden administration, after the two presidents’ phone call it remained unclear whether Russia would invade.

One senior national security official said that there was “no fundamental change in the dynamic that has unfolded now for several weeks.”

On Friday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the United States government believes a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent.

Sullivan said, “We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. As we’ve said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it.”

Alongside the United States, many other countries are reducing their diplomatic presence in Ukraine and are actively encouraging their citizens abroad to return home.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-military-and-withdrawal-from-ukraine-as-russian-invasion-looms,2022-02-12
American officials travel to Venezuela to re-establish trade and further isolate Russia,"Senior American officials traveled to Venezuela to try and drive a wedge between Venezuela and its longtime ally Russia.

The New York Times reported that this trip is the highest-level visit to Venezuela by American officials since 2019.

In 2019, the United States broke off diplomatic relations with the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro due to allegations of electoral fraud. The Trump administration closed the American embassy in Venezuela and issued sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and senior members of the country’s government.

The Trump administration also moved to officially recognize the leader of Maduro’s opposition — Juan Guaido — as the lawful president of Venezuela. In a direct slight to the Maduro regime, Trump hosted Guaido at the 2020 State of the Union Address.

In response to American sanctions, Venezuela sought economic relief and diplomatic assistance from its counterparts in Russia, Iran, and China.

Russian energy companies have played a crucial role in allowing Venezuela to continue exporting oil throughout the world.

With Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine, the Biden administration is paying closer to attention to the allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in South and Latin America. The Biden administration is concerned that Putin could leverage these relationships in ways that pose a threat to U.S. safety.

As sanctions from Western allies weaken the Russian economy, American leadership is lunging at opportunities to drive a wedge between Russia and its allies who rely on it for economic support.

The New York Times alleged that there is bipartisan support for reestablishing diplomatic relations with Venezuela in an effort to undermine Russia.

Scott Taylor, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, works alongside pro-Venezuelan lobbyists and said, “We should take this opportunity to achieve a diplomatic win and a wedge between Russia and Venezuela.”

Trish Reagan, a former Fox Business host, said, “Venezuela has the largest source of oil reserves yet, we’re handing that to the Chinese and Russians.”

In the past month, prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Nicolas Maduro spoke with Putin by telephone and has hosted Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Yuri Borisov.

Maduro appears to be open to discussing re-establishing trade relations with the United States.

In a public speech he delivered this past week, Maduro said, “Here lies the oil of Venezuela, which is available for whomever wants to produce and buy it, be it an investor from Asia, Europe, or the United States.”

Suspect reportedly shoots police officer's mother in the head in broad daylight as she answers the door,"The mother of a New York City police officer was fatally shot as she answered the front door of her home, ABC News has reported.



What are the details?

Police say 51-year-old Queens woman Anna Torres was killed after a suspect shot her in the head after she answered the door.

Surveillance video footage showed the moment the suspect's gun went off, fatally striking Torres and sending terrified children and neighbors fleeing for cover. At least two of the woman's relatives were inside the home at the time of the shooting.

Giuseppe Canzani, the 41-year-old suspect, drove to a local police station and surrendered after the shooting.

In a statement on the shooting, NYPD Deputy Chief Jerry O'Sullivan said that after driving to the precinct, the suspect ""exited [his] vehicle, pulled out a firearm, and placed it on the sidewalk.""

""There were two officers in front of the precinct for station-house security,"" O'Sullivan continued. ""The officers successfully handcuffed the individual and removed the firearm away from the subject.""

Canzani was charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a firearm. He is due to appear in court on Thursday.

A deeper look

WABC-TV reported that a man matching Canzani's description was once seen arguing with Torres in her back yard.

The station noted that Canzani said Torres, a psychic who reportedly did tarot readings inside her home, was a ""witch"" who cursed him and condemned him to death.

""[Her curses] tried to kill me,"" he reportedly told investigators. ""I am supposed to be dead already.""

Torres' husband, David Aguilar, said he can't believe his wife, who possessed a kind nature, is gone.

""My son is the same way,"" he said. ""He's good with everyone. He's fair. She was the sweetest person in the world. I'm lost without her.""

One neighbor called the murder ""unbelievable.""

""It's so quiet and so nice. Everyone knows each other. I've been here almost 6 years. Never, nothing happened,"" the neighbor told the station.

Another neighbor added, ""It's scary that our family lives here. Our grandparents live next door. You don't know was it a home invasion or not; you don't know what it is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anna-torres-shooting-giuseppe-canzani,2022-05-06
Another In-N-Out Burger in northern California gets shut down for failing to check customers for proof of COVID vaccinations,"Northern California officials have shut down a second In-N-Out Burger location for failing to check customers for proof of COVID-19 vaccinations or negative coronavirus test results, the Los Angeles Times reported.

What are the details?

The first In-N-Out shutdown occurred earlier this month at a restaurant in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf for the same reason. The Times said that location has since reopened for outdoor dining only.

But on Tuesday, Contra Costa Health Services said the the In-N-Out at 570 Contra Costa Blvd. in Pleasant Hill was shut down after repeatedly violating county rules, the Times reported.

More from the paper:

Officials in Contra Costa County, located east of San Francisco and Oakland, said they gave the In-N-Out in Pleasant Hill ample opportunities to comply, but it created a public health hazard by ""repeatedly violating"" the county order. That order, in effect since Sept. 22, requires restaurants and some other indoor establishments to verify that all customers 12 or older are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have had a negative coronavirus test within the previous 72 hours.

Officials said the Pleasant Hill In-N-Out garnered four citations over several weeks and had to pay fines totaling $1,750 for violating the order, the Times said, adding that the restaurant can appeal the permit suspension but must stay closed ""until the hazard is abated.""

The paper said two other area In-N-Outs — in Pinole and San Ramon — have received notices of violating the vaccination order, the paper said.

San Francisco Bay Area public health officials have enacted some of the strictest COVID-19 rules in California, the Times added.

What did In-N-Out have to say?

""It is unreasonable, invasive and unsafe to force our restaurant associates to segregate customers into those who may be served and those who may not, whether based on the documentation they carry or any other reason,"" Arnie Wensinger, In-N-Out's chief legal and business officer, said in response to the Pleasant Hill shutdown, according to the paper. ""This is clear governmental overreach and is intrusive, improper, and offensive.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/another-in-n-out-burger-northern-california-shut-down-covid-vaccinations,2021-10-27
Antony Blinken gives NATO allies 'green-light' to send fighter jets to Ukraine as Western sanctions cripple Russia's economy,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that NATO member nations are allowed to send fighter jets to Ukraine as the United States and its allies continue to provide assistance to Ukraine in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Blinken said on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” on Sunday, that NATO allies sending fight jets to Ukraine “gets a green-light.”

He said, “In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now abut what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if in fact they choose to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they are handing over to the Ukrainians?”

A White House spokesperson told CBS News that the Biden administration is evaluating its ability to provide fighter jets to Poland should the Polish government decide to transfer planes to Ukraine, CBS News reported.

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. said that she hopes Ukraine will receive fighter jets from Poland “as soon as possible.”

She said, “We are working with our American, especially, friends and allies, on the steady supply of ammunition and anti-air, anti-tank, and planes to be able to effectively defend our county.”

Allied Western nations have provided military and humanitarian aide to Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion and have also issued sweeping sanctions that effectively cripple and isolate the Russian financial system.

Shortly after Russia launched its invasion, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. issued a statement expressing their intentions to remove Russian banks from the SWIFT telecommunication network.

The statement said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World WAR, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

Since the West locked arms in support of Ukraine, the Russian economy has been rapidly deteriorating. Private financial institutions like Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in Russia, further isolating Russians from participating in the global economy, and the Western energy company British Petroleum announced that it would liquidate its holdings in Russian energy companies and suspend its operations in Russia.

Blinken affirmed that Western sanctions were drastically impacting the Russian economy.

He said, “The impact of the sanctions is already devastating. The ruble is in freefall. Their stock market’s been shuttered for almost a week. We’re seeing a recession set in Russia. Consumers aren’t able to buy basic products because companies are fleeing Russia, so it’s having a big impact.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/antony-blinken-gives-nato-allies-green-light-to-send-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-as-western-sanctions-cripple-russia-s-economy,2022-03-06
Even Ocasio-Cortez is upset at Democratic leadership over SOTU social distancing rules: 'That doesn't make sense',"Progressive Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York joined the chorus of people criticizing the social distancing rules imposed by Democratic leadership for the State of the Union address Tuesday.

Masking requirements were dropped ahead of President Joe Biden's first State of the Union speech, prompting many to accuse officials of following the polling instead of the science.

Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to complain about the rules because they meant some members of the press would not be allowed to attend.

""If leadership decided masks are now optional at SOTU, then how are they requiring social distancing to the extent of excluding press? That doesn’t make sense,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday.

Initially, the guidance from the Sergeant-at-Arms at the U.S. Senate and from the U.S. Capitol's attending physician said all members of Congress could attend the speech but that they would have to wear a KN95 mask and have a PCR test within one day of the event.

Then on Sunday, the attending physician said the guidance was changed to make masks optional just two days ahead of the State of the Union.

Dr. Brian Monahan said in a memo to members of Congress that they “may choose to mask at any time, but it is no longer a requirement.”

Monahan pointed to new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to explain his fortuitous lifting of masking demands.

Many Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, indicated that they would forego attending the address because of the testing requirements.

""I'm healthy, so I won’t be taking a test for COVID… so I won’t be attending the #SOTU,"" he tweeted.

""I don't have time to go take a COVID test today. I only take a test if I’m sick,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to explain why he wouldn't be attending.

Biden is expected to address the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia in his speech, as well as the economic challenges besetting his constituents.

AOC demands 'consequences' for big oil 'profiteering'; industry claps back with an economics lesson,"Progressive Democrats are accusing oil companies of ""profiteering"" and are demanding they face ""consequences"" for high prices at the pump as the price of crude oil fell below $100 on Monday and continued to decline Tuesday. But the industry has fired back, saying these Democrats are ""grandstanding"" instead of proposing solutions to the gas crisis.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Monday responded to MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who asked ""what's going on"" with gas prices averaging $4.32 per gallon on Monday while the price of crude oil dropped 8% and fell below $100 per barrel. ""Profiteering. And there should be consequences for it,"" the congresswoman replied.

Fellow ""squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) echoed her comments, writing, ""Big oil CEOs need to be held accountable for profiteering, this can’t stand.""

And another congressman, Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), accused oil companies of ""price-gouging"" and said, ""Congress must pass legislation to stop it.""

Their comments drew a harsh rebuke from the American Petroleum Institute, which said, ""The American people are looking for solutions, not finger pointing.""

""The price at the pump that Americans are currently paying is a function of increased demand and lagging supply combined with the geopolitical turmoil resulting from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine,"" API Senior Vice President of Policy, Economics, and Regulatory Affairs Frank Macchiarola explained in a statement to TheBlaze.

""Lawmakers should focus on policies that increase US supply to help mitigate the situation rather than political grandstanding that does nothing but discourage investment at a time when it’s needed the most,” Macchiarola said.

Left-wing accusations of price gouging came after the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark for crude oil, traded at $94.15 per barrel on Monday, coming down from the high of $130 reached a little more than a week ago. Crude oil prices remained below $100 a barrel on Tuesday as well.

Industry analysts said the previous spike in oil prices was fear-based, driven by concerns over how Russia's energy exports would be impacted by import bans from the U.S. and Canada, CNBC reported. The decline in prices is related to hopes that the commodity market will be resilient, as well as expectations that renewed COVID-19 lockdowns in China will prevent millions of people there from traveling and reduce demand for gasoline.

What that means is that in the short-term, gas prices could begin to decline, but a change in prices may come slowly. Crude oil makes up about 56% of the price of regular gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Falling crude oil prices will ""take a lot of the pressure off pump prices,"" but this change will be a ""gradual decline,"" American Automobile Association's Andrew Gross told Newsweek Tuesday.

Claims that oil companies haven't responded to the market are inaccurate. Patrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, observed Monday that there has in been a ""slow decline"" in gas prices, noting that the national average price of gas has decreased four cents per gallon since Thursday.

Some experts have cautioned that the drop in prices may be temporary. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis, told CNN that if crude oil stays around $100 per barrel, fuel prices could drop by about 20 cents per gallon. But he warned that prices could spike again in the spring and summer as people begin traveling more, increasing demand for gasoline. The World Travel & Tourism Council predicts a 6.2% increase over pre-pandemic travel levels within the U.S. this year, which the organization says will add nearly $2 trillion to U.S. GDP, CNN reported.

Kloza said he expects all of that additional travel to bring gas prices up to about $4.50 per gallon. But that figure will be a result of increased demand for a product that's restricted by supply, not greedy corporations taking advantage of consumers.



Gas prices have reached record highs since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, prompting international sanctions against Russia and disrupting oil markets. However, the cost to fill up a vehicle was increasing well before the invasion began, and this is not the first time Democrats have blamed oil companies.

In November, when the average price of gas was $3.22 — at the time the highest level since 2014 — President Joe Biden sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission tying rising prices to alleged ""anti-consumer behavior"" from oil companies. The industry blasted the accusation, arguing rising prices were the result of complicated factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and increased demand for gas. The American Petroleum Institute called Biden's letter a ""distraction"" and said that ""ill-advised government decisions"" were ""exacerbating this challenging decision.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-demands-consequences-for-big-oil-profiteering-industry-gives-economics-lesson,2022-03-15
"AOC slams NYPD's expenditure of $75,000 on a robotic dog as wasteful and possibly racist","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) slammed the New York Police Department for deploying its new robotic dog in the Bronx, suggesting that the $75,000 new crime-fighting tech is wasteful and its existence racist.

The democratic socialist ""Squad"" leader criticized the NYPD's ""Digidog"" after it was deployed to respond to a home invasion last week, saying that the resources spent to build the robot should have been allocated to serve other community needs.

""Shout out to everyone who fought against community advocates who demanded these resources go to investments like school counseling instead,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""Now robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with under-resourced schools.""

According to the New York Post, the NYPD's ""Digidog"" is still in its test phase. The 70-pound robot is equipped with lights and cameras that allow the police to view ""its surroundings in real-time."" The robot also is equipped with two-way communication, can run up to 3.5 miles per hour, can see in the dark, and can climb stairs.

""Digidog"" uses artificial intelligence to navigate and was designed to allow police to respond in emergency situations that are too dangerous for human officers.

""This dog is going to save lives, protect people, and protect officers and that's our goal,"" NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit Inspector Frank Digiacomo said.

The Daily Mail reported that ""Digidog"" was deployed to a home invasion and barricade situation on East 227th Street near White Plains Road in Wakefield on Tuedsay.

Two men were reportedly being held hostage in a Bronx apartment. They had been threatened at gun point, tied up and tortured for hours by two male assailants who pretended to be plumbers to gain access to the home.



One of the victims managed to escape and called the police.



Digidog was deployed and helped officers determine that the armed suspects were no longer inside the home.



The police said they were still searching for the two men, who stole a cellphone and $2,000 in cash and used a hot iron to burn one of the victims.

Though the police are confident that the new technology can help save officer's lives in dangerous situations, Ocasio-Cortez believes money spent on crime fighting would be better reallocated for education or health care in ""underserved communities.""

""Please ask yourself: when was the last time you saw next-generation, world class technology for education, healthcare, housing, etc consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?"" she asked in a follow-up tweet.

Ocasio-Cortez says sympathy for Ukrainian refugees is a 'profound opportunity' to get a pathway to citizenship for all refugees,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said that Democrats should use the overwhelming support for refugees from the Ukrainian war to help get a pathway to citizenship for all refugees.

She made the comments to Rachel Maddow on MSNBC Tuesday after the State of the Union address by President Joe Biden.

While Maddow asked Ocasio-Cortez how to use sympathy for the refugees from the invasion of Ukraine to avoid demonization of illegal immigrants at home, the congresswoman bent the conversation towards amnesty.

""I think that the way that we are looking at immediate granting of TPS to Ukrainian refugees, which is what we need to be doing, as well as many others, is something that we really need to keep in mind. Because I do believe that, for example, the thousands of people who try to seek legal refuge on our southern border, how Haitian refugees have been treated by the United States, not just in past administrations, but frankly this one, is not right,"" she said.



""And we really need to make sure that when we talk about accepting refugees, that we are meaning it for everybody, no matter where you come from. But I do believe that this also presents a profound opportunity because of the amount of extraordinary support for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued.

""If we grant TPS to Ukrainian refugees, this is also an opportunity to finally create a path to citizenship for TPS recipients,"" she concluded. ""So I think that while there is a risk, there’s also a profound opportunity for us to make the crooked path straight on this issue.""

Ocasio-Cortez retweeted a video of her immigration comments by someone who tied the proposal to abolishing ICE, and fighting racism and white supremacy.

It is estimated that about one million refugees have already fled from Ukraine as the Russian military attacks civilian centers, and more are expected as the war drags on.

Prestigious college paper apologizes after its reporters posted 'retraumatizing and invasive' photos of students publicly protesting Jeff Sessions' speech on campus,"Northwestern University's prestigious campus newspaper apologized for having ""actively harmed"" students through its coverage of a protest surrounding former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Nov. 5 speech on campus.

The Sunday op-ed signed by Daily Northwestern staffers said ""nothing is more important than ensuring that our fellow students feel safe — and in situations like this, that they are benefitting from our coverage rather than being actively harmed by it. We failed to do that last week, and we could not be more sorry.""

What is the paper sorry about?

The paper said that ""one area of our reporting that harmed many students was our photo coverage of the event. Some protesters found photos posted to reporters' Twitter accounts retraumatizing and invasive. Those photos have since been taken down.""

In addition:

""Some students also voiced concern about the methods that Daily staffers used to reach out to them. Some of our staff members who were covering the event used Northwestern's directory to obtain phone numbers for students beforehand and texted them to ask if they'd be willing to be interviewed. We recognize being contacted like this is an invasion of privacy, and we've spoken with those reporters — along with our entire staff — about the correct way to reach out to students for stories.""

The paper's editor in chief, Troy Closson, on Tuesday morning didn't immediately respond to TheBlaze's request for comment on exactly what constitutes a correct procedure for contacting students for stories.

The op-ed also said it removed the name of a protester initially quoted in the paper because Northwestern's administration can punish protesting students: ""We did not want to play a role in any disciplinary action that could be taken by the university.""

""As students at Northwestern, we are also grappling with the impact of Tuesday's events, and as a student organization, we are figuring out how we can support each other and our communities through distressing experiences that arise on campus,"" the op-ed noted. ""We will also work to balance the need for information and the potential harm our news coverage may cause. We met as a staff Sunday to discuss where our reporting and empathy fell short last week, and we are actively re-examining how we'll address similar situations in the future and how to best move forward.""

Closson — a senior with the school's prestigious Medill School of Journalism — told the Washington Post, ""Something we thought about a lot this week is how challenging it is to be student journalists who are reporting about other students. We're thinking about what our role looks like specifically as student journalists who have to cover this, but at the same time we have to go to class with those students tomorrow.""

Charles Whitaker, dean of Medill, on Tuesday morning didn't immediately respond to TheBlaze's request for comment on the Daily Northwestern's apologetic op-ed.

Backlash

The New York Times used a sarcastic headline for its story on the college paper's op-ed: ""The Daily Northwestern apologizes to student protesters for reporting.""

Image source: Twitter

A number of professional journalists took the paper to task as well:



""There's a lot to comment on in this Daily Northwestern editorial,"" the Chicago Tribune's Gregory Pratt tweeted, ""but apologizing for contacting people to ask if they're willing to be interviewed? Regretting that you photographed protesters protesting in public?""

The Washington Post's Amy Brittain tweeted: ""This is called reporting. Why are you apologizing for it? Mind-boggling to read this editorial from student journalists who attend one of the top schools for journalism in the country.""

""I don't doubt the sincerity of these student journalists,"" Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times tweeted. ""But I worry that if journalists keep ceding ground on when it is acceptable to do basic reporting, we eventually play into the hands of powerful interests who would love to criminalize journalism.""

""In appalling ignorance of the basics of news-gathering, a Northwestern student newspaper apologies for taking photos of students protesting Jeff Sessions and for using the student directory to text students to ask if they wanted to be interviewed,"" Byron Tau, who covers the Department of Justice and FBI for the Wall Street Journal, tweeted.

And Samuel King — a Northwestern alum who reports for Austin's National Public Radio station KUT.org — posted this telling tweet:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/apologetic-college-paper-says-it-actively-harmed-students-with-retraumatizing-and-invasive-photos-of-them-protesting-jeff-sessions,2019-11-12
Beto O'Rourke claims it is 'really hard' to believe President Trump's supporters are not racist,"Democratic presidential contender Beto O'Rourke said on CNN's ""State of then Union"" Sunday that if you vote for President Donald Trump then you are probably racist.

""You said to me last week that you thought President Trump was a white nationalist,"" host Jake Tapper said. ""President Trump won your home state of Texas by nine points. Almost 63 million Americans voted for him. Do you think it is racist to vote for President Trump in 2020?""

""I think it's really hard,"" O'Rourke responded after a long pause.

The former Texas congressman went on to explain why he believes the president is racist, citing Trump's ""repeated warnings of invasions, to his repeated calls to send them back,"" Trump's ""description of white nationalists and Klansmen and neo-Nazis as 'very fine people,'"" and Trump's so-called Muslim travel ban.

""Donald Trump is dangerous to the future of America, and will destroy what makes us so unique and so special and the genius that we represent to ourselves and to the rest of the world,"" O'Rourke said.

At the end of his interview, O'Rourke appealed Americans to vote for a presidential candidate who will bring ""this very divided and highly polarized country together,"" instead of a candidate who will ""try to divide us on our differences.""

Not only did O'Rourke declare Trump a white supremacist last week, but he partially blamed the president for the tragic El Paso massacre that left 22 people dead.

Arizona state House passes bill barring biological males from girls’ sports,"Lawmakers in Arizona moved a step closer to barring biological males from competing in girls' sports.

According to a report Tuesday from the Arizona Republic, the state's House of Representatives passed a bill that would close off designated female sports ""to students of the male sex"":

The emotional hours-long debate on House Bill 2706 culminated in a party-line vote of 31-29, sending the measure to the state Senate, where it will become another flashpoint in the culture wars at the state Capitol.



Rep. Nancy Barto, a Phoenix Republican who is sponsoring the measure, argued it is necessary in the face of a lawsuit in Connecticut brought by the conservative Scottsdale-based group Alliance Defending Freedom and students who argue they unfairly lost out in competition with transgender athletes.

H.B. 2706 would require sports or teams sponsored by educational institutions to be designated as either coed, male or female, with biological males not being allowed to compete in female-designated events.

The bill also says that in the event of a dispute about participation on a sport or team, ""A student may establish the student's sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that indicates the student's sex based on an analysis of the student's genetic makeup.""

The Arizona Republic story points out that a previous version of the bill had more stringent requirements for establishing biological sex in a dispute — which included determining testosterone levels — that were amended after pushback from Democrats, who said they were too invasive.

Language in the findings section of the bill declares that ""biological differences between females and males, especially as they relate to natural levels of testosterone, 'explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport,"" citing a paper from the Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy.

The proposed restrictions would apply to public schools and private schools that are part of interscholastic sports organizations, as well as public colleges and community colleges and other higher learning institutions that are members of national athletic associations such as the NCAA.

Naturally, the bill has drawn criticism from those who say that student athletes' biological makeup shouldn't trump their perceived gender identity in the realm of athletics.

""Transgender girls are girls, and transgender boys are boys,"" Amanda Parris, policy counsel for the ACLU of Arizona, said of the bill in a statement against the legislation last Friday. ""Transgender students participate in sports for the same reasons that other students do. They want enjoy the activities, challenge themselves and be a part of a team.""

""Trans athletes are not a threat. We need to protect trans kids—and all LGBTQ+ kids—and ensure they feel safe and welcomed at school,"" Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said last month, urging lawmakers to reject the bill.

Meanwhile, legislators in several other states have also sought to address the question of transgender athletes in girls' sports. Similar bills have so far been proposed or filed in Idaho, Missouri, Tennessee, New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio and Alabama.

"Arkansas man plants mystery seeds from China, says results are wild — and now other packages are inexplicably showing up","An Arkansas man who says he received a packet of unknown seeds from China has planted them — and KSFM-TV calls the burgeoning plant ""wild.""

Packages of unsolicited seeds from China began showing up in mailboxes across the country in July, stumping agriculture and commerce officials in the process.

In early statements, the USDA said it believes that the products are part of what could be a ""brushing scam,"" in which people receive unsolicited items to, in turn, create fake customer reviews for the purpose of boosting sales.

What are the details?

Booneville, Arkansas, resident Doyle Crenshaw said he planted a nondescript — and unsolicited — package of seeds from China.

""We ... planted the seeds just to see what would happen,"" he told the station, revealing that the large plant — which initially grew from orange-colored flowers — is producing large, white fruits.

""Every two weeks I'd come by and put Miracle-Gro on it, and they just started growing like crazy,"" he admitted.

The Booneville resident said that he only opted to plant the seeds before the USDA issued a warning against doing so to U.S. residents.

Image source: KSFM-TV video screenshot

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture warned, ""Our concern is from an invasive pest aspect: These seeds could introduce an invasive weed or an invasive insect pest or a plant disease.""



The station reports that the department of agriculture plans to remove the plant from Crenshaw's property out of an abundance of caution.

The spokesperson adds that the department isn't sure what the plants are at the time of this reporting, but it has plans to study the growth.

Booneville Man Plants Mysterious Seeds from China Being Sent Across the U.S. www.youtube.com

Not just seeds anymore

A Wednesday report from Newsweek reveals that U.S. consumers are receiving more unsolicited packages — this time containing items like sunglasses and used socks.

One woman tells the outlet that she received masks from China — but she never placed such an order.

Another woman said that she received a pair of knock-off Ray-Ban-style sunglasses. She thinks there's something more nefarious afoot than just bolstering online reviews.

""I don't think people are sending this in goodwill in my opinion,"" she says. ""I'm just afraid that there may be something harmful to them.""

Another woman says she received used socks, but she didn't think too much about it other than it being ""odd.""

A brushing scam can be a problem for a person, as it could indicate that their personal information has been leaked.

Ray Walsh, a data privacy expert, told Newsweek, ""Anybody who received an unexpected package needs to be aware that their data is being misused by the seller. If you receive a brushing parcel it is vital that you hand it in to the police so that they can forward it to the U.S. postal inspector's office for the purpose of tracking where it came from. Items received could be dangerous, which means that they must be disposed of correctly.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arkansas-man-plants-mystery-seeds-from-china-says-results-are-wild-and-now-other-packages-are-inexplicably-showing-up,2020-08-05
Armed great-grandmother fires at home intruder. He cowers in her closet until police arrive.,"A Georgia woman's grit — as well as her pistol — can likely be credited for scaring a home intruder off his plan.

What are the details?

Gwendolyn Agard, a 79-year-old great-grandmother, heard someone trying to gain access to her home through the back stairs of her Jackson County home on Feb. 11.

She called police immediately but she wasn't about to sit on her hands waiting for law enforcement to arrive.

""I've always said, don't ever let anybody come in and run you out of your own house,"" she told WSB-TV.

She took her own advice. Agard said that while the intruder broke her back window, she loaded up her pistol.

""I said to him, 'You come down these damn steps and I'll blow your f***ing brains out,"" she told the station. ""And that's exactly what I said.""

Agard fired two shots, missing the intruder, but it was enough to scare him — whom the police later identified as 20-year-old Hans Rogers — into a bedroom closet in her house, where police discovered him when they arrived.

""Trust me,"" she told the station, ""God was all in the picture. Because my legs were trembling. I was saying, 'Lord have mercy, Jesus.' And then 'motherf***er' the next time. It was all mixed in.""

What else?

Connie Oliver, a mail carrier, was impressed to hear how well Agard fared during the break-in.

""That's why I say she's my hero. That she could do this at her age, I was very impressed. And I'm thankful the good Lord took care of her,"" Oliver said.

Rogers faces a list of charges, including home invasion, according to the station.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-great-grandmother-stops-intruder,2019-02-22
"Armed home invasion takes a bizarre turn when suspect reportedly raids fridge, draws a bath, and sleeps over — then pays for the damage","Authorities say that an armed home invasion suspect broke into a Santa Fe, New Mexico, residence this weekend for a sleepover while the homeowners were out of town, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

What are the details?

The suspect, identified by police as 34-year-old Teral Christesson, reportedly broke a window to gain entry to the home, ate the homeowners' shrimp, drank their beer, took a bath, and slept in a bed.

The unnamed homeowners discovered Christesson in a back room of the home with a duffel bag and an AR-15 scoped rifle next to him.

Christesson, according to the report, was very embarrassed and apologetic over the break-in and was said to have left the homeowners $200 to pay for the broken window's repair.

One of the homeowners said that Christesson was ""extremely embarrassed and apologetic about the situation"" and said that he was just looking for a place to stay.

Christesson also reportedly told the homeowners that ""his family was killed in east Texas"" and that he was ""running from somebody.""

Christesson was then said to have left the home, walking through a nearby ditch.

What happened then?

A day later, police arrested Christesson after he reportedly attempted to carjack a woman outside an area restaurant.

Santa Fe Police said that an armed Christesson approached a woman outside the restaurant and held her at gunpoint while attempting to steal her vehicle from the drive-through lane.

The woman, however, refused and began honking her horn, driving Christesson away from the area.

Police later discovered him walking down a local street and took him into custody without incident.

Christesson reportedly told authorities that he broke into the home after being ""caught in a blizzard"" on Sunday.

Christesson was booked into the Santa Fe County jail on charges of aggravated burglary, larceny, and criminal damage to property, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-home-invasion-takes-a-bizarre-turn-when-suspect-reportedly-raids-fridge-draws-a-bath-and-sleeps-over,2022-02-08
Armed homeowner confronts armed home invasion suspect — and a shootout erupts. The homeowner wins.,"How many times in recent years did crooks figure they'd get the best of their victims with no problem? That they'd probably just lay down and take it? And certainly that their victims would never arm themselves with guns, much less fire them?

By this point, we've certainly lost count.

But we have for you yet another account of a crook who's not reading the news — or maybe just can't read. Either way, it once again meant a very bad day for the bad guy.

What happened?

Police in Rainier, Oregon — just across the river from Washington state and about an hour north of Portland — responded to a report of burglary in progress at a residence in the 600 block of West C Street early Sunday morning, Oregon State Police reported.

When officers arrived, they confronted an armed suspect who was eventually detained without incident, police said.

Oh, but there's a bit more to the story.

Turns out the preliminary investigation revealed the suspect committed a home invasion robbery and exchanged gunfire with the homeowner, police said.

The suspect was shot — and the homeowner was not injured, police said.

The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for his injuries, cops said.

While KOIN-TV reported that the suspect’s condition was not released, KGW-TV reported that the suspect is expected to survive.

State police said the Columbia County Major Crimes team was activated, and lead agencies for the ongoing investigation are the Rainer Police Department and the Oregon State Police, with assistance from the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office and Columbia County District Attorney’s Office.

What did observers have to say?

As you might imagine, folks reacting so far to the results of the shootout were decidedly happy for the homeowner.

"Home intruders bring pepper spray to a gunfight — after which armed homeowner crushes their threat, critically wounding at least one crook","A gun-toting homeowner critically wounded at least one burglar Thursday morning after the suspect and another man tried to enter a Parkland residence in western Washington state.

What are the details?

The pair tried to get into the home in the 14600 block of First Avenue South through a side window around 4 a.m., investigators with the Pierce County Sheriff's Department told KCPQ-TV.

The homeowner then confronted the suspected burglars, Sgt. Darren Moss told KCPQ.

One of the suspects deployed pepper spray, Moss added to the station, and the homeowner shot at least one of the suspects. Investigators don't know which came first — the pepper spray or the gunfire, KCPQ said.

The wounded 38-year-old suspect was taken to a hospital and was in critical condition, the station said, adding that deputies have not identified him.

The other suspect got away, KCPQ said, adding that it's unknown whether he was injured.

Both suspects face burglary and assault charges, the station said.

What happened to the homeowner?

Moss told KCPQ investigators believe the homeowner was protecting his family.

""We don't see enough — or enough of reason — to place the homeowner in custody,"" Moss added to the station. ""It seems to be that it could be self-defense.""

Investigators noted to KCPQ they believe the homeowner was randomly targeted.

'We're definitely moving'

Several neighbors said they heard the gunshots, the station said.

""We knew exactly what it was as soon as we heard it,"" Holly Petree, who lives just a few doors away, told KCPQ. ""We jumped up and opened the curtains, and there was a man laying over there.""

Police said the wife called 911 while the husband grabbed a gun and confronted the two men and one woman who were in the yard.

The husband told police that one of the suspects approached him while carrying a handsaw — and so he fired his gun.

When officers arrived at the scene at the Beacon Hill residence, they found a 53-year-old woman with an apparent gunshot wound to the abdomen, police said.

The shot woman was taken to Harborview Medical Center for treatment, police said, adding that they also arrested a 59-year-old man at the scene.

The victims reported a possible third suspect who fled the scene on foot, police said.

And several hours after the incident, police said a man with a gunshot wound walked into a hospital in the Ballard neighborhood.

Officers began life-saving measures until emergency services arrived, but the individual was pronounced dead shortly after 9 a.m., police said.

Who was the suspected intruder?

Authorities said the intruder was a 27-year-old male from nearby Suisun City who was on parole for a violent crime in Alameda County. KTVU reported that the crime for which he was on parole was a home invasion.

""Whatever the motive was, it does not look like it was peaceful or legal,"" Fairfield Police Lt. Jausiah Jacobsen told the station. ""We know the suspect was armed with a handgun, semi-automatic with magazines. As far as I know, there was no known relationship between the homeowner[s], who are the victims here, and the suspect.""

Armed intruder tries to rob Houston rapper Bun B and his wife—but the rapper was armed as well,"Houston rapper Bun B shot and injured a home invader who tried to rob him and his wife on Tuesday evening after a brief gunfight, causing the suspect to flee, according to KHOU-TV.

Bun B, whose legal name is Bernard Freeman, came to his wife's defense after the suspect held her at gunpoint during the attempted robbery.

What happened?

At about 5:45 p.m., the suspect, Demonte Alif Jackson, showed up at the door of Bernard and his wife Queen Freeman's home. She answered, thinking it could be a delivery. Jackson pulled a gun on her and forced his way in the house.

She begged him not to kill or harm her, and surrendered car keys and other possessions in an attempt to appease Jackson. Jackson took the car keys and went to the garage.

At that point, Bernard, who had been upstairs, pursued Jackson after his wife told him he was in the garage. When he got to the garage, he saw Jackson sitting in the driver's seat of one of their vehicles.

The two men exchanged gunfire, with Freeman hitting Jackson in the shoulder. Jackson jumped out of the car and ran, but not before Freeman pulled his mask off.

Police later arrested Jackson at a nearby hospital and identified by Freeman, where he was being treated for the gunshot wound. Freeman and his wife were unharmed.

""I've had messages from the Middle East and Europe, everyone is concerned about Bun and Queen. Although they're physically fine, the wounds, emotional wounds, I can't speak to how long they'll take to heal,"" attorney Charles Adams told KHOU. ""But it is really a story of two people that truly love each other and risked their lives to save each other. And I just thank God that both of them are okay.""

Armed intruders force their way into home — but homeowner punches one out and shoots the other to death. Surviving suspect charged with murder.,"A doorbell video showed two men forcing their way into an Arlington Heights, Illinois, home at gunpoint Saturday, WGN-TV reported.

But like many other stupid criminals, they didn't count on the homeowner being up for several rounds of fisticuffs — or practicing the Second Amendment.

What happened?

Prosecutors said Bradley J. Finnan, 39, and Larry D. Brodacz, 58 — both armed with guns and after boxes containing $200,000 in cash that Brodacz claimed he saw in the home 20 years ago — were captured on a Ring doorbell security camera as they approached the home just before 2 p.m., the Daily Herald reported.

Brodacz noticed the Ring camera and told Finnan to not look at it, prosecutors told the paper, adding that Brodacz rang the doorbell and forced his way inside after a male homeowner — expecting landscapers — answered. Finnan carried a bag containing zip ties and a blowtorch and followed inside, the Daily Herald said.

Yelling and commotion followed, the paper said, and then the homeowner was seen on video chasing Finnan from the house and punching him repeatedly.

As he fled, Finnan's identity was revealed when his mask slipped, prosecutors told the Daily Herald.



Things get more terrifying

Meanwhile, as the homeowner's wife saw the intruders inside her house, she screamed and ran to an upstairs bedroom with the couple's children and closed the door, the paper said. And while her husband fought Finnan outside, Brodacz broke the bedroom door, pushed the children onto the bed, and pointed his gun at the woman who pleaded with him not to shoot, prosecutors told the Daily Herald.

Once the homeowner was done beating on Finnan, he returned inside and was retrieving a handgun from the home's master bedroom when he was struck in the back of the head, the paper said.

During a struggle, the homeowner fired a shot at Brodacz but missed, and then the pair bit each other, prosecutors told the Daily Herald. Then Brodacz took a knife from his waistband and approached the homeowner — and fearing for his life and the lives of his family members, he fatally shot Brodacz in the stomach, prosecutors added to the paper.

More from the Daily Herald:

Arlington Heights police arrived and entered the home as the male homeowner, bleeding from a head wound and carrying his gun, walked down from the second story and told them he had shot the offender, prosecutors say.



Police recovered two bullet cartridges, Brodacz's knife and his .25-caliber semi-automatic handgun loaded with seven rounds, authorities said. They also recovered the bag Finnan carried and other items.



At about 1 a.m. Sunday, Buffalo Grove police received a missing-person report about a man whose description matched that of Brodacz. After interviewing one of his family members, police identified him from his driver's license.



Video surveillance from a Crystal Lake Metra station showed Finnan driving Brodacz's car to the station and removing bags from the trunk at about 9:23 p.m. Saturday. Early Sunday, police located him at his mother's Rockford home.

The family did not know either man, police told the paper.

Finnan charged with murder

The Daily Herald said Finnan is charged with murder under a statute that allows a defendant to be so charged if the accused takes part in felony offenses that lead to another's death — even if the defendant wasn't directly involved in the killing.

He's also charged with home invasion and is being held without bail, the paper said. Finnan could face a life sentence if convicted, the paper said, adding that April 21 is his next scheduled court appearance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-intruders-force-their-way-into-home-but-homeowner-punches-one-out-and-shoots-the-other-to-death-surviving-suspect-charged-with-murder,2020-04-08
"Six armed intruders break into home after midnight — but resident grabs own gun, blows one of them away, and the rest take off running","The resident of an Oceanside, California, home was badly outnumbered when an armed group broke in after midnight last week as part of an attempted robbery.

But this particular resident also was armed — and foiled the crooks' plan after pulling the trigger with deadly accuracy.

What happened?

Oceanside officers were called to the home on Moonstone Bay Drive near Marblehead Bay Drive just after 1:15 a.m. and determined that the resident ""retrieved a gun and shot at the suspects,"" hitting at least one of them, police spokesperson Jennifer Atenza told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The suspected group consisted of five men and one woman, the paper said.

""The resident reached for the firearm and then shots were fired,"" Atenza added to the Union-Tribune. ""We know that at least one of the suspects was armed and returned fire.""

The crooks took off and left behind their shot comrade, police told KSWB-TV, adding that despite the administration of medical aid, the shot suspect — a 31-year-old man whose name has not been released — was pronounced dead in the home.

The resident was not injured, the Union-Tribune said.

Vehicle pulled over

Other responding officers pulled over a vehicle nearby containing several people, and one of them — a 29-year-old man — had been shot, the paper said, adding that he was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition.

""It is unknown at this time if this same resident shot the second suspect, who is currently in the hospital, or if this suspect was shot by one of the other suspects who were also armed with a gun,"" Atenza added to the Union-Tribune.

Police said they arrested five people on suspicion of murder and robbery: Deshawn Ingram, 29, of Oceanside; Eric Dunnigan, 21, of Vista; Michael Simmons, 21, of San Diego; Jaylen Harvey, 24, of Oceanside; and Sydni Tucker, 25, of Oceanside, the paper said.

Murder charges pursued against all five suspects

Atenza added to KSWB that even though no one in the group is suspected of shooting the suspect who died, the San Diego County District Attorney's office was pursuing murder charges against them since the suspect died in commission of a felony that the group was involved in.

Ingram — the second shot suspect — was already convicted of a recent assault with a deadly weapon and had been out on bail while awaiting his sentence, police added to the station.

The resident is not suspected of a crime, officials added to KSWB.

Atenza didn't know how many weapons police seized or if anyone else was home at the time of the incident, the station said, adding that no information about the resident was released.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-intruders-resident-grabs-own-gun-blows-one-away-rest-take-off,2021-11-15
"Armed invaders forced their way into a Philadelphia man's home, but then the homeowner's dogs stepped in","According to multiple reports, armed home invaders attempted to break into a man's house in the Fairhill section of Philadelphia on Thursday night. The invaders clearly had deadly intent, as one of them even shot the homeowner in the leg.

That's when the homeowner's three pit bulls stepped in, and likely saved the homeowner's life.

According to WTXF-TV, the incident occurred on the 2000 block of North Reese Street just after 8:30pm on Thursday. According to police, two armed suspects attempted to enter a home. Police did not clarify whether they believed that the men had intent to rob the home or if they were there for another purpose.

However, according to WPVI-TV, the man clearly did not want these two men in his home, as he confronted them, with the aid of his three pit bulls. One of the suspects shot the homeowner in the leg and fled, but the man and his pit bulls tenaciously fought and held on to the other suspect until police arrived and took him into custody.

The homeowner was taken to a Philadelphia hospital where he is listed as in stable condition and is expected to recover. The suspect who was detained by the dogs (and ultimately the police) was also hospitalized for bite wounds he received from the homeowner's dogs.

One suspect remains at large, and Philadelphia police are asking anyone who might have information leading to his arrest to call 215-686-TIPS.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-invaders-forced-their-way-into-a-philadelphia-mans-home-but-then-the-homeowners-dogs-stepped-in,2019-09-21

The rest of the story



Witnesses said the intruder was the ex-boyfriend of a woman who was inside the home, WJBK-TV reported.

""He [was] out to kill. He didn't care,"" a female resident who didn't want to be identified told WJBK, which added the suspect allegedly forced his way into the home.

""He pushed my granddaughter who answered the door,"" the anonymous female added to WJBK. ""He literally shoved her.""

This woman who spoke to the station said she doesn't know the suspect's name but that he was her daughter's ex-boyfriend.

""He was seeing my daughter, but he beat her ... and she took off because he said he was going to kill her,"" the tearful woman told WJBK.

The woman also told the station the suspect pointed a gun at her and told her if she didn't call her daughter, he'd kill her — and that he also allegedly pointed the gun at other family members.

""He shot at my son-in-law from what I understand,"" the woman added to WJBK. ""He shot at him twice.""

"Armed men break into home, demand cash, pistol whip male who won't comply. Then female resident grabs her gun and turns the tables.","A trio of men wearing hoodies and armed with guns forced their way into a home in Monroe, Louisiana, around 10 p.m. Oct. 11 and demanded money, the Monroe News-Star said, citing a police report.

What happened next?

A male in the residence refused to comply with their demands and yelled several times for the female resident, who had fallen asleep, the paper said. The male was struck in the head several times with a gun, the News-Star said.

When the woman woke up, she said she knew something was wrong and grabbed her gun from underneath the mattress, the paper said.

She saw the male resident fighting with with two unknown armed men, the News-Star said, adding that one was wearing a light gray hoodie and the other was wearing a dark hoodie and light blue jeans — and that the latter assailant pointed a gun at her.

With that, the woman fired multiple rounds and heard one man say, ""Aw, she shot me,"" the paper said.

The woman said a third man was standing at the front doorway and appeared to be in shock, the News-Star reported, adding that all three ran off, got into a silver Nissan Altima, and drove away.

The jig is up

Then around 10:25 p.m., St. Francis Medical Center told Monroe police a shooting victim had arrived, the paper said.

Emergency room staff informed officers that 19-year-old Jeffrey W. Williams Jr. told them he was hanging out with friends when someone drove by shooting at them, the News-Star noted.

But police noticed that Williams' clothes matched the description from the home invasion, the paper said. And once officers began interviewing him, Williams told them he and another man entered the home and demanded money at gunpoint, the News-Star reported.

He said when the woman came into the living room, she fired two or three shots at them, the paper said — and he noticed he was shot in the abdomen as he fled the residence.

The man who forced his way into the home with Williams reportedly drove him to the hospital and dropped him off at the emergency room, the News-Star said.

Williams said he doesn't know the third man's name, only that he lives in West Monroe, the paper said.

Green Bay Police Interim Chief Jim Runge told the station the intruder was not able to gain entry to the residence in question through the front door.

And then as officers were arriving at the scene of the complaint, another call came in about a shooting at a home around the corner, WFRV noted.

What happened?

The station said the suspect broke into a duplex in the 1000 block of Laverne Drive through the back door — and was soon greeted by the resident.

And the resident didn't show up empty-handed.

Like a growing number of people around the country, the resident had prepared for just such an encounter by exercising his Second Amendment rights and arming himself.

So the intruder found himself staring down the barrel of a handgun, WFRV said.

But the sight of the lethal weapon apparently didn't deter the intruder. Authorities told the station the suspect aggressively approached the resident and tried to grab the gun out of his hand.

With that, the resident fired one round and hit the suspect in the leg, WFRV said.

Authorities arriving at the scene found the shot suspect, who was then taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, the station said.

Police told WFRV the intruder could have been under the influence of drugs and that the suspect's motivation was not clear.

Groups urge Biden to use Defense Production Act to push green energy,"As Americans face rapidly surging fuel prices, a coalition of groups is calling for President Biden to use the Defense Production Act to push a transition to green energy. They are also calling for the president to reject calls to ramp up America's fossil fuel production.

Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA, Islamic Society of North America, and Our Revolution are just a few of the many groups that joined together in the message to Biden.

The groups expressed support for the president's recent move to ban Russian oil.

""We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and we want to thank you for halting oil imports from Russia. We urge you to continue to resist short-sighted policies such as scaling up domestic fossil fuel production or expanding oil and gas infrastructure or financing, which would only deepen our dependence on fuels that lead to global instability and drive further devastating climate impacts. Instead, we are calling on you to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to ramp up the deployment of renewable energy to transition the world off fossil fuels,"" the groups declared.

While Americans were already facing elevated gas prices, fuel costs have recently spiked dramatically, and the situation could get even worse.

President Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order banning the importation of Russian oil into the U.S., a move meant to squeeze Russia as it perpetrates a destructive and deadly invasion in Ukraine. The order specifically prohibits importing ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.

""We urge you to utilize the Defense Production Act to ramp up the deployment of renewable energy to transition the world off fossil fuels and generate millions of good quality, union jobs,"" the groups declared in their message to President Biden. ""The DPA – which you have already used to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to wildfires – provides you with the historic opportunity to produce alternatives to fossil fuels, fight the climate emergency, combat Putin’s stranglehold on the world’s energy economy, and support the transition to a renewable and just economy.""

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Wednesday that, ""we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/as-americans-face-skyrocketing-gas-prices-groups-urge-biden-to-push-for-green-energy-and-reject-calls-to-ramp-up-fossil-fuel-production,2022-03-10
"'Asian carp' renamed over racism concerns: 'If you say it's invasive, bad, and needs to be eradicated ... that's why there's talk about cultural insensitivity.'","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service quietly renamed the Asian Carp to ""invasive carp"" due to concerns about racism, the Associated Press revealed in a Thursday report.



The carp was brought from Asia to North America in the 1970s to eat algae, parasites, and weeds in aquaculture ponds. The news agency reported, however, that the invasive species became a problem after natural flooding and inadvertent releases allowed the breed to escape into the Mississippi River and other waterways. Officials worry that the species could escape to the Great Lakes, jeopardizing their $7 billion sport fishery.

The service made the change in April.

What are the details?

Charlie Wooley, director of the Great Lakes Regional Office for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told the outlet that the department wanted to ""move away from any terms"" that may ""cast Asian culture and people in a negative light.""

Wooley added that the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee will follow suit as of Aug. 2.

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Foung Hawj told the Associated Press that he was ""never a fan of the 'Asian carp' label,"" and along with fellow Minnesota Democratic Sen. John Hoffman in 2014 were successfully able to change the name to ""invasive carp"" within Minnesota agencies.

Hawj told the news agency that he long had taken issue with the name, but ""the last straw"" came when a group of Asian visitors arrived at a Minneapolis airport only to be met with signs that read ""Kill Asian Carp.""

Song Qian, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Toledo, said that carp is valued in a wide variety of Asian countries and is a good-luck symbol in all of China.

""If you say it's invasive, bad, and needs to be eradicated, even though it's because of miscommunication, that's why there's talk about cultural insensitivity,"" Qian explained.

Kevin Irons, assistant fisheries chief with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, says that the word ""carp"" is a ""four-letter word in this country.""

The report added that the state of Illinois along with partner agencies hope to market the fish — typically known as bottom-feeders — as ""sustainably wild, surprisingly delicious"" in a campaign to market the fish to consumers. The fish, they say, is ""high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids"" and ""low in mercury and other contaminants.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/asian-carp-set-to-be-renamed-over-racism-concerns,2021-07-19
Associated Press tells reporters not to say 'crisis' — but had no problem using word when Trump was president,"The Associated Press — one of the largest journalism organizations in the world — released guidance last week restricting employees from using the word ""crisis"" when referring to the ongoing border crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

But, as it turned out, the Associated Press found the word completely acceptable when Donald Trump was president.

What did the AP say?

President Joe Biden, his administration, and top Democrats have refused to acknowledge the migrant crisis unfolding at the southern border as that — a ""crisis.""

The Associated Press revealed Friday they agree with Biden's White House.

AP Vice President and Editor-at-Large for Standards John Daniszewski explained in a memo that reporters should use ""accurate and neutral language"" when describing the immigration crisis — and that means not calling it a ""crisis.""

According to Daniszewski, the magnifying crisis at the border does not fit the definition of a ""crisis.""

The current event in the news — a sharp increase in the arrival of unaccompanied minors — is a problem for border officials, a political challenge for Biden and a dire situation for many migrants who make the journey, but it does not fit the classic dictionary definition of a crisis, which is: ""A turning point in the course of anything; decisive or crucial time, stage, or event,"" OR ""a time of, or a state of affairs involving, great danger or trouble, often one which threatens to result in unpleasant consequences [an economic crisis].""



Therefore, we should avoid, or at the least, be highly cautious, about referring to the present situation as a crisis on our own, although we may quote others using that language.



If using the word ""crisis,"" we need to ask of what and to whom. There could be a humanitarian crisis if the numbers grow so large that officials cannot house the migrants safely or in sanitary conditions. Migrants may face humanitarian crises in their home countries. In theory, there could be a security or a border crisis if officials lose control of the border, allowing people to enter unencumbered in large numbers. But, in general, avoid hyperbole in calling anything a crisis or an emergency.

Daniszewski added that reporters should ""avoid imagery conjuring war or natural disaster, which could portray migrants as a negative, harmful influence.""

""Avoid emotive words like onslaught, tidal wave, flood, inundation, surge, invasion, army, march, sneak and stealth,"" Daniszewski instructed.

What did the AP write under Trump?

The AP freely used the word ""crisis"" to describe migrant surges during the Trump administration.

July 2018 : ""Judge puts blame on Trump, Congress for immigration crisis""

: ""Judge puts blame on Trump, Congress for immigration crisis"" June 2019 : ""House passes emergency funding bill for migrant care crisis""

: ""House passes emergency funding bill for migrant care crisis"" October 2019 : ""Immigration official says US-Mexico border crisis not over""

: ""Immigration official says US-Mexico border crisis not over"" June 2018: ""Ivanka Trump stayed silent for days as border crisis mounted""

Despite reluctance to describe the border crisis as such, Border Patrol data clearly show a migrant crisis is unfolding.

In fact, the Border Patrol is on track to break the record of immigrant encounters set during the Trump administration.

""The U.S. Border Patrol has encountered an average of 5,000 undocumented immigrants per day over the past 30 days, according to a senior Border Patrol official who spoke to reporters on Friday, putting the U.S. on track to outpace the Trump administration's monthly record of border crossings,"" NBC News reported. ""In May 2019, more than 144,000 undocumented immigrants were encountered by the Border Patrol, marking a 12-year high. March is likely to surpass that, reaching 150,000 crossings per month — meaning apprehensions plus crossings at legal ports of entry without paperwork.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/associated-press-tells-reporters-not-to-say-crisis,2021-03-28
Attention pregnant women: FDA warns that prenatal screening tests may have false results,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that common blood tests used to screen pregnant women for signs of genetic abnormalities in their pre-born babies run the risk of giving false results.

On Tuesday, the FDA put out a safety communication advising expecting parents that genetic non-invasive prenatal screening tests, sometimes called non-invasive prenatal testing or tests, or NIPTs, have not been authorized or approved by the agency. The agency said that women have chosen to kill their unborn children based on the results of these tests, which run the risk of false-positives.

NIPTs are blood tests done to screen an unborn child for genetic conditions that could result in that child being born with serious health problems. The FDA warns that the accuracy and performance of these widely used tests has not been evaluated by regulators and that false results could lead parents to believe their unborn babies have a genetic disorder when they do not.

""The FDA is aware of reports that patients and health care providers have made critical health care decisions based on results from these screening tests alone and without additional confirmatory testing,"" the agency said. ""Specifically, pregnant people have ended pregnancies based only on the results of NIPS tests.""



The FDA strongly emphasized that there is a distinction between screening, which evaluates the risk of a child having certain genetic abnormalities, and diagnosis, which confirms or rules out disease.

""Without confirming the results with a diagnostic test, there is no way to know whether the fetus actually had the genetic abnormality reported by the screening test,"" the FDA said, adding that there have been cases where a follow-up diagnostic test after a positive screening test found that the unborn child was actually healthy.

Prenatal screening tests available today are categorized as laboratory developed tests, which are not subject to review by the FDA. The New York Times reported in January that more than a third of pregnant women in America have sought the services of NIPT providers. The report revealed that as many as 80% of the screening results for rare genetic conditions were false positives, which led some women to consider seeking abortions when they had healthy babies.

The FDA said that companies offering prenatal screening market the tests as ""reliable"" and ""highly accurate"" so that expecting parents can have ""peace of mind."" But these claims are not based in ""sound science,"" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.



“Without proper understanding of how these tests should be used, people may make inappropriate health care decisions regarding their pregnancy. We strongly urge patients to discuss the benefits and risks of these tests with a genetic counselor or other health care provider prior to making decisions based on the results of these tests,” he said.

Congress is working with the FDA on bipartisan legislation that would give the agency regulatory power over the safety and efficacy of genetic testing and also over how the tests are marketed to patients.

Australia testing 'Orwellian' quarantine app that dispatches police if users don't verify location within 15 minutes,"A state in Australia is testing a new app that would help the government track residents to ensure they are obeying COVID-19 quarantine orders.

The government of South Australia has begun a trial of the Home Quarantine SA, an app that The Atlantic calls ""as Orwellian as any in the free world.""

Australians will download an app on their cellphone that features facial recognition and geolocation. The South Australian government will randomly contact the user to check if they are at their approved quarantine location. Users will have 15 minutes to take a photo of their face. If the quarantining individual fails to reply within 15 minutes, a police officer will be sent to ""check"" on the person.

""Home Quarantine SA uses geolocation and live face recognition check-ins as a key component of ensuring your safety, as well as the safety of the community,"" the government of South Australia website states. ""The check-ins are on a randomized schedule and confirm that you are at your approved address and ensures you are compliant with your home quarantine direction.""

""The app performs several geolocation and live face recognition check-ins at random intervals each day and you will have 15 minutes to respond,"" the website reads. ""If you miss the notification and the phone call, a compliance officer may visit the approved address to check you are safe and compliant with your direction.""

""If a person cannot successfully verify their location or identity when requested, SA Health will notify SA Police who will conduct an in-person check on the person in quarantine,"" the Australian Broadcast Company reported.

""Home Quarantine SA is voluntary at this time,"" the government notes.

Premier Steven Marshall touted the invasive app, ""I think every South Australian should feel pretty proud that we are the national pilot for the home-based quarantine app.""



Marshall said the pilot program began with about 50 people, but he hoped the trial would be expanded to international travelers in ""subsequent weeks.""

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald commented on the quarantine app, ""No matter your views of COVID, what's happening in Australia is alarming, extreme and dangerous.""

Australia already has some of the most stringent lockdowns in the world.

In New South Wales, individuals who break lockdown orders face a maximum penalty of A$11,000 ($7,840), or imprisonment for 6 months, or both, and another A$5,500 ($3,920) penalty ""may apply for each day the offense continues.""

Last week, the Queensland government announced that it was building a regional COVID-19 quarantine facility that will have 1,000 beds by the end of the first quarter of 2022.



In July, about 300 Australian army personnel were deployed in Sydney to enforce coronavirus lockdown orders, even going door-to-door to ensure COVID-positive Australians are quarantining.

Last month, there were massive protests, which at times became violent, against the draconian COVID-19 lockdowns in the Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/australia-home-quarantine-app,2021-09-02
The Australian government is killing millions of cats — here's why,"Australia has had it with invasive feral cats killing the country's native species. So, the government is in the thick of a full-scale plan to get rid of the pests, enlisting the help of farmers and hunters to help eradicate millions of unwelcome felines despite accusations that they're carrying out ""genocide"" against the creatures.

What are the details?

In 2015, Australia declared open season on feral cats after discovering they were responsible for the extinction of at least 27 indigenous species, USA Today reported. The goal was to send 2 million of an estimated 20 million wild cats to the grave over the course of five years.

Officials received some pushback when the plan was announced, with cat lovers at home and abroad protesting the decision. Actress Brigitte Bardot wrote a letter to the environmental minister, declaring the culling as inhumane ""animal genocide.""

But cats aren't native to Australia, and their presence in the ecosystem has led to the decimation of several mammal species that are — or were — unequipped to survive against the predators. According to Queensland veterinarian Katria Lovell, the public recognizes the destruction wild cats have caused.

""Australians have a huge appreciation for our natural fauna,"" Lovell told The New York Times. ""Most people have empathy with the fact that there is all this wildlife being killed and it is taking its toll on the environment, so I think there is a general feeling that something has to be done.

On Thursday, the Times reported on the progress of the mission, detailing the methods used for trapping, hunting, and poisoning the foreign invaders. The paper noted that not only has the country embraced the idea that feral cats are ""killers,"" even PETA Australia ""in principle recognized that feral cats hunted wildlife to a point at which species can no longer survive.""

While scientists lead the charge from the government side, private citizens are handling most of the problem: farmers and shooters offed 83 percent of the feral cats killed in the first year of the eradication effort, according to federal data.

Anything else?

The Daily Caller reported that feral cats aren't just a problem in Australia, citing a study that claims the predators have been linked to the extinction of more than 60 unique species worldwide over the past 500 years.

Correction: A previous version of this article stated that PETA has turned a blind eye to Australia's feral cat culling. The organization disputes that claim, and has a published stance calling for either mass sterilization of the cats, or trapping ""if necessary"" to have them humanely euthanized.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/australia-is-killing-millions-of-feral-cats-despite-accusations-of-genocide,2019-04-26
Authorities arrest Maryland mayor on charges of distributing at least 50 images of revenge porn,"Police arrested Andrew Bradshaw — Mayor of Cambridge, Maryland — on Monday and charged him with 50 counts of distributing revenge pornography.



WBAL-TV reported that the state's Revenge Porn Statute ""prohibits the nonconsensual distribution of a private visual representation of another which exposes their intimate body parts or displays them engaged in sexual activity, with the intent to harm, harass, intimidate, threaten or coerce the person depicted.""

What are the details?

Charging documents, which were filed in the Dorchester County Circuit Court on Monday morning, alleged that Bradshaw ""created multiple accounts on the public internet forum Reddit"" in order to share nude photographs of a person with whom he had previously engaged in a sexual relationship.

WJZ-TV reported that Bradshaw is accused of publishing the name and birthdate of the victim and shared the photos to forums ""related to sex, humiliation, degradation, and race.""

The charging document further alleged that Bradshaw digitally shared the images without the knowledge or consent of his purported victim and with the intent to harm her.

According to a report from MyEasternShoreMD, Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton Howard said that his office is dedicated to the victims of those people who abuse positions of power.

Howard said that Bradshaw is accused of sharing the photos of the unnamed victim, captioned with ""racial slurs and sexually explicit language.""

""Using someone's private images without their consent is a serious breach of trust and invasion of privacy, and the power and breadth of the internet makes such a violation even more egregious,"" Howard said in a release on Bradshaw's arrest. ""Our office is committed to protecting victims from those who abuse their positions of power and trust.""

If convicted on all charges, Bradshaw could face a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine for each count of distributing revenge pornography.

The City of Cambridge's website states that Bradshaw — a lifelong resident of the area — took office in January, making him the youngest mayor in the city's history.

Authorities intercept suitcase containing dead birds from China at DC-area airport,"Airport authorities at Dulles International Airport in Sterling, Virginia, discovered a suitcase on Jan. 27 containing dead birds from China.

A package inside the suitcase read ""cat food.""

What are the details?

According to WTHR-TV, the suitcase contained dozens of dead birds of an unknown variety ranging in size from 2.5 to 3.5 inches in length.

The suitcase belonged to a traveler from Beijing. Authorities say that the traveler's final destination was a residence in Prince George's County, Maryland. The traveler insisted that the birds were to be pet food.

Casey Durst, director of field operations for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Baltimore field office, said that such items are prohibited due to the risk of avian influenza.

""These dead birds are prohibited from importation to the United States as unprocessed birds pose a potentially significant disease threat to our nation's poultry industries and more alarmingly to our citizens as potential vectors of avian influenza,"" Durst said in a statement. ""Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists continue to exercise extraordinary vigilance every day in their fight to protect our nation's agricultural and economic prosperity from invasive pests and animal diseases.""

A tweet from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, ""@CBP agriculture specialists at Dulles airport continue to protect our nation's vital agricultural resources and our economy by intercepting potential animal threats, like those posed by these tiny dead birds from China packaged as 'pet food.'""

""They have extensive training and experience in the biological sciences and agricultural inspection, inspect tens of thousands of international air passengers, and air and sea cargoes nationally being imported to the United States.""

Authorities use Google's location history to place a Virginia man near the scene of a federal bank robbery – sentenced to 12 years in prison,"In 2019, police used a broad search warrant to collect the location history of 19 cell phones near the scene of a federal bank robbery in Virginia. Okello Chatrie was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Wednesday based on location data evidence gathered from his phone, the Associated Press reported.



Call Federal Credit Union in Midlothian, Virginia, was robbed in May 2019. The suspect passed ""a threatening note"" to the teller demanding money. He pulled out a gun and forced the workers to get on the floor. The suspect stole their phones and placed $195,000 in his backpack.

Authorities requested a court-ordered geofence warrant to help find the suspect. This warrant allowed them to collect location data from Google for any phone in the area within a specific timeframe.

Last year, Google released a report detailing how many location-related search warrants it had received, TechCrunch reported.

Google's report stated, ""Since the start of 2018, we have seen a rise in the number of search warrants in the United States that order Google to identify users, based on their Location History information, who may have been in a given area within a certain timeframe. These so-called 'geofence' warrants are one subcategory of the total search warrant requests we share in our User Data Requests Transparency Report.""

In 2018, Google received 982 geofence warrants. By 2020, the number of location data warrants Google received jumped to 11,554.



A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch, ""We vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. We developed a process specifically for these requests that is designed to honor our legal obligations while narrowing the scope of data disclosed.""

While police have been granted geofence warrants for years, Chatrie's lawyers are pushing back on the legality of the searches. They argued that these invasive warrants violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. His lawyers stated, ""It is the digital equivalent of searching every home in the neighborhood of a reported burglary, or searching the bags of every person walking along Broadway because of a theft in Times Square.""

U.S. District Judge Hannah Lauck agreed that the warrant violated Chatrie's rights and the rights of the innocent parties whose data was also collected. However, Lauck denied Chatrie's motion to throw out the location data evidence. Instead, the judge found that the authorities acted in good faith and followed set procedures.

Federal prosecutors argued that Chatrie forfeited any expectation of privacy when he opted into the location tracking feature on Google.

Lauck's ruling about the unconstitutional nature of geofence warrants has some privacy advocates hopeful that changes to the law may be coming.

Ax-wielding man busts through back door of home where mom is with her kids. Unfortunately for him she's an armed off-duty sheriff's deputy.,"An ax-wielding man was on a bit of a rampage Tuesday afternoon in Apopka, Florida, attempting to break into multiple homes, WESH-TV reported.

Finally he arrived at a home on Yvonne Street around 5:30 p.m. and used the ax to smash through the back door, authorities told the station.

What happened next?

Inside the residence were children and their mother, WESH said — but this mom also happens to be an Orange County Sheriff's deputy.

Fearing for her life and for the lives of her kids, the off-duty deputy shot the intruder multiple times in the lower half of his body — but he still got inside, the station said.

The intruder wrestled with the deputy — but the two-year vet got the upper hand and managed to handcuff the suspect, WESH reported.

When more deputies arrived at the scene, they used tourniquets to stop the intruder's bleeding, the station said, adding that it was the first time the deputy used her department-issued gun.

Orange County Sheriff John Mina added to reporters that the deputy has been ""trained to react to something like this, but we don't expect that in our own home.""

Authorities identified the suspect as 40-year-old Steven Thayer, WKMG-TV reported, adding that he's was in stable condition and faces charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and armed burglary of an occupied dwelling with a deadly weapon.

""This could happen to anyone, but our deputies are trained to protect ourselves, protect our communities, and this person broke into a deputy's home with an ax — and who knows what his intentions were — but anyone like that is going to be met with lethal force by our deputies, and I think she did a great job,"" Mina told WKMG.

Belarus is preparing to invade Ukraine and provide support to its Russian allies,"Belarus is preparing to deploy troops into Ukraine in support of the country’s Russian allies.

A Biden administration official said that Belarusian leadership could order the deployment of forces into Ukraine as early as Monday, the Washington Post reported.

The official said, “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.”

The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russian troops to conduct military drills and store supplies within his country.

On Saturday, Ukrainian and Russian leadership agreed to hold peace talks along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. Lukashenko’s planned invasion of Ukraine will, naturally, complicate these planned talks.

The Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, recently called for sanctions against Lukashenko and the Belarusian regime.



Newsweek reported that Tsikhanouskaya referred to them as “accomplices of Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian government official told CNN that the Ukrainian government had intelligence indicating that Belarus is ready “to maybe participate directly” in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The official said that the Belarusian government is allowing Russia to use Belarus to enter Ukraine, “in addition to allowing Russians to use their territory as well as letting them cross the border.”

However, as of now, according to a senior U.S. defense official, the American government has not seen Belarusian troops “being readied to move into Ukraine” or “that they are moving or are in Ukraine.”

Anticipating Belarus’ participation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration suspended all operations in the American embassy in Belarus.

The State Department also encouraged non-emergency employees and family members of American diplomats to vacate the U.S. embassy in Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “The U.S. Department of State has suspended operations at our Embassy in Minsk, Belarus and authorized the voluntary departure (‘authorized departure’) of non-emergency employees and family members at our Embassy in Moscow, Russia. We took these steps due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine.”

Over the weekend, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensified as Russian officials threatened to drop the International Space Station on the United States and its allies and Putin ordered the Russian military to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed rhetoric and posturing from NATO allies and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/belarus-is-preparing-to-invade-ukraine-and-provide-support-to-its-russian-allies,2022-02-28
"Benjamin Netanyahu warns of new 'pernicious' form of antisemitism, reveals behind-the-scene details of Middle East peace deals with Donald Trump, being 'disrespected' by Barack Obama in wide-ranging G","Israel Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu touched on several important topics in a new interview with Glenn Beck. Netanyahu warned there is a new ""pernicious"" form of antisemitism, gave behind-the-scene details of the Middle East accords, spoke on the dangers of Iran, and revealed how he plans to deal with the Russian invasion of Ukraine when he returns to power in Israel.

Netanyahu warns of a new kind of antisemitism

With the current controversies surrounding NBA player Kyrie Irving and rapper Kanye West making headlines, Beck told Netanyahu, ""People don't seem to know what an antisemite is."" He then asked Netanyahu to define what an antisemite is.

""Well, I think it's the opposition to Jews period as a collective body and desire to do away with Jewish people,"" Netanyahu said. ""The culmination of that is obviously Hitler, but there are men who have been smaller Hitlers in history, who don't care about individual Jews, they don't differentiate. Antisemites are just anti-Jews.""

He added, ""But I would say that antisemitism today, has taken on a pernicious new form because you know it's not fashionable to say you're an antisemite.""

Beck chimed in, ""If you know anything about Israel, the point of Israel is so they can live, so you could just live.""

Netanyahu replied, ""The real purpose of the Jewish state is, first of all, to defend the lives of Jews who are subjected to this unforgiving and undiscerning hate.""

""We paid a horrendous price of massacres and displacements and exiles and pogroms and murder and ultimately Holocaust,"" he continued. ""If Israel wasn't strong, we would have been destroyed many times over.""



Netanyahu on being 'mistreated and disrespected' by Barack Obama

Netanyahu was promoting his new memoir titled ""Bibi: My Story.""

In the book, the former Israeli prime minister revealed that he was ""mistreated and disrespected"" by Barack Obama when he was president.

Netanyahu said Obama ""took the gloves off"" during their first White House meeting in 2009.

""With staff present, he made it clear that the U.S. would not tolerate further stalling or obstructions in the peace process, leaving no doubt which party he thought was responsible for such things,"" Netanyahu wrote in his new memoir.



The Times of Israel reported, ""Netanyahu says he felt the president engaged in 'a premeditated shock-and-awe' effort to make clear that past pressures on Israeli leaders on issues pertaining to the Middle East conflict 'would pale in comparison to the ones that would be applied to me.'""

""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood,"" the book read.



Obama allegedly instructed Netanyahu in private, ""I expect you to immediately freeze all construction in the areas beyond the 1967 borders. Not one brick!""

Obama then purportedly boasted, ""You know, people often underestimate me. But I come from Chicago, where I had to deal with tough opponents.""

Without providing much detail, Netanyahu said, ""He then said something out of character that shocked me deeply,"" only cryptically describing the message as ""unmistakable,"" ""offensive,"" and ""highly disturbing.""

The memoir stated, ""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood. It was this sense that the elected leader of a proud four-thousand-year-old nation was being mistreated and disrespected that got me back on my feet. 'Mr. President,' I said slowly, 'I'm sure that you mean what you said. But I am the prime minister of Israel, and I’ll do whatever I need to do to defend my country.'""

Beck asked Netanyahu to elaborate on how Obama ""mistreated and disrespected"" him, but he said he'll save that antidote for a second book.

Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel

Then-President Donald Trump allegedly asked to speak to Netanyahu about the potential threats of violence if the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Netanyahu told Trump, ""I said, 'Look, I don't see it and my intel guys tell me the same thing, but I'll tell you if there is a danger, it'll be directed first against us, and we're willing to you know, take the brunt of any attack, but frankly I just don't see it.'""

""Anyway he decided luckily or gratefully that he would declare Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of course nothing of the kind that was described happened,"" he said.

Netanyahu said the move was a ""great moment,"" and Trump ""punctured this myth and frankly finally punctured this lie"" that Jerusalem couldn't be recognized as the capital of Israel.

How Netanyahu and Trump helped bring peace to the Middle East

Netanyahu said that he approached Trump with four peace treaties ""ready for the taking.""

""I suggested that he come with an aircraft carrier to the Red Sea in the Middle East, invite me and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and others,"" he said.

Netanyahu said Trump was ""not convinced initially,"" but Trump came around after a few years.

Netanyahu said the American contribution to the peace deals was ""essential,"" ""stellar, and important to finish seal the deal.""

The incoming Israeli prime minister said, ""More will be coming.""

Netanyahu on the global dangers of the war in Ukraine

Netanyahu told Beck about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""Well I think everybody sees that something could unravel and if it unravels it could go to a place that could jeopardize the peace of the world in an unprecedented way, really especially the slippery slope of tactical nuclear weapons and so on so.""

Israel's relationship with Russia

Netanyahu said Russia's alliance with Turkey and Iran is ""not good,"" but said Israel's relationship with Russia has ""actually changed"" and ""in many ways for the better.""

""We have a complex relationship, a nuanced relationship with Russia, yet what I said before – this question of the possible unraveling of Ukraine into a global catastrophe – is something that should occupy every leader and anybody who can contribute to preventing this or somehow ending this tragedy should do so,"" he declared.

How to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear threat

Regarding Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, Netanyahu stressed, ""The only way you could stop Iran from becoming nuclear is through crippling economic sanctions coupled with a credible military threat. If you don't have that no deal that you sign we sign – which they'll violate promptly – will make any difference we talk about.""

How America and Israel are similar

Netanyahu remarked, ""I think that the case of America and Israel, we were both founded on an ideal. Our idea was to return to the promised land, and your idea was to create a new promised land of liberty.""

Speaking to ""60 Minutes"" for the first time in his presidency, Biden told host Scott Pelley, ""The pandemic is over.""

""We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lot of work on it ... but the pandemic is over,"" President Biden said. ""If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.""



According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current 7-day moving average of daily new cases is 59,856 as of Sept. 14, 2022. The current 7-day average of daily new cases is similar to the numbers in late April and in July 2021 – when there were many COVID-19 restrictions still in place across the country.

In December 2021, Biden raised the alarm for unvaccinated Americans.

""We are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated, for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they'll soon overwhelm,"" Biden fearmongered.



Pelley asked Biden, ""Mr. President, as you know, last Tuesday the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%. The stock market nosedived. People are shocked by their grocery bills. What can you do better and faster?""

Biden replied, ""Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective. Inflation rate month to month was just – just an inch, hardly at all.""

When pressed about the 40-year-high inflation of 8.3%, Biden argued, ""No, I'm not saying it is good news. But it was 8.2% or – 8.2% before. I mean, it's not – you're ac– we act– make it sound like all of a sudden, ""My god, it went to 8.2%."" It's been–.""

Pelley asked if U.S. military forces would defend Taiwan from an invasion by China.

Biden declared, ""Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.""

When questioned if ""U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women, would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion,"" Biden said, ""Yes.""

Regarding aiding Ukraine during the Russian invasion, Biden declared, ""We're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help."" Biden added that the United States would provide financial aid to Ukraine for ""as long as it takes.""



Biden claimed that he had not been briefed about the alleged classified documents the FBI found at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.

""I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take,"" Biden alleged. ""I– I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.""

Biden was asked, ""Sir, are you committed to running again, or are there certain conditions that have to be right?""

President Biden said, ""Look, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden, a whole range of things come into play that I have – requirements I have to change and move and do.""

He added that because of election laws and other reasons make it ""much too early to make that kind of decision"" about running for president in 2024.

""I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job,"" he continued. ""I'm gonna do that job. And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.""

Biden admin lawyers urge Supreme Court to allow warrantless gun confiscation ahead of major case,"President Joe Biden's administration is urging the Supreme Court to impose restrictions on the Fourth Amendment protections and permit what Forbes described as ""warrantless gun confiscation.""

The news comes at the same time the White House confirmed Biden will sign an executive order on gun control.

What is the background?

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Wednesday for a case — Caniglia v. Strom — that will ultimately determine whether the ""community caretaking"" exception to the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against warrantless searches and seizures extends to private residences.

The case stems from a 2015 incident in which police deceptively seized firearms from a Rhode Island couple — Kim and Edward Caniglia — who had engaged in a heated argument. Neither Kim nor Edward were ever accused of a crime, nor was either person ever deemed to be an imminent threat to themselves or others. Police argued they seized the firearms from the couple under the ""community caretaking"" exception to the Fourth Amendment.

The exception was established by the Supreme Court in a 1973 case. According to Forbes, the exception ""was designed for cases involving impounded cars and highway safety, on the grounds that police are often called to car accidents to remove nuisances like inoperable vehicles on public roads."" The court ""went to special lengths to be clear that the community caretaking exception only extended to vehicles,"" according to Law.com, even stating there is a ""constitutional difference"" between homes and vehicles.

But in Caniglia's case, both a federal district court and the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ""community caretaking"" exception was valid.

""We hold today — as a matter of first impression in this circuit — that this measure of protection extends to police officers performing community caretaking functions on private premises (including homes),"" the appeals court ruled.

What did the Biden administration say?

Despite Caniglia's lawyers warning that extending the ""community caretaking"" exception would be an ""anathema to the Fourth Amendment,"" attorneys with Biden's Justice Department filed an amicus brief — the first one of Biden's administration — asking the Supreme Court to uphold the appeals court's ruling.

They wrote:

The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. For criminal investigations, this Court has generally incorporated the Warrant Clause into the Fourth Amendment's overarching reasonableness requirement, but it has not generally done so for searches or seizures objectively premised on justifications other than the investigation of wrongdoing. The ultimate question in this case is therefore not whether the respondent officers' actions fit within some narrow warrant exception, but instead whether those actions were reasonable. And under all of the circumstances here, they were.

The attorneys further argued that warrants should not be ""presumptively required when a government official's action is objectively grounded in a non-investigatory public interest, such as health or safety.""

If the Supreme Court rejects the lower court's ruling that the warrantless seizure was legal under the ""community caretaking"" exception, the Biden administration lawyers suggested the court uphold the ruling ""by concluding that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity.""

Anything else?

A joint amicus brief filed by the ACLU, Cato Institute, and American Conservative Union warned of the constitutional dangers that would follow if the Supreme Court extends the ""community caretaking"" exception.

""Extending the 'community caretaking' exception to warrantless searches of the home would allow police officers to bypass the Fourth Amendment's restrictions in a startling array of circumstances,"" the organizations warned.

""These are not theoretical concerns. In both state and federal courts, everything from loud music to leaky pipes have been used to justify warrantless invasion of the home. Allowing ill-defined notions of 'community caretaking' to override the Fourth Amendment is unwise, unmanageable, and unnecessary, and it opens the door to abusive police conduct, including against those who most need society's protections,"" they continued.

""[We] urge the Court to keep the 'community caretaking' exception confined to its historic, vehicle-related origins and reject a broader standard that would give police free rein to enter the home without probable cause or a warrant, whenever they think it is 'reasonable' to do so,"" they said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-lawyers-file-brief-support-warrantless-gun-confiscation,2021-03-28
Biden administration set to ban imports of Russian oil and gas,"The Biden administration plans to ban imports of oil and natural gas from Russia as soon as Tuesday.

Two people reportedly with knowledge of the matter told the Washington Post that President Joe Biden intends to punish Russia for invading Ukraine by implementing an import ban.

Biden is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning and announce “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”

These new sanctions will ban imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal, Markets Insider reported.

The administration’s decision to ban these products came after lengthy discussions with European allies. However, at this time, those European nations are not joining the United States in banning Russian energy imports with the exception of the United Kingdom, per Politico.

Western nations have been particularly hesitant to stop importing oil from Russia since Russia provides them with a substantial amount of their energy. The European Union, for instance, gets around 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Russia accounts for roughly 12% of global oil production.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned that a Western ban on Russian oil would yield “catastrophic consequences” for the global market and cause oil prices to surge beyond $300 a barrel.

Oil prices were already reaching historic highs before the White House considered barring the import of Russian energy.

Last week, crude oil futures listed prices at more than $113 per barrel. This is the highest that oil has traded since 2011.

And for the first time since 2008, the average price of gas in the U.S. is over $4 a gallon. In some states, like California, gas is well over $5 a gallon.

Despite the skyrocketing costs of energy consumption, the Biden administration is adamantly opposed to increasing domestic oil production.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki argued that instead of increasing domestic production, the U.S. should pivot away from fossil fuels altogether.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,"" Psaki said. ""Domestic production has not insulated us from the price volatility of fossil fuels or the whims of those who control them such as President Putin. Americans know that.""

The Biden administration has even floated the possibility of buying oil from countries that are openly hostile to the United States, like Iran and Venezuela, instead of increasing domestic oil production.

Senior American officials are even meeting with representatives of the Maduro regime in Venezuela to discuss the possibility of purchasing oil from the Venezuelan reserves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-set-to-ban-imports-of-russian-oil-and-gas,2022-03-08
"Biden administration set to ship 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe to protect NATO allies from Russia","The United States is preparing to deploy around 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe as Russia continues growing its military presence along the border of Ukraine.

NBC News reported that in the coming days, roughly 1,000 American soldiers who are currently stationed in Germany will be repositioned to Romania to support American forces already in the country.

John Kirby, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said that the reinforcements are part of a Stryker infantry unit that is “designed to deploy in short order and move quickly.”

Kirby stated, “This force is designed to deter aggression and enhance our defense capabilities and frontline allied states, and we expect them, as I said, to move in coming days.”

He also said that the United States will be moving an additional force of about 2,000 troops from the United States to Europe “in the next few days.” Most of these troops will be stationed in Poland.

Kirby continued, “Collectively, this force is trained and equipped for a variety of missions — to deter aggression and to reassure and to defend our allies.”

It is believed that these troop movements are “not permanent” and that the United States will reassess the situation as it continues to evolve.

Last week, President Biden committed to stationing American troops in NATO countries, saying, “I’ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe in the NATO countries in the near term.”

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “We are ready, capable, and prepared to uphold our obligation under treaty to NATO. An attack against one NATO ally is an attack against all.”

Differentiating these reinforcements from the 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” for potential military conflict with Russia by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Kirby noted that these forces “are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to maintain robust defense of our NATO allies.”

A senior official within the Biden administration said, “At the president’s direction and following Secretary [Lloyd] Austin’s recommendation, the Department of Defense will reposition certain Europe-based units further east, forward deploy additional U.S.-based units to Europe, and maintain the heightened state of readiness of response forces to meet these commitments.”

The 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” have not yet been given deployment orders.

Two weeks ago, when this decision was announced, Kirby said, “I want to reinforce that as of now, the decision has been made to put these units on high alert and higher alert only.”

Currently, Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine, and its leadership believes that its Western adversaries are not taking its demands seriously. It appears that armed conflict may occur in the near future.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-set-to-ship-3000-troops-to-eastern-europe-to-protect-nato-allies-from-russia,2022-02-02
Biden administration spent $324 million in taxpayer funds on illegal immigrants' dental and health care at holding facilities,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued its annual report last week, revealing the lengths to which the Biden administration has gone to take care of illegal immigrants who flouted American laws and stole into the nation.

The ICE Health Service Corps' operating budget in 2022 was roughly $324 million, representing an increase of $8 million over the previous year.

According to the annual ICE report, that money was spent on providing ""direct care – including medical and dental health services – to over 118,000 non-citizens housed at 19 IHSC-operated facilities throughout the United States, which exceeded 1.1 million visits over the course of the fiscal year.""

The IHSC ""also oversaw compliance with healthcare-related detention standards for more than 120,500 non-citizens housed in 163 non-IHSC-staffed facilities.""

Among these foreign nationals were illegal immigrants, 2.37 million of whom poured over the southern border last year, and nearly 500,000 of whom had already been encountered by the end of November this fiscal year.

One perk of breaking into the country and landing in ICE custody is ""an initial medical screening, including for mental health needs, as well as all necessary follow-up care"" at taxpayers' expense.

Individuals flagged as ""public safety"" or flight risks are also rendered these services.

This care is administered by 1,640 U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers, civil servants, and contract health professionals at ICE-owned facilities and elsewhere.

According to composite scores recently developed by Gallup along with the nonprofit organization West Health, nearly 112 million (44%) of Americans are presently struggling to pay for health care.

West Health noted in a March 31, 2022, press release that unlike the illegal immigrants in ICE detention facilities, over a third of ""cost desperate [American] adults report that they have cut back on utilities, and half have cut back on food in the past 12 months to pay for necessary healthcare.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted in 2020 that 31.6 million Americans had health insurance, largely those under the age of 65.

3.7 million American children were found to have been uninsured.

While more and more foreign nationals enjoy services that tens of millions of Americans don't have, U.S. taxpayers bear a greater and greater burden.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform published a study in September showing that to provide for the needs of illegal immigrants who've entered the U.S. under Biden, taxpayers must shoulder burden of an additional $20.4 billion every year.

FAIR revealed that this annual figure was not included in the estimated $140 billion per year that taxpayers were already footing, which compensates for the provision of services and benefits to the ""longer-term"" illegal immigrant population.

In 2018 – years before the border crisis ballooned under Biden – Forbes reported that Americans cross-subsidized health care for illegal immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year.

A new Los Angeles Times/YouGov survey conducted between Dec. 9 and 14 highlighted how the Biden administration's immigration policies are widely unpopular.

The Center Square reported that 64% of respondents said illegal immigration is a problem while 42% said that they should be ejected to their countries of origin.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who announced this week that he was suing the Biden administration over a rule that penalizes taxpayers to pay down the cost of illegal immigration, said that the Biden administration ""is committed to opening the borders to aliens who lack the ability to take care of themselves. Texans should not have to pay for these costly immigrants, nor should any other American.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-spent-324-million-in-taxpayer-dollars-on-criminal-noncitizens-dental-and-health-care,2023-01-06
Biden approval sinks to record low in NPR poll taken before Russia invaded Ukraine,"A majority of Americans believe President Joe Biden's first year in office was a ""failure,"" according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.

Support for the president has dropped to the lowest level recorded by the survey, with Biden holding just a 39% overall approval rating with U.S. adults. His overall approval rating is slightly better with registered voters, though still at a dismal 40%. The president's overall disapproval rating is at 55% with both groups.

A 56% majority of both U.S. adults and registered voters rate the president's first year in office as a failure, the survey found. Only 39% said it was a success.

These crushing poll numbers come as Americans are expressing widespread dissatisfaction with how Biden is performing on the economy, the pandemic, and with foreign policy. Most survey respondents, 54%, said Biden is not fulfilling his campaign promises, and 52% said he has done more to divide the country than unite it, even though uniting the country was a central theme of Biden's 2020 campaign for the White House.

On the issues, Biden receives just 36% approval for his handling of the economy and 47% for his handling of the pandemic. A plurality of 37% of registered voters say inflation should be the top priority for Biden right now, as consumer prices have increased at the largest rate in 40 years over the past year.

Other important issues rank far behind inflation, with the pandemic being the top concern for 12% of registered voters, voting laws for another 12%, and foreign policy and violent crime each for 10%.

Foreign policy is a rising concern for Americans with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Importantly, this poll was conducted between Feb. 15 and Feb. 21, before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When this poll was taken, 50% of U.S. adults said they disapproved of how Biden was handling the situation, while only 34% approved.



A pitiful 30% of respondents said they think the U.S. is headed in the right direction.

""These are sort of rock-bottom numbers,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, in a statement. ""It's about as low as you're going to see him.""

NPR identified three key groups that Biden is struggling with that explain his disastrous poll numbers: Independents, suburban voters, and the Democratic base.

Only 29% of self-identified independents approve of Biden's job performance. An astonishing 64% of independents disapprove of Biden, more than double the percentage that approve. It's a far-cry from the support Biden held in 2020, when he won the presidency with majority support from independents.

As for suburban voters, just 38% approve of the president, a decrease of 11 percentage points from December. Biden has seen a double-digit decrease in support from suburban women over the past two months alone, down to 45% from 57%.

The president is also suffering from a lack of intense support from Democrats. Only 14% of U.S. adults strongly approve of Biden's performance, a worse rating than President Donald Trump had at any time during his presidency, according to NPR.

Credit Biden's souring approval with his supporters to the 50-50 U.S. Senate. Major initiatives like the Build Back Better social spending package and a federal overhaul of U.S. elections have been stymied by lack of support in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster.

The only major pieces of legislation advanced under Biden's tenure have been a coronavirus relief package, called the American Rescue Plan, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Those achievements are decidedly not enough to make up for Biden's failure to ""shut down"" the coronavirus pandemic, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ongoing supply chain issues and rising prices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-approval-sinks-to-record-low-in-npr-poll-taken-before-russia-invaded-ukraine,2022-02-25
Biden calls it 'bizarre' to claim his big spending caused high inflation,"President Joe Biden said on Thursday that it was ""bizarre"" to claim that his big spending plan has lead to high inflation.

Biden made the comments in an interview with the Associated Press.

“The need for mental health in America, it has skyrocketed, because people have seen everything upset,” Biden said. “Everything they’ve counted on upset. But most of it’s the consequence of what’s happened, what happened as a consequence of the COVID crisis.”

He went on to say that the overall mindset of Americans is not good.

“People are really, really down,"" Biden said.

When asked about whether his coronavirus relief package worsened inflation, Biden unequivocally denied the claim.

“You could argue whether it had on the margin a minor impact on inflation,” he continued. “I don’t think it did. And most economists do not. But the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre.”

Americans faced more economic bad news on Thursday when the stock market continued its collapse, but Biden claimed that it was unlikely to mean a recession was coming.

“First of all, it’s not inevitable,” he said about a recession. “Secondly, we’re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation.”



He was also defensive about his role in causing the rise in inflation.

""If it’s my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I’m not being a wise guy,” he asked.

A poll in March showed there are more Americans who blame Biden and his policies for the rise in inflation than there are who blame the invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, or greedy corporations. The Biden administration has tried to deflect blame from their policies to all three, but Biden's favorability continues to sink lower and lower ahead of pivotal midterm elections.

"Biden caves to Russia on sanctions in new Iran nuclear deal, will enrich Russia: Report","The Biden administration will reportedly lift certain energy sanctions on Russia to comply with the forthcoming renegotiated Iran nuclear deal.

What are the details?

The revived Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, includes American concessions negotiated by the Biden administration that immunize Moscow from certain sanctions deployed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, the Washington Free Beacon reported, citing Russian and Iranian documents.

Specifically, the new deal will allow Rosatom, Russia's top state-controlled energy company, to ""cash in on a $10 billion contract"" to help Tehran expand its Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, according to the Free Beacon. Bushehr is one of the most controversial nuclear sites in Iran.

Thus, the new JCPOA establishes a ""sanctions evasion hub"" providing Russian companies with money, essentially counteracting energy sanctions deployed after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

A State Department official confirmed to the Free Beacon the U.S. will ""not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA.""

""The United States will take actions as necessary to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not apply to the implementation of JCPOA nuclear-related projects and activities by non-U.S. individuals and entities,"" the official explained. ""Perhaps it is now clear to Moscow that, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation.""

The Russian Foreign Ministry also confirmed the development.

""Additions were made to the text of the future agreement on #JCPOA restoration to ensure that all the JCPOA-related projects, esp. with Russian participation, as well as Bushehr NPP, are protected from negative impact of anti-Russian restrictions by US & EU,"" the ministry's Vienna mission said on Twitter.

The U.S. is also lifting sanctions on Iran.

As part of the deal, the U.S. will lift economic sanctions on Tehran that prevented the country from accessing funds held in South Korean and Japanese banks. Unfreezing the funds will allow Iran to pay Russia for working on its nuclear program.

Additionally, Axios reported the U.S. is considering removing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from terrorist lists. The IRCG is known to fund terrorism against the U.S. and its allies across the Middle East.

Anything else?

Republican lawmakers have been extremely critical of Biden's administration for renegotiating the JCPOA over fears the U.S. would give up too many concessions.

Unfortunately, those fears will probably be realized once the deal is finalized.

In fact, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's lead negotiator, recently bragged that Moscow, Tehran, and Beijing essentially took the U.S. to the cleaners in getting what they wanted from the deal at the expense of America.

""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" Ulyanov said. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-caves-to-russia-on-sanctions-in-new-iran-nuclear-deal-will-enrich-russia-report,2022-03-17
Biden claims he didn’t think Iraq had WMDs when he voted for the war. CNN reporter fact-checks him.,"2020 presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden claims that he didn't think that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he voted for the Iraq war to prove otherwise, but some of his past statements don't necessarily support that.

In a Monday night interview on MSNBC's ""The Last Word,"" host Lawrence O'Donnell asked Biden if rival candidate Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — who opposed the war — had exercised better judgment on the matter.



In October 2002, Biden was one of 77 U.S. senators who voted to give then-President George W. Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq, a decision that has since haunted him on the campaign trail.

Biden told O'Donnell that he didn't believe Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that ""the reason I voted the way I did was to try to prevent a war from happening"" by proving that such weapons weren't there.

""Remember, the threat was to go to war,"" Biden told O'Donnell. ""The argument was because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. So [Bush] said that 'I need to be able to get the [United Nations] Security Council to agree to send in inspectors to put pressure on Saddam, to find out whether or not he's using, is producing, nuclear weapons.'""



The former Delaware senator said that ""at the time"" he agreed, because ""the rationale was that's the way to not go to war, because I didn't believe he had those nuclear weapons; I didn't believe he had those weapons of mass destruction.""

Biden went on to claim, ""What happened was we went in, determined that they hyped what, in fact, was occurring. There was no concrete proof of what he was doing, and they still went to war.""

The former vice president added that it was a ""mistake"" that he ""took the word of a president saying that he wasn't going to go to war and this was the way to avoid going to war.""

However, the former vice president's account of the events doesn't match up with some of his statements at the time, according to CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski, who explained the disparities on Twitter.

Kaczynski referred back to a report of his from September that delved into multiple Biden statements from around the time of the debate over the invasion.

""I know there's enough circumstantial evidence that if this were a jury trial, I could convict you,"" Biden said of the administration's case about weapons of mass destruction ahead of then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's U.N. presentation.

""I am not opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq,"" Biden said in a speech the following February, according to the report. ""I am not opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that.""

This wouldn't be the first time that Biden has been called out for an attempt to explain his Iraq war vote. A Washington Post fact-check about a previous claim that he opposed the war ""from the moment it started"" said that the Democratic candidate ""was on his way to Four Pinocchios"" until a campaign adviser sent a lengthy statement saying that he ""misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately.""

Last week, the Sanders campaign hit Biden on his Iraq record with a video ad highlighting the Vermont senator's past skepticism of the Bush administration. The ad was released in a tweet that stated, ""I do not believe we will defeat Donald Trump with a candidate like Joe Biden who supported the Iraq War.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-claims-he-didnt-think-iraq-had-wmds-when-he-voted-for-the-war-cnn-reporter-fact-checks-him,2020-03-10
"Biden condemns invasion of Ukraine, announces harsh sanctions against Russia","President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the U.S. will impose severe economic sanctions against Russia after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two rebel regions of Ukraine as independent states.

Biden condemned actions Putin took on Monday, including deploying troops into eastern Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions to carry out ""peacekeeping functions."" Russia's Parliament also authorized the use of military force in Ukraine on Tuesday, which the president characterized as the beginning of an invasion.



""To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Last night, Putin authorized Russian forces to deploy into these regions. Today, he asserted that these regions actually extend deeper than the two areas he recognized, claiming large areas under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian government. He's setting up a rationale to take more territory by force, in my view.""



Biden announced that in response, the U.S. would impose sanctions ""far beyond"" those imposed against Russia in 2014, when Putin annexed the Crimean peninsula. The president called Putin's actions ""a flagrant violation of international law"" that ""demands a firm response from the international community.""



""Russia has now undeniably moved against Ukraine,"" Biden said.

The new sanctions will be levied against large Russian financial institutions and members of the country's elite, as well as their families. The United States will also place ""comprehensive sanctions"" on Russian debt.

“That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western finance,” Biden said. “It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.”

The president acknowledged that Americans will likely see rising gas prices as a result of levying sanctions against Russia.

“As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs, for us as well and here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that. But as we do this, I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.”

The president vowed to continue placing sanctions on Russia should Putin proceed with a further invasion of Ukraine. He also said that the U.S. is working with Germany to freeze the Nord Steam 2 pipeline project.

Earlier Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country has stopped the certification process for the pipeline, which Russia badly desires to be completed to permit Russian oil to flow directly to Germany, circumventing Ukrainian oil-transit taxes. The U.K. government also said it would sanction members of the Russian Parliament who voted to recognize the independence of the separatist regions in Ukraine.

“This is the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson told U.K. lawmakers on Tuesday.

These actions come as western leaders struggle to develop a policy to contain Putin's ambitions to expand Russia's borders. In a fiery speech Monday, Putin showed his hand by condemning the fall of the Soviet Union and denying that Ukraine has a right to exist as a free state outside of Russian control.

Putin asserted that Russia has a national defense interest in protecting ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking residents of the eastern part of Ukraine, remarks that drew comparisons to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's justification for the invasion of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.

His ultimate goal is the restoration of Russian greatness by reclaiming parts of the old Soviet empire, starting with Ukraine.

To shore up defenses in other Eastern European nations, Biden said he has authorized additional movements of U.S. forces and military equipment to ""strengthen"" allies in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

“Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movements of US forces and equipment, already stationed in Europe to strengthen our Baltic allies: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,” Biden said.

He emphasized that these forces are being stationed as a ""defensive"" move and that the door to a diplomatic resolution to the crisis remains open, should Russia be willing to deescalate.

""Whatever Russia does next, we're ready to respond with unity, clarity, and conviction,"" Biden said.

In the speech, which was reported to be the second major foreign policy address of his campaign, Biden lambasted Trump as ""dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.""

Not once, but twice



But that was not the only time Biden mistook the two Middle East countries for each other. Earlier in the day, the Democratic presidential front-runner mixed the two countries up as he expressed fears that Trump would lead the U.S. into a new war ""with Iraq.""

""I said not long ago that as the walls close in on this president, I worried that he was going to get us in war with Iraq,"" Biden remarked.

Also, per pooler @ShaneGoldmacher, Biden twice appeared to misspeak, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran':



""I said not long ago that as the walls close in on this president, I worried that he was going to get us in war with Iraq, as the ultimate wag the dog...'' Biden said.

— Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) January 7, 2020

The Washington Examiner reports: ""U.S. troops have been stationed in Iraq, which borders Iran, since 2003. Biden voted in favor of military action in Iraq in 2002 but has since falsely claimed that he opposed the effort 'from the moment' the March 2003 invasion started.""

Surely, Iraq and Iran's phonetical similarities present a daunting challenge to any speaker, but Biden, who often boasts his foreign policy chops, should be expected to distinguish between the two.

The Washington Free Beacon notes that gaffes like the ones highlighted in this article have become commonplace for the 77-year-old candidate. Last December, Biden appeared to forget where he was on the campaign trail. Before then, he mistakenly said Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated in the late 1970s, instead of the late 1960s.

Biden warns of possible cyberattack from Russia on critical infrastructure: 'It's coming',"President Joe Biden issued another warning of the possibility of a Russian cyberattack on critical infrastructure in the U.S.

“The magnitude of Russia’s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it’s coming,” said Biden Monday at a business roundtable meeting.

""The federal government is doing its part to get ready,"" he added and called on the private sector to respond accordingly. He also suggested that it would be their ""patriotic duty"" to invest as much as they could to improve their technological defenses.

The warning was based on preparatory activity identified by U.S. intelligence that could precede a cyberattack.

""I have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we’ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners,"" said Biden in a statement.



""It’s part of Russia’s playbook,"" he added. ""Today, my administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks.""

The White House urged companies to improve and update their cyber defenses as a precaution.

White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology Anne Neuberger told reporters at a media briefing that the Biden administration was prepared to respond to a cyberattack from Russia.

“As the president has said, the United States is not seeking confrontation with Russia, but he has also said if Russia conducts disruptive cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, we will be prepared to respond,” Neuberger claimed.

Biden also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin might lash out in a cyberattack because the invasion into Ukraine is not going according to their timeline.

""The more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,"" Biden said.

“And now is a time when things are shifting,” Biden continued, “We’re going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.”

According to a transcript of Biden’s address released by the White House, the discussion emphasized the need for American companies to continue working with the White House in “reducing costs and a whole lot more” while accounting for the ongoing disruptions to agricultural markets and energy production.

The president applauded American corporations for assisting American leftists to further their radical social messaging across the globe as they “innovate with and for diversity.”

Biden said, “I’m pleased to see American companies stepping up and doing their part.”

Biden’s address also patted the transnational business leaders on the back for their role in decimating the Russian economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

“You did a hell of a lot to help us impose sanctions and incur costs,” the president said to the room full of CEOs. “We’re seeing now that it mattered. It was really important what you all did.”

The president was also very optimistic about the future of American manufacturing. He asked for America’s business leaders to “invest in America itself in manufacturing.”

“As one of my colleagues from the Midwest said: We’re not going to talk about the Rust Belt any more,” Biden said. “We’re going to talk about new, expanded manufacturing capacity in the Middle — in the Middle Atlantics — excuse me, in the Midwest.”

Biden called on business leaders to “invest in America itself — in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy — so America can win the competition in the 21st century.”

"Biden offers his solution to high gas prices, and the online backlash is fierce","President Joe Biden faced online ridicule and mockery after he offered one solution for high gas prices that the average American would likely find completely unfeasible.

Biden made the comments in a speech Thursday from the White House where he touted his plan to tackle the problem of high gas prices.

The president blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic for the rising of gas prices.

""Putin's war is imposing the costs on Americans and our allies, and on Democracies around the world,"" said Biden in his speech.

He called the increase in gas prices ""Putin's price hike"" and said that his plan would lead to American energy independence.

""Under my plan, which is before Congress now, we can take advantage of the next generation of electric vehicles, that a typical driver will save about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump,"" Biden explained.



Gas prices have skyrocketed in past months due to inflation from government overspending, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the Democratic efforts to phase out fossil fuels.

'Way out of touch'

Many critics of the Biden administration took to Twitter to respond to the unfeasible solution.

""Just drop $60,000 on a new car and you could save $80/mo it's not that hard,"" replied Abigail Marone.

""A 'typical driver' with an average credit score financing a bare bones Nissan Leaf will have a car payment of around $560 a month. So a net 'savings' of -$480 per month,"" tweeted writer Jim Jamitis.

""The old man and his whole staff is way out of touch,"" read another very popular response.

""These people live in a totally different world than the average citizen. They just don’t get it or else they do get it and keep pushing it hoping it comes true,"" replied one critic.

""These people are just mocking the poor and working class people,"" said another detractor.

Biden's two-prong plan to reduce gas prices included releasing millions more barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve and punishing oil companies who don't follow his command to increase oil production.

A recent poll found that far more people blamed Biden and his energy policies for high gas prices than those that blamed Putin, the pandemic, or greedy corporations.

Biden kills an hour with TikTok 'influencers' brought to DC to receive Democrat marching orders,"Eight people were flown to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with President Joe Biden. Their stated purpose was neither to bolster border security nor to address inflation but rather to utilize the Chinese-controlled social media app TikTok to help Democrats hold on to and secure more power.



Crystallizing public opinion

The Washington Post reported that a handful of so-called influencers, including Nia Sioux, Mona Swain, Vitus Spehar, Kat Wellington, and Mattie Westbrouck, were flown for free to D.C., where they met with Biden, former president Barack Obama, and leaders of both the Democratic National Committee and House Democrats' campaign committee.



Streaming their experiences, the influencers toured the Supreme Court and received a private tour of the Capitol.

The penultimate stop on their whirlwind visit was a news conference where the 79-year-old president claimed the COVID-19 mRNA booster ""is going to be required"" before sitting down to receive one himself.

Finally, in a detour planned directly by the White House, the influencers received an hour more of Biden's time than Americans along the southern border have received in person since he took office.

In the Oval Office, Biden reportedly explained why he got into politics and why the healthy young streamers should get COVID-19 mRNA boosters. He then walked them around the West Wing.

22-year-old Westbrouck, who has over 10.2 million followers on TikTok, said, ""It felt like a little room tour but by the president.""

Though Spehar, the host of the TikTok news channel ""Under the Desk News,"" said Biden ""didn't mention the election or voting,"" the influencers had already received their marching orders by the time they had reached the Oval Office.

High-level Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffers instructed the influencers on how they could best serve the interests of the party in the midterm election. The Post indicated that DCCC staffers highlighted key districts in battleground states where the influencers' help was required and could be used to great effect.

Obama, like Biden and other Democrats, impressed upon these prospective agents of the state how important it was that the Democrats win in the midterms.

""I genuinely think it's a scary time for people who can get pregnant and won't be able to have rights to an abortion,"" said 21-year-old Nia Sioux, who has 8.3 million followers. ""I will be talking about my stance on that, and I will have more information in [my] social media content.""

Kat Wellington, 24, similarly found the Democrat immersion trip activating. She said, ""This trip helped me make the push to use my platform for that. I don't want to be afraid to share my genuine beliefs about politics, even if it's going to upset some people.""

Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, told the Post, ""We know people listen to trusted messengers, and as an increasing number of young people turn to Instagram, TikTok and other platforms for news and information, we need to engage with the voices they trust directly.""

Shelby Cole, deputy mobilization officer at the DNC, underscored the need for Democrats to exploit the reach of content creators to engage ""young voters to remind them of the stakes in this election and how to make a plan to vote.""

Vaccines and votes

In recent years, the Biden administration has invested a great deal of time and energy into leveraging TikTok to achieve its political ends.

Earlier this month, Judicial Watch obtained evidence of an extensive media campaign executed by the Biden administration aimed at driving up acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. While records revealed the administration had colluded with establishment media, major corporations, and various institutions to advance its vaccine narrative, its messaging strategy also relied heavily upon social media influencers.

For instance, the Biden administration noted its intention to request ""major TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram influencers to create videos of themselves being vaccinated and start a special campaign of funny and/or musical videos about being vaccinated to encourage others to create content and post.""

The documents acquired through Judicial Watch's freedom of information lawsuit also revealed the administration's belief that in order to capture the minds of young people, it would have to ""target endemic content creators, with a particular focus on Youtube, and TikTok.""

17-year-old Ellie Zeiler was one of those paid by the Biden administration to push vaccines as part of the so-called ""influencer army."" Although just a high school student, Zeiler was useful to the administration because she had over 10 million followers.

Owing to influencers' perceived utility, they are often given preferential treatment.

TheBlaze noted last week that it's difficult to schedule an interview with Biden. He has only agreed to 28 interviews since taking office. Transsexual fetishist Dylan Mulvaney managed, however, to secure an exclusive interview with the president, which aired on Sunday. Mulvaney is a TikTok user with 8.3 million followers.

Mulvaney was assigned priority, like the influencers invited to the White House this week, in part because the interview was able to deliver more eyeballs than the traditional media networks that Democrats have long depended upon, such as CNN, which frequently has trouble seizing even the interest of 600,000 viewers.

The Biden administration has used influencers to supplement its establishment media support since the beginning. The Washington Post reported that in 2020, TikTok for Biden assembled a collective of over 500 Tiktok users to endorse Biden.

In the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, top White House and National Security Council staffers met with influencers. Forbes reported that in March, persons whose only qualifications were comfort using a phone and access to a big audience were briefed on the war and prompted to disseminate the White House's narrative to their followers.

Compromised apparatchiks

While Democrats are relying more and more on TikTok influencers for strategic and governmental functions, they do so despite warnings that the platform is compromised in more than one way.

TikTok has censored conservative speech and artwork, such as rapper Bryson Gray's ""Let's Go, Brandon"" song, as well as content flagged as unacceptable by foreign dictators. Earlier this year, the platform banned the founder of the pro-life group Live Action and barred the group from posting ads.

Fox News Digital reported that a whistleblower indicated the Chinese government, which controls TikTok, has been using the app to ""suppress minorities, censor freedom of speech and mask human rights violations.""

In addition to being used to selectively silence certain groups and amplify the voices of others — such as those anointed on trips to the White House — TikTok is a security threat.

A report released last week accused TikTok's parent company ByteDance of planning to use the location data it collected on the app to track and monitor American citizens. The company is also being accused of seeking to gather users' personal and private information without their consent.

This week, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) said, ""Donald Trump was right on TikTok years ago ... If your country uses Huawei, if your kids are on TikTok ... the ability for China to have undue influence is a much greater challenge and a much more immediate threat than any kind of actual armed conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-kills-an-hour-with-tiktok-influencers-brought-to-dc-to-receive-democrat-marching-orders,2022-10-27
"Drain, baby, drain: Biden admin will deliver another 10 million barrels of oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November as OPEC+ cuts production by 2 million barrels per day","The White House expressed opposition to the decision of OPEC+ to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day beginning in November and said that the U.S. will release another 10 million barrels of oil from America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve next month.

A collection of OPEC and non-OPEC nations has determined to decrease overall oil production ""from the August 2022 required production levels, starting November 2022,"" according to a press release.

In a bid to tackle soaring gas prices, Biden announced a plan earlier this year to release one million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over a six-month period.

While gas prices are not as high as they once were, they are still very high — as of Wednesday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.831.

High gas prices could prove politically problematic for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections next month.

""The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council director Brian Deese said in a statement.

""At the President’s direction, the Department of Energy will deliver another 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the market next month, continuing the historic releases the President ordered in March. The President will continue to direct SPR releases as appropriate to protect American consumers and promote energy security, and he is directing the Secretary of Energy to explore any additional responsible actions to continue increasing domestic production in the immediate term,"" they said in the statement.

Republicans responded to the news about OPEC+'s plans to cut oil production by blasting President Biden.

""OPEC’s decision to cut oil production would have a minimal impact on people in Wyoming if the U.S. were still energy independent. The American people will continue to suffer at the pump due to Biden’s attack on domestic energy production,"" GOP Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming tweeted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-opec-strategic-petroleum-reserve,2022-10-05
White House has to clean up Biden's embarrassing gaffe to US soldiers in Poland to avoid international incident,"President Joe Biden made an embarrassing gaffe to U.S. soldiers in Poland, and the White House had to hastily issue a clarification on his comments to avoid international provocation.

Biden implied that the U.S. was sending troops into Ukraine when speaking on Friday to members of the Air Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Rzeszow, Poland, just 60 miles from the border with Ukraine.

""And you, some, some of you have been there,"" said Biden. ""You're going to see, you're going to see women, young people standing, standing in the middle of, in front of a damn tank, just saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground.' They're incredible.""

""But they take a lot of inspiration from us,"" he added, according to the White House transcript of his comments.

The president has said previously that the U.S. engagement in the war in Ukraine would be limited to economic sanctions against Russia and sending non-personnel military aid and economic aid to Ukraine. The presence of U.S. troops would be a significant escalation and provocation against Russia.

The White House released a statement clarifying that Biden's statement was made in error.

""The President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position,"" read the statement sent to Andrew Feinberg of the Independent.

Biden followed up his comments calling the troops the ""organizing principle"" around which the free world revolves.

""And you know, the woman who just died, the secretary of state used to have an expression, she said we are the essential nation,"" he said, quoting the late Madeleine Albright.

""It sounds like a bit of hyperbole, but the truth of the matter is, you are the organizing principle around the rest of the world, the free world, is moving.""

Biden also took selfies and ate pizza with the troops.

"New poll finds more Americans blame Biden for inflation than the pandemic, corporate greed, or Putin's invasion","Recent polling shows that very few Americans are buying the excuses the Biden administration are making for high inflation and instead blame the President Joe Biden and his policies.

The NBC News poll asked Americans who they thought was to blame for the high inflation that they are suffering under and offered some of the culprits blamed by the president and his supporters as possible answers.

Among the options listed, Biden and his policies were blamed by a plurality of Americans polled, at 38%.

Only 28% blamed the coronavirus pandemic, another 23% blamed corporations raising prices, and barely 6% blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Over recent months, the Biden administration has attempted to blame the invasion of Ukraine, the greed of meat conglomerates, and the pandemic for the high inflation eating away at Americans' savings and wages.

The same poll found the president's approval rating to drop to 40% while an astounding 55% disapprove of the job Biden is doing. When asked about the economy, only 33% said they approved of the job he's doing, while 63% said they don't approve of the job Biden is doing.

The astonishing poll is just the latest in a long series showing devastating results for Democrats ahead of the midterms, where they would have faced an uphill battle even without horrible polling.

The terrible polling has lead to greater division in the Democratic party among the centrist establishment wing, which blames progressive extremism, and the far-left progressive wing that blames Biden for not going far enough to the left.

Socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Thursday said that the low polling came from progressives and young voters who were disappointed that Biden had done enough to satisfy their left-wing demands.

Poll: Americans say Biden's first year was a failure,"Two new polls were recently released regarding the job performance of President Joe Biden, and they paint a potentially disastrous picture for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections.

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Friday finds that a majority (56%) of Americans think Biden's first year in office has been a failure, compared to only 39% who said it was a success.

There was also a majority of Americans who said Biden is ""not fulfilling campaign promises"" (54%) and is ""doing more to divide the nation than to unite it"" (52%). Biden campaigned heavily on the promise of uniting Americans.

A mere 30% of Americans feel as though the country is headed in the right direction. This is similar results to a Fox News poll released on Thursday that found just 35% of Americans believe the country is better off now than a year ago.

There were 38% of the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll participants who said that President Biden's top priority should be inflation – far higher than any other issue. Earlier this month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

Of the respondents, 11% said Biden should concern himself about the coronavirus, and another 11% said voting laws were a top priority. There were 10% who said Biden needs to focus on foreign policy, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There were also 10% who believed violent crime was the most important issue.

Biden's job approval rating was a paltry 39%, down from 41% in December. There are 55% who disapprove of Biden's job performance and a whopping 41% who ""strongly disapprove.""

A new ABC News/Washington Post poll spelled even more trouble for Biden and Democrats in the midterm elections.

Heading into his first State of the Union address, Biden has a meager 37% approval rating – the lowest of his term.

ABC News delivered some historical relevance to such a poor rating of a president in their first year:

Analyzing data going back to Harry Truman's administration, only two presidents have had approval ratings this low heading into their first State of the Union address, which Biden delivers Tuesday. Those two were Donald Trump, at 36%, and Gerald Ford, at 37%. Disapproval has been higher, by a nonsignificant 3 percentage points, only for Trump. (More were undecided about Ford, then just five months in office.)



However, it isn't just President Biden who appears to be in political turmoil, according to polls. Democrats also face alarming polling numbers.

The ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed:

Seventy-five percent of Americans rate the economy’s condition as not so good or poor, the most in ABC/Post polls since 2013. The public by a 3-1 margin says it’s gotten worse rather than better since Biden took office, 54-17% (with the rest saying it’s stayed the same). That “gotten worse” number is more than double what it was when measured during Trump’s presidency in 2019 (22%) and 11 points higher than under Obama in 2012.

In early midterm voting preferences, the poll found that Republican congressional candidates have a 49-42% advantage over Democrats among registered voters. The GOP advantage spikes to 54-41% among Americans who say they both are registered and certain to vote in November.

""In the new data, among independents who are registered to vote – often swing voters – GOP candidates lead by 14 points,"" Langer Research Associates stated.

Biden requests $2.6 billion from Congress to fund global gender equity programs,"President Joe Biden is requesting $2.6 billion to fund gender equity programs across the globe.

The announcement was made on Tuesday, reported The Hill, to commemorate International Women’s Day.

The $2.6 billion will be part of the Biden administration’s 2023 congressional budget request and, if approved, will double the amount requested for gender equity programs last year.

In a prepared statement, Biden said, “On this day and every day, let us recognize that all of us have a better future when women and girls can reach their full potential – and together, let’s renew our efforts to advance dignity, equality, and limitless possibilities for all.”

Biden affirmed that International Women’s Day recognizes the achievements of women and girls and celebrates progress in gender equity. The president also recommitted himself and his administration to work that he says still needs to be done to achieve gender equity.

He said, “Ensuring that every woman and girl has that chance isn’t just the right thing to do – it’s also a strategic imperative that advances the prosperity, stability, and security of our nation and the world. Yet too often, in too many places, women and girls face obstacles that limit their possibilities and undermine their participation in economic, political, and social life.”

Biden stated that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many existing issues that women face on a regular basis. He suggested that women’s participation in the work force declined, that additional burden was placed upon caregivers, and that gender-based violence increased.

The president’s announcement marks the one-year anniversary of the administration debuting the White House Gender Policy Council.

The White House announced the $2.6 billion over a livestreamed video conference to commemorate International Women’s Day, U.S. News reported.

The conference featured Secretary of State Antony Blinken, acting budget director Shalanda Young, U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Samantha Power, and the director of the Gender Policy Council, Jen Klein.

First lady Jill Biden, who was also present, marked International Women’s Day by making a video tribute to women throughout the world “who courageously use their voice, no matter the cost.”

She said, “To our sisters from Ukraine who are fighting to keep their country free and their families alive: We stand with you in solidarity. To our sister in Russia who are protesting and speaking out against the invasion at great personal risk: We see your courage.”

“And to women warriors around the world, those fighting for justice and working for a change: Thank you for building a better future for all of us,” the first lady added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-requested-2-6-billion-to-fund-global-gender-equity-programs,2022-03-08
"As Russian invasion of Ukraine demands urgency, Biden says, 'Let's have a conversation in another month or so to see' if new sanctions are 'working'","President Joe Biden responded Thursday afternoon to Russia's rapid full-scale invasion of Ukraine by announcing new sanctions against the warring nation. However, when pressed on what else he would do to confront Russia over its warmongering, the president suggested only that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the sanctions ""are working.""

The lackluster response is sure to spark widespread criticism amongst the American people and allies around the world for not matching the urgency of the moment.

Biden delivered the remarks while speaking with reporters in the East Room of the White House Thursday in response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.

During the speech, Biden announced that the U.S. and its NATO allies would swiftly sanction more major Russian banks and impose export controls to curtail Russia's access to high tech as a way to punish the Kremlin for its ""premeditated attack."" He declared the new measures would be ""devastating"" for Russia by limiting the country's ability to do business ""in dollars, pounds, euros, and yen.""

But when a reporter noted that Putin had thus far been undeterred by sanctions and that Biden was in fact still withholding other sanctions at his disposal — such as removing Russia from SWIFT, a prominent international banking cooperative — Biden balked.

""Respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?"" the reporter asked. In under 24 hours, Russia has reportedly destroyed 74 Ukrainian military installations and begun attacking civilian facilities en route to overthrowing the government in Kyiv.

Biden answered by alleging that his new sanctions are plenty powerful and suggested that before taking any more aggressive action against Russia, the U.S. should adopt a wait-and-see approach.

""Let's have a conversation in another month or so to see if they are working,"" he said of the current sanctions.

Other reporters pressed Biden on his refusal so far to personally sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin. In response, the president refused to answer why he hasn't taken such an approach, saying only that it remains ""on the table.""

At another time during the press conference, Biden acknowledged that sanctions were never expected to prevent Russia from attacking. But he said they may prove, in time, to sting Russia for their bad behavior.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official is reporting that Russia is advancing on Ukraine's capital with ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance.""

According to Ukraine, at least 40 troops and up to 10 civilians have been killed thus far in the assault. Many more casualties are expected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-sanctions-russia-over-ukraine-war,2022-02-24
Biden says Putin 'cannot remain in power' in remarks the White House says weren't a threat,"On Saturday, while delivering a speech in Poland, attempting to rally NATO allies to stand against the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia.

“A dictator, bent on rebuilding an empire, will never erase the people’s love for liberty, Biden said of his Russian counterpart, Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.”

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said.

Throughout the crisis in Ukraine, Biden has lobbed insults at Putin, calling him a “murderous dictator” and a “war criminal,” but has never previously called for Putin’s removal from power unlike other prominent politicians.

A White House official has since attempted to walk-back the president’s statements saying that Biden “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change, but was instead insisting that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors in the region,” CNBC reported.

This is the second high-profile, alleged gaffe that Biden had made while on this European excursion.

On Friday, Biden told US troops who were stationed in Poland that they would witness the bravery of the Ukrainian people “when you’re there,” explicitly insinuating that American troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Biden said, “You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a dammed tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground.’”

The White House quickly clarified that Biden was mistaken and that the president was not, in fact, changing his stance on deploying the military into Ukraine.

During his Saturday address, Biden reiterated his belief that the only thing that will get Russian leadership to cease its invasion is by instituting debilitating sanctions on the Russian economy.

Per the New York Times, Biden said, “Swift and punishing costs is the only thing that will get Russia to change course.”

Biden also suggested that the invasion has been a failure for Russia, saying: ""This war has already been a strategic failure for Russia. Having lost children, myself, I know that’s no solace to people who’ve lost family.”

Biden also indicated that the West does not find fault with, or hold responsible, the Russian populace, despite implementing sanctions that are devastating their way quality of life.

He said, “This is not the future you deserve for your families and children. I’m telling you the truth, this war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-says-putin-cannot-remain-in-power-in-remarks-the-white-house-says-weren-t-a-threat,2022-03-26
'I'm going to do it again': Biden allegedly told Al Sharpton he's running again in 2024,"In a private conversation last month, President Joe Biden confided in MSNBC's Rev. Al Sharpton, informing him of his intention to run for reelection in 2024. ""I'm going to do it again ... I'm going,"" Biden allegedly said on September 2 in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

This confidential admission, which Sharpton reportedly broadcast to his National Action Network staff immediately after the meeting, comes amid much uncertainty whether the president should or would seek to hold on to power.

Sharpton suggested that the recent meeting paralleled another, in January 2019, during which Biden allegedly solicited his advice on whether to pursue the highest office in the land.

Biden's intentions

Biden recently cast doubt on whether he would seek reelection in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on September 18. The 79-year-old said that his ""intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again.""

However, he added, ""it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen. ... Within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, [I will] make a judgment on what to do.""

Biden recently suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris, whose 2020 presidential campaign was a failure, ""won't be the last woman to be vice president or president,"" intimating that perhaps she might soon have an opportunity to take the top spot.

Democrats' disagreements



Democrats are not united behind the prospect of another four years of Biden.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer laughed at the question of whether Biden should run, saying, ""I'm not having that conversation.""

Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) flat-out opposed the idea, stating that he thought ""the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up.""

Rep. Angie Craig concurred, suggesting that while it was entirely up to Biden on whether to run, in terms of having his support, ""I would say we need new leaders in Washington up and down the ballot in the Democratic Party.""

Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), now running against J.D. Vance for a Senate seat, said last month, ""My hunch is that we need leadership across the board ... I think it's time for a generational move.""



While some Democrats have expressed a desire for a change, others have attempted to remain diplomatic.

At a September 22 news conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who may similarly be on her way out, eulogized Biden's first term, stating he ""did a great service to our country: he defeated Donald Trump. Let's not forget that."" She added that she wouldn't go ""into politics about whether the President should run or not.""

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN that Biden ""beat Donald Trump before; he'll beat Donald Trump again ... I think Joe Biden is the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump in 2024.""

Recent YouGov and ABC News/Washington Post polls have Biden and Trump nearly tied, whereas a late September McLaughlin & Associates poll had Trump up by nine points.

When asked by Time magazine whether she'd want Biden to campaign with her, Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska) answered, ""I'd like to take a wait-and-see approach. I don't know what is on the horizon.""

Jim Roosevelt, a top DNC member, told CNN, ""If he feels he can do it ... people would want him to do it.""

The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll suggested otherwise. Only 35% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want to see the party nominate Biden in 2024. Over half of Democrats (56%) want someone else.

Voters' apprehensions

A September 22 Marquette University National Survey indicated that nearly three-quarters (72%) of Americans don't want the president to run again. Alternatively put, only 28% of respondents want Biden to run again. That's three points lower than the current national support for former President Donald Trump to run again.

Although up considerably higher than in previous months, a September Gallup poll placed Biden's approval at 42%. The average for U.S. presidents is 53%.

On Monday, a Monmouth University poll gave Biden a failing score on all of America's issue priorities, with the exception of the COVID pandemic, regarded as the nation's second-lowest priority, where he secured a 50% approval rating.

30% of likely voters approve of his handling of inflation; 32%, crime; 31%, immigration; 31%, abortion; and 41%, his handling of student loan debt.

49% of the public believe Biden is performing worse than they had imagined he would as president.

Biden, the second U.S. president to claim to be a Catholic, now majoritively lacks the support of Catholic voters. An EWTN News and RealClear Opinion Research poll indicated on September 29 that 58.4% of likely Catholic voters think Biden should not pursue a second term. Only 22.2% think he should run again.



Cognitive dimensions

Biden, the oldest president ever to hold the office, is a month shy of becoming an octogenarian. There is mounting concern over whether he will be able to continue to serve as president in light of what some have suggested may be signs of mental deterioration.

In August, an Issues & Insights/TIPP poll revealed that 59% of respondents were ""concerned"" about Biden's mental health. 36% stated they were ""very concerned."" Although this concern skewed along political lines, 39% of Democrat respondents nevertheless expressed concern.

When asked whether age may present a challenge to Biden in 2024, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That is not a question that we should be even asking."" The 48-year-old added, ""I can't even keep up with him.""

Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), a former White House doctor, observed that Biden is now slow, frail, forgetful, confused, and short-tempered. ""All these things are physical and mental manifestations of cognitive decline and it's related to age,"" said Jackson.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jackson suggested that Biden should resign.

Jackson told Fox News Digital, ""The whole country is seeing his mental cognitive issues on display for over a year now, and there's really no question ... that he's not cognitively the same as he used to be and, in my mind, not fit to be our president right now.""

Biden's routine gaffes have stoked much of this worry.

Last week, the president asked for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), who died this summer in a car crash. Biden had previously issued an official statement in which he offered her family his condolences.

In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Biden was asked about his mental focus. His answer became the subject of much ridicule.

In July, Biden said that it was important to ""bear witness, to keep alive the truth and the honor of the Holocaust,"" having originally been scripted to say ""horror of the Holocaust.""

Biden shields Ukrainians in US from deportation with temporary protection during war,"The Biden administration will temporarily shield tens of thousands of Ukrainians in the United States from deportation and grant them work permits for as long as they are unable to return to Ukraine because of the ongoing war with Russia, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday.

According to the agency, any Ukrainian resident in the U.S. who has been here since March 1 or earlier is eligible for Temporary Protected Status for a period of 18 months. Ukrainians who arrived in the country after March 1 are ineligible for this designation, DHS said in a release.

The federal government's action comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, air, and sea in what has become one of the largest wars in Europe since World War II. President Joe Biden strongly condemned Russia in his State of the Union address earlier this week, calling the attack ""premeditated and unprovoked.""

The president detailed economic sanctions the U.S. and European allies have placed on Russia in his address, and promised additional aid to the Ukrainian people during this conflict. He also announced that Russian flights would be cut off from American air space to ""squeeze"" the Russian economy as punishment for Putin's war.

Biden's administration has determined that the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine and ""extraordinary and temporary conditions"" will prevent Ukrainian nationals in the U.S. from returning home safely. The TPS designation for Ukrainians in America will grant them access to work permits and enable them to remain in the U.S. after their visas expire, for as long as the status lasts.

""Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a written statement.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it had paused deportation flights to Ukraine due to the ""ongoing humanitarian crisis,"" Reuters reported.



Since the war began, more than 1 million Ukrainians have fled their country seeking refuge in European nations to the west. Half a million of these refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which said this could be the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, CNN reported.



U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said Thursday, ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.""

""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed.

Biden snaps at reporter who confronts him over effectiveness of sanctions. Then even NBC calls him out.,"President Joe Biden snapped at a reporter Thursday who confronted him over contradictory statements about the purpose of American-imposed sanctions on Russia.

What is the background?

The Biden administration infamously waited until Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine to impose harsh sanctions on Russian leaders, businesses, and the Russian economy.

The purpose of sanctions, the Biden administration has maintained repeatedly, is deterrence.

Vice President Kamala Harris said on Feb 20: ""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.""

""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence."" National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Feb 11: ""The President believes that sanctions are intended to deter.""

""The President believes that sanctions are intended to deter."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Feb 20: ""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war.""

""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war."" White House press secretary Jen Psakihas reportedlysaid the purpose of sanctions is to have a ""deterrent impact"" or deterrent effect.""

What happened with Biden?

During a press conference at NATO headquarters in Belgium, CBS News correspondent Christina Ruffini confronted Biden after he announced that NATO had agreed to imporse additional sanctions against Russia.

""Sir, deterrence didn’t work. What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you’ve taken today?"" Ruffini asked.

In response, Biden claimed that he has never said sanctions are meant to deter Russia.

Let’s get something straight: You remember, if you’ve covered me from the beginning, I did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions — the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain, and the demonstration — why I asked for this NATO meeting today — is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we’re doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That’s what will stop him.

When Ruffini asked her question again — whether new actions would ""have an impact on making Russia change course in Ukraine"" — Biden accused Ruffini of ""playing a game.""

""That’s not what I said. You, you — you’re playing a game with me,"" Biden chided.

""The answer is no,"" the president continued. ""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified, and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people’s lives that are being lost and ruined, and what’s going on. That’s the important thing.""

While reporting on Biden's remarks, NBC News correspondent Kelly O'Donnell fact-checked the president.

"Biden, state of the union, defund the police, Russia","While delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. is moving to ban all Russian flights from American airspace in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Biden also reiterated that U.S. forces will not engage with Russia in Ukraine, noting that America and its allies will defend all NATO territory.

The president, who continues to remain underwater on various job approval polls, also spoke against defunding the police. The policy is promoted by some Democrats, but strongly opposed by many Americans.

""We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police, it's to fund the police,"" he declared.

Biden described the state of the American union as ""strong,"" claiming that the country is stronger now than one year ago and that it will be even stronger one year in the future.

Biden says US will intervene if China invades Taiwan,"President Joe Biden has announced that the United States will militarily intervene if the People's Republic of China decides to invade Taiwan, according to reports.

What are the details?

During a Monday press conference in Tokyo, Biden said that the United States military will help Taiwan defend itself against China if necessary.

A reporter asked the president, ""You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?""

""Yes. That's the commitment we made,"" Biden responded while delivering in remarks alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

The president added that China should not take Taiwan ""by force.""

""[It] is just not appropriate,"" he said.

A White House spokesperson told Fox News that the Biden administration's One China policy ""has not changed.""

""As the president said, our policy has not changed,"" the spokesperson said. ""He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.""

Fox News noted that America's ""One China policy"" states that the U.S. recognizes the People's Republic of China as the ""sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges, without endorsing, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China.""

What else?

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he was unhappy with and opposed to Biden's remarks.

""China has no room for compromise or concessions on issues involving China’s core interests such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Wang said.

In October, Biden issued similar remarks and said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, to which a ministry spokesperson warned, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination, and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Joe Biden's own words come back to haunt him after he tries to blame Republicans for economic woes,"President Joe Biden was reminded of his own words over the weekend after he attempted to blame Republicans for the ongoing economic woes plaguing Americans.

What did Biden say?

On Sunday, the president claimed that Republicans ""are doing nothing but obstructing"" the Biden administration's tireless efforts to help Americans and their checkbooks.

""Republicans are doing nothing but obstructing our efforts to crack down on gas-price gouging, lower food prices, lower healthcare costs, and hopefully, soon, lower your prescription drug costs,"" Biden said.

""This is not right,"" he added. ""And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important.""

The escalating rhetoric from Biden comes as the 2022 midterm elections inch closer.

Democrats, who could face significant losses, are trying to shed responsibility for economic woes — like sky-high inflation and record-high gas prices — because every poll shows those are the issues American voters believe are most important. Thus, Democrats believe that blame-shifting will deceive some voters into actually believing that Republicans, who do not control Congress or the White House, are responsible for economic problems.

Do people believe Biden?

Deflecting blame did not go over well. In fact, the social media response unearthed remarks from Biden that contradict his attempt to blame Republicans for problems happening under his watch.

In June 2020, Biden vowed: ""It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike [Donald Trump] I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.""

""It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike [Donald Trump] I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."" In April 2020, Biden said: ""The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.""

""The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job."" In August 2020, Biden promised: ""Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.""

And what about Russian President Vladimir Putin? As Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, pointed out, for months the Biden administration blamed skyrocketing gas prices and other economic woes on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So which is it? Republicans or Putin?

Biden says US troops will head 'in the near term' to NATO countries in Eastern Europe,"President Joe Biden said Friday evening that he would be sending U.S. troops to NATO countries in Eastern Europe ""in the near term.""

The decision is seen as a challenge to Russian Federation president Vladimir Putin, who has amassed more than a hundred thousand troops on the border with Ukraine.

Biden made the comments to reporters at Joint Base Andrews after returning from Pittsburgh where he gave a speech on infrastructure spending.

“I’ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe in the NATO countries in the near term,” said Biden. “Not too many.”

Numerous countries have made statements in support of Ukraine and have pledged to help defend the country if Russia invades. Moscow has denied any plans involving an attack on the former Soviet satellite country.

Biden has twice made statements that appeared to accept the possibility of an eminent invasion, but the White House has twice walked the statements back. Ukrainian officials have called on the U.S. president to stop creating panic about the tense situation.

He has also promised that Russia would face damaging economic sanctions if Putin follows through with a military attack.

Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley pressed for a diplomatic solution in a media briefing Friday and said that a Russian invasion would incur ""horrific"" costs.

“Given the type of forces that are arrayed, the ground maneuver forces, the artillery, the ballistic missiles, the air forces, all of it packaged together. If that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,” Milley explained.

But he said the U.S. was ready to defend its NATO ally.

""We are ready, capable and prepared to uphold our obligation under treaty to NATO,"" Milley said. ""An attack against one NATO ally is an attack against all.""

The Pentagon has placed about 8,500 troops on high alert in anticipation of deployment to Eastern Europe.

Biden is getting torched on social media for begging dictators to produce more oil after criticizing US oil production,"President Joe Biden is seeking to solve the oil crisis in the U.S. by begging foreign dictators and despots to increase their territories'' oil production and many on social media are torching him for it.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that they would not be seeking to increase domestic oil production and instead insisted that the crisis meant they should depend more on renewable sources.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” Psaki claimed. “The only way to protect U.S. over the long term is to become energy independent.""

Oil prices have been skyrocketing since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many in the U.S. are calling for the Biden administration to stop all oil imports from Russia while it continues to attack Ukrainian sovereignty.

Republicans and other critics of the administration criticized him on social media for seeking increased production from questionable foreign sources while seeking to shut down domestic producers of oil.

""It is wrong for the Biden Administration to beg for oil from Venezuela & legitimize Maduro’s communist regime during an official visit. The U.S. should hold Maduro accountable while increasing domestic energy production so we won’t need to rely on hostile regimes for energy,"" responded Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).

""Apparently Biden thinks producing more of our own oil in America is bad for the climate but somehow producing more oil in #Venezuela is not,"" tweeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).

""Gas is up 13% in just the past week. What will it take for Joe Biden to increase oil production in America?"" replied Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.).

""Gas wouldn’t be this expensive if Joe Biden opened up America’s oil pipelines,"" tweeted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). ""Anyone telling you otherwise is lying.""

""Biden should be turning to AMERICAN energy producers for more oil and gas—not dictators in Venezuela, Iran, and Saudi Arabia,"" tweeted Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.).

""Joe Biden would rather get oil from socialists in Venezuela than from American workers in Texas,"" added Rep. Lance Gooden (R-Texas.)

""At this point, the Biden administration is actively considering incentivizing both Iranian oil and Venezuelan oil, but has thus far shown no interest in incentivizing *checks notes* American oil. Up is down. Down is up,"" said Newsweek opinion editor Josh Hammer.

While the administration is now blaming oil companies for the high price of gas and claiming their policies have not reduced production, Biden previously said that it would be necessary to transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.

Also on Monday, the stock market continued to collapse over fears due to inflation and the continuing invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

Biden admin warns it 'will not be in a position to evacuate US citizens' from Ukraine if Russia invades. Critics compare it to Afghanistan debacle.,"The Biden administration warned over the weekend that it ""will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens"" from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion, and critics quickly drew comparisons to the administration's previous failures in Afghanistan.

What are the details?

Hundreds of thousands of Russian troops have been massing on the country's border with Ukraine in recent months, foreshadowing a possible invasion. Diplomatic attempts to resolve the tensions so far have appeared to fail.

In response to the military movements, the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of family members of diplomats and authorized the departure of some U.S. government employees.

The department previously increased Ukraine's travel advisory status to ""Level 4 — Do Not Travel"" due to Russia's military threat. In a news release Sunday, the State Department alerted U.S. citizens in the country that the U.S. government would essentially be unable to assist their evacuation in the event of a Russian attack.

""As President Biden has said, military action by Russia could come at any time and the United States government will not be in a position to evacuate American citizens in such a contingency, so U.S. citizens currently present in Ukraine should plan accordingly, including by availing themselves of commercial options should they choose to leave the country,"" the State Department said.

State Department officials reportedly echoed the same statements to reporters in a conference call.

""We've authorized the departure of some US government employees, but we have ordered the departure of all family members of US government employees at our Embassy in Kyiv. The State Department has also elevated our travel advisory for Ukraine to level four,"" a spokesman said, according to Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin.

What was the reaction?

Critics on social media quickly responded by slamming the Biden administration's efforts to help U.S. citizens trapped in war zones, or lack thereof. Many drew comparisons to the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, during which hundreds — if not thousands — of Americans were left behind amid a Taliban takeover of the country.

Oliver Jia posted, ""The U.S. to its citizens trapped in war zones,"" followed by a gif of a man throwing up the peace sign before disappearing.

What else?

Citing British intelligence, the Daily Beast reported on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has plans to install a pro-Russian regime in Kyiv and has identified former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevheniy Murayev as a potential front-runner to lead the takeover.

On Sunday, the Biden administration was said to be considering the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft to NATO allies in Eastern Europe as a deterrent to Russian action. But some experts said the action would be too little, too late.

Last week, President Biden stunned Ukrainian officials after he appeared to offer an incredibly weak response to Russia's threat in a long, rambling press conference. During the conference, Biden seemed to downplay a potential ""minor incursion"" by Russia in the coming days.

Ukrainian officials reportedly slammed Biden for effectively giving ""the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-ukraine-evacuation-russia-threat,2022-01-24
"Biden unveils new plan to target, punish oil companies for gas crisis he blames on Putin","President Joe Biden is asking Congress to punish oil companies for allegedly placing profits over oil production.

The allegations are the latest development in Biden's total abdication of any responsibility for the gas price crisis. Energy experts say the Biden administration's hostile policies are playing some role in the crisis, but the White House blames Russian President Vladimir Putin and oil companies.

While Russia's invasion of Ukraine undoubtedly shook the oil market, the White House has blamed oil companies for not using as many as 9,000 approved oil leases. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was making that claim before the war.

What are the details?

In an announcement, the White House pushed blame for the gas price crisis on oil companies, claiming they are putting profits over production.

""[T]oo many companies aren’t doing their part and are choosing to make extraordinary profits and without making additional investment to help with supply,"" the White House said in a statement.

To stop oil companies from their alleged profiteering, Biden wants Congress to impose fees on companies for not using approved leases.

""Today, President Biden is calling on Congress to make companies pay fees on wells from their leases that they haven’t used in years and on acres of public lands that they are hoarding without producing,"" the statement said.

""Companies that are producing from their leased acres and existing wells will not face higher fees,"" the White House continued. ""But companies that continue to sit on non-producing acres will have to choose whether to start producing or pay a fee for each idled well and unused acre.""

But what is the problem?

Three significant problems exist with the White House's claims.

First, while the oil industry is highly lucrative, it is also volatile. Although major oil companies measure annual revenue in the tens of billions of dollars, the same measuring standard applies to losses. In fact, the world's biggest integrated oil companies — ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Chevron, and TotalEnergies — lost more than $70 billion in 2020. That means gains in 2021 essentially offset losses from the previous year.

Second, many oil companies, while making investments in renewable sources, are slowing investments in fossil fuels because the U.S. government is enacting policies that are increasingly hostile toward oil. Why would a company make additional investments in oil, like the White House's statement indicates the Biden administration wants, if U.S. policy makes oil production untenable?

Third, not every approved oil lease is viable. In fact, the process of finding, acquiring, and developing oil under an approved lease is a lengthy one — only if oil exists under the land for which a lease is approved. To make matters worse, leases are often hung up by litigation and bureaucratic red tape.

Anne Bradbury — CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council, a national trade organization that represents oil companies — has called the White House's accusation a ""red herring.""

""It's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to continue right away,"" Bradbury told Fox Business. ""The fact is that industry is producing at a higher level on existing leases on federal lands than in the last 20 years and these leases take many years to explore, to develop and produce on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-unveils-new-plan-to-target-punish-oil-companies-for-gas-crisis-he-blames-on-putin,2022-03-31
"Bill Gates says Russian invasion of Ukraine will be 'good for the long run' because it will force countries to transition to green energy, praises ESG investments","Software developer Bill Gates declared that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be ""good for the long run"" because it will force European nations to embrace renewable green energy.

Gates appeared on CNBC's talk show ""The Exchange"" this week, where he pushed green energy alternatives over fossil fuels and touted efforts to promote the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiative.

""The 'E' part — lot of controversy, but there is a way to measure it, and it should be one of the factors people look at when they invest in companies,"" Gates said of the environmental aspect of ESG.

Gates commended BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as a ""great example of private-sector leadership"" in regard to climate change policy.

“Anyone who says that climate shouldn’t be a factor in how you evaluate the future of a company – that’s not capitalism,"" Gates claimed. ""Because companies that have emissions, they are going to be subject to border adjustment tariffs or taxes. If you’re dealing with severe weather events, that’s got to be factored in.""

Gates argued, ""Climate does affect the economy, which does affect investments.""



BlackRock is an investor in Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which aims to invest in green solutions that usher in a zero-carbon world. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire told Forbes that his Breakthrough Energy organization is ""only focused on investments that will have a substantial effect on climate change.""

Gates conceded that society can't stop using fossil fuels cold turkey because it's ""how people get to work today"" and "" how people avoid freezing to death in the winter.""

However, Gates said the transition to green energy still must happen. He said the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused a ""setback"" in the transition to green energy as European countries attempt to replace sanctioned fossil fuels from Russia.

""You know, it's a setback, you know, we need to find non-Russian hydrocarbon sources to substitute for those. So there's coal plants running and variety of things because you know, keeping people warm, keeping those economy's in decent shape is a priority,"" the Microsoft co-founder said on Tuesday.

""Now, on the other hand, it's good for the long run because people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas,"" Gates told CNBC’s Diana Olick. ""So they'll move to these new approaches more rapidly.""

The ""new approaches"" are likely green energy alternatives that the Breakthrough Energy organization plans to invest in.

Gates – who has a net worth of $101 billion – said efforts to combat climate change need to expand to things like green steel, green cement, and green hydrogen.

During the Breakthrough Energy Summit in Seattle this week, Gates said, ""The ultimate measure of success is global greenhouse gas emissions: We need to go from 51 billion tons a year to zero in the next three decades.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-gates-green-energy-esg,2022-10-20
Bill Maher asks why Putin invaded Ukraine under Biden not Trump,"Bill Maher roasted both political parties for manipulating Russia's invasion of Ukraine to score political points. The ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host also noted that it's ""worth asking"" why Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine when Joe Biden was in the White House and not when Donald Trump was president.

During the New Rules segment of Friday's episode, Maher blasted Americans for trying to make the war in Ukraine about them.

""Don’t make World War III all about you,"" Maher opened. ""Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to the thing we already hate.""

""All issues today: Pandemic, war, whatever, become a stress test for our reflexive partisanship,” he continued. “Can you take a vastly complex situation that is 100% not about your thing and somehow still make it about your thing? Our answer is, 'Watch me.'""



Maher noted that Republicans ""naturally"" blamed the invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden because they believe he is the ""worst president ever."" Maher also stated that Democrats feel the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened because they believe Donald Trump was the ""worst president ever.""

The liberal talk show host criticized Biden who asserted that Putin's latest aggression was brought on by the Jan. 6 riot.

During a speech about infrastructure on March 2, Biden claimed, ""Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to split up the United States. Look, how would you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament and kill five cops, injure 145? Or the German Bundestag or the Italian Parliament?""

Five Washington, D.C., police officers died following the Jan. 6 riots, however one died from a stroke and four others died because of purported suicides.

Maher asked the question, ""OK, but if Putin thought Trump was really that supportive of him, why didn't he invade when Trump was in office?""

""It's at least worth asking that question if you're not locked into one intransigent thought,"" Maher said.

Maher also questioned Trump's reason for Putin's invasion.

""Now, one guy we know is locked into one thought is Donald Trump, who was asked what went wrong with Ukraine said, 'Well, what went wrong was a rigged election.' Kanye thinks less about Pete Davidson than Trump thinks about the rigged election,"" Maher joked.

Maher was also befuddled by ""1619 Project"" author Nikole Hannah-Jones – who suggested that Ukraine was garnering attention because they ""appear white.""

The HBO host mentioned that there was a Vanity Fair piece that said the war in Ukraine is ""also a fight for LGBTQ rights.""

""Don't take this personally, but don't take everything personally,"" Maher said.

""Ukraine is not mostly about your pet grievances, it's about Vladimir Putin. And Putin is bad, very, very, very bad,"" he added and then joked, ""But he's still better than the guy who brings every conversation around to bitcoin.""

"Bill Maher says punishing the Russian people in response to the Ukrainian invasion is 'not fair,' says it would be 'racist' if Russians 'weren't white'","On Friday, late night television host Bill Maher took to the air to lambast people who are using the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine to condemn and ostracize Russian people who are not involved in any way with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war.

Fox News reported that Maher asked the panelists on his eponymous talk show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” “Do you think we’re, um, lumping the Russians too much with their government?”

He said, “I feel like in this country what we’re doing now, everything Russian is bad an every Russian is bad.”

“First of all, it’s not fair,” Maher continued, “If they weren’t white, I feel like we’d call that racism, you know. To lump everybody together – not every, I mean a lot of the Russian people don’t know what’s going on.”

One of Maher’s guests, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, suggested that the anti-Russian sentiment has spilled over and “gone way too far” after mentioning how Alexander Malofeev, the 20-year-old Russian piano prodigy, had his Canadian engagements canceled because of his Russian heritage.

Author Max Brooks, another of Maher’s guest panelists, said that the global ostracization of the Russian people is “unwise.”

He said, “What we were very smart about doing in World War II is, we knew the war was going to come to an end. And we knew that if we punished all Germans the way we did after World War I, we would back them into a corner.”

“So we crafted the narrative that ‘You Germans are led astray by Hitler,’” he continued, “because we knew, even if in some cases it wasn’t true, you know, we said to the average Nazi, you still got to run to the post office.”

Brooks, son of comedic legend Mel Brooks, said, “We have to think, we cannot back the Russians as an entire ethnic group into a corner. If we can separate Putin from the Russians in general, then we don’t only have a victory, we have a post-war plan.”

Maher, an avowed liberal-Democrat, has been considerably outspoken about the American government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

He criticized both the Democratic and Republican parties for making the conflict into partisan mess.

Maher said, “Don’t make World War III about you.

"Bill Maher hammers liberals who say masculinity is always toxic. 'Real Time' host praises males defending Ukraine, points out how 'the world still needs grown-ass men.'","Bill Maher laced into liberals who attack men for having supposed ""toxic masculinity."" The ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host used Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and men taking up arms to defend Ukraine from the Russian invasion as examples of how masculinity can be anything but toxic.

""If there's one thing we've learned from the crisis in Ukraine, it's that everyone loves, and the world still needs, grown-ass men,"" Maher began his rant.



Maher noticed that American women are obsessing over Zelenskyy, who the New York Post and Forward labeled as a ""sex symbol"" earlier this month. Maher stressed that progressives can't consider Zelenskyy a sex symbol while also denouncing masculinity as toxic.

The liberal talk show host jokingly hypothesized, ""Could it be that as much as women may want to create the perfect man there's always going to be a little bit of toxic mixed in with our masculinity and no amount of training will turn us into your favorite 'Twilight' character.""



""Masculinity is like coffee even when you decaffeinated, there's still a little caffeine in there,"" Maher quipped.

""Now there's certainly no denying that there has been a lot of toxicity associated with men throughout history, oceans of brutality, all of which is horrible, and some of which is why our species still exists on earth,"" Maher acknowledged.

""There are brave women fighting in Ukraine, but the images of people fleeing all seem to be women and children while every able-bodied man in Ukraine is sticking around to fight and maybe die,"" Maher noted. Ukraine has prohibited most Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 from fleeing the country, forcing them to defend against the Russian invasion.

""It's not always a great advantage being a man and toxic though we may be,"" he proclaimed. ""We do sometimes come in handy.""



""Turns out after 200,000 years, there's still a lot of 'Another tribe is coming to kill us.' And when that happens, you want a little big d*** energy,"" Maher said of military conflicts.

Maher remarked that for years he has been told that ""women just want a man who listens"" and ""won't try to fix their problems. He dared, ""Put that to the test sometime. Go over to her house tomorrow and fix her radiator. I bet she loves it.""

""When there's a noise downstairs, someone has to go into the dark and most women still want a man to do it,"" Maher joked. ""And if he doesn't, or can't or won't, it's not sexy.""

The HBO host shared a study that American adults having sex hit a 30-year low. He highlighted a study that one in four adults in the U.S. haven't had sex in the past year. Maher also pointed out how sperm counts of U.S. men have been drastically declining over decades.

Maher questioned the manlihood of today's American male, and suggested it could be because of the constant lecturing about toxic masculinity.

""It's the result of having it drilled into us in recent years that masculinity is itself toxic and scary and unevolved,"" he proposed. ""And women don't like it and the ones who think they do they really don't. And if you think you do, you're wrong, too.""

""Even the act of just asking a girl out is now seen by many younger people as overly aggressive,"" he said. ""There's a feeling that the attributes traditionally characteristic of men are inherently problematic. Which sounds a lot like men are born wrong.""

Maher lashed out at the Obama administration for using a man who became known as ""pajama boy"" to try to ""sell Obamacare to a skeptical nation.""

Maher ridiculed the marketing of Obamacare, ""This is what they put out as an image of the perfect man. The only thing he loves more than affordable health insurance is his therapy cat and 'Emily in Paris.' That ad might as well say, 'Ask your doctor if chemical castration is right for you.'""



Regarding the ""pajama boy"" campaign, there was a Politico opinion piece at the time titled: ""Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child.""

""You could win the battle and lose the war if you harangue men into becoming less like us and more like you,"" Maher stated.



""Women aren't attracted to these girly men they've created,"" Maher declared. ""The guy you whipped into total sensitivity isn't sexy to you anymore.""

Maher joked, ""There's a special place in a woman's heart for a man who learns to suppress his masculinity, it's called the 'friendzone.'""

Maher then lambasted men for ""sulking"" and ""complaining"" about not being able to be with a woman.

""Girls don't want to have sex with you unless you put in a little effort,"" Maher exclaimed. ""So put in a low effort. Yes, stupid lazy f***s.""

Biological male wins female beauty pageant in Nevada,"A transgender person is now one step closer to being crowned Miss USA.

Kataluna Enriquez, a biological male, won the Miss Silver State USA pageant this week, an event considered the biggest preliminary competition for the Miss Nevada USA pageant, KVVU-TV reported.

The outlet called it a ""monumental win"" for Enriquez, who will now move on to the statewide competition in the pageant circuit that leads to Miss USA and, eventually, the Miss Universe competition.

The pageants, collectively run by the Miss Universe Organization, were once owned by former President Donald Trump and are widely recognized for awarding among the most coveted crowns in the pageant world.

In an interview with the local news outlet after the victory, Enriquez called the experience ""a celebration of womanhood and diversity and this celebration of being your true self.""

First transgender titleholder crowned Miss Silver State USA youtu.be

But Enriquez noted that she has not always been so well liked in the pageant world. She recalled at a previous pageant, which she chose not to name in the report, when event organizers found out she was a transgender, they required her to provide medical documents to prove she was female. The organizers also allegedly refused to assign her a roommate.

""I was asked to provide documents that were invasive in my opinion physically asking me to get a letter from my doctor,"" Enriquez said. ""It brought me back to a time where I felt like I was not welcome.""

But according to KVVU-TV, Enriquez said instead of shying away from her transgender identity based on past experiences she has decided to make ""awareness of the transgender community"" her pageant platform.

That message evidently resonated in the Miss Silver State USA pageant and may prove to benefit Enriquez in upcoming competitions, especially as transgenderism gains popularity in progressive circles and pressure mounts to avoid even the slightest appearance of discrimination.

Over the last few years, pageant organizations have started to receive entries from more and more biological males and have been hit with backlash upon denying the participants from competing.

In 2018, Angela Ponce, winner of that year's Miss Universe Spain pageant, was at one point the favorite to be crowned Miss Universe.

The Miss Nevada USA pageant is scheduled for June, according to the report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biological-male-wins-female-nevada-beauty-pageant,2021-03-18
Biological men no longer permitted to compete in Idaho women’s sports. Here come the lawsuits.,"Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) signed a new law prohibiting biological males from competing in women's sports across the state.

Now advocacy groups are suing, insisting that the move violates constitutional rights.

What are the details?

In late March, Little signed House Bill 500, the Fairness for Women in Sports Act, into law that prevents biological men from competing in women's sports.

A portion of the new law states, ""The legislature finds that there are 'inherent differences between men and women,'"" and points out that the courts have, indeed ""recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic capabilities.""

""Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex,"" the newly signed law points out. ""If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex-based solely on: (a) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy; (b) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and (c) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup.""

The new law will permit testing of qualified candidates to ensure that they meet the standards of biologically female athletes.

The law is set to go into effect beginning July 1 and applies to all sports teams sponsored by public schools, colleges, and universities.

What has been the response?

On Wednesday, Forbes reported that the American Civil Liberties Union and gender advocacy group Legal Voice filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state's new law.

The groups insist that the new law violates constitutional privacy as well as discrimination protections, including the Equal Rights Amendment and Title IX.

The ACLU — which threatened to sue in March over the bill — is requesting the court permanently prevent the state from enforcing the law.

Gabriel Arkles, senior staff attorney with the ACLU, told The Associated Press that the law ""illegally targets women and girls who are transgender and intersex and subjects all female athletes to the possibility of invasive genital and genetic screenings.""

""In Idaho and around the country, transgender people of all ages have been participating in sports consistent with their gender identity for years,"" Arkles insisted. ""Inclusive teams support all athletes and encourage participation — this should be the standard for all school sports.""

Anything else?

Rep. Barbara Ehardt (R) — the bill's co-sponsor — took to Facebook to quell the media outrage on March 31.

She wrote, ""Today Governor Little signed H500, Fairness in Women's Sports Act. I have been working on this legislation for 20 months. As both a former Division I Women's Basketball player and Division I Women's basketball Coach for over 15 years, I know first hand that as females, we cannot compete against the inherent physiological advantages that boys & men have.""

""Title IX, as well as the women who went before me and helped to pave the way forward, changed my life,"" Ehardt continued. ""I have always felt it incumbent on me to do the same for those who followed. H500 will continue to￼ ensure opportunities for girls & women as we move forward.""

""As for the media, this is not anti anything, it is pro opportunities for biological girls & women, just as it has been for the past 48 years under Title IX. Thank you Governor Brad Little,"" she concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biological-men-no-longer-permitted-to-compete-in-idaho-womens-sports,2020-04-20
Bipartisan House majority rebukes President Trump's actions on Syria with resolution,"An overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution on Wednesday to criticize President Donald Trump's recent foreign policy moves regarding Syria and Turkey.

In a 354-60 vote, the lower chamber passed a resolution ""Opposing the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria."" All 60 votes against the resolution were from Republicans while 129 Republicans voted with the majority.

Last week, President Trump announced a decision to move troops out of a part of northern Syria ahead of a planned Turkish offensive in the area. Following the start of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria, the president tweeted on Monday that he would authorizing sanctions against Turkey, accusing the country of ""endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region.""

Wednesday's measure was sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Elliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and the committee's top Republican Mike McCaul (Texas).



""The measure we're considering today will send an unambiguous, bipartisan, hopefully bicameral rejection of Trump's policy in Syria,"" Engel said ahead of the vote. ""Today, we make clear that the Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and we want nothing to do with this disastrous policy.""

""The Kurds are being slaughtered as I speak in northern Syria,"" McCaul said on the House floor ahead of the vote. ""Our allies must trust us and our enemies must fear us. That is my foreign policy.""

The measure takes no hard actions to change U.S. policy or troop placement, but merely expresses Congress' opposition to the president's actions, which have drawn considerable criticism from Democrats and Republicans. It also calls on the president to produce ""present a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS.""

On Wednesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to bring the measure up for a vote in the upper chamber.

""If there's an overwhelming vote for this resolution, the president will feel tremendous pressure to reverse course,"" Schumer told reporters.



At a different news conference ahead of the vote, McConnell said that his team was looking at taking up the House's resolution, but did not commit to doing so. He also voiced his disagreement's with the president's decision.

""Any president has a lot of latitude in deploying troops, many of us have been arguing that this was a mistake, that it shouldn't have been done and hoping that he would reverse course,"" McConnell said. ""There seems to be any evidence of it so far, but I think it was a mistake.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bipartisan-house-majority-rebukes-trumps-actions-on-syria-with-resolution,2019-10-16
Bipartisan lawmakers letter to Fauci on NIAID funding of tests on dogs,"A bipartisan group of United States lawmakers demanded answers regarding a report that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases used taxpayer money to fund ""cruel"" and ""costly"" experiments on dogs as young as six months old. The letter regarding possible animal abuse was sent to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

""We write with grave concerns about reports of costly, cruel, and unnecessary taxpayer-funded experiments on dogs commissioned by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,"" the bipartisan letter signed by 24 lawmakers, spearheaded by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), reads.

The letter cites a damning report from the White Coat Waste Project that claims that 44 beagle puppies — all between the ages of six and eight months old — were subjected to ""commissioned tests"" for a drug. The experiments involved ""injecting and force-feeding the puppies an experimental drug for several weeks, before killing and dissecting them.""

According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there was an invoice to the NIAID for a ""cordectomy,"" an invasive surgical procedure also known as ""debarking"" and ""devocalization"" that removes the dog's vocal cords so that the animal can no longer bark, howl, or cry.

""This cruel procedure — which is opposed with rare exceptions by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, and others — seems to have been performed so that experimenters would not have to listen to the pained cries of the beagle puppies. This is a reprehensible misuse of taxpayer funds,"" the legislators wrote.

""Our investigators show that Fauci's NIH division shipped part of a $375,800 grant to a lab in Tunisia to drug beagles and lock their heads in mesh cages filled with hungry sand flies so that the insects could eat them alive,"" White Coat Waste told The Hill. ""They also locked beagles alone in cages in the desert overnight for nine consecutive nights to use them as bait to attract infectious sand flies.""

White Coat Waste reports that documents show the NIAID spent $1.68 million in American taxpayer funds on drug tests involving the beagle puppies.

The White Coat Waste Project — a nonprofit government watchdog group — demands to know why these experiments are being conducted when the Food and Drug Administration does not require new drugs to be tested on dogs.

The lawmakers want Fauci to reveal how many drug tests have been performed on dogs since January 2018, as well as what are the total costs and what is the justification for them.

Mace's letter was also signed by Reps. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa), Cliff Bentz (R-Ore.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), Rick Crawford (R-Ark.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Scott Franklin (R-Fla.), Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Fred Keller (R-Pa.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.), Brian Mast (R-Fla.), Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Bill Posey (R-Fla.), Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), Maria E. Salazar (R-Fla.), Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.).

Rep. Nancy Mace Leads Bipartisan Letter Demanding Answers from Dr. Fauci www.youtube.com

In August, reports surfaced that the NIAID directed $424,455 to the University of Georgia Research Foundation to test an experimental drug on beagles. The experiments subjected dozens of healthy beagles to biting flies that were carrying a disease-causing parasite that can affect humans. The records obtained under a FOIA request show that the dogs ""vocalized pain"" during the tests. The experiments were said to have allowed 28 beagles to ""develop infections for three months before being euthanized for blood collection.""

Former WH COVID-19 coordinator says officials never promised vaccines would prevent infection,"Former White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said Wednesday that although more than half of Americans have been infected with the COVID-19 virus or vaccinated, the U.S. has still not met a herd immunity threshold to end the pandemic.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data on Tuesday showing that nearly 60% of Americans have coronavirus antibodies in their blood. The number of children with COVID-19 antibodies is even higher — almost 75% of children 11 and younger have antibodies, providing at least some protection from the virus.

Even so, CDC officials are still encouraging people to get vaccinated to increase protection against severe disease, and Birx echoed their concerns, adding that the U.S. is still far from herd immunity against the virus.



""The issue with herd immunity, we know natural infection and we know now vaccination doesn't lead to long-term protection against infection,"" Birx said on ""America's Newsroom.""

""So this isn't like measles, mumps, and rubella, where you get [the vaccine] and you're protected for a long time. We know now with this virus that natural infection and the immunity that you develop does not lead to durable long-term protection.""

""The only time you could talk about herd immunity is when you know that you have durable protection,"" she added.

Her comments come just a day after White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the U.S. is ""out of the pandemic phase,"" but that the U.S. will never ""eradicate this virus.""

Fauci told PBS NewsHour that people may need to get vaccine boosters yearly and for ""longer"" than they expect in order to keep virus infections low.

""That might be every year, that might be longer, in order to keep that level low. But, right now, we are not in the pandemic phase in this country,"" said.

Watch:



Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer suggested that the messaging from public health officials on the vaccines has been ""confusing."" He asked Birx if the government's messaging about the vaccines failed, noting that breakthrough infections among those who are fully vaccinated and even boosted against COVID-19 have caused people to question the efficacy of the vaccines.



Birx, who is on a media tour this week to promote her new tell-all book about her time with the Trump administration, answered that the government has failed to be fully transparent with the American people, which she says has led to distrust in public health officials and misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccines.



""In everybody's head was, 'this is like measles, mumps, and rubella,' because that's what we know. So they thought that they were superhuman and invincible once they were vaccinated,"" but that wasn't the case, Birx said.



""I made it very clear to the president and vice president that this vaccine was never studied to create what we call sterilizing immunity, the invincibility to never be infected again,"" she said. ""And I think the White House understood that, and frankly we made it very clear it was never studied to do anything but protect against severe disease and hospitalization, which it's done a pretty good job about.""



The record is not as clear as Birx suggests. It is true that in late 2020, before the COVID-19 vaccines were released widely, both Fauci and BIrx warned that scientists were unsure that the vaccines would prevent infection, even though they appeared to be effective against severe disease.



But at times, Fauci favorably compared the COVID-19 vaccines to other vaccinations such as the polio vaccine, which eradicated that disease. And once the vaccine rollout ramped up in February and March 2021, he touted studies that suggested vaccination slowed the spread of infections, before backtracking months later once the Delta surge demonstrated that fully vaccinated people could still have breakthrough infections.

BlackRock president warns 'entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice' that they will soon face shock due to major shortages: 'Put on your seatbelts',"The president of the world's largest asset management company just issued a stark warning to members of America's ""entitled generation.""

BlackRock co-founder and president Robert Kapito said Tuesday that the global supply chain and soaring inflation crises will soon have dramatic effects on the U.S. economy that will result in a noticeable scarcity of goods not experienced before by many younger Americans.

That scarcity, he said, will likely be a shock to the system for many who are accustomed to an abundant and comfortable lifestyle.

""For the first time, this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want,"" Kapito said, adding, ""We have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.""

""I would put on your seatbelts, because this is something that we haven’t seen,"" he asserted, in reference to what he called ""scarcity inflation.""

Kapito's remarks, first reported by Bloomberg News, were made at the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association convention — an annual gathering of oil and gas industry leaders.

The warning comes just days after Bloomberg economists advised Americans to consider budgeting an extra $5,200 this year — or $433 monthly — to prepare for the effects of historically high inflation.

Inflation under the Biden administration has skyrocketed in the past year, rising at the fastest pace in four decades. Inflation is measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which increased nearly 8% over the past 12 months, according to government data released for February 2022.

The dramatically inflated prices have reportedly resulted in 64% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.

The last time inflation rose at such a fast rate was in 1982. That year, the U.S. economy went into a recession. Now, some experts are warning that another economic recession is ""inevitable.""

The Biden administration has been peddling a litany of excuses for the economic downturn — including the coronavirus pandemic, corporate greed, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine — but American voters reportedly aren't buying it.

A plurality of respondents to a recent NBC News poll (38%) blamed President Joe Biden for the increase in the cost of consumer goods, while just 28% blamed the coronavirus pandemic, 23% blamed corporations raising prices, and only 6% blamed Putin.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blackrock-inflation-scarcity-entitled-generation,2022-03-31
Sec. of State Blinken says Putin wants to advance beyond Ukraine as White House is hit hard over 'failed' diplomatic strategy: 'Putin was playing Biden all along',"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that Russia's military invasion of Ukraine is likely only part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's designs for the European continent.

Blinken made the remarks in an interview with CBS News managing editor Norah O'Donnell. When asked by O'Donnell if the U.S. had any specific intelligence indicating Putin will advance beyond Ukraine, the nation's top diplomat shrugged off the question, suggesting it's obvious.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants,"" Blinken said. ""He's made clear that he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.""

Blinken made it clear that any attack on a NATO member country would trigger a global response.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders, there's something very powerful standing in his way,"" Blinken noted. ""That's Article 5 of NATO — an attack on one is an attack on all. It's exactly why we've been reinforcing NATO's eastern flank.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on alarming developments in Ukraine www.youtube.com

It remains to be seen, however, what strength of response NATO countries, including the U.S., would offer. President Biden has thus far been tepid and diplomatic in his approach to Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe. Though it depends on who you ask. In a press conference Thursday, Biden responded to Russia's unprovoked military invasion by unleashing a slew of sanctions he said would be ""devastating"" — in ""another month or so.""

The U.S. has also been supplying weapons to the Ukrainian government, as well. But when pressed by reporters Thursday on whether more could be done — such as personally sanctioning Putin and removing Russia from SWIFT, an international banking cooperative, for starters — Biden demurred.

Politico reported Thursday that Putin was ""playing Biden all along."" Reuters, too, reported that Biden's negotiating returned zero results. Other voices, some notorious, chimed in with varying degrees of criticism.

Despite the president's tough rhetoric toward the would-be tyrant in the past, during meetings this year, Biden attempted to appeal to Putin's reason, pleading with him to ""return to diplomacy"" for the sake of Russia's ""credibility worldwide,"" the Politico report stated.

With the launch of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine this week, Putin proved that Biden's reasoning and emotional appeals had little effect on him.

""Biden’s appeals to Putin’s geopolitical ego didn’t work,"" the report added. ""For Biden and his team, it is a deeply frustrating moment. Their strategy toward Russia has largely failed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blinken-says-putin-wants-to-advance-beyond-ukraine,2022-02-25
"Democratic Sen. Blumenthal, CNN place blame on President Trump for New Zealand massacre","Hours after a horrific mass murder occurred in New Zealand on Friday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) wasted little time in placing blame on President Donald Trump — joining a CNN anchor in saying the president's rhetoric played a role in the killings.

What are the details?

During an interview on CNN's ""New Day,"" host Alisyn Camerota began by asking the senator for his take on the tragedy and ""a rise in right-wing extremist around the globe."" After extending his condolences to the victims and their families, Blumenthal pointed to Trump's rhetoric as a prompt for the murders.

""Words do have consequences, and we know that at the very pinnacle of power in our own country, people are talking about good people on both sides,"" Blumenthal said, referring to the president's comments following a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

""You mean the president talking about it,"" Camerota pressed. ""I mean I know it's hard to call this out. I've heard this from a guest this morning, they're having a hard time calling this out for some reason.""

Blumenthal responded, ""I think it's more than the president. It's the people who enable him and who fail to stand up to him and speak out.""

""Words have consequences, like saying we have an 'invasion' on our border, and talking about people as though they were different in some fatal way,"" he continued. ""I think the public discourse from the president on down is a factor in some of these actions.""

Camerota suggested the link was a fact rather than speculation, saying, ""I mean, we don't have to guess, actually, at this. We don't have to connect the dots ourselves. This is what the suspects say. This guy put out, according to authorities, put out this manifesto where he connects the dots between the rhetoric that he likes to hear and his violent action.""

Politico reported that at least 49 people were killed at two mosques during the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, and dozens more injured. A man in his late 20s has been taken into custody and charged with murder, and three other people have been arrested in connection with the horrific crimes.

The main suspect in the killings published a 73-page manifesto ahead of the attacks, in which he said he was inspired by the Norway murderer who killed 77 people in 2011, according to the Daily Mail.

In the writings, he also referred to President Trump as ""a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose,"" and said ""the person that has influenced me above all was [black conservative pundit] Candace Owens.""

The suspect also referred to himself as an ""Eco-Fascist by nature,"" and wrote that ""the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.""

According to Newsweek, ""many observers pointed out that the manifesto contained what is known online as 's**t posting,' the practice of posting outrageous comments to elicit an emotional reaction in viewers and distract from the real meaning of the post."" The outlet added, ""The comments about Trump may have been just that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blumenthal-cnn-blame-trump-for-new-zealand-massacre,2019-03-15
Police body cam video shows cops shoot Tucson man who threatened police dog,"Bodycam video shows the disturbing moment when Arizona cops fatally shoot a man after he pointed a loaded gun at a police dog.

Tucson Police Department SWAT officers were conducting surveillance on 49-year-old Francisco Javier Galarza. Police were tracking Galarza – who had active felony arrest warrants for a home invasion and bank robbery.

At 11:51 a.m. on Aug. 25, Tucson SWAT police spotted Galarza at a Circle K convenience store. The suspect exited the store.

""He's out, just say when,"" an officer is heard saying in the bodycam footage. Another officer responds, ""Take him here.""

Police officers confronted Galarza in the store's parking lot, and he immediately ran away.

Officers yell at the fleeing suspect, “Police! Get down! Police! Get down!”

Cops chase Galazra with guns drawn.

Officer Barrie Pedersen released his police dog named Kiro. The K-9 trips up the suspect, and he falls to the ground. The police dog bites Galarza in the leg.

Galarza then pulls out a handgun and points it at the dog's head.

Tucson Police Department Officers Ernest Ortiz and Pedersen responded by opening fire on the armed suspect. Galarza dropped the firearm.

Officers attempted life-saving procedures, but Galarza was pronounced dead at the scene.

Galarza had in his possession a Taurus G3 9mm semi-automatic with ammunition in the magazine and one round in the chamber.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department and Marana Police Department have launched a criminal investigation into the police shooting. The Tucson Police Department's Office of Professional Standards will conduct a separate, parallel investigation into the fatal shooting.

Ortiz is a 17-year Tucson Police Department veteran, and Pedersen is a 15-year veteran.

Galarza has a lengthy criminal history, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections.



""In 1992, he was sentenced to three years in prison as part of the shock incarceration program, KOLD-TV reported. ""In 1994, he was convicted of drug possession and was sentenced to four years.""



The outlet reported that Galarza was convicted of vehicle theft in 2000 and was convicted on six counts of armed robbery armed. In 2001, he was convicted of armed robbery again and received an 11-year jail sentence.

In 2011, Galarza was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 7 years.

The Pima Regional Critical Incident Team released bodycam video of the deadly police shooting on Monday.

MSNBC viewers melt down on social media after John Bolton says Biden has failed to handle the Ukraine crisis,"MSNBC viewers lashed out at the progressive cable news channel after veteran journalist Andrea Mitchell interviewed John Bolton about the Biden administration's failures in Ukraine.

The former national security advisor in the Trump administration criticized President Joe Biden for failing to proactively prevent Russia's invasion into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic.

""I think [Russian President] Putin was undoubtedly waiting for a second Trump term. but he's getting almost effectively what he would have expected then,"" said Bolton. ""This is gonna be a victory for Russia.""

""You think that what the Biden administration is doing, rallying the NATO allies,"" Mitchell replied before getting interrupted.

""It has failed,"" Bolton fired back. ""The president has said it has failed.

They went on to debate whether NATO was more unified under the real threat of Russian invasion or whether it remained divided, but the viewers were not impressed by Bolton's presence on the show or Mitchell's reactions to his critique.

""I don’t want to hear John Bolton’s opinion on what we should be doing with Russia or anything for that matter,"" tweetedfailed congressional candidate Richard Ojeda.

""Literally the last person on earth who should be giving foreign policy advice right now. Perpetually incorrect bloodthirsty warmonger,"" replied YouTuber Kyle Kulinski.

""I would literally interview satan about Russia/Ukraine before even asking John Bolton how he likes his coffee,"" read one very popular tweet.

""Why would @andreamitchell give air time to a filthy traitor like john bolton? I despise her, for good reason,"" read another popular tweet.

Putin announced in an angry rant on Monday that Russia would be sending what he termed as ""peacekeepers"" into separatist regions of the former Soviet republic. Ukrainian leaders have warned that the ruse was likely a precursor to Russian forces seizing control of the country. Putin also said that other former Soviet republics should have never been allowed to leave Russia.

Bolton has fallen out of favor with supporters of former President Donald Trump after Bolton made damaging claims about him in a book he wrote after leaving the White House in 2019.

"Border Patrol nabs more than 700 illegal immigrants in El Paso overnight, including two convicted sex offenders","Authorities apprehended more than 700 illegal immigrants in El Paso overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Two convicted sex offenders were among those detained. The men had attempted to enter the U.S. with larger groups of immigrants that agents were processing.

""Both sex offenders were arrested in different groups attempting to enter the United States illegally evading Border Patrol agents. Both subjects had been convicted of their sex offenses and had served time in jail before being deported from the United States,"" CBP said in a news release Thursday.

An unaccompanied 2-year-old was also found among one of the large groups, according to CBP.

The immigrants, mostly from Central America, had traveled primarily in large groups through Mexico before crossing into the U.S. The influx of crossings continued into Thursday to bring the total to more than 1,000 over a two-day period, KTSM-TV reported.

Has the number of illegal crossings increased in El Paso?

The recent apprehensions were among the largest number of illegal immigrants taken into custody in El Paso in recent years.

The number of unaccompanied children (those younger than 18 years old) who've been taken into federal custody in El Paso has spiked by 296 percent this fiscal year over 2018, according to recently released CBP data.

From October 2017 to February 2018, there were 1,355 unaccompanied minors apprehended. Since October, there have been more than 5,372.

And the number of those captured, while traveling as family units, has exploded by 1,689 percent, according to CBP data.

Agents in El Paso have taken in more than 36,298 traveling as family units since October, up from 2,029 during the same period during the fiscal year 2018.

One of the large groups was reportedly made up of mostly women and children from Brazil, Guatemala, and Honduras to Mexico.

One man said he had traveled with his daughter for days because he wanted to escape poverty in his home country.

""That's why we're pursuing this dream to travel to the United States so we can help our families, help my daughter who is here with me so she can go to school,"" Andres Martinez told KTSM before he was detained.

What about the drug smugglers?

But authorities said the immigrants are merely a diversion for drug smugglers.

""They're using these individuals to try to coordinate movements and try to get our agents to create gaps in the coverage and that way they can try to exploit those gaps for the criminal aliens,"" Border Patrol spokesman Joe Romero told the news outlet. ""We're talking about the felons. The wanted individuals, the pedophiles, the rapists, the murderers. They are trying to smuggle them past our agents by inundating them with groups like this.""

According to Romero, the smugglers are the ones who are controlling the movement of the immigrants and where they attempt to cross from Mexico into the U.S.



A smaller group of six was also arrested Wednesday.

A ""28-year-old U.S. citizen and self-proclaimed prison gang member, was found to have an outstanding federal warrant for escape. In addition, the subject has a lengthy criminal record. The subject was remanded to the custody to the U.S. Marshals Service. The other five aliens are currently being processed accordingly,"" according to the CBP release. ""Criminal organizations continue to attempt to distract and occupy Border Patrol agents, however their continued vigilance and experience is stopping these attempts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-patrol-nabs-700-illegals-overnight,2019-03-08
The party's over for Boris Johnson: UK prime minster resigns amid scandal,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation Thursday and will step down as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister following multiple scandals and significant loss of support from members of his party. Johnson indicated that he would remain as prime minister until the Tories can elect a new leader.

In a short address delivered from the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London, Johnson said it was ""clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader ... and therefore a new prime minister.""

He thanked voters for handing Conservatives ""the biggest Conservative majority since 1987"" in the landslide election of 2019 and said he was grateful for the accomplishments of his government, which include Brexit, managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and ""standing up to Putin"" after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Johnson said he would have preferred to remain prime minister, but that ""the herd instinct is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves.""

He was referring to the fact that dozens of Conservative ministers had resigned from his government this week, following revelations that Johnson had named Conservative MP Chris Pincher to his government even though he was aware of sexual misconduct allegations against him. Pincher resigned from Parliament last week amid new allegations that he sexually assaulted two men at a club.

Conservative lawmakers were already on the verge of breaking from Johnson after the so-called ""Partygate"" scandal — allegations that Johnson had hosted parties and other intimate gatherings at his residence during the pandemic in violation of the U.K.'s lockdown rules. Last month, Johnson faced a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but survived by winning simple majority support from Conservative lawmakers.



However, the new Pincher scandal was the straw that broke the camel's back. Beginning with Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor Rishi Sunak's resignations Wednesday morning, at least 59 of Johnson's ministers exited his government, leaving him scrambling to find enough new ministers to continue governing.

When it became clear he could not fill his government, Johnson resigned.

""In the last few days I've tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much, and when we have such a vast mandate, and when we're actually only a handful of points behind in the polls even in midterm after quite a few months of pretty relentless sledging,"" Johnson said.

""I regret not to have been successful in those arguments and, of course, it's painful not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,"" he continued.

Adding that no politician is indispensable, Johnson said, ""our brilliant and Darwinian system will produce another leader,"" to whom he will pledge his full support.

Boston Globe editorial staff: Trump has ‘blood on his hands’ for coronavirus response,"The Boston Globe editorial board said that President Donald Trump has ""blood on his hands"" for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in an editorial published Monday.

The writers called the president ""epically outmatched"" by the global pandemic, and argued that his delayed response to the outbreak — including his administration's refusal to adopt the World Health Organization's diagnostic test — ""will cost thousands if not hundreds of thousands of American lives.""

""As the American public braces itself for the worst of this crisis, it's worth remembering that the reach of the virus here is not attributable to an act of God or a foreign invasion, but a colossal failure of leadership,"" the editorial began.

""The months the administration wasted with prevarication [lies] about the threat and its subsequent missteps will amount to exponentially more COVID-19 cases than were necessary,"" it continued.

""In other words, the president has blood on his hands,"" the writers concluded.

The editorial staff maintained that the president's inaction must not go unpunished, however, asserting that ""come November, there must be a reckoning for the lives lost.""

America disagrees

The vehemently negative opinion shared by the Boston Globe editorial board is out of step with the rest of America, who approve of Trump's handling of the coronavirus by a slight margin, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.

The editorial staff seem to paint a picture of a rogue president acting out of order and without the support of public health officials and state political officials. But, that is simply not the reality of the situation.

Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the two leading health officials on the Trump administration's coronavirus task force, came to Trump's defense Tuesday after a White House reporter launched a similar accusation at the president, suggesting that his delayed response to the virus cost countless lives.

""This may be an uncomfortable question, what would the models have looked like, that Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci showed us, if we had started the social distancing guidelines sooner in February, or January, when China and South Korea were doing those sorts of things,"" asked CNN reporter Jim Acosta in reference to updated death toll projections.

Birx hit back saying that a lack of information about the virus from China hampered the U.S. response.

Fauci went further, dismantling the question's assumptions and scolding Acosta for seeking a media soundbite.

As of Wednesday morning, more than 190,000 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., which had resulted in over 4,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. As confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise in America, on Tuesday, Trump warned of a ""painful two weeks"" ahead for the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-globe-trump-coronavirus-blood,2020-04-01
"Boy, 11, bashes intruder in head with machete while home alone: 'You're better off to get a job than breaking into other people's houses'","On Friday, 11-year-old Braydon Smith stayed home alone for a few hours for the very first time, the News & Observer reported.

And his solo debut manning his home in Mebane, North Carolina, will be one he certainly won't forget.

What happened?



About 11 a.m. Braydon was on the phone with his mother when 19-year-old Jataveon Dashawn Hall allegedly entered the home through a window, WTVD-TV reported.

""He pointed a pellet gun at me that was located in our house. I knew that it wasn't loaded, so I just sat down and got in my closet like he told me to,"" Braydon recalled to the station. ""He went into the living room to grab my phone to make sure I didn't call the 911 or anything.""

Of course, there was the machete on Braydon's bedroom wall that he purchased with gift cards and typically uses to chop down trees, WTVD said.

And this time the machete would prove useful in a different way.

""When I saw him try to put [my phone] in his pocket. I grabbed my machete off of my wall and went to hit him,"" Braydon told the station. ""I hit him in the back of the head like right here.""

Image source: WTVD-TV video screenshot

The boy also had a few pieces of advice for the intruder, WTVD reported: ""You shouldn't have done what you've done. You're better off to get a job than breaking into other people's houses.""

The station said in an earlier story that the intruder kicked Braydon in the stomach — after which the boy got up, swung the machete again, and missed. The intruder then kicked Braydon in the side of the head, grabbed several items, but noticed he was bleeding profusely due to the kid's machete strike, WTVD said. So the intruder ran off, the station said.

What happened to the intruder?

Hall checked himself into a hospital after the incident, the News & Observer reported. There was apparent confusion between law enforcement and hospital staff regarding Hall's status, and he ended up leaving the hospital in his gown before being arrested Sunday at the home of his mother and stepfather, the paper said.

Image source: WTVD-TV video screenshot

Hall has been charged with breaking and entering, second-degree kidnapping, interfering with emergency communications, and assault on a child under 12, the News & Observer reported. He was taken to jail under a $100,000 secured bail, the paper added.

Two other suspects allegedly connected to the incident — a man and a woman — have not been identified, the News & Observer said.



'If they come in the door, you let 'em have it'



Braydon told WTVD he wasn't scared during the home invasion.

""It went by really fast,"" he told the station. ""I knew I didn't have the time to think about what I was going to do. I just grabbed a weapon in the house and acted with it.""



Braydon's decision had a lot to do with advice his dad, Christopher Smith, gave him a few years ago when thieves ransacked their home, WTVD reported.

""If they come in the door, you let 'em have it,"" his dad said, the station noted.

Image source: WTVD-TV video screenshot

Braydon's mom, Kaitlin Johnson, who lives in Kentucky, told the News & Observer that her son is taking his sudden fame in stride.



""He has made national news, so I think at 11, he kind of thinks he's somebody,"" she told the paper, adding that she and Braydon's father have taught him to be responsible and to stand up for himself.

""You never think it's going to happen to your kid,"" Johnson added to the News & Observer. ""We are a family that [believes] violence is not the answer, but you defend yourself. You don't allow yourself to be bullied. You do not allow yourself to let people run all over you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boy-11-bashes-intruder-in-head-with-machete-while-home-alone,2019-06-18
5-year-old boy caught on video taking on gunman during home invasion,"A stunning video captures the moment a 5-year-old boy can be seen taking on a gunman during a home invasion, according to ABC News.

What are the details?

The incident took place on Sept. 30 in South Bend, Indiana, after four men broke into a family's home.

In the video, the four unidentified men — all wearing hooded shirts — can be seen bursting into the home. Three of the four men appear to be armed.

""About four males knocked on the door, a juvenile who was inside opened that door, and those males forced themselves inside the home,"" South Bend Police media liaison Christine Karsten told WNDU-TV.

Two of the suspects can be seen entering the family's living room, where a woman is ironing alongside two children.

As the family scrambles around, the unnamed 5-year-old boy can be seen attempting to throw an object at one of the gunmen. The gunman appears to knock the item out of the boy's hand, but the boy remains unafraid and launches himself at the suspect, grabbing his forearm in an attempt to get him to stop.

WSBT-TV identified the woman in the video as Tamika Reid.

Reid told the station that her 5-year-old son, David, is a hero.

""I'm just, my whole thing was my hero right here,"" Reid said. ""[David] was trying to hit the guys. My thing was I need to get him out of the house before they do something to my son.""

David told the station that he was just trying to keep the men from hurting his mother.

""I hit him and I tried to throw my car at him,"" the little boy said.

'It is our job now to defend him'

The South Bend Police Department said that it is still seeking suspects involved in the home invasion.

""This video is extremely disturbing,"" the department said in a statement on the incident. ""You can see a little boy hitting one of the armed suspects as he tries to defend his home. It is our job now to defend him.""

The department revealed a suspect fired shots at the scene, but no one was injured.

UPDATED: White House says Russia could invade Ukraine at any time,"White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Friday that U.S. officials believe a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent, pending a decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull the trigger on war.

""We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. As we've said before, we are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time should Vladimir Putin decide to order it,"" Sullivan said during a White House press briefing.

The briefing was held shortly after PBS foreign affairs and defense correspondent Nick Schifrin reported that U.S. officials were certain that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and has communicated that decision to the Russian military.

Sullivan declined to comment on the details of U.S. intelligence information.

""I do want to be clear, [an invasion] could begin during the Olympics despite a lot of speculation that it would only happen after the Olympics,"" Sullivan said. ""As we've said before, we are ready either way. We are ready to continue results-oriented diplomacy that addresses the security concerns of the United States, Russia and Europe, consistent with our values and with the principle of reciprocity. We've continued to make that clear to Russia in close coordination with our European allies and partners.



""We are also ready to respond decisively alongside those allies and partners should Russia choose to take military action,"" he added, warning that the U.S. and its western allies would impose ""severe sanctions"" against Russia in response to war.

The warning comes after Schifrin said Friday that six Western and defense officials told him the U.S. expects the invasion to begin next week.

""US officials anticipate a horrific, bloody campaign that begins with two days or aerial bombardment and electronic warfare, followed by an invasion, with the possible goal of regime change,"" Schifrin reports.

Sullivan emphasized to reporters that the U.S. government does not believe Putin has made a ""final decision.""

""I want to be crystal clear though, we are not saying that a decision has been taken, a final decision has been taken by President Putin. What we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we are seeing on the ground and what our intelligence analysts have picked up that we are sending this clear message,"" Sullivan said.

He warned Russia against invading Ukraine.



""If Russia proceeds, its long term power and influence will be diminished, not enhanced, by an invasion. It will face a more determined transatlantic community. It will have to make more concessions to China. It will face massive pressure on its economy and export controls that will erode its defense industrial base, and it will face a wave of condemnation from around the world,"" Sullivan said.



He also repeated President Joe Biden's warning to Americans remaining in Ukraine and Russia to flee both nations, reiterating that in the event of war there will be ""no prospect"" of a U.S. military evacuation of American citizens.

""American citizens should leave now,"" Biden said in an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt on Thursday.

“It’s not like we’re dealing with a terrorist organization. We’re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It’s a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,” he said.

Israel's Foreign Ministry on Friday also issued a travel warning for Ukraine and announced that embassy workers and the families of Israeli diplomats stationed in the country will be evacuated in anticipation of war, the Times of Israel reports.

A senior Israeli official reportedly said that Russia has amassed enough troops on Ukraine's borders to begin an invasion at any time.

“The Russians began a military exercise in Belarus that may soon become an offensive against Ukraine,” the unnamed official told Walla news.

Russia has placed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. Putin has publicly denied having plans to invade, but has issued warnings to western powers to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet block nations out of NATO.

UK company develops breathalyzer device designed for early cancer detection,"Researchers in the United Kingdom announced Thursday the launch of a clinical trial for a breathalyzer device that the company believes could be used for early cancer detection in patients.

""We urgently need to develop new tools, like this breath test, which could help to detect and diagnose cancer earlier, giving patients the best chance of surviving their disease,"" professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, the lead trial investigator at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre, said in a news release.

Owlstone Medical has developed its non-invasive Breath Biopsy technology that's designed to help doctors detect early changes in volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs, exhaled from a patient's breath.

What are the details?

The initial two-year trial plans to recruit 1,500 patients suspected of having esophageal and stomach cancers. It plans to expand the study to include prostate, kidney, bladder, liver, and pancreatic cancers in the coming months, according to the release.

Trial participants will be asked to breathe into the breathalyzer device for 10 minutes. The device will collect VOCs, which scientists will analyze for breath-based biomarkers with aims to detect and identify various types of cancer.

Cancer cells alter metabolism even at the very earliest stage of disease, affecting the pattern of the VOCs exhaled, the release said.

""Through this clinical trial we hope to find signatures in breath needed to detect cancers earlier — it's the crucial next step in developing this technology,"" the release continued. ""Owlstone Medical's Breath Biopsy technology is the first to test across multiple cancer types, potentially paving the way for a universal breath test.""

What else?

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization.

Last year, WHO estimated 9.6 million deaths were attributable to cancer. Lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, and breast cancer are the most common causes of cancer death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/breathalyzer-cancer-detection,2019-01-03
Video: CNN's Brian Stelter is challenged on mainstream media bias by college student at 'Disinformation' conference,"CNN media critic Brian Stelter was confronted by a college freshman about the failures of journalism at CNN during a conference on disinformation.

Stelter dismissed the question as a ""right-wing narrative"" after taking the question from the audience at a ""Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy"" conference at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.

The question came from a young man who identified himself as a college freshman named Chris Phillips.

""My question is for Mr. Stelter, you've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation but CNN is right up there with them,"" said Phillips.

""They pushed the Russian collusion hoax, they pushed the Jussie Smollett hoax, they smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a racist, and they also smeared Nick Sandmann as a white supremacist, and yes, they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation. With mainstream corporate journalists becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime is it time to finally declare the canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative?"" he asked.

""All the mistakes of mainstream media and CNN in particular seem to magically all go in one direction, are we expected to believe that this all sort of random coincidence, or is there something else behind it?"" Phillips added.

""It's too bad, it's time for lunch!"" Stelter joked to some applause from the audience.

""I think my honest answer to you, and I'll come over and talk in more detail after this, is that I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch. But I understand that that is a popular right wing narrative about CNN,"" replied Stelter.

""We talk about shared reality and Democracy all these networks and all these channels have to defend Democracy,"" he added. ""And when they screw up, admit it.""

He went on to point out how CNN and other news crews showed how they supported each other when they helped Fox News journalists when they were attacked during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""We don't talk about it enough though, we don't share that reality about how that happens. And with regards to the regime, I think you mean President Biden, well the last time I spoke with a Biden aide, we yelled with each other,"" Stelter continued.

""So that's the reality of the news business, the people don't see, the people don't hear, they imagine it's a situation that it simply is not, but I think your question speaks to the failure of journalism to show our work and show the reality of how our profession operates,"" he added.

""We have a lot of work to do, I think,"" Stelter concluded.

British Petroleum divests from Russian state-owned oil ventures,"The British Petroleum Company (BP) plans to sell its nearly one-fifth stake in the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft.

BP plans to liquidate its 19.75% stake in Rosneft “with immediate effect” following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sky News reported.

Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, will also resign from his role on Rosneft’s board along with another BP executive, Bub Dudley.

The chairman for BP, Helge Lund, said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

“It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue,” Lund continued, “We can no longer support BP representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board.”

He added, “The Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with BP’s business and strategy, and it is now the board’s decision to exit BP’s shareholding in Rosneft. The BP board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.”

Russia’s economy has been in a freefall since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine.

In response to the Russian invasion, leaders of Western nations have proceeded to implement a wide array of sanctions on the Russian economy.

The Western sanctions specifically target Russia’s financial institutions. President Joe Biden issued sanctions that target Russia’s two largest banks, Sherbank and VTB, which will make it effectively impossible for Russians to conduct transactions through the American financial system.

Biden’s sanctions restrict nearly 80% of Russia’s banking assets.

On Saturday, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement that announced their intention to remove Russia from the SWIFT telecommunication network.

Kicking Russia out of SWIFT will significantly damage the Russian economy and make long-term recovery incredibly difficult. This move will economically isolate Russia and prevent Russian businesses and banks from engaging in international transactions.

Natural gas and fossil fuel exports make up more than 80% of Russia’s GDP. Restricting Russia’s ability to sell fuel to the rest of the world will effectively cripple its economy.

The Russian ruble also continues to lose value rapidly.

To try and stabilize the cratering Russian economy, the Russian central bank said that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market and expand the list of securities that it is willing to accept as collateral.

Russia’s removal from SWIFT will put the Russian central bank in a tight bind as it will not be able to freely manipulate Russian monetary policy to offset inflation and the economic impact of Western sanctions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-petroleum-divests-from-russian-state-owned-oil-ventures,2022-02-27
British prime minister front-runner ‘ready’ to push nuclear button,"Liz Truss, Britain’s Foreign Secretary and front-runner to become the nation’s next prime minister, said she would be ""ready"" to use the U.K.'s nuclear arsenal if she was to become prime minister.

Truss was speaking at a debate (known in the U.K. as a “husting”) hosted by Times Radio’s John Pienaar. Pienaar asked Truss how she would react if she were put in a situation where she had to consider activating the UK’s nuclear arsenal.

Pienaar laid out the scenario: ""Your orders to our Trident boat captain on whether you, prime minister Liz Truss, is giving the order to unleash nuclear weapons. It would mean global annihilation. I won't ask you if you would press the button, you'll say yes, but faced with that task I would feel physically sick.""

""How does that thought make you feel?"" Pienaar asked.

Truss replied, “I think it’s an important duty of the prime minister and I’m ready to do that,” adding, “I’m ready to do that.”

Truss’ response was met with applause from the live audience. Rishi Sunak, Truss’ opponent, reportedly was not asked the same question at the debate.

The issue of nuclear war has become more pressing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

Truss has taken a hardline position against Russia. “I will go further as prime minister by doing everything possible – including declassifying more intelligence – to expose Putin’s playbook to the world,” Truss wrote in the Daily Telegraph. She added, “My government will use intelligence strategically to reveal the Kremlin’s attempts to undermine and destabilize freedom-loving democracies.”

The U.K. first developed and tested nuclear weapons in 1952, making it the third nuclear country (after the U.S. and Soviet Union.) It is one of five officially recognized nuclear states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Nuclear weapons have been used twice in warfare — in the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. About 13,400 nuclear weapons reportedly remain today. There have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted since the original Trinity test in 1945, according to the United Nations.

Brooke Shields calls out Barbara Walters for 'practically criminal' teenage interview rife with sexual innuendo,"Actress and model Brooke Shields, now 56, said recently that her famous interview with Barbara Walters, which took place in the 1980s when Shields was just a 15-year-old girl, was ""practically criminal.""

What are the details?

During an interview with Dax Shepard on his ""Armchair Expert"" podcast, Shields recalled a time during the early '80s when she was particularly uncomfortable during an interview with a woman who was supposed to be an ally.

The 1981 interview took place amid the wildly popular Calvin Klein jeans ad for which Shields became a modeling world staple.

The ad featured a teen Shields asking, ""You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing.""

""I was very naive,"" Shields said of the sexually charged, double-entendre commercial during an October Vogue interview. ""I didn't think it had to do with underwear. I didn't think it was sexual in nature. I'd say that about my sister, nobody could come between me and my sister. ... If they had intended on the double-entendre, they didn't explain it to me. It didn't faze me. It didn't sort of come into my psyche as it being anything overtly sexual, sexualized in anyway.""

The televised interview with Walters, however, was a horse of a different color.

During the interview, Walters asked myriad intimate questions about fresh-faced, soft-spoken Shields' body and sexual history, even though she was just 15 years old at the time.

Shields told Shepard that some of the more personally invasive questions included ""What are your measurements?"" and ""Do you have any secrets from your mother?""

""It's practically criminal,"" she said of Walters' conduct. ""It's not journalism.""

Shepard agreed, calling it ""maddening.""

He added that the 1980s media at the time created ""competing narratives"" about Shields and said that much of the media said that the teen was a ""sexual tigress"" with ""overtly sexual"" tendencies, but other media outlets said that the ""naive"" teen was ""being taken advantage of.""

Shields agreed and said that those insisting that she was naive were correct.

She added, ""They were mad at themselves for not figuring it out and taking it out on me.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brooke-shields-barbara-walters-practically-criminal-teenage-interview,2021-12-09
"Brutal Mexican massacre leaves 20 dead near Acapulco, including mayor whose father may have been in league with the gang responsible","On Wednesday in San Miguel Totolaplan, a municipality in the southwestern Mexican state of Guerrero (roughly five hours away from both Mexico City and Acapulco), terrorists killed 20 people and wounded three. Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda and his father, the former mayor, were among those targeted in the massacre.

Two groups of gunmen wearing face coverings arrived in SUVs. They carried out simultaneous attacks at the city hall and at a private residence. In the first instance, they interrupted a meeting between the mayor and city officials, riddling all participants and the building enclosing them with bullets.

Mexico's assistant secretary of public safety, Ricardo Mejia, stated, ""This act occurred in the context of a dispute between criminal gangs."" The BBC reported in 2020 that this is a claim often repeated by Mexican politicians.

The Los Tequileros gang claimed responsibility for the massacre. Los Tequileros is affiliated with the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel (JNGC) and is in an ongoing territorial dispute with the Familia Michoacana gang in the region.

Mejia indicated that the ""Tequileros dominated the region for some time,"" kidnapping, extorting, murdering, and smuggling and distributing opiates.

Evelyn Salgado Pineda, the governor of Guerrero, condemned the attack and indicated there would be no impunity for those who committed this aggression against the municipal president and local government officials.

The leftist party affiliated with Almeda issued a statement, saying it condemns the ""cowardly murder"" and its members ""demand justice.""

It is unclear if Almeda knew his killers, but his father, also gunned down on Wednesday, had encountered them before.

In 2015, after the June 7 Guerrero state elections in which Almeda's father was himself elected mayor, a video circulated online wherein Mendoza Acosta could be seen drinking with members of the Los Tequileros gang. The gangsters indicated Mendoza had been elected with their help: ""Just as we made you win, also give us a hand.""

When asked whether he would work with them, Mendoza replied, ""We will! I will never work with other cochos.""

One month prior to the election, Mendoza had been kidnapped but released shortly thereafter.

Al Jazeera reported that Mendoza, as seen in the video, might not have been meeting with the gang voluntarily, but rather under duress.

According to the analytics firm Etellekt Consultores, Almeda's murder brings the number of mayors assassinated during Mexican President Lopez Obrador's administration to 18. An additional 31 aldermen and 11 trustees have been assassinated during Obrador's term in office.

In recent months, Obrador has come to rely more on the military than on civilian police to rein in Mexico's incredibly high levels of violent crime. After all, the police may no longer be well equipped to handle a threat that has grown increasingly militarized.

Vanda Felbab-Brown, director of the Brookings Institute's Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors, told Metro.co.uk, ""Over the last 15 years, the operational tempo of these groups in terms of hits, counter-hits and other attacks has been as high as the Taliban.""

Cartels and related gangs ""are able to take entire cities like an invasion force associated with an insurgency, they deploy drones to drive people out of areas, they use quite stunning forms of violence,"" said Brown.

August was a particularly bad month for cartel violence in Mexico.

Edgar Garcia Carrillo, a doctor in the Mexican city of Celaya, told the New York Times that the region had descended into ""absolute warfare.""

Cartels and gangs reportedly rampaged throughout the country, firing on police and troops. They torched businesses, blockaded roads, and committed executions in broad daylight. In Celaya, homicides skyrocketed 32% in the first four months of the year.

In one such instance of brazen violence, gangsters lined up mourners at a funeral on February 27, gunned them down, and then cleaned up the scene, leaving behind only a bag of brains.

The JNGC cartel has taken to employing drones for bombing campaigns, as seen in this video showing one such bombing in Michoacan.

The violence is encroaching on the U.S. southern border. In Juarez, which sits next to the American city of El Paso, Texas, a prison battle between members of two rival Mexican cartels spilled out this summer into the streets, killing at least 11, most of whom were civilians.

On August 13, 24 cars were set on fire in Tijuana, Mexico, amid sporadic shootings. Members of the JNGC, whose proxies committed the massacre in Guerrero this week, set out to terrorize the city. The city ultimately issued a shelter-in-place order.

The U.S. State Department recently warned American citizens about travelling to Mexico, stating: “Violent crime — such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery — is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico.”

The State Department said not to travel to the following Mexican states: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas.

It suggested that Americans ought to reconsider traveling to Baja California, Chihuahua, Duranjo, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, and Sonora. The U.S. government also underlined the need to exercise ""increased caution"" virtually everywhere else in Mexico.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brutal-mexican-massacre-leaves-20-dead-near-acapulco-including-mayor-whose-father-may-have-been-league-with-the-gang-responsible,2022-10-06
Bungling burglary suspect gets stuck in chimney during attempted home invasion — and has to be rescued by fire department,"Authorities say that a would-be home invasion suspect got stuck in a chimney while attempting to rob a Silver Spring, Maryland, resident's home.

What are the details?

Montgomery County firefighters arrived at the home around 5:30 a.m. Jan. 8 to assist a home invasion suspect, who remains unnamed at the time of this reporting, in a chimney extrication.

The home's residents reportedly awoke during the early hours of Saturday morning to hear what they described as a knocking noise coming from inside their walls.

Upon realizing that there was something stuck in the chimney, the residents called police for assistance.

First responders rushed to the scene, only to determine that an unnamed 24-year-old male was stuck inside the home's chimney after attempting to gain unlawful access.

Firefighters were said to have worked for more than 90 minutes to free the subject from the wall.

""The call was originally dispatched as a residential burglary call in progress,"" a spokesperson for the Montgomery County Police Department said, according to a report from WTOP-TV.

When police first arrived on the scene, they heard a ""human voice coming from inside the fireplace, in the chimney.""

The man's feet, according to the report, were visible from inside the fireplace.

It's not clear at the time of this reporting how the suspect got stuck inside the chimney.

Video obtained of the bizarre scene shows firefighters removing the resident's wall brick by brick in an attempt to free the suspect from his narrow prison.

The suspect sustained minor injuries in connection with the incident.

The station noted that local authorities are looking to charge the suspect with fourth-degree burglary charges.

MCPD spokeswoman Shiera Goff said that as of Sunday, the suspect had not been charged.

“He was taken to an area hospital and a request for charges [was] filed on Thursday,” Goff said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bungling-burglary-suspect-gets-stuck-in-chimney-during-attempted-home-invasion,2022-01-17
"Burglar armed with gun enters house. But homeowner has gun, too — and intruder doesn't make it out alive.","A Mississippi man arrived home just before noon Tuesday to find a burglar armed with a gun in a bedroom, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported.

But the homeowner — who happens to work for the Jackson County coroner's office — also had a gun and pulled the trigger, police told the paper.

With that, the burglar ""fell behind the bed,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Matt Chapman told the Sun Herald.

What happened to the burglar?

What about the homeowner?

Burglar breaks through home's second-floor bedroom window just before midnight — but homeowner has a gun and shoots burglar dead,"A burglar broke a window on the second story of a home in Vancouver, Washington, late Thursday night and entered a bedroom — but the homeowner was armed and shot the burglar dead.

What are the details?

The suspect ""used a vehicle to boost themselves up onto the second story and then broke in through the window of what appears to be a bedroom of the home,"" Kim Kapp, spokesperson for Vancouver police, told KGW-TV.

The homeowner confronted the intruder in the bedroom where he'd broken in, the station said, and shot him during the encounter.

Officers responded just before 11:30 p.m. to the scene — a house on NE 157th Court, a cul-de-sac that backs up to NE 28th Street, KGW reported, adding that the intruder was dead when officers arrived.

Kapp told the station the homeowner and his spouse were in the house at the time of the break-in, but she did not believe any children were present. Kapp added to KGW that she didn't know if the intruder was armed.

Police told the station there's no indication so far that the intruder and homeowner knew each other. The station in its video report said the break-in appeared to be random.

Kapp could not say if the homeowner is likely to face any charges, KGW reported.

""I don't know. I mean ... definitely something that is not uncommon when people are entering people's homes,"" Kapp noted to the station. ""But I don't have the details on anything further on the investigation, and we're in the very early stages of that.""

The police department's Major Crimes Unit is investigating the incident, KGW said.

The Clark County Medical Examiner is expected to issue autopsy results and provide the name of the suspect within the next several days, the station reported.

"Would-be burglar gets through front door of home occupied by children. But woman inside has a gun — and she fires it, hitting crook multiple times.","A would-be burglar got through the front door of a home in south Toledo, Ohio, around 1 a.m. Friday, WTOL-TV reported.

But through the front door was as far as he got.

You see, he joined the rapidly growing number of folks finding the hard way that those forced to endure their unsavory behavior just aren't taking it anymore.

What went down?

Adding to the danger in this incident was a report from WTVG-TV that the intruder was armed with a gun. In addition, WTOL's report noted that the home in the 200 block of Knower Street was occupied by several children when the intruder got inside.

But also inside was a woman who wasn't about to let the would-be burglar advance further — and she ensured that by exercising her Second Amendment rights and arming herself with a gun.

Sure enough, the woman resident fired and hit the would-be burglar multiple times, WTOL reported.

What happened to the would-be burglar?

With that, the man stumbled away and fell on the front lawn where medics found him, the station said, adding that he was the only person injured in the incident.

Life-saving procedures were conducted on the intruder as he was placed into an ambulance, WTOL reported, adding that he was rushed to a hospital with injuries that were described as critical and life-threatening.

"Pair of burglars force their way into home in middle of the day. But homeowner grabs his gun and shoots them both, sending duo running for help.","Once again we have a tale to share about crooks who perhaps figured they could pull off a crime with no danger to themselves — and once again we find that yet another ""victim"" took preventive measures by exercising the Second Amendment and getting armed.

And once again, things didn't go well for the crooks this time, either.

What happened?

Police in Lafayette, Louisiana, were dispatched to a burglary in progress at a residence in the 200 block of Wilkie Street around noon Wednesday — and it turns out the homeowner was present when two individuals forced their way inside, KATC-TV reported.

But the duo weren't dealing with a defenseless homeowner. Instead they ran smack into a guy who had armed himself with a gun, the station said.

And unfortunately for the crooks, the homeowner wasted no time putting his gun to use. He fired and hit both intruders, police told KATC.

With that, the pair realized they were no longer welcome.

In fact, the station said they fled the residence and sought medical attention for their injuries at a local hospital.

Police said the duo remained at the hospital Wednesday night, KATC noted.

The station added that a third individual — 21-year-old Antonio McClelland — was arrested and booked into the Lafayette Parish Correctional Center on one count of principal to aggravated battery and one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. The Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office noted that McClelland had an active warrant at the time of his arrest.

Lafayette police on Thursday afternoon told TheBlaze that McClelland's connection to the break-in cannot be revealed yet.

Law enforcement is continuing to investigate the shooting, KATC said, adding that additional arrests are expected.

The homeowner — whom the station called ""Remi"" — at first thought raccoons were making the racket, as they'd been breaking into his garbage container as of late.

What happened next?

But when Remi checked what was happening on the balcony in the back of his place on Beverly Ridge Drive, he instead spotted two men — one of whom was armed with a gun, KTTV said.

""I see two guys, and one is pulling my sliding [glass] door open, so immediately I run toward my bedroom, grab my firearm, and I'm just putting rounds straight at the guy,"" Remi recalled to the station.

The intruders ran away, but Remi ran after them in fear they'd find another way into his house, KTTV reported, adding that he stood face to face with a third intruder after coming back inside his home.

""So I open my bedroom [door], and there's a guy literally six feet in front of me,"" Remi noted to the station. ""He's in my house already coming toward my bedroom, so as soon as he sees me with a gun he starts yelling — [and] I pull out my gun, and I start firing inside of my own house.""

The third intruder ran off as well, but Remi wasn't taking any chances — and he ran back to his bedroom to get more bullets, KTTV reported.

""I'm thinking, 'OK, I'm gonna run out of bullets,' so I run back to my closet; I have four extra magazines with a first-aid kit, so I grab my magazines, [and] turn the lights off,"" he recalled to the station. ""I'm in survival mode.""

The aftermath

Remi told KTTV the intruders were wearing masks and hoodies but may have been Middle Eastern based on a non-English word they were yelling that he understood: ""Run!""

Police arrived soon after Remi called 911 and cleared the home, the station reported.

Police also believe the intruders got to the back of the home by climbing up a hillside from a dirt road.

Remi added to KTTV that he doesn't know whether his bullets actually hit any of the intruders, but he's thankful he had a gun and ammunition to protect himself.

"California's high-capacity magazine ban violates the 2nd Amendment, federal appeals court rules","California's ban on magazines holding more than 10 bullets was struck down by a federal appeals court as unconstitutional, with the majority ruling that the law ""strikes at the core of the Second Amendment,"" according to the Associated Press.

Judge Kenneth Lee of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that there may be good intentions behind the law, which was a response to mass shootings, but that doesn't have any impact on whether it is constitutional.

""In the wake of heart-wrenching and highly publicized mass shootings, the state of California barred its citizens from owning so-called 'large capacity magazines' (LCMs) that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition,"" Lee wrote for the majority. ""But even well-intentioned laws must pass constitutional muster. California's near-categorical ban of LCMs strikes at the core of the Second Amendment — the right to armed self-defense.

""Armed self-defense is a fundamental right rooted in tradition and the text of the Second Amendment,"" Lee continued. ""Indeed, from pre-colonial times to today's post-modern era, the right to defend hearth and home has remained paramount.""

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra must now decide whether to appeal the decision to the full 9th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court, and whether to seek a delay in the ruling to prevent an immediate buying surge.

The majority found the ban to be too broad, even when considering its stated goal of limiting mass shootings.

""California's law imposes a substantial burden on this right to self-defense. The ban makes it criminal for Californians to own magazines that come standard in Glocks, Berettas, and other handguns that are staples of self-defense,"" Lee wrote, according to the Washington Times. ""Its scope is so sweeping that half of all magazines in America are now unlawful to own in California.""

The ban on high-capacity magazines was passed in 2016 by 63% of voters in California, and challenged in 2017 by gun owner Virginia Duncan and the California Rifle and Pistol Association.

Deputy Attorney General John Echeverria argued earlier this year that the ban still allowed people to protect themselves and their homes because an average of 2.2 shots are fired during a home invasion.

U.S. Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan previously called the ban a ""slippery slope"" and criticized the limit of 10 rounds as seemingly arbitrary.

""There seems to be some evidence that people need more than a few bullets to defend themselves in the home,"" Callahan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-magazine-ban-struck-down,2020-08-14
California police dept. might use drones outfitted with speakers to 'educate the public about the dangers' of the coronavirus,"A San Diego-area police department is considering using drones outfitted with speakers to ""educate the public about the dangers"" of the coronavirus, KUSI-TV reported — but Capt. Vern Sallee of the Chula Vista Police Department emphasized to the station that ""we're not using drones to follow people; we're not using drones to enforce stay-at-home orders.""

What's going on?

KUSI said the department has been using drones for several years primarily for emergency calls, and Sallee — who oversees the police force's drone program — added to the station that drones give officers ""situational awareness"" and can help them ""maintain order and deescalate"" incidents.

But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a stay-at-home order for the state's 40 million residents last week in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Sallee told KUSI drones could help in that regard — but emphasized there are limits.

""We're not using drones to follow people; we're not using drones to enforce stay-at-home orders,"" he told the station in a phone interview. ""At this point, Chula Vista is trying to educate the public about the dangers of this virus, so when we come into contact with a group of people ... out and about that shouldn't be in a public area — for instance, a closed park — we are trying to educate the public and ask them to voluntarily comply with the governor's order.""

KUSI said the department is vetting the drone idea through the Federal Aviation Administration and testing speakers on drones at present. The station added that the police department has as many as 10 types of drones.

The station also said the drones can be deployed to broadcast instructions on how to get public services to known homeless encampments in canyons so officers aren't forced to negotiate the rough terrain. The drones also would enable officers to keep social distancing, KUSI noted.

What else did the police department have to say?

In the wake of media coverage about the department considering using drones amid the coronavirus pandemic, Chula Vista Police issued a clarification statement Tuesday:

The Chula Vista Police Department and its drone program were recently mentioned in several news stories nationwide. This advisory is intended to correct the record of several of those news stories.



The story originated from an interview provided by Captain Vern Sallee to a media outlet that specifically contacted CVPD to inquire about the department's potential use of drones during the COVID-19 outbreak. The interview took place before Governor [Newsom] issued an Executive stay-at-home restriction statewide on the evening of March 19, 2020.



While the quotes in the body of the original story were accurate, some lacked context and the story failed to address all aspects of the police department's drone response strategy. Unfortunately, the story has been picked up by several other media outlets and it has been sensationalized and given inaccurate headlines which serve only to cause public misunderstanding of the positive steps our organization is taking to protect Chula Vista.



The Chula Vista Police Department is not proactively enforcing the Governor's stay at home order at this time. Rather, CVPD staff on regular patrol have been asked to take note of large gatherings (more than 10), businesses that should not be open or people using the city's parks, which are closed for safety. Staff have been directed to educate the public and ask for voluntary compliance with the Governor's order to stay at home. Staff are encouraging the public to refrain from leaving home if possible and have been directed to remain highly visible, to be a resource to our community and to prevent crime.



Chula Vista P.D.'s drone program is an FAA certified Public Aircraft Operator (PAO) and flies public safety missions in response to emergencies. Started in 2016, the Chula Vista Police Department's drone program has strong policies and procedures to protect the privacy and civil rights of the community while providing critical real-time information to first responders.



The department has not changed how it has used drones during this emergency, but staff are considering how drones may improve communication with the public under certain limited circumstances. Specifically, the department is considering one strategy to use drone mounted speakers to communicate and reach vulnerable populations in inaccessible areas of the city, like large urban canyons with homeless encampments. Unsheltered persons are particularly vulnerable to the current pandemic and their safety and welfare is important to stopping the spread of the disease. Left without pro-active communication and outreach, COVID-19 could spread in these populations and increase illness throughout our community.



That being said, there things that CVPD drones will not be used for. Specifically, police drones will not be used for random patrol, to follow or surveil residents going about their daily routines, or other invasive tactics which would hinder the freedoms we all enjoyment in our community.



Now more than ever, CVPD is using every available resource and tool to keep our community safe and to inform the public about our efforts. Simply put, if you see a CVPD drone, it is responding to an emergency in support of firefighters or police officers on the ground. More than ever, Chula Vista must pull together as a community to stay safe during this outbreak. CVPD will continue to use drones in a Constitutional and responsible manner to keep our community safe.

The police department in its statement doesn't name the media outlet that used quotes that ""lacked context."" And according to KUSI's below segment on the drones, Sallee's interview with the station took place Tuesday, March 24 — well after Newsom's stay-at-home order from last week, meaning the department is referring to a different media outlet.

Capitol rioters were a minute away from reaching Mike Pence,"During the storming of the U.S. Capitol building, rioters were reportedly only a minute away from reaching Vice President Mike Pence, The Washington Post reported on Friday.

According to interviews with law enforcement officials and examining video footage from the chaos at the Capitol, rioters were less than 100 feet away from Pence and his family.

New details about the Capitol invasion on Jan. 6 claim that Pence was escorted out of the Senate chamber once the protesters breached the building. At the time, Pence was presiding over a joint congressional session to certify the Electoral College results of the 2020 election, which was delayed by the riot.

""About one minute after Pence was hustled out of the chamber, a group charged up the stairs to a second-floor landing in the Senate,"" the Post reported.



The Secret Service rushed Pence, second lady Karen Pence, and their daughter to an office that was ""less than 100 feet"" from a second-floor landing, where the mob had infiltrated.



The report alleges that if the rioters had arrived seconds earlier, ""they would have been in eyesight of the vice president.""

Pence was then reportedly marshaled to a secure location inside the Capitol complex.

Secret Service spokesperson Justine Whelan responded to the report, and noted that the vice president was not in danger.



""While the Secret Service does not speak specifically about the means and methods of our protective operations, Vice President Pence was secure at all times on Jan. 6,"" Whelan said in an email.

The Secret Service and other federal agencies are investigating a video from inside the Capitol of people chanting, ""Hang Pence!""

Eugene Goodman was one of the Capitol Police officers who helped protect the members of Congress during the violent situation. Goodman is being heralded as a hero for confronting rioters and baiting them into following him to an area where there was more law enforcement to slow their progress through the Capitol building.

""Hundreds"" of Capitol intruders will be charged for their role in the incident, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Investigations by the DOJ are even looking into serious felony charges of ""sedition and conspiracy.""

Capitol rioters intended to ""capture and assassinate"" elected officials during the raid, according to a Justice Department court filing.

"Cartel hitmen crossed US border illegally to commit home invasion and murder, police say","Authorities in Zapata County, Texas, are looking for help identifying a hitman for a Mexican drug cartel who is accused of crossing the border illegally, breaking into a man's home, and murdering him.

Police said last Wednesday that a sicario, or hitman, of the ""Tropa Del Infierno"" gang carried out a fatal home invasion in the Medina Addition of Zapata. They are seeking the public's help in identifying the suspect, who is accused of participating in the murder of 22-year-old man, the Laredo Morning Times reported.

A press release from the Zapata County Sheriff's Office said that on Friday, July 23, police responded to a call in the Medina Addition where gun shots had been fired in the early morning. Arriving at the scene of the incident, police found a young man in his early 20s who had been shot multiple times in his own home, where he died of his injuries. The victim was identified as Santos Flores III.

Investigators determined the victim was murdered during a home invasion. Two male suspects identified as David Mendez Jr. and Billardo Alaniz were arrested by police on charges of murder and home invasion.

""During the course of the investigation it was discovered that Mendez and Alaniz had picked up two unidentified male subjects who had entered the United States illegally through Falcon Lake,"" the sheriff's office said. ""The two unidentified male subjects were later found to be cartel hitmen also known as 'Sicarios' for the 'Tropa Del Infierno' organization.""

Police said that ""Tropa Del Infierno"" is a ""professional organization for highly qualified hitmen"" that works for the Cartel Del Noreste.

Mendez and Alaniz were allegedly responsible for taking the two hitmen to the victim's residence, where he was murdered. Police said that after the killing, Mendez picked up the hitmen miles away from the scene of the crime and transported them to a safe house.

The sheriff's office is in charge of the investigation with assistance from the Webb and Zapata County District Attorney's Office, Texas Department of Public Safety Texas Rangers Division, and the U.S. Border Patrol.

""These agencies have been working diligently in hopes of finding the individuals that are responsible for committing this drug cartel related home invasion murder,"" the sheriff's office said.

Casey DeSantis shares how her husband Ron stood by her through cancer in heartwarming video,"Florida first lady Casey DeSantis has released a strong emotional video thanking her husband Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for taking care of their family during her battle with cancer.

On the one-year anniversary of Casey DeSantis' breast cancer diagnosis, the Ron DeSantis reelection campaign announced an ad titled, ""That Is Who Ron DeSantis Is.""

""First Lady Casey DeSantis knows who he is better than anyone, and in this ad, she shares how Governor DeSantis fights for Florida the same way he fights for his family,"" the Ron DeSantis reelection campaign said.



The ad features the first lady talking about her husband and how he stood by her and their children while she received treatment for her illness.

""I get asked all the time, who is Ron DeSantis?"" Casey DeSantis says in the video. ""Well he’s the kid who grew up right here in Florida, working his tail off, paying his own way through school and volunteering to serve in the Navy and deploying to Iraq.""

She continues: ""He’s the man who I fell in love with from the moment we met, and he’s the dad of three very rambunctious, energetic children: Mamie our two-year-old little comedian, Madison our beautiful sweet five-year-old, and Mason our four-year-old athlete.""

""But if you want to know who Ron DeSantis really is, when I was diagnosed with cancer and I was facing the battle for my life, he was the dad who took care of my children when I couldn’t,"" DeSantis says, voice becoming heavy with emotion.



""He was there to pick me off of the ground when I literally could not stand. He was there to fight for me when I didn’t have the strength to fight for myself. That is who Ron DeSantis is.""

Casey DeSantis was diagnosed with breast cancer last October. She underwent chemotherapy treatment, and Gov. DeSantis said in January that she had ""responded very well"" to treatment. The Florida governor's office announced in March that she was cancer-free after going through treatment and surgery.



Ron DeSantis issued a statement at the time thanking Floridians for their prayers.

“Over the past year, my family has felt the power of prayer in our own lives,” DeSantis said. “The outpouring of support for my wife and our First Lady Casey DeSantis from across Florida and across the world helped us get through a very trying time.”

“Thank you to the prayer warriors and the faithful across Florida and may we all pray that religious liberty will forever abide in our midst. So long as I’m Governor, I can assure you that it will,” he added.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women, according to the non-profit group breastcancer.org. About one in eight U.S. women are estimated to develop invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetimes.

"At least 2,000 cattle die amid dangerous heat wave","At least 2,000 cattle have died in recent days due to a heat wave baking Kansas, NBC News has reported.

What are the details?

Kansas, the third-largest cattle-producing state in the country, took a hit this week after high temperatures and humidity caused the cattle to die from heat-related distress.

A spokesperson for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that the cattle deaths were also attributed to the lack of grain supply brought on by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to Reuters report, Ukraine is one of the leading exporters of corn worldwide.

According to the report, the death toll estimate has come from facilities and farms that reached out to the agency for help in disposing of livestock carcasses, which may indicate that the final tally may be greater than 2,000.

Temperatures soared to at least 108 degrees in areas of Kansas this week, and meteorologists say that temperatures could climb to over 110 over the weekend. Over the last 30 days, the national drought tracker released at least twostatements warning that regions of Kansas are facing drought or extreme drought conditions.

Agricultural meteorologist Drew Lerner told Reuters that the coming days will be ""oppressively hot and stressful for the animals.""

CNBC quoted Brenda Masek, president of the industry association Nebraska Cattlemen, who said that ranchers need to be on their A-game in order to help cattle survive the oppressive summer heat.

“You can’t say, ‘Oh I checked them three days ago,’” Masek said. “When it gets hot, you’ve got be to out every day and making sure that their water is maintained.”

"ABC News reporter blames Republicans for invasion at southern border, claims Biden didn't invite illegal migrants to 'come on over'","In a recent interview with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, ABC News' Martha Raddatz suggested that Republican critiques of the Biden administration's open-border policies — not the policies themselves — are to blame for the invasion under way at the southern border.

By way of strategically faulty memory, Raddatz also claimed that President Joe Biden never called on illegal aliens to ""come on over.""



What are the details?

Raddatz, the reporter who wept bitterly on television when former President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, discussed the border crisis with Abbott in an interview on ABCs' ""This Week"" that aired Sunday evening.



""You talk about the border wall, you talk about open borders, I don't think I've ever heard President Biden say, 'We have an open border, come on over,'"" said Raddatz.

Raddatz may not have heard Biden struggle with those exact words, but in the first Democratic primary debate, she might have caught Biden say that when he is president, illegal aliens should ""surge to the border. ... We're a nation that says, 'You want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.'""

In recent years, Biden has gone beyond explicitly telling foreign nationals who knowingly violate American territorial sovereignty ""to come,"" promising them health care; an end to detentions of illegal border crossers; an end to deportations; and amnesty.

The Biden administration spent billions to halt construction of the previous administration's planned border wall and was instrumental in lifting the Trump-era Title 42 border policy, which served as a partial bulwark against illegal immigration and foreigner-borne disease during the pandemic.

While an unprecedented number of illegal aliens have stolen across the southern border since Biden took office (over 2.37 million in 2022 and 1.73 million in 2021), officials anticipate a greater flood after Title 42 is eliminated on Dec. 21.

Shifting blame

In the final stretch of the interview, Raddatz cited the opinion of unnamed sources, claiming that it was the rhetoric employed by Republican critics of Biden's open-borders policies that has been driving illegals to make the crossing.

""People I have heard say [that the border is open] are you, are former President Trump, Ron DeSantis — that message reverberates in Mexico and beyond. So they do get the message that it is an open border, and smugglers use all those kinds of statements,"" said Raddatz.

Abbott responded, ""It was known from the time that Joe Biden got elected that Joe Biden supported open borders. It's known by the cartels who have sophisticated information. Whether or not the Biden administration is going to enforce the immigration laws or not is known across the world, but most importantly known among the cartels.""

Newsbusters' Kevin Tober called Raddatz' allegation ""obviously absurd.""

Republicans ""can proclaim the border to be open, but if it wasn’t, migrants would be unable to get into the United States in the numbers that they are,"" wrote Tober.

Despite suggesting that Republicans were to blame, in the segment, Raddatz spoke to a pair of illegal aliens who confirmed that Biden's border policy changes was what prompted their journey.

Although Raddatz may have trouble remembering, last year, an illegal alien informed her that he would ""definitely not"" have tried to cross while Trump was in office; that his reason for coming was ""basically"" because Biden was now in office.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-reporter-blames-republicans-for-invasion-at-southern-border,2022-12-19
CDC director faces criticism from all sides over statement that 75% of COVID-19 deaths have 'at least four comorbidities',"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is being criticized from all sides over comments she made last week in an interview.

Appearing on ABC News to discuss Omicron variant death statistics, Walensky was asked about a new CDC study that found COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. The study looked at more than 1 million people who completed primary vaccination (two shots, no booster, or one Johnson & Johnson shot) between December 2020 and October 2021. Researchers found that ""severe COVID-19-associated outcomes"" occurred only in only 0.015% of vaccinated people. Deaths were rare, happening in only 0.0033% of cases.

""Severe COVID-19 outcomes were defined as hospitalization with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) including all persons requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (including discharge to hospice),"" the study said. ""Among 1,228,664 persons who completed primary vaccination during December 2020–October 2021, a total of 2,246 (18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated persons) developed COVID-19 and 189 (1.5 per 10,000) had a severe outcome, including 36 who died (0.3 deaths per 10,000).""

The study explained that people most at risk from developing a severe outcome were older than 65, are immunosuppressed, or have at least one of six other underlying health conditions.

Digging into these results on Friday, Walensky told ""Good Morning America"" that the vast majority of people who died of COVID-19 after primary vaccination had at least four underlying conditions that increased their risk of serious illness. Those conditions include diabetes, and chronic kidney, cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and liver diseases.

""The overwhelming number of deaths, over 75%, occurred in people who had at least four comorbidities. So really these were people who were unwell to begin with, and yes, really encouraging news in the context of Omicron,"" Walensky said, referring to deaths of vaccinated people examined in the study, not total deaths from COVID-19.



CDC director responds to criticisms on COVID-19 guidance l GMA youtu.be

Some people on social media attacked the CDC director for allegedly speaking disrespectfully toward disabled or chronically ill people. Newsweek reported that Twitter users posted #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy with comments criticizing Walensky for saying she was encouraged that COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated appear limited to people with preexisting health conditions or disabilities.

""Contrary to popular belief, CDC Director, disabled people aren't just data points ... How callous to say you're encouraged by the prospect of their deaths,"" Imani Barbarin, a disability rights activist, wrote.

Matthew Cortland, a lawyer who suffers from a chronic illness, tweeted: ""It is 'encouraging' to [Walensky] that chronically ill and disabled Americans are dying ... our deaths clearly don't count.""

Many others shared similar comments, some of them nasty. The social media backlash prompted Walensky to respond on Sunday with a tweet emphasizing the CDC's dedication to protecting people with comorbidities from COVID-19.

""We must protect people with comorbidities from severe COVID-19. I went into medicine—HIV specifically—and public health to protect our most at-risk,"" she wrote. ""CDC is taking steps to protect those at highest risk, including those with chronic health conditions, disabilities and older adults.""

But the CDC director faced more backlash for entirely different reasons. Several individuals called attention to Walensky's comment that over 75% of COVID deaths were people with ""at least four comorbidities."" These critics took her comments out of context, leaving out the vaccination effectiveness study and claiming she was saying that 75% of all coronavirus-related deaths were from people with comorbidities.

""How many had 2/3 things that would likely kill them or were in late stage terminal cancer, or were hit by a bus?"" Donald Trump Jr. asked. ""Whats the # of truly healthy?""

""This means they shut down the country, stole two years of education from children, sent thousands of businesses under, and caused mass hysteria when only 209,000 deaths weren't people already deathly sick,"" Greg Price, a senior digital strategist for X Strategies LLC, a political consulting and digital marketing firm, said.

These critics and others thought Walenksy's comments confirmed a long-held suspicion by many people skeptical of COVID-19 lockdowns and government mandates that reported COVID deaths were inflated by counting deaths with COVID alongside deaths from COVID.

Data from New York, for instance, shows that more than 40% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state are patients that were admitted to the hospitals for reasons other than coronavirus infection or were complications from the virus. Last week, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) ordered hospitals to start differentiating why COVID-19 patients were initially admitted in their daily COVID reports.



Walensky was asked directly about this issue on ""Fox News Sunday,"" hosted by Bret Baier.

""Do you know how many of the 836,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to COVID are from COVID or how many are with COVID, but they had other comorbidities? Do you have that breakdown?"" asked Baier.

""Yes of course with Omicron we're following that very carefully,"" Walensky responded. ""Our death registry of course takes a few weeks ... to collect. And of course Omicron has just been with us for a few weeks. But those data will be forthcoming.""

Her non-answer only frustrated her critics, who demanded to know when that data would be released so that science, not fear of death from COVID-19, would inform policy makers with the power to close schools, businesses, and mandate masks or vaccination during a pandemic.

Charges against Breonna Taylor's boyfriend dropped in shooting of officer serving no-knock warrant,"A judge on Tuesday officially dismissed charges against Kenneth Walker, the boyfriend of Breonna Taylor, who shot a Louisville police officer who was serving a no-knock warrant at Taylor's home for a drug investigation in March, WAVE-TV reported.

Walker had been charged with attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault after shooting Louisville Metropolitan Police Officer Jon Mattingly one time in the leg. Mattingly recovered from his injury after surgery. Taylor was shot eight times and killed, and police found no drugs in the home.

Walker's side of the story: Walker told investigators he heard a banging on the door of Taylor's home after midnight and believed it was a home invasion. By the time he started moving toward the door, Walker said, the officers were already busting it open. He fired one shot, still not knowing they were police officers (they were plainclothes officers). Walker said he fired downward because he was not intending to kill anyone.



""I don't need to kill anybody if I can just get you out of here,"" Walker said, the outlet reported.

Walker reportedly told police initially that it was Taylor who had fired at them, but that he only did that out of fear. Walker is a legal gun owner who was not named on the warrant.

Mattingly's side of the story: Officer Mattingly, who was accompanied by two other officers, said they knocked several times and announced themselves as police before ramming the door. Mattingly said when he got through the door he was immediately faced with Walker aiming a gun at him and firing.



Mattingly said after he was hit he fired four shots. He said the officers expected Taylor to be at home alone when they served the warrant.

What's next? The prosecutor in the case, Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine, filed the motion to have the charges dropped, but indicated that Walker could be charged again if additional evidence is uncovered during the investigation. He said more evidence should've been presented to the grand jury.



""I believe that additional investigation is necessary,"" Wine said, WAVE reported. ""I believe the independent investigation ... must be completed before we go forward with any prosecution of Kenneth Walker.""

Wine also said Walker would be given the opportunity to testify if he wishes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/charges-against-breonna-taylor-boyfriend-dropped-shooting-officer,2020-05-27
Concealed-carry gun owner thwarts Chicago phone store robbery,"An armed robber expected to walk into a cellphone store in Chicago and saunter off with wads of cold hard cash and merchandise, but little did he know there was also a gun owner ready to protect himself and others.

An armed man reportedly attempted to rob a Metro by T-Mobile cellphone store in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood around 7 p.m. Saturday. During the intense robbery, a 29-year-old gun owner with a concealed carry permit allegedly opened fire on the thief. The would-be robber was struck with at least two gunshots in the chest and abdomen, according to a news report by WFLD-TV.

The suspect was transported to the local Stroger Hospital in critical condition, but was later pronounced dead.

It was not immediately known if the legal gun owner was the business owner, an employee, or a concerned customer. The shooter did possess a valid Concealed Carry License and Firearm Owner's Identification Card. Police confiscated both firearms from the parties involved in the attempted robbery, according to the news report.

The incident remains under investigation by detectives.

This is just the latest example of a bad guy with a gun receiving their comeuppance from a good guy with a gun.

Two brothers allegedly force their way into suburban home. Both pay the ultimate price after a gunfight with a legal gun owner.,"Police say that two brothers were killed in a gunfight after they forced their way into a home in a suburb of Chicago.

The brothers allegedly walked up to the home in Waukegan at about 10 a.m. Tuesday armed with one revolver and forced their way in when a woman who was renting the home answered the door.

She was babysitting a toddler at the time and began screaming for help.

Waukegan police say that a man who rents a downstairs room at the home heard the screams, grabbed his pistol, and ran to investigate.

The man shot one of the brothers who dropped the gun after being hit.

The other brother then retrieved the gun and began dragging his brother out of the house. The renter went back to grab a weapon and engaged in a gunfight with the second brother. Multiple shots were fired on both sides.

Both brothers were found dead on the lawn by police when they arrived at the home. None of the victims were injured in the harrowing incident.

Both the woman and the man who rented the home had valid Firearm Owner's Identification Cards, while neither of the two brothers had a license. They said they did not know who the brothers were, or why they had targeted their home.

The brothers were identified as Christian Tenorio, 36, and Jimy Tenorio, 34, both from Waukegan.

""I can't remember the last time where we had two people try to break into a home, if that's what this ends up to be, where they're shot and found in the front yard,"" said Waukegan Police Commander Joe Florip to WGN-TV.

""This is a very isolated and specific incident, and I don't recall ever having anything like this,"" he added.

No charges have been filed, and the case is being investigated by the Waukegan Police Criminal Investigations Division.

Chilean 'tourists' responsible for hundreds of burglaries in the US,"Law enforcement agencies are sounding the alarm over a growing trend: Chilean crime syndicates taking advantage of visa waivers for ""burglary tourism."" Authorities believe the sophisticated operations are responsible for ""hundreds and hundreds"" of heists across the U.S., resulting in losses totaling millions of dollars.

What are the details?

Officials are working to determine how many people are involved in the rings, but methodical patterns have emerged linking Chilean nationals to a crime circuit with international scope. According to the Daily Mail, the root of the operations have ""been linked to a corruption scandal in the Chilean capital Santiago, involving bribes to police.""

""There are many Chileans who, being criminals here, travel abroad because they can obtain better treasures,"" Chilean journalist Javiera Rodriguez told the Los Angeles Times. ""In addition, they are very ingenious and create new forms of theft.""



The perpetrators use innovative, signature tactics for jamming car key fobs so they won't lock, disabling or circumventing security systems, and disguising their identities with fake documentation even when they are caught. Their efforts appear to be worth it, too; more than $1 million in jewelry was lifted during a single Chilean-linked raid in California last month. An LAPD captain said it's not uncommon for homeowners to lose $30,000 or $40,000 worth of property if they become victims of the gangs.

In Ventura County, California, such thefts by tourist burglars are ""in the hundreds and hundreds,"" Sheriff's Detective Theodore Stern told the Times. ""It's a huge issue. They're taking advantage of our immigration laws. Officers are working hard to catch these guys.""

While Southern California has become a popular target for the malicious visitors seeking easy-pickings of luxury goods, dozens of Chilean ""tourists"" are believed to be responsible for home, vehicle, and business invasions across the U.S. The problem has been flagged by law enforcement in several other states, including Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and New York.

Anything else?

Chilean ""tourist"" gangs have also been blamed for recent waves of burglaries across England, Canada, and Australia. Not only have the operatives earned a reputation for their savvy stealing, they are adept at using visas to legally enter wealthy nations and freely pillage for months.

In spite of their elusive ways, dozens of Chilean suspects have been apprehended in what officials say are widespread, well-coordinated gangs of professionals. Law enforcement agencies across the globe are taking notice, while calling for more stringent background checks on tourists entering their countries.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chilean-tourists-responsible-for-hundreds-of-burglaries-in-the-us,2019-04-25
US says China forcibly tested American diplomats with anal swabs for COVID-19 detection,"The U.S. State Department says that China forced American diplomats to take invasive anal swab tests to detect COVID-19 infection, according to various reports Thursday.

China has reportedly been using anal swabbing tests to determine the coronavirus status.

What are the details?

According to the Insider, a state department representative said that the United States complained to China after it learned that staffers were subjected to the anal swab.

""The State Department never agreed to this kind of testing and protested directly to the Minister of Foreign Affairs when we learned that some staff were subject to it,"" the representative said.

The representative added that China also said the tests were given to American diplomats ""in error"" and that the diplomats were supposed to be exempt from the test.

During a Thursday press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, ""I have checked with my colleagues. As far as I know, China has never required U.S. diplomatic staff in the country to take anal swab tests.""



According to a related report from Vice, it was not immediately clear how many diplomatic employees or members of their families were made to take the tests.

Insider reported that the test involves inserting a cotton-tipped swab one to two inches into the rectum and rotating it.

In a statement, the State Department said that it is committed to preserving the ""dignity"" of American diplomats.

What else?

According to a Thursday report from the BBC, Li Tongzeng — a respiratory and infectious diseases expert in Beijing — said that anal swabbing can ""avoid missing infections as virus traces are detectable for a longer time than the more common COVID tests used in the mouth and nose.

At the time, Li insisted that the tests were only necessary for certain populations, such as those under quarantine orders.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-american-diplomats-anal-swabs-covid,2021-02-25
"China Christianity crackdown, shuts down religion Bible apps","The Chinese Communist Party recently enacted a nationwide crackdown on Christianity in the past week, according to multiple media reports. China also reportedly shut down Christian-based apps in what appears to be the persecution of Christians in the authoritarian nation.

International Christian Concern, a United States-based non-partisan Christian organization that attempts to ""bandage the wounds of persecuted Christians and to build the Church in the toughest parts of the world,"" reported that there was a major crackdown on Christianity in China that started on Saturday. The report stated, ""Bible Apps have been removed from App Store in China, while Bibles in hard copy are not available for sale online,"" and ""those who want to download Bible Apps have to use VPN to circumvent the Firewall.""

The religious persecution watchdog said, ""Bible Apps and Christian WeChat public accounts have been removed.""



The report referenced a post on Twitter by Father Francis Liu from the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, which stated that ""some decent Christian WeChat accounts are no longer available online.""

""A few snapshots of Christian accounts' landing page such as 'Gospel League' and 'Life Quarterly' no longer show any content,"" the ICC report added. ""Instead, a message reads ""[We] received report that [this account] violates the 'Internet User Public Account Information Services Management Provisions' and its account has been blocked and suspended.""

Pastor Bob Fu, founder and president of China Aid that provides legal aid to Christians in China, wrote on Twitter, ""On Wednesday official WeChat public accounts aimed at providing resources on Bible &guides on edifying the church to Chinese Christians were suddenly suspended. #CCP suspends Old Gospel &The GospelCoalition. Both have a large number of readers within China's pastoral network.""

Three-self churches, Chinese government-sanctioned religious organizations, are ""increasingly selling books that promote President Xi Jinping's thoughts or the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) ideology,"" according to the ICC report, adding, ""Even their WeChat accounts are turning into propaganda channels for CCP.""

The Christian Post reported that the communist authorities implemented restrictions on religion on May 1, ""Catholic bishops must be approved and ordained by the state-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference."" The new regulations purportedly run in contrary to a deal that China and the Vatican made in 2018 regarding the appointment of Catholic bishops in the communist country, according to the Union of Catholic Asian News.

Religious freedoms in China are severely restricted. The Chinese Communist Party has been chastised for its treatment of Uighur Muslims. There could be as many as 3 million Uighur Muslims detained in secret re-education camps in the Xinjiang region, according to one security expert.

China is expected to increase military spending in 2022,"China is expected to increase spending on its defense budget in 2022.

The Global Times, a tabloid newspaper owned and operated by the Chinese Communist Party, said, “Ahead of China's announcement of its defense budget for 2022, analysts and observers predict that the country will likely continue to steadily increase its military expenditure, at a rate possibly slightly faster than last year.”

“China enjoys a positive economic development but faces security threats,” the global times continued, “The two factors provide a foundation and need for China to further develop its national defense capabilities to safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and rightful interest.”

Military experts believe that the Chinese defense budget could grow by as much as 7 percent.

Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, said, “China will likely continue to expand its military expenditure this year, as the defense spending should be closely related to the development of the national economy.”

China has made single-digit increases to its annual defense budget every year since 2016. In 2021, China’s GDP expanded by 8.1 percent marking the fastest growth in the Chinese economy in almost a decade.

“While the economy has been affected by COVID-19, China did well with epidemic prevention and control, and is enjoying a relative healthy economy,” Fu added, “So, it is likely that China will spend more on national defense.”

Many in the West expect China to invade the island nation of Taiwan in the near future. In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it clear that it is a matter of “when” and not “if” China makes a move on Taiwan.

Chinese leaders have even said that if the United States comes to the aid of Taiwan and affirms the nation’s independence it could lead to military conflict between America and China.

In a recent interview with NPR, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, said, ‘If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.”

Xi Jinping recently reached out to his counterpart in North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, and called for the two communist countries to come to a “common understanding” as they work to build supportive and friendly relations under “a new situation.”

China mandates anal swab COVID-19 tests for all foreign arrivals after US slams exam as 'undignified',"China has decided to require international travelers entering the country to undergo anal swab procedures to test for COVID-19, a method the communist nation insists is more accurate than other on-the-spot mechanisms for detecting the disease.

The Times out of the UK reported Wednesday that China has now made the tests ""compulsory,"" in a move the newspaper says deepened ""a row with other countries over a practice many have described as humiliating.""

What are the details?

According to the New York Post, the Times claims that ""as part of the new travel requirement, there will be testing hubs in Beijing and Shanghai airports."" The Sun reported that ""the procedure involved inserting a cotton swab about three to five centimeters into the anus and gently rotating it.""

Beijing insists that anal swabs are more accurate than nasal or throat swab tests.

Li Tongzeng, a Chinese respiratory and infectious disease expert, explained to the media last month that the anal swabbing can ""avoid missing infections as virus traces are detectable for a longer time than the more common COVID tests used in the mouth and nose.""

As TheBlaze previously reported, Li insisted at the time ""that the tests were only necessary for certain populations, such as those under quarantine orders.""

But the news of the widespread mandate comes after the United States and Japan issued separate complaints to China after diplomats from both nations were forced to provide fecal samples via the invasive method.

American diplomats cry foul

Last week, the U.S. State Department protested to China's Minister of Foreign Affairs after American diplomats cried foul over being subjected to anal swab tests, which ""Washington has slammed as 'undignified,' according to The Sun.

The Chinese Communist Party has denied that it subjected American diplomats to rectal probing, but then Japan complained this week that the anal swabs were conducted on their diplomats upon entry to China.

Katsunobu Kato, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said during a news conference, ""Some Japanese reported to our embassy in China that they received anal swab tests, which caused a great psychological pain.""

However, Chinese physician Lu Hongzhou suggested on state-run media that foreigners do have an alternative to the swab test upon arrival in the country: providing a stool sample.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-mandates-anal-swab-covid-19-tests-for-all-foreign-arrivals,2021-03-04
Chinese officials scramble to find ways to insulate China's economy from Western sanctions as tensions with Taiwan grow,"Stoking fears that China is preparing for an invasion of Taiwan, Chinese officials are looking for ways to defend their country from economic isolation should Western nations opt to sanction China in a similar fashion to how they sanctioned Russia after it invaded Ukraine.

The Daily Mail reported that China’s economic regulators held emergency meetings in late April with officials from the Chinese central bank, the finance ministry, domestic banks operating in China, and international leaders in the financial sectors like HSBC.

In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Western nations locked arms and issued thorough sanctions on the Russian economy. These sanctions caused the Russian economy to plummet and prompted drastic retaliatory threats from the Russian government.

These Western sanctions greatly restricted Russia’s ability to conduct business with other nations by limiting its use of the SWIFT telecommunications network and making it virtually impossible for it to conduct business with the global reserve currency – the U.S. dollar.

The crippling effect these sanctions have had on the Russian economy prompted the emergency meeting between Chinese officials and financial executives. Chinese President Xi Jinping has been startled by the dollar freeze and is concerned about a similar policy being leveraged against China.

Reportedly, the U.S. is considering implementing similar packages of sanctions against China in the event that it moves forward with an invasion of Taiwan. Recent and repeated rhetoric from Chinese leadership indicates that it is not a matter of “if” but a matter of “when” China launches an invasion of Taiwan.

A source close to the Chinese officials who met said, “No one site could think of a good solution to the problem. China’s banking system isn’t prepared for a freeze of its dollar assets or exclusion from the Swift messaging system as the US has done to Russia.”

Reportedly, one idea proposed in the meeting was to force Chinese businesses that export to other nations to part ways with their holdings in U.S. dollars in exchange for Chinese renminbi.

Other proposed solutions such as swamping U.S. dollar holdings to favor the Euro were not thought to be practical.

Some of the Chinese leaders present doubted whether the U.S. even has the capacity to issue such sanctions on China’s economy.

Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research in Hong Kong, said, “It is difficult for the U.S. to impose massive sanctions against China. It is like mutually assured destruction in a nuclear war.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-taiwan-usa-sanctions,2022-05-02
China threatens war if US interferes with possible Taiwan invasion,"China's defense minister threatened all-out war while discussing Taiwan's independence during a meeting between top Chinese and American military officials. The threats were made on Friday during the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe.

""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost,"" warned China’s defense spokesman Wu Qian – who was quoting General Wei.

The saber-rattling continued as the Chinese defense minister declared that Beijing would ""smash to smithereens"" any effort to maintain Taiwan's independence. The ministry vowed that Taiwan would be made part of China for the ""unification of the motherland.""

During the 30-minute summit at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Wei ""stressed that Taiwan is China's Taiwan... Using Taiwan to contain China will never prevail.""

Qian said the meeting was a ""good start"" to resuming normal military dialogue, and both countries agreed to continue communicating.

Austin pointed out there has been a ""steady increase in provocative and destabilizing military activity near Taiwan.""

Austin called on China ""to refrain from further destabilizing actions toward Taiwan.""

""We remain focused on maintaining peace, stability and the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,"" Austin proclaimed. ""But the PRC's moves threaten to undermine security, and stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.""

Austin hinted at a parallel with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, stating that the indefensible assault on a peaceful neighbor has galvanized the world and ... has reminded us all of the dangers of undercutting an international order rooted in rules and respect.”

Austin added, ""Rules-based international order matters just as much in the Indo-Pacific as it does in Europe.""

""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is what happens when oppressors trample the rules that protect us all,"" Austin said. ""It's what happens when big powers decide that their imperial appetites matter more than the rights of their peaceful neighbors. And it’s a preview of a possible world of chaos and turmoil that none of us would want to live in.""

Austin said the U.S. is committed to ""assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.""

The Pentagon released a statement regarding the meeting.



""Secretary Austin discussed the need to responsibly manage competition and maintain open lines of communication,"" the statement said. ""The Secretary underscored the importance of the People’s Liberation Army engaging in substantive dialogue on improving crisis communications and reducing strategic risk.""



""Secretary Austin discussed global and regional security issues, including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" the Pentagon stated.

Austin told his counterpart that the United States ""remains committed to our longstanding one-China policy.""

The Center for Strategic and International Studies defines the one-China policy as: ""The United States recognizes the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China but only acknowledges the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China. Thus, the United States maintains formal relations with the PRC and has unofficial relations with Taiwan.""

Last month, President Joe Biden broke away from the strategic ambiguity of whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan against an invasion by China.

When asked if the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if the CCP invaded, President Biden said, ""Yes... that's the commitment we made. The idea that it [Taiwan] can be taken by force... is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.""

The Taipei Times reported this week that Beijing estimates that the Chinese military will be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.



""China has over the past few years stationed an increasing number of warships along its southeastern coast, as it is seeking to maintain its military advantage in the region and attempting to build a system of intelligence warfare by 2027,"" the report said. ""By 2027, China is expected to possess regional air defense capabilities, and long-range sea and airstrike systems, which would greatly extend its combat range, following the introduction of its aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong, a second-generation Type 003 vessel, as well as the mass production of Type 055 destroyers, Y-20 tanker aircraft, and J-20 fighters.""

Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, and Taiwan has been self-governed ever since. China claims that Taiwan is a breakaway province.

CCP leader Xi Jinping has vowed to reclaim Taiwan.

""No one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Xi said last year. ""The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-war-us-taiwan-invasion,2022-06-11
GOP lawmaker dresses down Congress for ramming through $40B aid package despite having just hours to read it,"Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) dressed down the House of Representatives on Tuesday for voting on a massive aid package to Ukraine without giving lawmakers ample time to read the bill.

What did Roy say?

Speaking on the House floor, Roy rebuked lawmakers for rushing to pass the aid package despite only having hours to review it before voting.

""We got a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I haven't had a chance to review the bill. My staff was poring over the pages trying to see what's in it,"" Roy began.

""You want to talk about the institution? You want to talk about standing up alongside Ukraine? Why don't we actually have a debate on the floor of the people's house instead of the garbage of getting a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock in the afternoon — not paid for, without any idea of what's really in it, with a massive slush fund that goes to the State Department: $13 billion dollars, $8 billion to the economic support fund, $110 million for embassy security,"" he continued.

Instead of passing yet another aid package for Ukraine, Roy said lawmakers' time would be better spent addressing issues hurting Americans.

""We've got $40 billion that is unpaid for and you want to sit here and lecture this body about what we're going to do or not do about standing alongside Ukraine? Why don't we talk about the American people who are hurting?"" he said. ""The wide-open borders, the inflation that's killing people, the jobs that people can't get because the cost of goods and services in this country.""

Roy concluded his speech by moving for an adjournment, which did not happen. Democrats, instead, charged that approving the aid package was necessary to demonstrate American solidarity with Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even appeared to quote the Bible when she argued for the necessity of the aid package.

Ultimately, the House passed the aid package by a vote of 368 to 57. Only Republican lawmakers voted against the package.

The Senate is expected to vote on the bill later this week. If it passes, that means Congress will have approved more than $50 billion in aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion nearly three months ago. In March, Congress approved a $13.6 billion aid package.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-ukraine-aid-package,2022-05-11
MSNBC's Chris Hayes gets torched for suggesting the US turn to Iran for help to relieve gas crisis,"MSNBC host Chris Hayes got lambasted on social media for suggesting that the U.S. alleviate the skyrocketing price of gas by turning to the Iranian regime for help.

Hayes linked to a proposal to buy gas from Iran in response to increased prices as caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as from growing inflation.

""If you’re a) devoted to cutting off Russia’s oil revenues and b) worried about inflation and spiking oil prices, this is one possible solution…,"" Hayes Tweeted.

Critics excoriated Hayes and the suggestion to seek oil from one murderous regime in response to the military aggression of another murderous regime.

""Actually, giving billions to American-murdering terrorists is a really bad idea,"" responded Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

""Oh great, give our money to Iran instead of Russia. Much better than revamping domestic production,"" read one popular tweet.

""Maybe start producing more of our own oil and gas? You know, like we were doing until Joe happened?"" said another critic.

""Or, you know, we could just let Americans make lots of money producing it domestically instead of funding a terror state,"" another user offered sarcastically.

""Buying oil from Russia and Iran after cutting our own supplies is the act of an imbecile or a traitor. There is no logic to any Democrat environmental idea,"" responded another detractor.

""Funding terror to end terror?"" asked Ian Haworth.

Others pointed out that Hayes had been against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2014, which could have relieved some of the lack of oil supply.

The Biden administration had blamed inflation on everything from supply chain issues related to the pandemic to the ""greed"" of ""meat conglomerates."" The pain of high inflation has been cited among the many causes of the very low favorability rating for President Joe Biden ahead of the midterm elections.

"Christmas caroler kicks in home's door, tries to enter. But gun-toting homeowner adds to his naughty list — and fires shots at door.","Indiana homeowners told police a man came to their Fort Wayne home Thursday while singing Christmas carols and knocked on their door, WANE-TV reported.

The female homeowner said she thought it was strange and didn't answer the door, the station said.

She added that a car pulled up in front of the house, and the man went to the car and came back with another person, WANE noted.

The female homeowner said the pair shook the door handle and then kicked in the door and tried to come inside, the station said.

But the male homeowner had a gun and fired shots at the door, WANE reported, adding that he told police he was unsure if he struck anyone.

What happened next?

The pair did not offer a rendition of ""Good King Wenceslas."" Police told the station the alleged intruders fled on foot and were not located.

There have been no arrests in connection with the incident, WPTA-TV said, adding that some reports indicated a person showed up at a hospital after the attempted break-in with a gunshot wound.

What did a neighbor have to say?

Neighbor Lance Turner told WPTA he was shocked by the incident.

""I didn't think that something like that would happen in this neighborhood,"" he added to the station. ""I mean, seriously, we've only lived here about a year, never really felt any problems with the neighborhood. It was always welcoming, neighbors were fine.""

"MSNBC’s Chuck Todd dismisses Americans’ economic woes under Biden, blames 'right-wing echo chamber'","MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd this week expressed shock and frustration at recent polling showing the majority of Americans are unsatisfied with the economy under President Joe Biden, calling the negative public opinion a result of ""right-wing echo chamber"" lies.

In a stunning dismissal of the Americans hurt by historic inflation levels and a supply chain crises under the Biden administration, the liberal media figure suggested that Americans simply ""don't feel first-world enough"" and should go live in another country before they criticize the president.

What did he say?

""Fifty-one percent believe the economy is in a recession or depression. I mean, look, it's just not true,"" Todd exclaimed during a panel segment on ""MTP Daily"" Tuesday, posted by Real Clear Politics.

Todd was citing a USA Today and Suffolk University poll conducted in February. Displayed alongside it onscreen was another recent poll published by the Washington Post and ABC News that returned similar findings; namely, that a whopping 75% of Americans felt the economy is ""not so good"" or ""poor.""



""This economy is frustrating,"" he continued. ""This economy with COVID has been — 'I've got money and I can't find something' — but my God, there's jobs. There's good jobs.""

""Is this the right-wing echo chamber is better than the Democratic echo chamber problem?"" he asked guest Jennifer Palmieri. ""Or is there something else missing?""

Palmieri, a former Obama White House communications director, responded by agreeing with Todd's assertion and claiming that liberals don't just repeat what they've been told like conservatives do. She went on to add that Americans' gripes about the economy are just a feeling, not reality.

""That’s the real issue. They don’t feel secure about that right now,"" Todd declared.

What else?

At that point, Republican strategist Matt Gorman entered the discussion to suggest that negative responses to the economy over the last year are ""broader"" than economic measurements. He said people are feeling the squeeze when they go to restaurants without adequate staffing or to grocery stores that are void of product.

""We don't feel first-world enough,"" Todd jumped back in to say as if the real issue had just dawned on him.

""I want to tell people, 'Go live in another country,' and realize we have it pretty good here,"" he added.

Todd's complaints are unlikely to change anyone's perception of the economy, however, as skyrocketing inflation hit a 40-year high last month and the country continues to grapple with supply chain issues and staffing shortages. That's not to mention the pain Americans will likely feel at the gas pump over the coming days and weeks amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

'Cicada tacos' are on the menu for young environmentalists. Why? Eating the invading bugs are part of 'living sustainably.',"Amid the current cicada invasion underway, some students at Princeton High School are getting creative — they're eating them.

Say what?

Yes, there's an Insect-Eating Club at the school — and teacher Mark Eastburn joined club members at a recent cicada catching and tasting party in Princeton, New Jersey, NJ.com reported.

""We are going to have to get more used to eating insects,"" Eastburn told the outlet. ""As the population of the Earth continues to grow, protein sources are going to be harder and harder to raise, so really insects are the solution to a lot of the world's problems and that's what we're hoping to inspire the next generation to pursue.""

Eastburn also told the outlet that the gathering was ""an opportunity to really highlight the importance of living sustainably.""

More from NJ.com:

There were plenty of options on the menu. Some featured the insect bodies in recognizable form, like the Salted Roast Cicadas, Cicada Stir-Fry, Deep Fried Soft Shell Cicadas.



Other dishes didn't scream ""There are bugs in my food"" at first glance, such as Cicada banana bread with nuts or Chocolate Chip Cicada Cookies.



At one point during the afternoon, club founder Matthew Livingston came out onto the deck from the kitchen and yelled something not often heard at dinner parties, ""Cicada smoothies! Anyone want to help me make them?""



Of course they did. This is, after all, the Insect-Eating Club. Freshman Nicolas Maya had the first sip and announced, ""It's good!""

Another good guy with a gun — this time a Florida city official — shoots home intruder,"Typically stories about United States citizens who take to heart their constitutional right to keep and bear arms — and who use their guns to protect themselves and loved ones — involve civilians.

But this time the good guy with a gun turned out to be a Florida city official — and the result was the same as it's been in so many of these instances: Bad news for the bad guy.

What happened?

Palmetto police spotted a possibly impaired driver about 10 p.m. Thursday and attempted to pull over the vehicle — but the driver sped away instead, police told the Bradenton Herald.

The suspect, Avelino Misreal Vasquez-Perez, crashed into a home a few blocks away and ran off, the paper reported.

Police caught his passenger, the Herald said, and then placed a perimeter around the neighborhood in search of Vasquez-Perez.

Vasquez-Perez climbed a fence into Palmetto Commissioner Brian Williams' backyard and broke into Williams' garage in an apparent attempt to hide from police, the paper said.

But Williams' daughter lives next door and spotted Vasquez-Perez and called her dad, the Herald reported.

With that, Williams armed himself — and then heard Vasquez-Perez trying to enter his kitchen from the garage, the paper said.

Williams confronted Vasquez-Perez, who tried pushing past and punching the homeowner, the Herald reported.

But Williams pushed Vasquez-Perez back — and then shot him twice, Chief of Police Scott Tyler told the paper.

""He was lawfully defending home and family,"" Tyler added to the Herald.





Vasquez-Perez surrendered to police and was rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery, the paper said, adding that as of Friday, he was in stable condition and was expected to recover.

What did Williams have to say?

""I am glad that everything turned out the way it did,"" Williams told the Herald. ""I guess he is doing OK, and we are happy and glad that no one in my family was hurt.""

Vasquez-Perez is facing charges of resisting arrest without violence, burglary and battery in addition to traffic citations, the paper said.

Report: Clandestine CIA program prepared Ukrainian troops for war with Russia,"In the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden's administration pulled covert Central Intelligence Agency personnel out of the country, including war-zone-hardened agency paramilitaries. The CIA operatives had been there since 2014, training Ukrainian forces in modern warfare tactics, a report from Yahoo News revealed.

Although Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine 36 days ago, the Kremlin's forces have so far been unable to capture the capital of Kyiv or crush the Ukrainian military. The most conservative U.S. estimates believe that more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in less than three weeks of fighting, and Ukraine's military claims to have killed at least three Russian generals.

According to half a dozen former intelligence officials who spoke to Yahoo News, the CIA's training is what has helped Ukrainian forces stymie the Russian advance.

After Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, the U.S. military operated a publicly acknowledged training program for Ukrainian troops in the western part of the country, far from the front lines of a civil war with pro-Russian separatists in the east. But at the same time, the CIA reportedly developed a covert training program on the eastern front in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces were directly fighting Russia-backed troops and possibly even Russian soldiers.



The covert CIA training program operated under existing authorities for the CIA and did not require new authorization, according to Yahoo News. CIA paramilitaries trained Ukrainian troops in sniper techniques; taught them how to operate Javelin anti-tank missiles and other equipment; showed them how to evade Russian surveillance; and gave them training to draw out Russian and insurgent forces from their positions, Yahoo News reported.

Former U.S. officials involved with the program believe the training was effective. “I think we’re seeing a big impact from snipers. Especially as Russian forces get bogged down from lack of supplies,” one former senior official said. “I think the training really paid off.”

Yahoo News previously reported in January that the CIA had conducted a secret U.S.-based training program for Ukrainian special operations. The outlet also said that CIA paramilitaries had traveled to eastern Ukraine to assist Kyiv's forces there, but the CIA had denied their programs were offensively oriented.

“The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence,” a senior intelligence official said in January.

That statement now appears to be false.

According to Yahoo News, the CIA paramilitaries sent to Ukraine were given a twofold mission. First, they were ordered to determine how best to train Ukrainian special operations forces to fight the Russian military and separatist forces in the Donbas region. Second, the CIA operatives were told to determine the ""backbone"" of the Ukrainians and assess their willingness and ability to fight.

Former officials acknowledged to Yahoo News that the program carried serious risks. ""Everything we did in Ukraine had a chance to be misinterpreted, and escalate the tensions,” one former official said. The CIA reportedly wanted to avoid a direct conflict with the Russians that could result in a war. Accordingly, the number of personnel initially sent to Ukraine was limited to the ""low single digits,"" Yahoo News reported. They were directed to advise and train, but were instructed not to take part in combat.

However, after President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017, the new administration raised concerns that the CIA's Ukraine mission ""might be too far-ranging,"" according to a former national security official.

“How far can you go with existing covert action authorities?” the official recalled asking. ""If, God forbid, they’ve shot some Russians, is that a problem? Do you need special authorities for that?”

Though the Trump White House was mindful of the risks, the program continued through his presidency and into the Biden administration. It wasn't until it became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine that President Biden pulled all CIA personnel out of the country, Yahoo News reported.

Biden's administration was ""terrified of even clandestine folks being on the frontline"" of Ukraine's war with Russia, a former official said.

Rep. Jamaal Bowman claims 'A Global Green New Deal ... would really address this oil crisis with Russia'; former California Gov. Jerry Brown says 'climate is like war',"As Russia invades Ukraine and Americans are hammered with high gas prices, Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York is pushing for a ""Global Green New Deal"" and former California governor Jerry Brown is claiming that people will die if climate change goes unaddressed.

""A Global Green New Deal is what would really address this oil crisis with Russia - and prevent future ones. It’s time we mobilize for real energy security, climate safety, and peace,"" Bowman tweeted.



The website bowmanforcongress.com indicates that this agenda would entail slashing U.S. military spending.

""Global Green New Deal: We must promote trade that grows and empowers labor and foreign policy and moves us toward 100% clean and renewable energy abroad,"" the website declares. ""The US military is the biggest polluter on the planet so decreasing our military spending will go a long way toward saving the planet. I believe the climate crisis is an opportunity to finally discard our weapons and fear of each other to come together and save the planet.""

In an effort to squeeze Russia, President Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday which prohibits importing Russian oil and other products into the U.S. — the list of banned products includes, ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products,"" according to the order.

The move, which comes as Ukrainians strive to defend their country against a Russian invasion, will likely lead to even higher gas prices for Americans.

But while Ukrainians bravely fight an actual war, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who served four terms in office — including from 1975 to 1983 and from 2011 to 2019 — told the Associated Press last week that ""climate is like war.""

""It's true that the Russians are earning money from oil and gas, but to compound that problem by accelerating oil and gas in America would go against the climate goals, and climate is like war: If we don’t handle it, people are going to die and they’re going to be suffering. Not immediately, but over time,"" Brown said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-change-oil-russia-ukraine-green-new-deal,2022-03-08
Climate refugees: CNN pushes absurd new theory about migrant caravan crisis,"No one contends the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is not an issue requiring immediate attention. What to do, exactly, about the problem is where most Americans deviate. Some say provide the migrants with political asylum while others, like President Donald Trump, do not want to aid the foreigners off the American tax dollar.

Then there are others seeking to understand why migrant caravans are now, almost routinely, making their way from Central America through Mexico to the U.S. Indeed, understanding the why behind the politically charged caravans could help alleviate future controversy.

And it appears CNN may know the reason behind the caravans: climate change, of course.

How can climate change be responsible?

According to a new article CNN published Tuesday, climate change is the impetus behind the caravans due to drought conditions plaguing parts of Central America, specifically in Honduras.

The article, penned by CNN investigative reporter John Sutter, shrewdly bashes Trump for claiming many of those in the migrant caravans are ""gang members and some very bad people"" seeking ""an invasion"" of the U.S. But Sutter claims Trump is missing one major detail.

""Overlooked is this factor: climate change,"" Sutter claims, adding:

The ""dry corridor"" of Central America, which includes parts of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, has been hit with an unusual drought for the last five years. Crops are failing. Starvation is lurking. More than two million people in the region are at risk for hunger, according to an August report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

To bolster his theory, the reporter quotes Edwin Castellanos, the dean of research at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, who is billed as a ""global authority on climate change in Central America."" The drought is so bad, Castellanos says, that children in extremely impoverished areas of Central America are dying of starvation, an unusually rare occurrence even for that part of the world.

Further solidifying his pre-arrived to conclusion, Sutter quotes Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. McAleenan said last week that drought conditions, which has led to widespread crop failure, is directly related to the migrant crisis.

But what does scientific data show?

While theories may allege the migrant crisis is, at least, partially related to climate change, Sutter admits empirical data does not confirm his hypothesis.

""Studies have not definitively tied this particular drought to climate change, but computer models show droughts like the one happening now are becoming more common as the world warms,"" Sutter explains.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-refugees-cnn-pushes-absurd-new-theory-about-migrant-caravan-crisis,2018-12-12
CNN anchor asks Biden official: 'Why won't the US shoot down' Russian planes?,"A Biden administration official wouldn't give a straight answer when asked why the U.S. won't ""shoot down"" Russian planes that are bombing civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.

On Thursday, CNN anchor Jim Sciutto asked State Department spokesman Ned Price to explain why the U.S. won't take military action against Russia, given that the government considers Russian military strikes against civilian targets like hospitals to be war crimes.

The question came up after Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda Thursday, during which Harris called Russia's actions ""atrocities of unimaginable proportion.""

She also said that Russia ""absolutely"" should be investigated for war crimes.

Afterwards, Price joined ""CNN Newsroom with Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto"" to discuss the vice president's comments, and he was asked if Russia had committed ""war crimes.""

""Lamentably, that's an apt description,"" Price said, adding that ""we’re working with the international community, each group to create new mechanisms to ensure that we are holding Russia and will hold Russia accountable for any potential war crimes.”

Sciutto then asked why the U.S. won't take military action and ""shoot down"" the Russian planes attacking civilians.



""OK, hold them accountable, but not stop them because they’re continuing here. Why won’t the U.S. shoot down the planes that are bombing hospitals?"" Sciutto asked.

""Well, Jim, we are providing our Ukrainian partners with what they need to engage in self-defense. And you have seen the effectiveness of that strategy. The Russian war effort really has been stalled,"" Price answered, deflecting the question. ""President Putin has severely miscalculated if he thought he would roll into Ukraine, not find any resistance. Clearly, he was wrong. We have seen convoys stuck. We’ve seen Russians engaged and stopped really in a morass of their own making.""

""And we’ve done that by providing over the course of the past year, as you heard from the vice president, more than $1 billion in defense of security assistance, more than $250 million in security assistance over the past week alone,"" he continued. ""And by working with Congress, we’re grateful for Congress’ cooperation. We’ll be able to provide more than $13 billion to our Ukrainian partners, about half of which will be in the form of security assistance.""

Sciutto followed up by asking if President Joe Biden is ""in effect giving the Kremlin a veto, veto power over U.S. military options here?""

“Jim, we’ve heard a lot of rhetoric from Moscow. I wouldn’t put stock in Moscow’s rhetoric,” Price said, without giving the obvious response that taking direct military action against Russia, like shooting down planes, would start World War III.

"CNN chief international correspondent stops during live shot, captures viral moment desperate Ukrainians kneel in prayer amid Russian invasion","Clarissa Ward, CNN's chief international correspondent, witnessed a moving demonstration of faith on live television Thursday morning as a group of Ukrainians kneeled on the ground in prayer as Russia continued its invasion into the war-torn country.

What are the details?

Talking with CNN anchor Don Lemon, Ward — who was on the ground in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Thursday morning — witnessed the group of people praying on what appeared to be a public street amid the danger.

“I think this ... really speaks to the sort of desperation of this moment,” Ward said of the group's faithfulness. “We just see a small group of people ... have gathered in the main square, and they are kneeling and praying because right now there is clearly a sense of having no idea what is coming down the pipeline, what is in store.”

Video footage showed the group of people as Ward pointed out that the scene — though dire and desperate — was ""very moving.""

“It’s freezing cold here, so to see these people kneeling on the cold stone in prayer is honestly very moving,” she continued. “And I think it speaks to the state of ordinary Ukrainians here who have done absolutely nothing to deserve this.”

Ward added that Ukrainians have every reason to fall to their knees as Russia continued its deadly advance into the country, ushering in violence and uncertainty in the hours and days ahead.

“I think that’s why you’re seeing those people ... getting to their knees and praying,” she said.

CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand shared the segment on social media, tweeting, ""What a moment captured by @clarissaward and her team in Kharkiv.

CNN host says world is entering 'post-American' era under Biden: 'You can see signs of this everywhere',"CNN host Fareed Zakaria observed Sunday that under the leadership of President Joe Biden, the era of global American dominance is over.

What is the background?

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates declined calls with Biden as Russia's war in Ukraine intensified.

According to the report, relations between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern kingdoms have strained under Biden. However, the White House denied the truth of the report.

""That report is inaccurate, so let me start there,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""The president did speak with the Saudi king just a few weeks ago, several weeks ago, it’s all running together at this point in time. There were no rebuffed calls, period.""

What did Zakaria say?

According to Zakaria, Russia's war in Ukraine marks a new era of world history and in particular highlights evidence of America's diminishing influence on the global stage.

""One of the defining features of the new era is that it is post-American. By that I mean that the Pax Americana of the past three decades is over,"" Zakaria said. ""You can see signs of this everywhere.""

To prove his thesis, Zakaria cited the the Journal report and Biden's failure to lead a coalition of world powers against Russia.

""Consider that according to the Wall Street Journal the leaders of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, two countries that have depended on Washington for their security for decades, refuse to even take phone calls from the American president,"" Zakaria explained. ""Consider as well that Israel initially in the Security Council vote and India have refused to describe Putin's actions as an invasion and that all four countries have made it clear they will continue to do business with Russia.""

It is not all bad, according to Zakaria, who observed that America ""remains the world's leading power, still stronger than all the rest by far.""

Anything else?

Comedian Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show,"" made a similar argument last week. In fact, Noah said Saudi Arabia and the UAE would not have snubbed Donald Trump as they allegedly did Biden.

""That must have been really embarrassing for Biden. Can you imagine? He phones them and they don’t pick up?"" Noah said.

""Now, according to the White House, this story is totally untrue. They deny it, which I would, too. But either way, man, there is no denying that Saudi Arabia isn’t playing ball with Joe Biden,"" Noah added. ""And you know what? You can say what you want, but this would have never happened to Donald Trump. Never.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-host-says-world-is-entering-post-american-era-under-biden,2022-03-14
"After White House denial, CNN scrubs report on alarming leak from Biden's call with Ukrainian president","Chaos erupted online after CNN ran with a leaked report about alleged statements President Joe Biden made to the president of Ukraine in a phone call amidst rising tension from the possibility of a Russian invasion.

Biden spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday about the threat from Russia but a leaked report claimed that he told Zelensky an invasion was virtually certain and that the country should ""prepare for impact.""

Biden also told them that the capital of Kyiv could be ""sacked"" by the Russians, according to the disputed report.

That report was regurgitated by numerous CNN reporters, and covered by Jake Tapper on his show on the Cable News Network before the White House said the claims were false. He cited a Ukrainian official as a source for the story.

The official account for the ""The Lead"" tweeted the video of Tapper's report and then deleted it. Later, they reposted the video report and added that the White House had disputed the account.

A spokesperson for Zelensky released a statement backing the claims of the White House that the leaked report was untrue.

""Dear colleagues! Some reports regarding the content of the talks between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden have appeared on social media, citing the alleged 'senior Ukrainian official.' These messages are completely false,"" read the statement.

""Correct information can only be found in official releases from the Ukrainian and American sides. Everything else is suppositions and speculations,"" the statement continued. ""In this troubled time, we ask you to treat every piece of information as responsibly as possible and publish only carefully verified data.""

Here's the latest version of the story from CNN:

Christopher Miller of Buzzfeed News said that his source in Zelensky's office confirmed that the comments claimed by the leaked report were an accurate depiction of what Biden said on the call.



Some wondered if CNN had been forced by the White House to delete an accurate report.

""CNN either completely botched a report that could impact whether or not Russia invades Ukraine, Or they got it right and got bullied out of reporting truth by Biden admin. It was probably botched,"" tweeted Brent Scher of the Free Beacon. ""Under last admin they would have stood by their garbage, but now they back down.""

The confusion mirrored a previous statement that Biden made about the possibility of a Russian invasion that occasioned loud and frustrated push back from Ukrainian officials. White House press secretary Jen Psaki later walked back his comments.

CNN torpedoed after cuing ill-timed Applebee's commercial alongside wailing air raid sirens in Ukraine,"CNN took heavy criticism on Thursday morning after airing a poppy, upbeat Applebee's commercial alongside footage of air raid sirens blaring across Kyiv, Ukraine, amid the Russian invasion.

What are the details?

CNN bizarrely aired an Applebee's commercial on Thursday morning while myriad air raid sirens rang out across the smoky streets of Kyiv.

The upbeat commercial featured the Zac Brown Band's ""Chicken Fried"" and showed off a man dancing in skin-tight jeans to lyrics such as: ""A little bit of chicken fried/ Cold beer on a Friday night/ A pair of jeans that fit just right/ And the radio up.""

Air raid sirens could be heard on the newscast before the network superimposed the commercial over the dystopian footage in split screen fashion.

What was the response?

Much of social media could not fathom why CNN would air such devastating footage juxtaposed with a lighthearted commercial celebrating fried chicken and beer at a mid-range casual dining restaurant franchise.

Journalist Arash Markazi wrote, ""A friend once yelled the opening lyrics of Smash Mouth's 'All Star' in a movie theater during a silent moment in a dramatic movie as a dare. This is worse than that moment.""

Broadcaster Keith Olbermann added, ""Death from the skies...sponsored by @applebees[.]""

Research director Scott Whitlock wrote, ""Really, CNN? There's this thing called tone and tact. Look it up. Because your blending of commercials and all hell breaking out in Europe isn't working.""

Another user added, ""Cutting away from air raid sirens in Kyiv for an Applebee’s commercial with a guy in jeans shaking his ass is certainly a choice, @CNN. What sort of dystopian hell is this?""

""Applebees couldn’t get a Super Bowl commercial, so they took the WW3 CNN slot. Savage,"" another user wrote.

Yet another chimed in, ""Nothing like sliding on a pair of jeans that fit right while preparing for ww3.""

"CNN's Jim Acosta, Chris Cuomo criticized President Trump for tying coronavirus to China — but video mash-up highlights their hypocrisy","Following President Donald Trump's address to the nation Wednesday, CNN's Jim Acosta, not surprisingly, found something in it to criticize, pointing out that Trump calling the coronavirus a ""foreign virus"" would ""come across to a lot of Americans as smacking of xenophobia.""

""That, I think, was interesting because, as I was talking to sources earlier this evening, one of the points that the president wanted to make tonight — wanted to get across to Americans — is that this virus did not start here, but that they're dealing with it,"" Acosta told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""Now, why the president would go as far to describe it as a 'foreign virus,' that is something we'll also be asking questions about.""

Hypocrisy

Well, on the heels of Acosta's sanctimonious statement, MRC-TV put together a gut punch of a video mash-up showing his fellow CNN anchors and talking heads on other media outlets calling coronavirus the ""Wuhan virus"" and the ""Chinese coronavirus"" numerous times.



It starts with a grinning Cuomo with a gushing glint in his eye noting how ""you're starting to hear the Republicans, especially Trump Co., calling it the Wuhan or the Chinese coronavirus. They're looking for someone to blame.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

With that, let's roll tape, shall we?

All told, the clip showed CNN on-air personalities tying the coronavirus to China or Wuhan at least 20 times.

One of the funnier segments featured a CNN panelist mocking Trump's European travel ban to prevent ""the outside invasion of the disease"" and then Cuomo's buddy Don Lemon responding with ""the Chinese coronavirus, that they've been calling it"" — as if it's a phrase he's never heard before.

But as the very next mash-up segment shows, Lemon did hear it before — because he himself said those exact words following the first coronavirus death in the U.S.

Even the very woke, very international Christiane Amanpour uttered the words ""Wuhan coronavirus.""

How did others react to the video mash-up?

As you might expect, other Twitter users picked up on the hypocrisy straight away:

""The Chinese Wuhan Coronavirus is from Wuhan China.... in China... where Wuhan is.... where the Chinese Wuhan Coronavirus started.""

""A network of hypocrites!""

""Sad how they keep their viewers/supporters in a constant state of confusion & full of HATE and have done so for years & years...""

""SHUT THEM DOWN!!!""

And one added a rather entertaining discovery:

An advanced search for the tweet on Acosta's account came up with nothing.

In addition, CNN published a story in January titled, ""Disease detectives hunting down more information about 'super spreader' of Wuhan coronavirus,"" Fox News noted, adding that the network's senior medical correspondent used the word ""Wuhan"" a dozen times.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnns-jim-acosta-chris-cuomo-criticized-president-trump-for-tying-coronavirus-to-china-but-video-mashup-highlights-their-hypocrisy,2020-03-13
CNN's own heavily Dem poll gave Biden lowest 'very positive' SOTU response in 15 years: 'The tide did not turn tonight',"President Joe Biden received the lowest marks in CNN's post-State of the Union poll in 15 years, despite the respondents being significantly more Democratic than the general public.

What are the details?

After Biden's speech, CNN political director David Chalian revealed the results from CNN's post-SOTU poll and explained why the poll signals bad news for Biden.

""This is a poll of people who watch the speech. And what’s important to note about that is that people who watch a president give a State of the Union tend to be more supportive of that president or in that president’s party,"" Chalian explained. ""And so our survey tonight of speech watchers is about 11 points more Democratic as a body of people here that were pulled than the overall population in America.""

Despite the overwhelming Democrat bias in the pool of respondents, just 41% of people polled said they had a ""very positive"" reaction to Biden's speech, while 29% said they had a ""somewhat positive"" reaction and 29% said they had a ""negative reaction.""

The ""very positive"" number is down 10 points from 2021, when CNN recorded a ""very positive"" reaction among 51% of respondents. The significant drop is a problem for Biden because, as Chalian explained, ""that 41% is the lowest very positive we’ve seen in about the last 15 years of instant polling after the State of the Union address.""

Even more troubling for Biden was that a majority of respondents told CNN that Biden failed to sufficiently address violent crime and historic inflation. According to CNN's poll, only 47% of respondents said Biden adequately addressed inflation and just 46% of respondents said he sufficiently addressed violent crime.

""Majorities for both inflation and violent crime said he did not do enough,"" Chalian observed. ""And again, I just want to remind you that is the majority of a speech-watching audience that is more Democratic than the American populace overall.""

Meanwhile, respondents gave Biden positive marks on Ukraine — 69% said he adequately addressed Russia's invasion of Ukraine — but the same respondents, when asked to choose the most important issue between the economy and Ukraine, overwhelmingly (64% to 36%) said the economy was more important than Ukraine.

College to use tracking device that notifies officials if students leave school's 'COVID-bubble',"Michigan's Albion College is requiring that students download a phone application that tracks at all times their physical locations as well as their private health data in order to battle the spread of the coronavirus, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What are the details?

Albion — a private college — is aiming to create a ""COVID-bubble"" on campus for the entire semester, the Free Beacon said. And if a student breaks the 4.5-mile perimeter, the app notifies the administration, and the student could be temporarily suspended, the paper added.

But as you might imagine, this plan has students and parents complaining about privacy invasion.

""The school wants my daughter to sign a form consenting to specimen collection and lab testing,"" one father told the Free Beacon on the condition of anonymity. ""I have a ton of concern with that. ... Why is the state of Michigan's contact tracing not enough?""

The paper added that while students are required to remain on campus, professors and administrators are not. And Albion — when asked about this disparity and potential ""COVID-bubble"" loophole — declined to comment, the Free Beacon said.

""I feel like I am being treated like a five-year-old that cannot be trusted to follow rules,"" rising senior Andrew Arszulowicz told the paper. ""If the school believes masks work ... why are we not allowed to leave if they work? It does not make sense to me.""

What else?

More from the Free Beacon:

Albion is planning to offer in-person learning only, and students who refuse to comply with the contact-tracing program will be forced to defer for a semester or a full school year.



Coronavirus testing will be required upon arrival to campus. It's unclear how many follow-up tests the university will mandate throughout the 14-week semester, but the results be stored on Albion's tracking app.



Returning students must also sign a form authorizing the disclosure of their test results to the county, state, or ""any other governmental entity as may be required by law"" — though the school told the Free Beacon that state and county officials are not collecting information from the app.



In addition to downloading the app, students must undergo a mandatory three-day quarantine after they move back to campus. They will be given a list of ""approved businesses"" to frequent, and must fill out an online form five days in advance if they plan to leave for ""approved"" activities, such as medical appointments, religious obligations, and ""significant family obligations.""

In addition to the possibility of receiving suspensions, students who don't comply with the guidelines will be locked out of their dorms and other on-campus buildings, the paper said, citing emails from the university it obtained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-tracking-device-students-covid-bubble,2020-08-19
Congressional group visits Taiwan as China ramps up military presence,"Days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi enraged Chinese officials with a trip to Taiwan, a congressional delegation made an unannounced two-day visit of their own to the island.

Led by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, the five-member delegation “will meet President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials, as well as members of the private sector, to discuss shared interests including reducing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and investments in semiconductors,” reports the Associated Press.

After Pelosi’s visit earlier this month, the government of China announced that it would extend its threatening military exercises around Taiwan.

China's embassy in Washington, D.C. argued the latest congressional visit ""once again proves that the U.S. does not want to see stability across the Taiwan Straits and has spared no effort to stir up confrontation between the two sides and interfere in China's internal affairs.""

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said members of Congress have gone to Taiwan for decades and will continue to do so, reports Reuters.

According to the Associated Press, the other members of the delegation are Republican Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen from American Samoa, Democratic House members John Garamendi and Alan Lowenthal from California, and Democratic Rep. Don Beyer from Virginia.

China and Taiwan split in 1949 after a civil war; however, China's ruling Chinese Communist Party continues to claim Taiwan as its own territory. In a statement, the Chinese government stated that while it seeks peaceful reunification with Taiwan, “we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This is to guard against external interference and all separatist activities.”

The United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as an independent country— only 13 countries currently do — however, it does maintain a strong relationship with Taiwan, and has repeatedly vowed to defend the island against potential attacks.

According to analysis conducted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, the U.S. could lose up to 900 warplanes fighting a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, reports Bloomberg.

“The results are showing that under most — though not all — scenarios, Taiwan can repel an invasion,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “However, the cost will be very high to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy and to U.S. forces in the Pacific.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congressional-group-visits-taiwan-as-china-ramps-up-military-presence,2022-08-15
Congresswoman Nancy Mace reveals she carries a gun 'everywhere I go' after her home was vandalized,"A month after Congresswoman Nancy Mace's home in Charleston, South Carolina was vandalized, the Republican lawmaker revealed she carries a firearm with her everywhere she is allowed to.

""I go to the gun range almost weekly to practice shooting,"" Mace told Fox News in a video feature.

""It doesn't feel good that I feel like I have to look behind my shoulder every day. It doesn't feel safe,"" she added.

On Memorial Day weekend, Mace discovered that her home and property had been vandalized with anarchist messages like ""all politicians are bastards"" and ""no gods no masters."" Police are investigating the crime, but so far no suspects have been arrested nor charges filed.

In mid-June, police released a picture of an individual they suspected of vandalizing Mace's home as well as property at Bishop England high School earlier this year.

""When they show up to your house and physically try to destroy it with graffiti, it's personal and it's invasive. It's violating,"" said Mace.

After the incident, she revealed she carries a firearm in public for protection.

""I carry a gun everywhere I go today. Where I'm allowed to, I do carry,"" Mace said.



""When this happened, it really changed everything for me. I'm not going to live in fear, and I'm not going to be intimidated, and to be able to carry a gun wherever i go, for me as a woman, I think it's one of the most empowering things that you can do to defend yourself,"" she told Fox News.

After Mace reported that her home had been vandalized on social media, unsubstantiated rumors began circulating that she had faked the crime for attention. She was also criticized for fundraising off the ""Antifa vandals' who ""went after my home.""

""There was no empathy. There was only, 'let's re-victimize her and let's accuse her of doing the crime herself',"" Mace said.

""I challenge anybody, if I did this, please send the evidence to the FBI and please charge me with a crime. I dare you to because the evidence just doesn't exist out there. And it's crazy to me that this is where we are in this country and you're seeing the downfall of civility on social media because of this,"" she added.

Mace said she will continue to mention what happened in fundraising efforts and that talking about what happened — how it made her feel, and the fact that she carries a firearm in response will be a regular part of her public discourse.

""I'm absolutely going to talk about it to people and I will try to fundraise off of it,"" Mace said. ""I'm not going to back down. I think we've got to use all the tools that we can to be successful in this country.



""I feel liberated by the ability to carry a gun now. It's liberating, but also it's empowering for me to know that I can be able to defend myself no matter what.""

"Judge sentences convicted pedophile to 280 years in prison for 'horrific, dastardly conduct' against four little girls","A California judge has sentenced a Paso Robles, California, man to more than 280 years in prison after he was convicted on 52 counts related to sex abuse of children, including video surveillance of dozens of children without their knowledge.

What are the details?

Jason Robert Porter, 49, was convicted of abusing at least four young girls between the ages of 1 and 13 years old from 2008 to 2016, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune, after having waived his right to a jury trial.

Authorities first arrested Porter in June 2016 after a young girl's mother — a former friend and neighbor — reportedly caught him shooting cell phone photos underneath her child's dress. Several weeks later, authorities arrested him a second time after investigators discovered ""tens of thousands of images and videos of children engaging in sexual acts, including some allegedly showing Porter molesting children,"" during a related search of his home and personal electronic devices.



The charges included 16 felony counts of sex crimes against children and child pornography, as well as 36 misdemeanors for unauthorized invasion of privacy.

In a Monday statement on Porter's sentencing, San Luis Obispo Superior Court Judge Barry T. LaBarbera added, ""I've been doing this a long time and I've seen a lot of things, and this for me was very difficult to watch. This was horrific, dastardly conduct. ... Not only were the victims particularly young, a lot of the conduct was committed while they were sleeping.""

One of Porter's victims, an 11-year-old girl, testified against him in court, saying that he molested her when she was just 4 years old during a visit to his home. The unnamed child said that she was at Porter's home for a playdate with his two adolescent sons.

""I pretended I was asleep,"" she admitted during her testimony.

A press release from San Luis Obispo County District Attorney Dan Dow quoted him as saying, ""We sincerely applaud the courage of these young survivors in reporting the abuse, and the parents of survivors who appeared in court today to face the defendant and express the very real impact of his terrible crimes. This sentence sends a clear message that we will prosecute child sexual predators to the maximum extent of the law.""

Deputy District Attorney Melissa Chabra added, ""The young victim's bravery while testifying in court in front of her abuser inspires me to continue my work on these cases and fight for justice for all survivors of sexual abuse in our country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/convicted-pedophile-280-years-prison,2021-07-02
"Officer involved in Breonna Taylor's death sends message to fellow officers slamming protesters, FBI","A Louisville Metropolitan Police Department officer sent an email to about 1,000 fellow officers at 2 a.m. Tuesday criticizing protesters, city officials, department leadership, and the FBI as he awaits a decision on whether he will be charged in Breonna Taylor's death, Vice News reported.

The email, written by Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and obtained by Vice News' Roberto Aram Ferdman, foreshadowed a ""rough"" period to come as the city braces for potential unrest if Mattingly, Officer Myles Cosgrove, and Sgt. Brett Hankison are not charged in Taylor's death this week.

""No matter the ineptitude in upper command or the mayor's office, this is one of the greatest jobs on earth,"" Mattingly wrote. ""With that being said, these next few days are going to be tough. They are going to be long, they are going to be frustrating. They will put a tremendous amount of stress on your families.""



The Louisville Metro PD declared a state of emergency Monday in advance of an expected grand jury decision on whether to charge the three officers who executed the no-knock search warrant on Taylor's home the night they shot and killed her. Hankison was fired, but Mattingly and Cosgrove are still with the department on administrative leave.

Mattingly told the other officers in the email that they didn't deserve the abuse they will potentially face from protesters in coming days.

""You DO NOT DESERVE to be in this position,"" Mattingly wrote. ""The position that allows thugs to get in your face and yell, curse, and degrade you. Throw bricks, bottles, and urine on you and expect you to do nothing. It goes against EVERYTHING we were all taught in the academy. The position that if you make a mistake, during one of the most stressful times in your career, the department and FBI (who aren't cops and would piss their pants if they had to hold the line) go after you for civil rights violations. Your civil rights mean nothing, but the criminal has total autonomy.""

Mattingly defended the officers' actions the night Taylor was killed. After the officers broke in the door of Taylor's apartment, Taylor's boyfriend shot at them, saying he believed it was a home invasion, and they returned fire with about 20 shots. Five of them hit Taylor, killing her.

""Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral, and ethical thing that night,"" Mattingly wrote. ""It's sad how the good guys are demonized, and criminals are canonized. Put that aside for a while, keep your focus and do your jobs that you are trained and capable of doing. Don't put up with their s**t, and go home to those lovely families and relationships.""

The officers had a warrant for Taylor because she was believed to be connected to her ex-boyfriend's drug trafficking operation. No drugs or money were found at her home.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cop-breonna-taylor-message-fellow-officers,2020-09-22

The suspect's injuries were not considered life-threatening, KDVR said.

"cori bush, 18,000, state of the union, shirt","Progressive Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri revealed that she is wearing a shirt emblazoned with the number 18,000 to President Biden's State of the Union address.

""My State of the Union fit. 18,000. That's how many people whose clemency petitions are sitting in a backlog, waiting for @POTUS's review. Justice delayed is justice denied. President Biden, we’re urging you: start granting clemency now,"" Bush tweeted when sharing a photo of herself wearing the brightly colored shirt.

The lawmaker has been a vocal advocate for defunding the police.

Biden is delivering his State of the Union address on Tuesday as he continues to remain underwater in a variety of job approval polls.

The speech also comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has drawn attention around the globe, and Ukrainians struggle to defend their nation.

Several GOP lawmakers announced that they would not attend the president's speech.

""I'm healthy, so I won’t be taking a test for COVID… so I won’t be attending the #SOTU,"" GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted.

Video: Ukraine truck bomb explosion on Crimea bridge to Russia,"A surveillance camera captured video of the moment that a bomb detonated and blew up a large portion of a key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. A Ukraine official vowed that the huge explosion is only ""the beginning.""

At sunrise on Saturday, a massive explosion destroyed part of the Kerch Bridge – a 12-mile road and rail bridge that links Crimea and Russia. Part of the bridge collapsed into the Kerch Strait. Russian authorities said three people were killed in the blast.









Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee stated, ""At 06:07 Moscow time today, an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed.""

Sergey Aksenov – the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea – confirmed that “two spans of the roadbed of the part [of the bridge] from Krasnodar to Kerch, collapsed.""

""Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that a truck bomb caused seven railway cars carrying fuel to catch fire, resulting in a 'partial collapse of two sections of the bridge,'"" the Associated Press reported.

Vladimir Putin ordered a “government commission” to investigate the Kerch Bridge “emergency,"" according to Russian state media TASS.



Mykhailo Podolyak – an adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky – did not directly take responsibility for the explosion, but said it was just ""the beginning.""

""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning. Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,"" Podolyak said on Saturday.

The official Twitter account for the government of Ukraine simply wrote, ""Sick burn.""

David Arakhamia – leader of the Servant of the People party in Ukraine – wrote on Telegram, ""Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode. And this is just the beginning. Of all things, reliable construction is not something Russia is particularly famous for.""

Oleksiy Danilov – the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council – posted a video of the Crimea Bridge on fire next to the 1962 video of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday Mr. President."" Vladimir Putin turned 70 years old on Friday.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova declared, ""The reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure shows its terrorist nature.""

The Kerch Bridge – also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge and the Crimean Bridge – is the longest in Europe and was opened by Vladimir Putin in 2018. The $3.7 billion bridge crosses over the Kerch Strait – which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Kerch Bridge links Russia's Krasnodar region with the Crimean Peninsula – which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.

The Crimean Bridge can reportedly handle 40,000 cars a day and 14 million passengers, plus 13 million tons of cargo per year. The bridge gives Russia access to important Ukrainian ports such as Sevastopol, and is a critical supply route to transport fuel, goods, and military weapons into Crimea. At the time of completion, Russian media hailed the bridge as ""the construction of the century.""

In 2021, Russian National Guard Chief Viktor Zolotov said, ""The facilities of the Kerch transport link are today comprehensively protected on the ground, from the air and from the water and under the water.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crimea-bridge-explosion-bomb-russia-ukraine-war,2022-10-08
"Critics blast New York's unfunded, unworkable, and likely unconstitutional social media disclosure rules for gun permits","When New York's new gun control law takes effect this September, applicants seeking a concealed carry permit will be required to turn over lists of their social media accounts to authorities as part of their permit application. It's a requirement that critics say is both unfunded and difficult to enforce.

Beginning Sept. 1, New York gun owners seeking a concealed weapons permit will be required to submit information on all their active and inactive social media accounts from the past three years for a review of their ""character and conduct,"" according to the Associated Press. They'll also need to take safety training courses, provide four character references, and sit through in-person interviews as part of the application process.

Anyone seeking a concealed carry permit will be required to show that they have ""the essential character, temperament and judgement necessary to be entrusted with a weapon and to use it only in a manner that does not endanger oneself or others,"" the law says.

These are restrictions New York adopted after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees the right of Americans to carry weapons for personal protection. Democrats and anti-gun activists support the requirements, arguing a social media review can help screen for mentally disturbed individuals who may harm themselves or others if they have access to firearms.

They point to the recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, where the gunman made several disturbing social media posts before murdering 19 children and two adults in an elementary school, and in Highland Park, Illinois, where a young man had uploaded violent imagery to his social media profiles before shooting up a Fourth of July parade.

But gun rights activists have criticized the measures, which they say infringe on privacy and free speech rights, let alone gun rights.

“This is the kind of bill that the Gestapo would be proud of. This is the kind of bill you’d see in communist China,” the New York State Firearms Association's Aaron Dorr said last week after Democrats introduced the bill. ""This will never survive a court challenge. This is the kind of concept that would pass in those countries.""

Aside from the constitutional concerns, there are practical concerns over how New York's law will be enforced. Local sheriffs' offices, judges, and county clerks are tasked with reviewing an applicant's social media profiles for evidence of dangerous behavior.

But Peter Kehoe, the executive director of the New York Sheriffs’ Association, told the Associated Press that New York sheriffs' departments haven't received additional funding from the state or personnel resources to conduct those reviews. Kehoe said the law infringes on gun rights and that local officials are unlikely to spend time reviewing social media accounts.

""I don’t think we would do that,” Kehoe said. “I think it would be a [un]constitutional invasion of privacy.”



Legal experts have also raised concerns about how officials are supposed to interpret social media posts.

""Where this will get tricky is to what extent this is expression and to what extent is this evidence of wrongdoing?” said James Densley, a criminal justice professor at Metro State University.



Adam Scott Wandt, a public policy professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the AP that the New York law appears rushed and vague, and could set bad precedents for mandatory social media disclosures for other types of licenses.

“I think that what we might have done as a state here in New York is, we may have confirmed their worst fears — that a slippery slope will be created that will slowly reduce their rights to carry guns and allow a bureaucracy to decide, based on unclear criteria, who can have a gun and who cannot,” Wandt said. “Which is exactly what the Supreme Court was trying to avoid.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/critics-blast-new-york-s-unfunded-unworkable-and-likely-unconstitutional-social-media-disclosure-rules-for-gun-permits,2022-07-08
Crook uses pickax to try breaking into home after midnight. But homeowner has a gun — and intruder doesn't stand a chance.,"We've said it before; we'll say it again. Those apparently out to violate the law and hurt and take from others in the process still don't seem to understand that everyday folks all over are choosing to exercise their Second Amendment rights and arm themselves for protection.

Especially when their homes and lives are threatened. The scenario of intruders getting fatally shot by homeowners is becoming a familiar one, and it has already played out a couple of times this month. In both cases, not only did the suspects apparently ignore the possibility that their victims may, in fact, be armed, but they also physically charged at or attacked the homeowners.

And a weaponless physical attacker typically loses to someone with a gun.

Never bring a pickax to a gun fight

On Friday morning yet another information-deprived individual decided to throw his hat into the ring and try a home invasion — but this one ended with a rather pointed twist.

Police were called around 1 a.m. to a San Antonio home in the 100 block of Arlington Court, not far from South Presa Street, after getting word that shots had been fired, KSAT-TV reported.

Police said the homeowner, a man in his 30s, fired three shots at an intruder who was trying to force his way inside the Texas residence through a window — using a pickax, the station said.

Naturally, the pickax-wielding suspect lost the battle.

Police said the intruder — a man in his 20s — was hit at least once and ran to a nearby fire station for help, KSAT reported, adding that he was taken to Brooke Army Medical Center for his injuries.

According to KENS-TV, the intruder was shot in the chest and was in serious condition.

Police are still investigating this incident, KENS said, adding that the homeowner who fired the gun is not expected to face charges.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crook-pickax-homeowner-has-gun,2021-02-12
"Crook steals car, drives off, ditches it, then tries breaking into nearby residence. But gun-toting homeowner ends his escapade.","Ryan Johnson Davis' calendar apparently displayed a full schedule Thursday night.

What happened?

Phoenix, Arizona, police said the 32-year-old allegedly stole a vehicle near 51st and Van Buren Streets around 10 p.m., KPNX-TV reported, adding that Davis dished out a minor injury to the owner who fought with the suspect to prevent his car from being stolen.

Davis then allegedly drove a few miles away to the area of 53rd Street and Indian School Road, where he ditched the car and tried to break into a home, KPHO-TV reported.

But the homeowner had a gun — and wasn't having any of it. KPNX said the homeowner shot Davis.

What happened to the suspect?

Soon after the suspect was arrested and taken to a hospital with an injury that wasn't life threatening, KPNX reported.

When Davis was released from the hospital, the station said he was booked into the Maricopa County Jail for robbery, theft of means of transportation, residential burglary, and trespassing.

UPDATE: Nov. 19, 10 p.m.: According to the Maricopa County Superior Court, Davis pleaded guilty to reduced charges on criminal trespass and theft — and that paved the way for the dismissal of his third and fourth charges.

He was sentenced to probation on May 26, court records indicate.

Crook throws dumbbell through glass door — even after homeowner warns him he's armed. Crook should have sheltered in place this night.,"It was quite the night for Hunter Layne Harrison.

Things started out eerily around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when a homeowner in Putnam County, Georgia, called 911 saying a man armed with a knife was up a tree making a disturbance, WGXA-TV reported, citing County Sheriff Howard Sills.

What happened next?

Deputies headed to the home, but on their way to the scene a second alert came in — from the first caller's next-door neighbors who said the man was trying to break into their home, the station noted.

Harrison, identified as the suspect, picked up a concrete landscaping border brick and threw it through a locked glass door that led to an enclosed porch, Sills told WGXA.

After getting to the porch, Harrison beat on the french glass door to the home, and the 28-year-old was screaming to be let in, the station said. But the homeowner hollered back that he was armed, and Harrison needed to leave, WGXA said.

Oh, you and your old gun!

Apparently unmoved at the prospect of being filled with lead, Harrison picked up a dumbbell on the porch, threw it through the glass door, and entered the home, Sills told the station.

Promises kept

As you might guess, the homeowner wasn't kidding. He fired his .45 semiautomatic, shooting the suspect once in the arm, WGXA said. Harrison fell to the kitchen floor, and the homeowner held him until deputies arrived, the station said.

After deputies made it to the house, they sent the homeowner, his wife, and their child to a bedroom to wait out the situation, WGXA said.

Fella's got gumption

When the deputies tried handcuffing Harrison, he battled with the deputies and splattered blood across the kitchen before breaking free, cursing out the officers, and running toward a door he believed was an exit, Sills told the station.

But not a lot of smarts

However, the sheriff told WGXA that Harrison — not realizing the home was under construction — exited a door that no longer led to a back deck.

With that, he fell nine feet to the ground where deputies finally arrested him, the station said.

Not that Harrison was ready to give up just yet, believe it or not.

Officers had to use pepper spray to subdue the suspect and keep his feet shackled to prevent him from running off, the station said, adding that he continued to fight deputies when he was being taken to an ambulance that had arrived at the house.

Harrison underwent surgery to remove a bullet from his arm, WGXA said, and once he's released he'll be booked.

'These hoodlums make me sick'

""These hoodlums make me sick,"" Sills told the station in the aftermath. ""He's got a 20-page raps sheet, and he's over at the hospital taking up a bed where someone more important who might have coronavirus might need it.""



The sheriff added to WGXA that he has warrants to charge Harrison with home invasion, first-degree burglary, three counts of felony obstruction, and one count of disorderly conduct.

Sills also told the station that Harrison at the time of the incident was on probation for a 2014 burglary in Putnam County, damaging government property in Putnam County two years later, and driving with a suspended license and giving a false name to law enforcement in Greene County in 2018.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crook-throws-dumbbell-through-glass-door--even-after-homeowner-warns-him-hes-armed-crook-should-have-sheltered-in-place-this-night,2020-03-26
Crooks break down home's front door in dead of night. But homeowner has a motion sensor — and a gun — just waiting for them.,"A quartet of criminals probably figured they'd pull off their heist rather easily, given they gathered in the dead of night — around 3:40 a.m. — last Thursday on the front porch of a Phoenix home near 36th Avenue and Pinnacle Peak Road.

The crooks had their masks on. Nobody else was around. One pair stood by the door; the other two were a few feet behind and at the ready.

Suddenly one of the crooks kicked in the front door, and the first two fellas began to breach the entrance, according to surveillance video of the incident.



But the home invaders had met their match.

What happened next?

You see, the homeowner's motion sensor linked to the security camera issued an alert, and the homeowner was able to see what was going on outside, AZFamily said.

And the homeowner also prepared another way: by exercising rights found in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. And so, thanks to the few seconds the surveillance system gave the homeowner to get a gun, the crooks were about to say hello to a force they clearly weren't prepared to deal with.

And with that, police said the homeowner fired more than one shot at the suspects after the front door was forced open. The outlet added that detectives believe some of the suspects were armed.

Amid the gunfire, the crooked crew got the message loud and clear that they were not welcome, and they bolted from the porch.

Oops.

They ran toward a getaway vehicle — a gray four-door sedan, police said — and one of the suspects comically tripped and fell after getting tangled in the legs of his comrade as they all seemed enthusiastic about getting as far away from the hail of bullets as possible.

The suspects got into the vehicle and drove away from the area, AZFamily said.



There was no word on the conditions of their hearts (or their underwear) in the wake of their frantic getaway.

Anything else?

The outlet said police didn't release descriptions of the suspects but hope the video of the break-in will create some leads. AZFamily said that anyone with information is asked to call the Phoenix Police Department or call Silent Witness at either 480-WITNESS (948-6377) or 1-800-343-TIPS (8477).

Crooks bust into apartment in broad daylight but quickly turn tail and run — one jumping a second-floor balcony — when resident opens fire,"A surveillance video showed a trio of men busting into a Florida apartment just before 6 p.m. Tuesday.

But seconds later they were high-tailing back through the door, one of them so freaked out he hopped over a second-floor balcony to make his escape.

What changed their minds so quickly?



Well, the break-in victim at the Park Place Apartments in Neptune Beach had a gun — and used it, WJXT-TV reported.

What are the details?

The station said the suspects were in the apartment for about eight seconds before the resident opened fire with five gunshots.

Here's raw video:

Neptune Beach police confirmed one was shot in the chest and is at a hospital while the other two suspects are still on the run, WJXT said, adding that the shot man hasn't been identified.



Surveillance images from a nearby parking lot show the suspects leaving in two getaway cars, a red Kia and a silver Pontiac, the station said.

Ken Jefferson — WJXT's crime and safety expert and a former Jacksonville Sheriff's Office detective — told the station it was a ""very scary situation"" but ""this homeowner realizes he has the right to protect himself, and he pulls out his gun, and he begins to fire. He's well within justification to do that.""

"Crooks follow man home, pull gun on him outside door, demand entry. But victim refuses to back down.","After a business owner closed up shop Thursday night in downtown Philadelphia, he returned home to a terrifying surprise.

He discovered two men had been following him, and as he got outside his northeast Philadelphia house, the two men confronted the 41-year-old victim with a gun and a crowbar and tried to rob him, police told WPVI-TV.

""A guy came behind him and then put a gun behind him and told him to open the door and let him in,"" the man's wife told the station off camera. ""He wanted to come to our house.""

No way

But the homeowner refused to back down and began fighting with the crooks, WPVI said, pushing and kicking to keep them from getting into his house.

His wife explained to the station what happened next.

""I opened the door — not all the way — and my husband's right at the door. The guy's two steps down. He still tried to kick him while my husband sneaked in quickly. And we slammed the door shut,"" she told WPVI.

The couple locked the door and called 911, the station said.

The suspect in custody will be charged with attempted robbery and other offenses, WPVI reported. The only description of the suspect who got away was that he was wearing dark clothing, the station added.

Nothing was taken from the home, and no one was injured, WPVI noted, and police found the crowbar they believe one of the suspects used.

Two masked men break into home and shoot homeowner. But victim grabs his own gun — and one intruder pays dearly.,"A pair of masked men broke into a North Carolina home Wednesday night and shot the homeowner, WRAL-TV reported.

But the 46-year-old owner of the Fayetteville residence scuffled with the intruders, retrieved his own gun, and opened fire, the station said.

Sheriff's deputies responding to the scene around 8:30 p.m. found one of suspected intruders — 23-year-old Henry Miller — dead outside the home, WRAL noted.

Authorities told the station the second intruder apparently fled the scene, possibly in a white sedan.

No charges have been filed in the case, WRAL reported, adding that the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said it looks like matter of self-defense.

Sheriff's spokesman Sean Swain told the station that Miller ""was just leaving the residence when he was shot.""

A woman inside the home was shot in the leg, WTVD-TV reported, adding that she was taken to a hospital with injuries that weren't considered life-threatening.

Current Cuomo aide accuses NY gov of blatant sexual harassment after her friend said he groped her underneath her blouse,"A current aide of Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) has accused the New York governor of sexual harassment and misconduct.

Over the last several weeks, multiple women have accused Cuomo of making inappropriate remarks and engaging in disturbing sexual behaviors including making unwelcome advances, including the woman's friend — also a Cuomo aide — who said earlier in March that Cuomo put his hand underneath her blouse and groped her.

The 63-year-old Democrat has denied any wrongdoing.

What are the details?

In a Sunday New York Times report, the aide, Alyssa McGrath, accused Cuomo of ""ogling her body, remarking on her looks, and making suggestive comments to her and another woman in his office.""

The Times reported that Cuomo called McGrath and a female co-worker ""mingle mamas"" and inquired about her ""lack of a wedding ring"" and the status of her divorce.

""She recalled him telling her she was beautiful — in Italian — and, as she sat alone with him in his office awaiting dictation, he gazed down her shirt and commented on a necklace hanging there,"" the outlet noted.

McGrath, a 33-year-old woman who has been working for the Cuomo administration since 2018, said that during one encounter, she was summoned to Cuomo's office for dictation.

""I put my head down waiting for him to start speaking, and he didn't start speaking,"" she said. ""So I looked up to see what was going on. And he was blatantly looking down my shirt.""

She said that Cuomo then asked her, ""What's on your necklace?""

The necklace, McGrath said, was in her shirt.

""He has a way of making you feel very comfortable around him, almost like you're his friend,"" she recalled. ""But then you walk away from your encounter or conversation, in your head going, 'I can't believe I just had that interaction with the governor of New York.'""

McGrath said of the continued flow of women making accusations against the governor, ""It makes me really upset to hear him speak about this and completely deny all allegations. And I have no doubt in my mind that all of these accusers are telling the truth.""

In a statement, Cuomo's lawyer, Rita Glavin, responded to McGrath's allegations by saying that he never made ""inappropriate advances or inappropriately touched anyone.""

""The governor has greeted men and women with hugs and a kiss on the cheek, forehead, or hand,"" Glavin said. ""Yes, he has posed for photographs with his arm around them. Yes, he uses Italian phrases like 'Ciao bella.' None of this is remarkable, although it may be old-fashioned. He has made clear that he has never made inappropriate advances or inappropriately touched anyone.""



The Times reported that Cuomo has ""asked New Yorkers to await the outcome of two investigations into the multiple allegations of sexual harassment against him before passing judgment.""

McGrath said that during a 2019 Christmas party, Cuomo ""kissed [her] on the forehead.""

""And in the picture we posed with him that year, he is gripping our sides very tightly,"" she recalled.

McGrath has continued to go to work amid the burgeoning number of allegations against the Democratic lawmaker.

""She says that executive offices are largely quiet, far from the heady days of Mr. Cuomo's pandemic-related popularity, when the halls of the Capitol buzzed with excitement and purpose,"" the Times noted.

Anything else?

Earlier in March, a Cuomo aide said that he reached underneath her blouse and groped her chest while the two were alone in the executive mansion.

McGrath said that the woman — her co-worker, who has not been publicly identified at the time of this reporting — ""froze"" when the alleged interaction took place.

""She froze when he started doing that stuff to her,"" she said. ""But who are you going to tell?""

McGrath said that the co-worker told her that Cuomo directed her not to talk to McGrath — with whom she shares a friendly relationship — about the alleged incident.

""He told her specifically not to tell me,"" she said.



The Times noted, ""Over the last three years, Ms. McGrath said, the governor had seemingly fostered an unusual work triangle with her and her friend, the co-worker he allegedly groped, blending a professional relationship with unwanted attention. There was paternalistic patter, but also a commandeering, sometimes invasive physicality.""

In a statement, Mariann Wang, an attorney for McGrath, told the Times, ""This would be unacceptable behavior from any boss, much less the governor.""

""The women in the executive chamber are there to work for the State of New York,"" Wang added, ""not serve as [Cuomo's] eye candy or prospective girlfriend.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/current-cuomo-aide-accuses-gov-sexual-harassment,2021-03-22
"Dad arrested, charged after beating man, 20, he found in his 14-year-old daughter's room","A Georgia dad is facing an aggravated assault charge after beating a 20-year-old man he found in his 14-year-old daughter's bedroom.

Police say they likely would not have pursued legal action in the case had it not been for the father allegedly firing his gun as the suspect fled his property.

What are the details?

Ismael Casillas, 41, discovered Keywontrezes Humphries in his daughter's room in the early morning hours of July 4th. Casillas beat Humphries, knocking out some of his teeth and choking him.

Authorities told WAGA-TV that they were sympathetic to Casillas' reaction and might not have charged him with anything had it not been for the father allegedly asking his wife at that point to get his gun.

After Humphries jumped out a window of the home, Casillas met him in the front yard and continued the beating, allegedly threatening the 20-year-old's life. Investigators said Casillas then fired shots as Humphries took off.

According to The Daily Mail, investigator Scott Kilgore explained, ""There is a line that he can't cross, we can't cross, when somebody is no longer a threat to you. My advice would be let it go and contact us and let us handle it. Don't take it into your own hands.""

Police caught up with Humphries, arrested him and charged him with child molestation for allegedly being in a sexual relationship with Casillas' daughter, whom he met online through playing Xbox. Humphries had driven two hours to visit the girl at the family's home. More charges are possible against Humphries, as the investigation continues.

Anything else?

Casillas' wife, Kristy, started a GoFundMe account to assist with the family's legal bills, wherein she warns, ""watch your kids when gaming online.""

Kristy Casillas also explains:

My husband did what anyone else would have done, we had no idea who this man was, did he just rape our daughter, was he trying to obduct (sic) our daughter, is this a home invasion, and does he have a gun in his waistband, in his car??

"Dad hears daughter scream, runs to her room, tackles intruder — and holds him at gunpoint until police arrive","A North Carolina husband and father told Lincoln County Sheriff's deputies that he was lying in bed Thursday morning when his wife and daughter returned to their Lincolnton home from a dentist appointment, WHKY radio reported.



But soon after he heard his daughter scream and ran to her room where he encountered an intruder, the station said.

Fatherly instincts naturally in full effect, he tackled the intruder, WHKY noted.

And Dad also had a gun, which he used to hold the intruder until deputies arrived on the scene, the station said, adding that no one was injured during the incident.

What do we know about the alleged intruder?

Jason Kane Tillman, 43, of Lincolnton was arrested and charged with four counts of felony breaking and entering, one felony count of attempted breaking and entering to a building, one felony count of larceny from a building, and one felony count of possession of stolen property, WHKY said.

Tillman was jailed under a $51,000 secured bond, the station said. His district court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 24, WHKY added.



The station also said deputies were in the area at the time of the incident for reports of a suspicious vehicle and building break-ins; authorities believe entry into the gun owner's home was made through a basement window.

Police said the man woke up to the sound of glass breaking in his young son's bedroom and near the front door of their apartment, the station reported, after which the father got his gun and opened his bedroom door.

Image source: WTVF-TV video screenshot

The dad saw an unknown man standing in the hallway of the apartment, WTVF said, adding that he shot at the man nine times, hitting him once in the jaw and neck area and possibly three times in the chest. Several bullets that missed traveled into the apartment across the hallway, the station added.

Officers responded to the call about the incident in the 3000 block of Andrew Jackson Way around 7:50 a.m., WTVF said.

What happened to the break-in suspect?

The still-unidentified break-in suspect was taken to Vanderbilt Hospital in critical condition with life-threatening injuries, the station said, adding that he was unconscious, intubated, and in surgery. Police told WTVF it could take weeks for him to wake up, assuming he survives.

Act of self-defense

The father told police he has no connection to the suspect and fired at him in fear and self-defense, the station said, adding that investigators concur that the shooting was an act of self-defense. If that conclusion stands, the suspect would face burglary charges, WTVF added.

'I would've done the same thing for my family'

Peter Olson lives in the building adjacent to where the break-in and shooting took place, the station said. While he's worried about his children's safety and said bullets could have entered his apartment in a similar scenario, WTVF said, Olson defended the dad for protecting his son and himself.

'There is indisputable evidence of Putin’s war crimes everywhere': Two Republican lawmakers become the first US officials known to visit Ukraine since beginning of Russian invasion,"Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana and Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana have become the first American officials known to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion started in late February.

For well over a month, Ukraine has been facing a brutal onslaught as Russia has wreaked death and destruction. But Ukraine has been striving to defend itself.



Daines noted that proof of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war crimes abound.

""There is indisputable evidence of Putin’s war crimes everywhere—the images of shallow mass graves filled with civilians, women and children are heart wrenching,"" Daines noted in a statement, according to NBC News. ""America and the world need to know about Putin’s atrocities against the innocent people of Ukraine now, not after time has passed and the aftermath of evil and bloodshed have been cleaned up.""



Spartz, who entered office last year, became the first Ukrainian-born legislator to serve in the U.S. Congress, according to the New York Times.



""Nothing can substitute for actually being here, seeing it first-hand, spending time with the people and leaders here in Ukraine who have been horribly affected by this war,"" Daines said during an interview, according to the Times.

""I hope that our visit will encourage more American officials and leaders to come, to stand with the people of Ukraine,” Daines said, according to the outlet.

Spartz remarked that it was ""important to show our support, to show we care,"" the Times noted.



""We’ve been driving for miles and miles and miles, seeing death and destruction caused by Vladimir Putin in this evil invasion,"" Daines said. ""I think we should be providing the lethal aid that they need to win this war,"" the senator said, according to the Times. ""The humanitarian crisis will not end until the war ends. And the war will not end until the Ukrainians win.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/daines-and-sdaines-and-spartz-visit-ukrainepartz-visit-ukraine,2022-04-15
"Dallas man allegedly shoots burglar, then goes back to bed — now he's in jail on murder charges","A Dallas man heard a burglar trying to break into the storage shed behind his home early Thursday morning, so he grabbed his gun and went outside. The ensuing altercation left the homeowner in jail on murder charges, according to The Dallas Morning News.

James Michael Meyer, 72, said he confronted a man who was trying to break open the shed with a pickax, yelling at him to stop and to not come any closer.

The burglar did not listen, instead taking a few steps toward Meyer. So, Meyer fired his handgun at him once, sending the suspect running toward a park behind the home. Meyer said he shot one more time in the direction of the man, ""into the night"" and then went back to bed without calling the police.

The incident occurred around 5 a.m. As the sun was coming up, Meyer looked from his house toward the park and noticed what he initially thought was a ""black bag"" in the distance, so he went to investigate. He found a dead body.

Meyer called the police around 7 a.m. and police arrived at the scene to find the body with a bullet wound in the back of the neck and blood that was dry. Investigators didn't find the spent shell casings outside, and Meyer's informed them he had thrown them in the trash.

According to the affidavit, the second shot ""into the night"" was the one that killed the burglar, and it was fired after ""the threat of serious bodily injury against him was over"" because the burglar had dropped the pickax and run away.

Meyer's wife reportedly called an attorney for legal advice before Meyer called 911. During the 911 call, police say, Meyer would not answer dispatchers' questions.

Neighbors reported to the police that they heard three gunshots, contradicting Meyer's account that he only shot twice.

Daughter of Uighur man 'disappeared' by Chinese gov't rips Disney 'disgrace' of profiting off persecution of people,"Jewher Ilham has not seen her father since 2013 — when the Chinese Communist government arrested him before he could board a plane to Indiana and ""disappeared"" him.

Now Ilham, a member of the Chinese Uighur people, is calling out Disney for playing footsie with China's oppressive government in order to gain access to the nation to film its newest movie, ""Mulan"" and screen the movie in the nation's theaters.

What did she say?

Disney has come under fire for filming ""Mulan"" in the Chinese province where Uighur Muslims are being held in concentration camps and then using the movie's credits to thank the agency that runs the camps for its help.

In an op-ed titled ""The Chinese Government Locked Up My Uighur Father. Disney's 'Mulan' Is a Disgrace"" for the Daily Beast on Thursday, Ilham, who currently serves as the Uighur Human Rights Fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C., explained that her father — a ""mild-mannered, studious professor of economics"" whose ""life's work was using his influence to promote peaceful coexistence between the Uighur people ... and the Han ethnic majority that rules China"" — was arrested by the Communist government in 2013 just before he was to get on a plane to the U.S. for an Indiana University Fellowship.

His efforts at ""peaceful coexistence,"" she said, ran counter to the interests of the Chinese government, and he was sentenced in 2014 to life in prison.

She has not heard from her father since the day before his arrest and has heard nothing of his whereabouts since 2017.

So naturally, Ilham is not impressed with Disney's cozy relationship with the very people who have reportedly put some 1 million ethnic minorities in concentration camps while using an ancient Chinese legend to make millions of dollars:

In many ways, I can identify with the title character in Disney's Mulan films, based on the ancient Chinese legend. In the story, as China calls up the men from every family to defend against a foreign invasion, Mulan dresses as a boy and fights in the place of her father, who is too old to go himself. As a child growing up in Beijing, I loved the legend and the fun Disney cartoon version produced in 1998. Little did I know that I, like Mulan, would later be fighting for my own father—helping to carry on his work while he is unjustly imprisoned. I hope, like her, to achieve victory by one day gaining my father's release.



Today, sadly, a new retelling of the Mulan story, once again by Disney, is profiting from the oppression of my people. This live-action version was filmed partly in the Uighur region—officially known in China as “Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region""—where the Chinese Communist government is holding at least one million members of Turkic ethnic minorities in concentration camps as part of a coordinated genocidal campaign. My father, if he is alive, may be among them—nobody will allow us to visit him, or even tell us where he is.



Despite widespread international condemnation of China's brutal tactics in Xinjiang, Disney still chose to go there to film this movie, delivering money and the prestige of an international “family"" brand to those directly engaged in genocide. Adding insult to injury, in the closing credits, they even made sure to thank the local government “bureau of public security"" (also known as state police) and “publicity department"" (or propaganda). These are the very same government agencies in the Uighur region that are imprisoning Uighurs and other Turkic minorities, and then telling their families and the international press they are merely being held in “training centers."" The “public security"" office is currently under sanctions by the U.S. government for human rights abuses.

Ilham noted that the government have been oppressing the Uighur people since at least the 1950s and have become more aggressive about it.



She's calling on the world to boycott 'Mulan'

Sadly, she said, the West has become increasingly complicit in the government's ""cultural genocide"" — especially major multinational corporations like Nike, Apple and Gap that rely on China's use of political prisoners for forced labor.

Hollywood, she stated, is as guilty as those other companies about getting suckered into doing business with and cozying up to China. And now she's calling on the world to boycott ""Mulan"":

Hollywood isn't immune from the charms of Beijing either. The promise of access to the massive Chinese market is irresistible for a movie industry desperate for revenue in the COVID era when movie ticket sales are down. While many theaters in the United States remain shut down, Mulan will be opening in Chinese theaters.



It appears, sadly, that Disney is the latest in the long and disappointing line of Western people and companies taken advantage of by China. We can hope, at least, that the outcry against Disney on behalf of the Uighurs and freedom-loving people everywhere will not only lead others to #BoycottMulan in the short term, but in the long term demand that Western companies cease cooperating with Chinese oppression.

Ilham concluded by saying she hopes this exposure will rally nations around the globe to stop letting China's Communist government get away with its myriad abuses.

Dean Norris tells capitalists to 'stfu' about high gas prices,"Actor Dean Norris has a message for capitalism supporters who are displeased about the sky-high gas prices they have been facing lately: They can just ""stfu,"" Norris said, using an abbreviation for the profane expression shut the f*** up.

""Youre not getting 'robbed' at the pump. You're paying fair market price for a commodity. If you love Capitalism so much then stfu,"" Norris tweeted on Wednesday.

The actor, who has played roles in television shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" and ""United States of Al,"" made the comment as Americans continue to face soaring gas prices. As of Thursday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $5.009.

""This comment is evidence that Dean knows nothing about fair or free markets or economics,"" RedState managing editor Jennifer Van Laar tweeted in response to the actor's remarks.

""It's not a fair-market price if government purposely creates scarcity to drive up the price,"" tweeted David Harsanyi, a senior editor at the Federalist.

Someone else responded to Norris's post by tweeting, ""yeah those gas prices determined by the market that's totally free and not at all distorted by government.""

""Another dimwit leftist rich actor spouting stupidity,"" someone else declared.

The Biden administration has been largely blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine for high fuel prices. The president recently issued a letter putting pressure on the leaders of major oil companies — according to Axios, the letter was directed to the leaders of ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP America, Shell USA, Phillips 66, Marathon, and Valero.

""Your companies and others have an opportunity to take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product you are producing and supplying to the United States market,"" Biden said in a the letter.

"Defiant Ukrainian soldiers who told Russia, 'Go f*** yourself,' and refused to surrender may still be alive","The brave Ukrainian soldiers who told invading Russian forces to ""go f*** yourself"" may still be alive, according to a report from the Jerusalem Post.

The group of 13 soldiers made headlines last week after refusing to surrender to a Russian warship as it stormed 42-acre Snake Island.

What are the details?

Ukraine's navy on Monday announced that the soldiers on Snake Island — who were initially believed to have died during the violent Russian incursion — may well be alive and in Russian custody.

Initial reports of the incident indicated that the band of soldiers sacrificed themselves after keeping at bay two Russian warships for a period of several hours.

The report from the Jerusalem Post noted, however, that the navy announced the soldiers may not have been killed during the attack.

“We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive,” the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in Saturday statement. “Preliminary information that border guards may be dead came before the defenders lost contact.”

The New York Post added that Russian media reported that the soldiers ""had been captured after they laid down their arms and were transported to Sevastopol on the Russian-controlled Crimea Peninsula.""

The State Border Guard Service added that the information had not been confirmed.

A roughly translated Facebook post from the Naval Forces Commandments Armed Forces of Ukraine also said:

Regarding the actions of the Russian Federation near the island of Zmí їnij February 26th, receiving the information that on the o [sic]. A snake among our defenders may be killed and wounded, a Sapphire civilian ship was sent to the island to carry out a humanitarian mission to help the victims. Together with the crew agreed to leave father Vasily Virozub, Alexander Chokov and their assistants. But they were illegally captured by the Russians. Illegal capture of a civilian ship - a non-combatant without performing any military mission, is a violation of the rules and customs of war, international humanitarian law.



We demand from Russia the immediate release of illegally occupied citizens of Ukraine. We address the world community, to the believers of all churches requesting to take all possible measures to influence the Russian Federation for the return of our citizens. Regarding the Marines and border guards, who were taken captive by Russian occupiers on the island of Snake.



We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well with them! But Russian propaganda tries to twist the ""news"" about the fact that the Ukrainian authorities ""forgotten"", ""buried"" their fellows.



At the same time, the sailors bravely rebuked twice the attacks of the Russian invaders. Because of BC's marriage, they could not continue the protection of the island. In turn, the invaders ""forgot"" to report that they had completely destroyed the island's infrastructure: lighthouse, carnations, antennas, etc. Accordingly, the connection with the snake was interrupted. Repeated attempts to contact the personal team and learn about its fate were futile. And the permanent shelling on the side of warships and aviation of the Russian Federation did not allow to help the Marines.



In summary, we want to add, the enemy once demonstrated his essence. He proved again that there is no faith and truth in his actions and words.

And we are looking forward to our brothers and with all our soul.

What else?

Previous reporting stated that the soldiers' message went viral — and audio footage captured the moment Ukrainian soldiers told the Russian warship where to go.

""This is a Russian military ship,"" a portion of the communication said. ""I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise we will open fire on you.""

One of the soldiers took to the radio and responded, ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself!""

Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the time said that all 13 soldiers died as a result of the incursion, ""but did not surrender.""

""All of them will be named Heroes of Ukraine,"" he said. ""May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever,"" said Zelenskyy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/defiant-ukrainian-soldiers-who-told-russia-go-f-yourself-and-refused-to-surrender-may-still-be-alive,2022-02-28
"Democrats wear African kente cloths, take a knee for George Floyd before introducing police reform bill","Congressional Democrats engaged in some performative demonstration Monday morning before introducing a police reform legislative package while wearing traditional west African accessories.

Democrats from the House and Senate knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in the Capitol Visitor Center while wearing kente cloths, with the time being a reference to how long George Floyd was pinned to the ground by the former Minneapolis police officer who killed him.

Once they got up, they held a joint news conference during which they unveiled a police reform legislative package that included a ban on chokeholds and some increased accountability measures for police departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the details of the reforms are not the main story, however.



""The story that leaves here, as Mr. [James] Clyburn said, is liberty and justice for all,"" Pelosi said.

Pelosi also dismissed safety concerns some have expressed amid all the talk of pulling funding from police departments.

""The martyrdom of George Floyd — and by Tuesday, by tomorrow, may he rest in peace — has made a change in the world,"" Pelosi said. ""So let's not get into these questions that may be from the small minds of some, as far as safety is concerned, but look at it writ large.""

Safety is a concern as some pivot from calls for police reform to calls to defund the police, or in the case of Minneapolis, disbanding the police department altogether. These movements lead to obvious questions about public safety, and what potential replacements for police departments look like. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not support defunding police.

Some on the right are open to a decrease in the power of government law enforcement, believing in the value of exercising the right to bear arms for personal protection of property. However, in Democratic areas where gun rights are consistently under attack, it's unclear what an alternative to police departments would look like for public safety.

Minnesota City Council President Lisa Bender said on CNN that questions about who one might call in the event of a home invasion if not the police come from a place of privilege.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-african-kente-cloths-take-a-knee-for-george-floyd-before-introducing-police-reform-bill,2020-06-08
"Democrats block bill that would restart Keystone pipeline, boost US energy production","House Democrats this week blocked a motion to consider a Republican bill that would reauthorize construction of the TransCanada Keystone pipeline and restart the federal oil leasing program, among other things, in an effort to boost domestic energy production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Daily Caller reported.

The legislation — called the American Energy Independence from Russia Act — was introduced in the House by Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Natural Resources Committee ranking member Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) on Feb. 28. The bicameral bill was also introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) on March 3.

It comes at a time when gas prices are skyrocketing in the U.S. due to private-sector boycotts and a public-sector embargo on imports of Russian oil in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The global energy supply disruption has exposed the West's reliance on Russian energy sources and thus renewed calls to bolster American energy independence.

Republicans have argued for years that the U.S. should seek energy independence as a matter of national security, and the current conflict with Russia has undoubtedly served to strengthen the argument.

Yet, according to the Daily Caller, on Wednesday evening, 219 Democrats in the House voted down a motion to consider the legislation. The Epoch Times reported that a motion to consider the bill was also shot down by Democrats on March 1.

The legislation would immediately reauthorize the construction of the Keystone pipeline from Canada to Montana and restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, both of which were suspended by the Biden administration last year.

It would also require the Biden administration to submit an energy security plan to Congress within 30 days that would grow America’s oil and natural gas production to offset Russian imports.

In a joint statement to introduce the legislation, Reps. McMorris Rodgers and Westerman said, ""Putin and Russia’s economy are dependent upon dominating energy production and exporting to other nations. He gains power by doing so, and it’s what funds his military and aggressive behavior. To counter Putin, our bill flips the switch to promote American energy jobs, production, and exports.""

The president was torched on social media this week after he begged foreign despots and dictators to increase their oil production in response to the global energy crisis rather than unleashing America's energy resources.

In a floor speech in support of the bill Wednesday, Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw (Texas) slammed President Joe Biden for his energy policies.

""This week our president — our American president — asked Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, asked them to boost their output so that American consumers wouldn’t see a spike in gas prices,"" Crenshaw said.

He added, ""Surely, [Biden] knows we can also boost domestic production right here at home. Surely he knows that domestic production supports American jobs, and surely he knows that domestic production is cleaner, by far, than foreign production.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-bill-that-would-restart-keystone-pipeline-boost-us-energy-production,2022-03-11
"Top Biden pollster issues dire warning that 'pissed' Americans 'don't feel Democrats can get their s**t together,' says Dems are facing bloodbath in midterm elections","John Anzalone served as chief pollster for Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign, as well as for the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Anzalone has done polling for numerous other Democrats, such as North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona. However, Anzalone was critical of Democrats in a recent podcast, where he voiced his fears that Democrats could get wiped out in the 2022 midterm elections.

In the recent episode of Politico's ""Playbook Deep Dive"" that was released on Friday, Anzalone warned that Americans are ""pissed."" The political strategist is extremely concerned that Democrats could get obliterated in the midterms – where they'll need to ""compete"" just to not get their ""a**es kicked.""

Host Ryan Lizza asked Anzalone, ""Let's just start off with how bad are things for Democrats this year and what can they do about it?""

Anzalone noted that American voters are always asking politicians, ""What have you done for me lately?” He adds, ""And they don’t feel Democrats can get their s**t together and get things done.""

""No one's going to sit there as a Democratic consultant and try to bulls**t you that this is anything but a really sour environment for Democrats,"" Anzalone admitted. ""So we better look at the strategic ways that we can compete, right? Just compete to not get our asses kicked.""



""Most Americans are pissed at the fact that they pay their fair share in taxes as middle-class people,"" the top Biden pollster expressed. ""They work hard. They want to see the benefits of the economy.""

He said that workers are getting pay increases; however, he acknowledged that the record inflation is ""eating it up.""

Anzalone asserted that voters are also ""pissed"" about ""big companies not paying any taxes."" He then commended President Biden's proposed tax hike on Americans making more than $400,000.

As a solution for Democrats to try to not get totally destroyed in the midterm elections, Anzalone proposed that Democrats should focus on doing something about health insurance costs, prescription drug costs, elderly care, and childcare. He speculates that if Democrats can show that they're helping working families that it will enable them to contend with several issues that are dragging down President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party – such as inflation, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the border crisis, and the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal.

Anzalone recommended that Democrats push a pro-union approach in areas that have a ""union culture.""

He said that the party needs to do better with male voters of all races, as well as college-educated men. The pollster said he is deeply concerned about male Latinos leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Republicans.

He advised Democrats to stop talking to Latinos about immigration, and to focus their message on the economy, inflation, healthcare, or schools. Anzalone suggested that Dems zero in on ""things like housing and crime"" when trying to woo Latino and black voters.

MSNBC opinion columnist Michael Cohen is also warning Democrats that they are facing a ""bloodbath"" in the midterm elections.

Citing record inflation, Cohen stated, ""It's precisely the kind of news that will compound the Democrats' political woes in November, which already looked dire.""

Cohen felt there was little the Democrats could do to prevent a demoralizing defeat in November.

""Rather than fight the prevailing political winds, Democrats would be better off acknowledging the reality that the midterm elections are going to be a bloodbath and focus instead on accomplishing as much as possible before then — the politics be damned,"" Cohen advocated. ""With the political situation looking increasingly bleak, Democrats have only one real option: pass their agenda.""

"Deputies: 15-year-old gave his life protecting his little sister, 5, from burglar","A Florida teenager was killed last week in an act of heroism, authorities say, when the honors student fought off a burglar to protect his 5-year-old little sister while their home was being invaded.

What are the details?

Deputies from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office were called to a Port Charlotte neighborhood Thursday at roughly 4:00 p.m. after receiving reports of an ""injured white male walking the streets."" Around the same time, a call came in that a burglary had occurred in the area, Fox News reported.

The officers were able to chase down and apprehend suspect Ryan Clayton Cole, 27, who was found with multiple stab wounds.

Following Cole's arrest, authorities searched other homes in the area, and discovered the body of Khyler Edman, 15. Khyler's 5-year-old sister was also found in their home, uninjured.

""We believe the teenager was trying to protect the home and protect (his) younger sibling,"" Charlotte County Sheriff Bill Prummell said during a press conference.

Now, according to local outlet WINK-TV, Khyler's ""family wants you to know who he is."" A spokesperson for Khyler's loved ones told the station, ""He loved his family. He was his sister's keeper. Khyler was a hero. He was a gentle soul. His life was taken away too early.""



A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family pay for the expenses of a funeral for the 10th grader. As of this writing, it has surpassed its $25,000 goal, and sits at more than $61,000. A Celebration of Life for Khyler has been planned for Oct. 5.

Ryan Cole was already known to police, has a history of drug use, and has been charged with burglary, theft, and violation of probation, KDVR-TV reported. The suspect has not been charged with Khyler's death, but police said the ""scene is still under investigation for additional charges related to the death investigation.""

"American diplomats meet with Zelenskyy, agree to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine","The U.S. agreed to provide the Ukrainian government with millions of dollars in military aid following a secretive meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top U.S. diplomats on Sunday.

The New York Post reported that the diplomats announced President Joe Biden’s plans to nominate Bridget Brink as the American ambassador to Ukraine and that American diplomats will return to Ukraine this week after evacuating the country before the Russian invasion began.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy and told him that the U.S. would provide his country with more than $300 million in military financing. The American diplomats also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition not made in the U.S. that will be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons.

The U.S. will be providing a total of $713 million for foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries. Of this money, $322 million will go to Ukraine.

The rest of the money will be split between NATO member nations and other countries that have provided military supplies to Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

With this latest aid package, the U.S. government has provided Ukraine with $3.7 billion in assistance since the beginning of the war.

This past Thursday, Biden pledged to give an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, including heavy artillery and drones.

As part of the $13.6 billion spending package approved by Congress last month to provide aid and relief to Ukraine and the country’s allies, the American legislative branch committed to spending a total of $6.5 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has made repeated pleas for military assistance from the U.S. since the Russian invasion began.

Before meeting with Blinken and Austin, Zelenskyy said, “We will talk about the list of weapons that we need and the pace of its supply. In recent weeks, the pace, the number has all improved. I’m grateful for that.”

Sunday’s meeting was kept very secret, as American officials refused to confirm that Zelenskyy and the American diplomats would be meeting even after the Ukrainian president announced the summit the day before.

Journalists who traveled with the American diplomatic contingent were not permitted to cross the border into Ukraine or disclose the location of the meeting. They were also barred from reporting on the trip until after it had concluded.

Diplomats stage walkout during Russian foreign minister's video address to UN Human Rights Council in protest of Ukraine invasion,"More than 100 diplomats staged a walkout Tuesday during Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's video address to the United Nations Human Rights Council in protest over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Japan, the European Union, and others exited the room while diplomats from Syria, China, and Venezuela — as well as Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Gennady Gatilov, a former Lavrov deputy — remained, the outlet said.

Lavrov addressed the U.N. remotely after canceling his visit over Russian claims that EU states blocked his flight path, Reuters said, adding that in his speech Lavrov accused the EU of ""Russophobic frenzy"" in giving weapons to Ukraine amid his country's invasion. The outlet added that Russia said its ""special military operation"" that began last week is aimed at removing ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine.

What did the diplomats have to say?

""This Russian war of aggression will have profound implications for human rights in Ukraine and Russia, and the leaders of Russia will be held accountable,"" Michele Taylor, the U.S. envoy to the Human Rights Council, said in a statement, Reuters reported.

Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod — both of whom walked out — joined Ukraine's ambassador, Yevheniia Filipenko, behind a large Ukrainian blue and yellow flag, the outlet said.

""It is a remarkable show of support for Ukrainians who are fighting for their independence,"" Filipenko told reporters, Reuters said. She added that Kharkiv — Ukraine's second-largest city — suffered ""massive destruction to civilian infrastructure"" and that the ""maternity wards are being attacked, civilian residential buildings are being bombed,"" the outlet also noted.

Russia denies targeting any civilian sites, Reuters reported.

""Minister Lavrov was giving his version, which is false, about what is happening in Ukraine and so that's why we wanted to show a very strong stance together,"" Canada's Joly said, according to the outlet.

Disney is halting theatrical releases in Russia,"Disney will pause its theatrical releases in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

According to Fox Business, a spokesperson for Disney issued a statement that said, “Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including the upcoming ‘Turning Red’ from Pixar. We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.”

CNN Business said that Disney is reportedly working with its partner in non-governmental-organizations “to provided urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees” who were displaced by the ongoing Russian assault on Ukraine.

Netflix is also pushing back against Russia by refusing to domestically air Russian state TV channels. Russian law requires streaming platforms that have more than 100,000 subscribers in Russia to distribute state-owned Russian entertainment and news channels for free to subscription holders.

A Netflix spokesperson said, “Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service.”

Disney’s decision to halt movie releases in Russia comes as the Western nations attempt to isolate Russia and cripple its economy with thoroughgoing sanctions.

On Saturday, several allied leaders of Western countries stated their commitment to restricting Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT telecommunications network.

The European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to sanctioning Russian oligarchs and banks tied to the Russian government and who may be financially supporting the invasion of Ukraine.

In a joint statement, the Western leaders said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

These sanctions stand to cripple the Russian economy. They will prevent the Russian central bank from implementing monetary policy that enables the Russian economy to withstand the economic impact of sanctions and they make it virtually impossible for Russia to engage in international commerce.

Apple Pay and Google Pay, two of the world’s most used payment processors, have severed their relationships with Russian banks as a result of these sanctions. The Russian people may still use their bank cards and certain payment processors domestically, but many are unable to make digital purchases or payments with entities outside Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-is-halting-theatrical-releases-in-russia,2022-03-01
'OVER MY DEAD BODY': DOJ's request for new 'emergency powers' over coronavirus met with swift condemnation,"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for new ""emergency powers"" amid the coronavirus outbreak, including the power to ask chief judges to indefinitely detain people without trial.



The DOJ has proposed numerous emergency measures, according to Politico, which obtained and reviewed documents the DOJ sent to lawmakers.



From Politico:

In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings ""whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.""



The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to ""any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,"" according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ document wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies, but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies ""in a consistent manner.""

As Politico noted, the proposal — which would essentially permit indefinite detention — would likely violate a person's right to appear before a judge and seek release after being arrested, a constitutional right known as habeas corpus.

Specifically, the Constitution states, ""The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.""

According to Politico, the DOJ is also asking to ""pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies"" as well as ""expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants' consent.""

The reported proposals were met with swift bipartisan condemnation.

""OVER MY DEAD BODY,"" Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) responded. ""If this is a joke, it's not funny. If it's not a joke, we've got much bigger problems. @realDonaldTrump, please refute and disavow this immediately.""

""Two Words: Hell No,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded.

""Congress must loudly reply NO,"" Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) responded.

Meanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called the power grab ""abhorrent.""

""There's a long history in this country and in other countries of using emergencies as times to really start to encroach upon people's civil rights. And in fact, this is a time when we need them the absolute most,"" she said on CNN Sunday. ""It does not matter how urgent times are. We have to make sure that we retain our civil rights.

Don't be a fool!,"" in an Oct. 9 letter obtained by Fox Business Network's Trish Regan.

What are the details?

""Let's work out a good deal!"" President Trump's letter began. ""You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will.""



""I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't let the world down,"" President Trump continued, adding that Kurdish general Mazloum Kobani Abdi had expressed his willingness to work with Turkey and ""to make concessions that they never have made in the past.""

President Trump's closing paragraph read, ""History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!"" He added, ""I will call you later.""



The Hill noted that ""the letter was sent shortly before Turkey began its invasion of territory in northern Syria held by U.S.-allied Kurdish forces last week."" The president imposed sanctions on Turkey in retaliation for their military offensive.

The release of the letter came Wednesday, the same day Congressional leaders from both parties met at the White House to discuss next actions in the region. President Trump reportedly supplied attendees with a copy of the letter he sent to Erdogan during the meeting, which broke down when Democratic leadership walked out, saying President Trump had ""offended"" them by calling Speaker Nancy Pelosi a ""third grade"" politician.



Also Wednesday, the House passed a resolution in a 354-60 vote condemning President Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria. TheBlaze's Nate Madden reported that ""all 60 votes against the resolution were from Republicans while 129 Republicans voted with the majority.""

'Don’t stop shooting until they're down': Homeowner says he 'did the right thing' when he fired at intruder who kicked in his door. Intruder died at scene.,"An Oklahoma homeowner told KOCO-TV he ""did the right thing"" when he fired at an intruder who kicked in his door in the middle of the day last week.

The intruder was pronounced dead at the scene in the 3000 block of Westbrook Street in Chickasha, which is about 40 minutes southwest of Oklahoma City.

What did the homeowner have to say?

A reporter with KOCO spoke with the homeowner Wednesday, the day after the break-in. He didn't want to be on camera or have his name mentioned, the station said.

The homeowner noted to KOCO that the intruder was looking for his ex-girlfriend and trying to get inside the home.

What was going through his mind while the break-in was taking place?

""Distance,"" the homeowner told the station. ""Don’t stop shooting until they're down and even then, watch 'em because people play possum.""

The homeowner added to KOCO that the intruder had dropped off a friend there.

""She had him drop her off here, and then she blocked him the next morning, and he decided to come over here because this is the last place that he knew she was,"" the homeowner recounted to the station.

The homeowner told KOCO that he used a security camera to watch the man on the porch of his home and asked him to leave.

Instead, the man got something out of his truck and returned to the door, the station said.

""I was right up against the door looking out as I saw his back and his frame, and then I started to back up,"" the homeowner told KOCO. ""He kicked the door in. It hit me in the face. I pushed it back up against him, backed up and continued to back up.""

He added to the station that he didn't begin firing ""until I saw his feet come in over my doorway.""

KFOR-TV reported observing at least a dozen shell casings scattered across the home’s floor.



A next-door neighbor recounted to KFOR that he heard ""pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. I mean, just, you know, as quick as someone could squeeze the trigger. I mean, it happened so fast ... I walked outside and could smell gunpowder right away.”

'I did the right thing'

Chickasha police told KOCO the case is still under investigation, and they aren't releasing the name of the fatally shot man until his family is notified. The city's police chief noted to KFOR that the homeowner doesn't know the intruder.

The homeowner told KOCO he’s continuing to work with authorities: ""The truth is truth, and I’ve got nothing to hide ... I've told them everything I know of, and as far as I’m concerned, I did the right thing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dont-stop-shooting-until-theyre-down-homeowner-says-he-did-the-right-thing-when-he-fired-at-intruder-who-kicked-his-door-in-intruder-died-at-scene,2022-11-21
"Driver rams car through KFC restaurant before backing into house, assaulting homeowner's wife, and entering residence — so homeowner shoots him dead","A motorist rammed his vehicle through a KFC restaurant early Tuesday morning then through several different yards before finally backing into a home in the 1100 block of S. 5th Street in Chickasha, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said.

What happened next?

The homeowner whose residence the suspect backed into ventured outside to see what was going on just before 5 a.m. and discovered the motorist banging on a neighbor's windows, the agency said.

With that, the suspect went up on the homeowner’s porch, assaulted the homeowner's wife, and then went inside the residence, OSBI reported.

But the homeowner had already exercised his Second Amendment rights and had a gun at the ready — which he used to shoot the intruder inside the home, the agency said.

The suspect died at the scene, OSBI reported.

The homeowner called Chickasha police after fatally shooting the still-unidentified suspect, the agency said.

OSBI said it's still investigating, and that the homeowners are cooperating the the agency.

How did folks react to the shooting?

Nearly 200 commenters on the OSBI Facebook page sang praises for the gun-toting homeowner and had little sympathy for the suspect. Here's a sampling:

""Got what he deserved sounds like,"" one commenter said.

""I’m so glad Oklahoma has such good laws that we can defend ourselves,"" another commenter wrote.

""Man has a right to protect his castle....Tough living with the results 'cause no one wants to take a life, but sounds like he had no choice and done what he had to do,"" another commenter declared.

Anything else?

Another Oklahoma homeowner — a 69-year-old who lives in Bokoshe near the Arkansas border — said just last week a man assaulted him inside his own home, exited, and then tried to re-enter the residence.

But by that point, the victim retrieved his gun and ended up shooting the alleged attacker dead.

Lt. Paul Moss, a LeFlore County Sheriff’s Department investigator, said the Bokoshe homeowner ""has made the claim of self defense.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/driver-rams-car-through-kfc-restaurant-before-backing-into-house-assaulting-homeowners-wife-and-entering-residence-so-homeowner-shoots-him-dead,2022-01-11
"Col. Edward Shames, World War II veteran and last surviving member of 'Band of Brothers,' has died at age 99","Col. Edward Shames — a World War II veteran who fought in some of the most significant battles and was the last surviving officer of the company that inspired the HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" — has died at age 99.

Shames died peacefully at his home in Virginia Beach on Friday, according to an obituary posted by the Holomon-Brown Funeral Home & Crematory. Shames was preceded in death by his wife — Ida — who died in 2019 after 73 years of marriage. He is survived by his sons Douglas and Steven, four grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.

Shames was a member of the renowned ""Easy Company,"" 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Easy Company was the subject of Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book ""Band of Brothers."" The book became the inspiration for the 2001 HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.

Shames wasn't interested in being drafted for the war, but he wanted to be part of ""something different."" He read a newspaper advertisement for an experimental parachute infantry.



In 1942, he went to Ft. Monroe in Virginia to sign up for the brand new 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Shames was 19 years old at the time, but applicants for the new unit had to be at least age 21 or have written permission from a parent. Shames wanted to be part of the new military unit so badly that he lied to the recruiter and said that his mother was outside sitting in the car. He forged her signature to allow him to enter the parachute unit.

There were 7,000 young men who tried out for the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, but the U.S. military only wanted the top 2,500. Edward Shames made the cut of ""2,500 of the finest men in the country,"" according to the military legend.

""After a grueling training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, Shames helped plan the Normandy invasion by constructing a 3D model of the beaches using a large box filled with soil,"" the Virginia-Pilot reported.

Shames made his first combat jump into Normandy, France, on D-Day as part of Operation Overlord.

""He volunteered for Operation Pegasus and then fought with Easy Company in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge in Bastogne,” according to the obituary.

""Frightening, scary, wondering if you're going to be alive the next morning – that's about the description of the jump itself,"" Shames said in an American Veterans Center video.

Shames was the first member of the 101st to enter the Dachau concentration camp in Germany days after its liberation.



""When Germany surrendered, Ed and his men of Easy Company entered Hitler's Eagle's Nest where Ed managed to acquire a few bottles of cognac, a label indicating they were 'for the Fuhrer's use only.' Later, he would use the cognac to toast his oldest son's Bar Mitzvah,"" the obituary noted.

After WWII, Shames worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on Middle East affairs. He also served in the U.S. Army Reserve Division, and would retire as a colonel.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/edward-shames-band-of-brothers,2021-12-05
"Edward Snowden wants to return to the US, but says the government won't promise him a fair trial","Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden — who notoriously leaked classified government documents exposing domestic surveillance programs — says he would like to end his exile in Russia and come home to America, but claims the U.S. government will not guarantee him a fair trial.

What are the details?

In an exclusive interview with CBS This Morning, Snowden said, ""I would like to return to the United States. That is the ultimate goal. But if I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in prison, the one bottom line demand that we have to agree to is that I at least get a fair trial. And that is the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won't provide access to what's called a public interest defense.""

""I'm not asking for a parade. I'm not asking for a pardon. I'm not asking for a pass,"" Snowden continued. ""What I'm asking for is a fair trial. And this is the bottom line that any American should require. We don't want people thrown in prison without the jury being able to decide that what they did was right or wrong. The government wants a different kind of trial. They want to use special procedures, they want to be able to close the courtroom, they want the public not to be able to go, know what's going on.""

""And essentially, the most important fact to the government and this is the thing we have a point of contention on, is that they do not want the jury to be able to consider the motivations. Why I did what I did. Was it better for the United States? Did it benefit us or did it cause harm? They don't want the jury to consider that at all. They want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful, not whether they were right or wrong. And I'm sorry, but that defeats the purpose of any trial.""

Snowden did concede, ""It's not hard to make the argument that I broke the law.""

"El Paso killer booked on capital murder charges, but makes chilling admission to police, report says","The man accused of killing 20 people at an El Paso Walmart was officially booked into the El Paso jail on capital murder charges early Sunday morning, records show.

According to KTSM-TV, the man is being held without bond.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Emerson Bowie told KTSM that ""enhanced charges"" are likely given the probability the killer was a white nationalist inspired by hatred for Hispanic people.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Saturday that Texas prosecutors will ""aggressively prosecute [the crime] both as capital murder but also as a hate crime.""

A manifesto posted online, which has been attributed to the killer but not yet confirmed by authorities as authentic, said the attack was ""a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.""

Indeed, the killer made a similar chilling admission to police.

According to ABC News, citing law enforcement officials, the killer told authorities his goal was to ""shoot as many Mexicans as possible.""

Such a motive would confirm why the killer — who is from Allen, Texas, which is 650 miles away from El Paso — drove nine hours to the border city, whose 650,000 population is majority Hispanic.

""This Anglo man came here to kill Hispanics,"" El Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles said, according to the Washington Post. ""I'm outraged and you should be too. This entire nation should be outraged. In this day and age, with all the serious issues we face, we are still confronted with people who will kill another for the sole reason of the color of their skin.""

The FBI is investigating the massacre as a domestic terrorism incident, CNN reported. The El Paso district attorney said at a press conference Sunday that prosecutors will pursue the death penalty.

Elderly homeowner in wheelchair fatally shoots former renter who kicked down door and attacked him,"An elderly homeowner who uses a wheelchair told Houston police that a former tenant he'd booted from his residence for failure to pay rent returned Tuesday night, kicked down his front door, and attacked him, KPRC-TV reported.

But the 72-year-old homeowner also has a gun — and fatally shot his former tenant during the attack, the station said.

What are the details?

Investigators told KPRC the homeowner had been renting out one of his rooms to the man in question, who allegedly stopped paying rent for quite some time.

With that, the homeowner told the man leave and not come back, the station reported.

Authorities told KPRC that while the tenant did indeed leave the premises, his departure was apparently short-lived, as he soon came back — and his reasons for returning did not appear related to paying back rent to his former landlord.

Officer R. Willkens with the Houston Police Department told the station that the man ""kicked the door in"" and ""got inside,"" after which ""some kind of altercation"" erupted.

While the former tenant may have figured he'd have an easy time overpowering an elderly man, who needs a wheelchair to get around, it doesn't appear the guy factored in the possibility that his former landlord might have an equalizing tool on hand.

""The older man shot the younger one,"" Willkens added to KPRC. ""The homeowner shot the guy who was kicking in the door, and homicide is ... trying to figure out what exactly occurred.""

One just might conclude it makes common sense for an elderly individual with a disability to own a gun for protection — just in case of incidents like this.

Now what?

Detectives told the station they're questioning the homeowner about the shooting, and added that he's being cooperative. KPRC said no charges have been filed so far.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-homeowner-wheelchair-fatlally-shoots-attacker,2021-06-10
82-year-old woman saved from intruder attack by bat-wielding elderly neighbor with martial arts skills,"An 82-year-old woman was saved from a harrowing attack by a male intruder when her friend and bat-wielding neighbor beat him down with her martial arts skills.

The stunning incident unfolded in Fontana, California, a suburban city east of Los Angeles.

Elizabeth McCray told KTLA-TV that she was attacked by a man who broke into her apartment and jumped on her while beating her down.

Her cries alerted her friend and neighbor Lorenza ""Miss Kitty"" Marruja, who rushed over with martial arts skills.

The 67-year-old Marruja told KTLA that the man had tried to attack her before he moved on to McCray's apartment, and that she had driven him away using a baseball bat.

""I was aiming at his head, and he backed off and said, 'No Miss Kitty, no Miss Kitty, I'm not gonna hurt you,'"" Marruja told KTLA.

""And I said, 'Get the F out of my apartment right now,'"" she said.

McCray said that Marruja rushed into her apartment and gave the man a second beating.

""I had him on the ground. First, I went down like to this to his chest,"" Marruja explained. ""And then this was on his throat, like that. I had my hand right here on his jaw and I was aiming toward his eyes.""

Marruja demonstrated her martial arts moves for the KTLA camera.

She says that he tried to get up but that she held him down until the police arrived.

""If I did have my bat I would've busted his knee caps,"" she said.

Fontana police Officer Jennie Venzor told KTLA that they do not recommend elderly people confront home intruders, but that the police officers were impressed with Marruja when they arrived.

She said the man was arrested on suspicion of elder abuse over the incident.

Elderly man shoots home invader — then fears for his life when intruder just gets more aggressive. But homeowner has more bullets left.,"An elderly man told KGNS-TV he saw a moving shadow outside his window followed by what sounded like someone trying to break into his Houston home early Monday morning.



What happened next?

The 74-year-old, who told the station he didn't want to be identified, grabbed a handgun and shot the intruder who had just broken out a window.

One would assume that would be enough to deter most people from trying anything further — and that it certainly is plenty to convince the target from turning up the heat.

But no such luck in this case.

The homeowner told KGNS that rather than backing down, the intruder became even more aggressive.

So the homeowner shot the man two more times, killing him, the station said.

KGNS noted that the homeowner said a prayer because he didn't know what was going to happen but believes it was a kill-or-be-killed situation and that he only was trying to protect himself.

And now the homeowner — who has lived in the area all his life and said he loves the neighborhood — told the station he believes it's time for him to move.

Anything else?

KGNS reported that the case will be turned over to a grand jury to determine whether charges will be filed. Authorities have not released the name of the alleged intruder, the station added.

In related news, New Orleans police told WDSU-TV a homeowner fatally shot an intruder at a Dauphine Street residence Thursday evening.

The homeowner reportedly heard banging on the door of the residence and approached with a gun, the station said.

After opening the door, police said an unidentified male lunged at the homeowner, who responded by shooting the male, WDSU reported. The male died at the scene, the station reported, adding that no other information was available on the incident.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-man-shoots-home-invader-then-fears-for-his-life-when-intruder-just-gets-more-aggressive-but-homeowner-has-more-bullets-left,2021-06-04
Elderly woman fatally shoots alleged home intruder after he attacks her fiancé,"A 65-year-old Texas woman fatally shot a home invasion suspect after the suspect reportedly attacked her fiancé.

What are the details?

The incident unfolded in Fredericksburg, Texas, in the early hours of Saturday morning when 19-year-old suspect Cleto Neri Solorzano was reportedly attempting to break through an elderly couple's patio door.

Curtis Roys, the 73-year-old homeowner, attempted to investigate the source of the noise when he came face-to-face with Solorzano.

The suspect reportedly confronted Roys and managed to force his way through the door. He then reportedly proceeded to enter Roys' home, struck him with a blunt object, and began choking the 73-year-old Roys.

That's when Roys' fiancée, Melody Lumpkin, jumped into action. The woman, who entered the room and discovered Solorzano attacking her betrothed, ran back to the bedroom and armed herself with a handgun.

With a vengeance, she returned to the room and fired a warning shot.

Sources report that she demanded Solorzano stop the attack on Roys — who had reportedly fallen unconscious at this point — and leave the property or she would make the second shot count.

Solorzano apparently refused, but Lumpkin made good on her threat — and shot the intruder directly in the head.

KXAN-TV reported that authorities arrived on the scene, and emergency workers transported Solorzano to nearby Hill County Memorial Hospital.

He was later transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio, where he was pronounced dead.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-woman-fatally-shoots-alleged-home-intruder-after-he-attacks-her-fianc,2020-04-14
Team of 10 elite forces veterans — including 6 Americans — has stepped up and volunteered to fight for Ukraine,"At least six Americans have volunteered to fight the Russians alongside Ukraine, BuzzFeed News reported Sunday, and are staging in Poland for preparation to cross into Ukraine.

What's a brief history here?

Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on anyone willing to help to join his country's military in battle.

“Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals,” Zelensky said on Saturday. “A separate subdivision is being formed of foreigners entitled the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine. There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.”

What are the details?

A team of 10 special forces veterans — made up of six Americans, three U.K. citizens, and a German — has stepped up and volunteered to join Ukraine's military to battle against Russia. All members of the group are said to have been NATO-trained and are experienced combat veterans with backgrounds in counterterrorism.

“They want to be among the first to officially join the new International Legion of the Territorial Defense of Ukraine that Zelensky announced Sunday,” text messages obtained by the outlet read.

The outlet added that two former American infantry officers ""are also making plans to come to Ukraine to provide 'leadership' for the group.""

Zelenskyy in his Saturday remarks said that any ""friend of Ukraine"" is invited to join the fight.

“Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country, please come over. We will give you weapons. It will be announced very shortly, how this can be done. Everyone who is defending Ukraine is a hero,” he said.

Zelenskyy added, “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence. Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe, and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.”

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba added, “Foreigners willing to defend Ukraine and world order as part of the International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine, I invite you to contact foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine in your respective countries,”

What else is there to know about this?

On Sunday, Newsweek reported that many U.S. veterans have reached out in various ways to offer up their services to their Ukrainian brothers.

""Here are six things needed before veterans and everyday Americans can join the fight in Ukraine,"" the outlet reported.

"Oscar-nominated actress Ellen Page comes out as transgender, promises retribution for politicians who 'criminalize' trans health care","Actress Ellen Page, 33, is now actor Elliot Page, according to a Tuesday announcement from Page.

Page famously came out as gay in 2014 and married partner Emma Portner in 2018.

What are the details?

Page made the announcement on social media Tuesday.

Page wrote, ""Hi friends, I want to share with you that I am trans, my pronouns are he/they and my name is Elliot. I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life. I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.""

Page continued, ""I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community. Thank you for your courage, your generosity, and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place. I will offer whatever support I can and continue to strive for a more loving and equal society.""

Page is looking for patience from peers and supporters.

""My joy is real, but it is also fragile,"" Page admitted. ""The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes,' and of violence.""

You aren't being 'cancelled,' you are hurting people. I am one of those people and we won't be silent in the face of your attacks.""

""I love that I am trans,"" Page concluded. ""And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows, and the more I thrive.

Page's wife, Portner, responded to the news Tuesday on Instagram, writing, ""Trans, queer, and non-binary people are a gift to this world.

"Elon Musk diagnoses Netflix's big problem after platform sheds subscribers, stock tumbles: 'Woke mind virus'","Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has diagnosed the disease that he believes is causing Netflix's foreboding financial woes.

What is wrong with Netflix?

Netflix announced on Tuesday that it experienced its first net loss of subscribers in more than a decade during the first quarter of 2022. The streaming platform disclosed that 200,000 users dropped the service between January and March.

The news caused shares of Netflix stock to tumble more than 25%, CNBC reported. Netflix previously told shareholders the company would experience a net gain of 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2022.

To make matters worse, Netflix is now forecasting the loss of another 2 million subscribers in the second quarter of this year. Netflix's stock further cratered more than 30% as of Wednesday afternoon.

What did Musk say?

Musk pointed to woke ideology as the source of Netflix's subscriber and impending financial woes.

Responding to news of the significant stock tumble, Musk said, ""The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.""

In response to another Twitter user who said the ""woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization,"" Musk affirmed, ""Yes.""

Indeed, Netflix has platformed provocatively progressive content.

For example, Netflix hosts the show ""Dear White People,"" which is described as addressing the ""complexities of prejudice that take different forms — whether it’s white or light-skinned privilege, sexism, or homophobia.""

Netflix is also scheduled to release a new show on Thursday called ""He's Expecting."" As the title suggests, the show is centered on a pregnant male character. Netflix describes the show: ""When a successful ad executive who's got it all figured out becomes pregnant, he's forced to confront social inequities he'd never considered before.""

Netflix is also working with Ibram X. Kendi to adapt his anti-racist work into film projects, and the platform released a show about Colin Kaepernick last year.

What does Netflix blame?

The platform attributed its subscriber decline and bleak forecast to market factors outside the company's control, account sharing, competition (from Amazon, Disney, YouTube, Hulu, and others), and other ""macro factors"" including ""sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-diagnoses-netflixs-big-problem-after-platform-sheds-subscribers-stock-tumbles-woke-mind-virus,2022-04-20
Elon Musk says he will 'eat locally grown food' at one of world's worst nuclear sites in order to demonstrate how important it is for Europe to begin nuclear power output,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says he will travel to a high-radiation location to ""eat locally grown food on TV"" after calling for a massive increase of nuclear energy production in Europe, Insider reported Monday.

What are the details?

Musk on Sunday called for European nations to increase their output of nuclear power in an effort to offset the possibility of a gas shortage.

He wrote, ""Hopefully, it is now extremely obvious that Europe should restart dormant nuclear power stations and increase power output of existing ones. This is *critical* to national and international security.""

Following backlash with many social media users stating a fear of radiation contamination in their food, Musk added, ""For those who (mistakenly) think this is a radiation risk, pick what you think is the worst location. I will travel there & eat locally grown food on TV. I did this in Japan many years ago, shortly after Fukushima. Radiation risk is much, much lower than most people believe.""

What else is there to know about this?

Over the weekend, Musk also called for the U.S. to increase its domestic oil and gas production and output amid sanctions imposed on Russia.

Insider reported that Russian oil exports have plummeted by approximately 33% amid the country's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

On Friday, Musk tweeted, ""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced support for the sentiment and responded, ""Couldn't agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!""

Cruz on Friday also issued a statement regarding his newly introduced Energy Freedom Act, which would help release the U.S. from its extreme reliance on foreign energy sources.

“I’m introducing the Energy Freedom Act to reverse Biden’s actions so we can restore American energy independence,"" he said in a statement on the proposed legislation. ""This bill won’t cost taxpayers a dime, but it will provide the United States billions in revenue in the coming years by expediting permitting, leasing, safe new pipelines, and exports, and providing much needed regulatory certainty. It would create new jobs, lower energy costs, and because modern energy production in the United States is far cleaner than in any other country’s by every measure, it would help the environment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-eat-locally-grown-food-at-nuclear-site-nuclear-power-output,2022-03-07
"Hillary Clinton blames Republicans for attack on Paul Pelosi, Elon Musk steps in and questions the narrative: 'Might be more to this story than meets the eye'","Following the alleged hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, several Democrats accused Republicans of inciting political violence. Some Democrats made the damning accusations despite the investigation in its infancy and there not being concrete proof that the suspect – David DePape – was motivated by politics to attack the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

On Saturday, Hillary Clinton blamed Republicans for political violence.

""The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories,"" Clinton wrote on Twitter. ""It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow.""



Clinton's tweet linked to a Los Angeles Times article with the headline: ""Accused Pelosi attacker David DePape spread QAnon, other far-right, bigoted conspiracies.""

""In a personal blog that DePape maintained, posts include such topics as 'Manipulation of History,' 'Holohoax' and 'It’s OK to be white.' He mentioned 4chan, a favorite message board of the far right. He posted videos about conspiracies involving COVID-19 vaccines and the war in Ukraine being a ploy for Jewish people to buy land,"" the article read.

""DePape’s screeds included posts about QAnon, an unfounded theory that former President Trump is at war with a cabal of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring and control the world,"" the article added. ""In an Aug. 23 entry titled 'Q,' DePape wrote: 'Either Q is Trump himself or Q is the deepstate moles within Trumps inner circle.'""

However, the website that the Los Angeles Times links to was created on Sept. 8, 2022, according to WHOIS – a public database that provides information about who and when a domain name was registered by.

Google first indexed this site in September.

The Wayback Machine – a digital archive of internet websites – only began archiving the site on Oct. 28, 2022.

The website in question, frenlyfrens.com, was deactivated by the hosting company Wix after the attack on Pelosi.

Elon Musk responded to Clinton's tweet, and questioned the narrative.

The new CEO of Twitter replied to Clinton, ""There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.""

Musk linked his tweet to an article from the Santa Monica Observer titled: ""The Awful Truth: Paul Pelosi Was Drunk Again, And In a Dispute With a Male Prostitute Early Friday Morning.""

The Santa Monica Observer claimed – without evidence – that Paul Pelosi was with a male prostitute on the night of his attack. The writer admitted that the accusation is ""my humble opinion.""

The Santa Monica Observer has a factual reporting rating of ""low"" by Media Bias/Fact Check – a self-proclaimed ""independent website that has promoted awareness of media bias and misinformation by rating the bias, factual accuracy, and credibility of media sources, large and small.""

MBFC labeled the Santa Monica Observer as a ""questionable source,"" which the site defines as having ""extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, a complete lack of transparency and/or is fake news.""

However, there are many questions still to be answered about the alleged home invasion involving David DePape – a reported nudist hemp jewelry maker from Berkeley.

As TheBlaze previously reported, DePape allegedly infiltrated the home of the third person in line for the presidency only using a hammer.

Paul Pelosi purportedly was permitted to use the bathroom by hammer-wielding DePape in the middle of the home invasion. Pelosi allegedly had his cell phone charging in the bathroom, which he used to call 911.



Reports claim, ""The operator heard Mr. Pelosi asking: 'What’s going on? Why are you here? What are you doing to me?'""

However, there is audio of an alleged police dispatcher informing officers that a ""somewhat confused"" Pelosi told him that a ""friend"" by the name of ""David"" was in his home.

The dispatcher is heard saying, ""There is a male in the home and that he is going to wait for his wife. However, he stated that he doesn't know who the male is but that his name is 'David 'and that he is a friend.""

The dispatcher noted that the reporting person ""sounded somewhat confused.""

When police arrived at the Pelosi's home in San Francisco, they ""knocked on the front door and were let inside by an unknown person,"" according to Politico.

The report continued, ""They discovered DePape and Pelosi struggling for a hammer, and after they instructed them to drop the weapon.""

Elon Musk promises to send more Starlink systems to Ukraine to maintain internet in 'destroyed cities',"In response to pleas from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has promised to send additional Starlink systems to provide internet coverage in war-torn areas of the country.

In a Saturday tweet, Zelenskyy announced that he had spoken to Musk, who had promised additional Starlink support. Zelenskyy thanked Musk for ""supporting Ukraine with words and deeds"" and indicated that he would like to work with Musk on space projects after the war is over.

Musk, who is believed to be the richest person in the world, has become an important figure in the Ukraine-Russia conflict after he agreed to use Starlink systems to provide internet to areas of Ukraine where internet service had been shut off by the invading Russian army.

Musk also made news by refusing to block Russian state-owned news sources like Russia Today from being broadcast on Starlink, which he says many governments asked him to do. ""We will not do so unless at gunpoint,"" Musk tweeted. ""Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.""

The Russian government has responded to Musk's action by attempting — apparently with some measure of success — to jam Starlink signals in the Ukraine conflict area. In a tweet last week, Musk noted that SpaceX had developed a software workaround to the Russian jamming attempts, and said that SpaceX would reprioritize its resources to promote cybersecurity to ensure that its signals could not be jammed by hostile powers in the future.





Control over the internet and the flow of information into and out of Ukraine has been a key priority for the governments of both Ukraine and Russia during this conflict.

Empty streets & air raids in northern Japan after North Korea fires a ballistic missile overhead,"On October 3, just days after Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan — the first time it has done so in five years.

The missile, believed to be the Hwasong-12, proved capable of reaching Guam. It was airborne for 20 minutes, reached an altitude of 620 miles (over twice as high as the International Space Station) and ultimately traveled 2,800 miles before smashing into the Pacific Ocean.

Upon detecting the launch, Japanese officials halted trains in the northern Hokkaido and Aomori regions and urged citizens to take shelter.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's office indicated that a missile was ""believed to have been launched from North Korea"" and that citizens should ""evacuate to the inside of a building or go to the basement.""

The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo reportedly cautioned Americans in the area that there was a possibility the missile was headed toward Japan.

Later, Japanese officials acknowledged that ""the aforementioned missile is believed to have passed through the Pacific Ocean.""

Condemnation

The U.S., Japanese, and South Korean governments quickly condemned the attacks.

Kishida stated that the ""firing, which followed a recent series of launches by North Korea, is a reckless act and I strongly condemn it.""

The Japanese prime minister was referencing several earlier launches of short-range ballistic missiles by the communist regime into the East Sea, including two fired just hours after the U.S. vice president's departure from South Korea last week.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol indicated that the regime's ""reckless nuclear provocations"" would be met by a stern response.

Adrienne Watson, the spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, stated that ""the United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) dangerous and reckless decision to launch a long-range missile over Japan.""

Watson added that the act was ""destabilizing"" to the region and in contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The Security Council previously called on the communist regime to ""cease its illicit activity"" and voted 15-0 to sanction the rogue nation.

In response to the imposition of parallel U.S. sanctions against North Korea in 2017, Pyongyang responded: ""The U.S. mainland will sink into an unimaginable sea of fire on the day when it dares to touch our country by stupidly causing mischief and brandishing its nuclear and sanctions clubs.""

The regime also threatened to hit U.S. military bases in Guam with the same type of missile believed to have been fired this week.

Responding to these threats to the U.S. homeland in a speech to the U.N., on September 19, 2017, former President Donald Trump stated: ""The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.""

North Korea withdrew from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, after the U.S. alleged the regime was pursuing an illegal uranium enrichment program. It refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the U.S.

This latest missile launch is reportedly another step toward the regime's test of a nuclear weapon, expected to occur after China's communist party congress starting on October 16.

Adrienne Watson emphasized that the U.S. ""will continue its efforts to limit [North Korea's] ability to advance its prohibited ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction programs, including with allies and U.N. partners.""

Military response

The U.S. and South Korea quickly responded to the communist regime's first missile launch with what the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff characterized as a ""combined attack squadron flight and precision bombing drill.""

Four U.S. F-16 fighter jets and four South Korean F-15s fired on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea. The drill evidenced the allies' ability to accurately obliterate communist targets with ""overwhelming force"" and ""to respond resolutely to any provocation from North Korea.""



Last week, the two countries also conducted joint military exercises, in which the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan participated. The North Korean regime allegedly regarded these exercises as invasion rehearsals.

On October 1, the 7th Fleet conducted exercises with Canada and Japan, reiterating its ""commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

In response to the latest missile launch, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command stated: ""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" noting further that while ""the event does not pose a threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we will continue to monitor the situation.""

USINDOPACOM added that the ""U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan and the [Republic of Korea] remain ironclad.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/empty-streets-air-raids-in-northern-japan-after-north-korea-fires-a-ballistic-missile-overhead,2022-10-04
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held in-person discussions with Zelenskyy where he committed to providing Ukraine with military supplies,"The United Kingdom is going to send more than one hundred armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine as the Russian invasion drags on.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the arrangement on Saturday during an in-person visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On Saturday, both Johnson and his Austrian counterpart, Chancellor Karl Nehammer, made in-person visits to Zelenskyy. The two leaders are the latest in a list of political figures who have made in-person visits to Ukraine in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian Embassy to the United Kingdom posted a picture of Johnson and Zelenskyy seated opposite one another at a table with the caption, “Surprise,” followed by a winking face emoji.

CNN reported that The Press Service of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said on its official Twitter account that Zelenskyy and Johnson engaged in diplomatic discussions in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.



On his Twitter account, Johnson said, “The Ukrainians have the courage of a lion. President [Zelenskyy] has given the roar of that lion. The UK stands unwaveringly with the people of Ukraine.”

At the time of writing, this tweet is pinned to top of Johnson’s Twitter page.



In an official statement as Prime Minister, Johnson said, “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”

Johnson also praised his Ukrainian counterpart’s ""resolute leadership"" and the “invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people.” He said that the UK “stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight” and that “[the British] are in it for the long run.”

Acknowledging Johnson’s steadfast support of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, “Boris was among those who didn’t doubt for a minute whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of Great Britain in providing our country help in defense, and also leadership in sanctions policy, will always be in history.”

He added, “Ukraine will always be grateful for this to Boris and Britain.”

During a press conference, Johnson said that the United Kingdom will continue to leverage sanctions against Russia and that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has dealt a “crushing blow” to his reputation and to the global standing of the Russian government.

During a subsequent press conference, Johnson said, “We will influence Russia’s ability to use its energy sources. The war determines the vision of Ukraine’s future, so our partners and I will supply Ukraine with equipment, technology, intelligence so that Ukraine never faces the horrors of invasion and blackmail.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/england-s-prime-minister-boris-johnson-held-in-person-discussions-with-zelenskyy-agreed-to-provide-ukraine-with-military-supplies,2022-04-10
Entomological Society renaming a moth species and an ant species to avoid word deemed a racial slur,"The Entomological Society of America is removing the names for a moth and an ant from its Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms List because they include a word deemed a racial slur.

Those are the ""gypsy moth"" and the ""gypsy ant.""

The decision is a part of an effort by the ESA to identify and change traditional names that include negative ethnic or racial stereotypes.

""The purpose of common names is to make communication easier between scientists and the public audiences they serve,"" explained ESA president Michelle S. Smith in a statement on Wednesday.

""By and large, ESA's list of recognized insect common names succeeds in this regard, but names that are unwelcoming to marginalized communities run directly counter to that goal,"" she added. ""That's why we're working to ensure all ESA-approved insect common names meet our standards for diversity, equity, and inclusion.""

The ESA Governing Board voted in June to remove the common names of the moth Lymantria dispar and the ant Aphaenogaster araneoides because the word ""gypsy"" is considered a racial slur against Romani people.

""It's an ethnic slur to begin with that's been rejected by the Romani people a long time ago,'' Smith continued. ""Second, nobody wants to be associated with a harmful invasive pest.""

The society is searching for new names to replace the insulting ones, but they say the process could take months. In the meantime, they recommend people use the latin names for those species.

Other offensive names that could be on the chopping block include the slave-maker ant, the rape bug, and the Large Faggotworm.

""There is no room for racism in science,"" said herpetologist Earyn McGee who signed a 2020 statement against offensive animal names. The statement identified about 60 different names that were problematic and should be changed.

""There is no amount of scientific contributions that can make unabashed racism and bigotry OK,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/entomological-society-gypsy-moth-ant,2021-07-09
Environmentalist pens article apologizing for 'climate scare' foisted on public. It gets taken down.,"Editor's note: TheBlaze does not take responsibility for Shellenberger's claims or vouch for their scientific accuracy. Shellenberger's article may contain scientific or factual inaccuracies. The focus of this article is solely upon the decision of Forbes to publish and then unpublish it. Shellenberger's claims are presented so that readers may understand some of the claims made in his article. For the perspective of some scientific experts who disagree with some of Shellenberger's claims, click here.



Michael Shellenberger is no slouch when it comes to environmental issues.

Besides his TED talks garnering more than 5 million views, he's a Green Book Award Winner, a frequent contributor to publications such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Scientific American — and he also authored ""Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All,"" which was released Tuesday by HarperCollins.

But Shellenberger said a Forbes article — ""On Behalf of Environmentalists, I Apologize for the Climate Scare"" — based on his new book was soon ""censored"" soon after it went up Sunday. The Daily Wire reported that his piece was taken down from the Forbes website ""a few hours"" after it was published. The Forbes site on Tuesday showed where Shellenberger's article should be — but only says it's ""no longer active.""

Image source: Forbes website

TheBlaze on Tuesday didn't immediately hear back from Forbes in regard to the reasons Shellenberger's article was removed or the reported time frame in which it was shuttered.

But Shellenberger has a few ideas on why his article is no longer there: ""No book on the environment has ever been praised by a more prestigious group of scientists & scholars than 'Apocalypse Never,'"" he wrote on Twitter. ""And no book has ever been more devastating to green alarmism. No wonder they're so terrified you'll read it.""

In a statement to the Daily Wire — which published his piece in its entirety — Shellenberger said, ""I am grateful that Forbes has been so committed to publishing a range of viewpoints, including ones that challenge the conventional wisdom, and was thus disappointed my editors removed my piece from the web site. I believe Forbes is an important outlet for broadening environmental journalism beyond the overwhelmingly alarmist approach taken by most reporters, and look forward to contributing heterodoxical pieces on energy and the environment in the future.""

What does his article say?

Editor's note: Many scientific experts disagree with some of the claims in Shellenberger's article. For their perspective, click here.



Here's how Shellenberger opens his article: ""On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It's just not the end of the world. It's not even our most serious environmental problem.""

He also says he feels ""an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.""

Shellenberger then details a list of ""facts few people know"":

Humans are not causing a ""sixth mass extinction""

The Amazon is not ""the lungs of the world""

Climate change is not making natural disasters worse

Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003

The amount of land we use for meat — humankind's biggest use of land — has declinedby an area nearly as large as Alaska

The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California

Carbon emissions have been declining in rich nations including Britain, Germany and France since the mid-seventies

Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor

We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter

Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change

Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels

Preventing future pandemics requires more not less ""industrial"" agriculture

""I know that the above facts will sound like 'climate denialism' to many people,"" he adds. ""But that just shows the power of climate alarmism.""

More from Shellenberger's article:

Some people will, when they read this imagine that I'm some right-wing anti-environmentalist. I'm not. At 17, I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution. At 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women's cooperatives. In my early 20s I lived in the semi-Amazon doing research with small farmers fighting land invasions. At 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia.



I became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network. At 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California.



In my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to invest $90 billion into them. Over the last few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions.



Until last year, I mostly avoided speaking out against the climate scare. Partly that's because I was embarrassed. After all, I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist. For years, I referred to climate change as an ""existential"" threat to human civilization, and called it a ""crisis.""



But mostly I was scared. I remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends and funding. The few times I summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences. And so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public.

He also added some highlights from his new book:

Factories and modern farming are the keys to human liberation and environmental progress

The most important thing for saving the environment is producing more food, particularly meat, on less land

The most important thing for reducing air pollution and carbon emissions is moving from wood to coal to petroleum to natural gas to uranium

100% renewables would require increasing the land used for energy from today's 0.5% to 50%

We should want cities, farms, and power plants to have higher, not lower, power densities

Vegetarianism reduces one's emissions by less than 4%

Greenpeace didn't save the whales, switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did

""Free-range"" beef would require 20 times more land and produce 300% more emissions

Greenpeace dogmatism worsened forest fragmentation of the Amazon

The colonialist approach to gorilla conservation in the Congo produced a backlash that may have resulted in the killing of 250 elephants

Shellenberger writes toward the end of his piece, ""Once you realize just how badly misinformed we have been, often by people with plainly unsavory or unhealthy motivations, it is hard not to feel duped.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/environmentalist-apologizes-for-climate-scare,2020-06-30
Biden's EPA set to run small Texas oil refinery out of business with big gov't regulations — even as energy prices skyrocket over Russia conflict,"The Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden is set to abruptly issue a sweeping denial of economic hardship exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program from small oil refineries around the U.S., likely forcing one Texas refinery to go out of business at a time when American energy independence is desperately needed.

In a forthcoming letter to the agency, obtained by TheBlaze, Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy urged the EPA to reconsider its proposed decision to deny more than 60 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions on behalf of The San Antonio Refinery LLC (TSAR), a small independent refinery in South Texas.

TSAR, which sources its oil from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, employs roughly 100 workers at its facility and primarily supplies gasoline and diesel to the San Antonio and Austin areas, operating at a production capacity of 21,000 barrels per day.

Since 2013, under the Clean Air Act, TSAR has been able to avoid burdensome costs associated with RFS ethanol blending mandates under a statutory guideline that allows refineries with a capacity of fewer than 75,000 barrels per day to request exemption — so long as they can demonstrate compliance would cause ""disproportionate economic hardship.""

But that all changed in December 2021 when the EPA proposed denying all pending SRE petitions, which for TSAR, included petitions from the 2019, 2020, and 2021 compliance years.

In his letter, Roy warned that imposing such a staggering regulatory burden would be catastrophic for small refineries like TSAR.

""Executing this proposal could lead to the closure of TSAR, an independent small refinery located in San Antonio, Texas, and would kill good-paying jobs, further increase the cost of refined products, and make the U.S. more dependent on hostile foreign nations like Russia for energy,"" Roy writes in a letter to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan.

""TSAR estimates that the combined cost of denying SREs for these years could be up to six times greater than what it spends on payroll annually. This would likely put the refinery out of business,"" Roy continued, adding, ""If that is not 'disproportionate economic hardship,' I don’t know what is.""

The congressman argued that under the RFS's statutory rules, the EPA is obligated to consider each exemption request on its own merits, a provision the agency appears to have ignored with its sweeping proposal.

TheBlaze reached out to the EPA requesting a comment on the matter, but the agency has not yet issued a response.

The regulatory burden on small oil refineries also comes as America's need for energy independence is crystallized amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has inexplicably become more reliant on foreign energy in recent years — specifically doubling its imports of Russian oil in 2021. Now, the Biden administration appears hamstrung by its reliance, unable or unwilling to curtail purchases of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow as it carries out an unprovoked attack on its neighboring country.

Yet in the midst of all this, the EPA is set to make it even harder to obtain domestic energy at a time when it is most needed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/epa-regulations-may-run-texas-oil-refinery-out-of-business,2022-03-03
Eric Swalwell calls for Russian students to be kicked out of American universities,"On Thursday, Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) suggested that the United States deport Russian college students and shutter the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Post Millennial reported.

While on “CNN Newsroom,” Rep. Swalwell said, “Frankly, I think closing their embassy in the United States, kicking every Russian student out of the United States, those should be on the table.”

He continued, “Vladimir Putin needs to know every day that he is in Ukraine, there are more severe options that could come.”

“This is the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, and these are the harshest sanctions that any country has experienced since World War II,” the congressman added, “There will be more to come.”

On Saturday, Western allies agreed to ramp up the sanctions placed on Russia by blocking Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT network.

In a joint statement, leadership from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to amplifying financial sanctions by prohibiting Russian banks from using the telecommunications network to conduct international and domestic transactions.

By preventing Russia from utilizing the SWIFT network, Western leaders will effectively isolate them and make it incredibly difficult for the Russian economy from making either short- or long-term gains. These sanctions, notably, interfere with Russia’s ability to export natural gas and oil. Fuel exports compose more than half of Russia’s GDP.

Vodka — one of Russia’s most iconic exports — is also being affected by Western sanctions. The Canadian government is stopping the sale and importation of Russian-made products. And in the United States, several state governments have called for the removal of Russian vodka from liquor stores.

After invading Ukraine and even before Western nations issued sanctions, Russia’s economy began to crater. Currently, a Russian ruble is worth about 0.012 U.S. dollars. The Russian currency is less valuable than some in-game currencies for video games.

Rep. Swalwell currently serves on the House Intelligence Committee.

Previously, per federal investigators, Swalwell had a close personal relationship with a woman named Christine Fang. As it turns out, Ms. Fang was a spy for the Chinese government. Rep. Swalwell and Ms. Fang were involved while Swalwell served on the House Intelligence Committee.

Upon learning of Ms. Fang and Swalwell’s relationship, high-ranking members of the House Republican Caucus called for his removal from the House Intelligence Committee.

In mid-January, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that if the Republican Party wins a majority in the House of Representatives after the 2022 midterms, Rep. Swalwell will be stripped of his role on the House Intelligence Committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-swalwell-calls-for-russian-students-to-be-kicked-out-of-american-universities,2022-02-27
EU energy prices soar as Russia vows not to resume gas supplies until sanctions lifted,"Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe until the West lifts its sanctions, reports the Guardian.

Dmitry Peskov, Moscow’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” for Russia’s failure to deliver gas to Europe.

European gas prices increased by as much as 30% following Russia’s announcement. The European Union (EU) is now weighing new gas benchmarks and price caps to address the soaring prices.

Russian energy supplier Gazprom announced that a suspension of gas supplies to Europe would be extended indefinitely, citing “malfunctions” on a turbine along the major Nord Stream 1 pipeline, reports the Guardian. Gazprom has blamed sanctions for delaying its ability to repair the turbine.

Germany’s energy regulator said that “the defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the cessation of operations.” Germany, which had been planning to bolster its natural gas reserves in an effort to maintain sufficient power and ease energy inflation, is now unlikely to meet its targets.

Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest gas pipeline between Russia and Europe and has historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe; its supply is considered crucial to improving the European energy crisis.

""Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn't come from Russia,"" said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. Norway, a major European gas producer, has been increasing its output to European markets in response.

France has been hit particularly hard by the energy crisis. The government has spent over $26 billion since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to reduce French citizens’ gas and electric bills. Companies in France will soon be required to cut their energy use “by 10 percent or face enforced rationing of electricity and gas,” reports the New York Times. Businesses will also have to appoint an “ambassador of energy sobriety” and send the government their plans for cutting electricity use.

Warning signs that Europe could have an energy crisis this winter,"Energy prices are soaring in Europe because of inflation and the repercussions of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. There are numerous warning signs that Europe could face a crippling energy crisis this winter.

Inflation has spiked

Inflation is surging in Europe. In July, the annual inflation rate was up 9.8% among the 28 European Union member nations – up from 2.5% a year earlier.

Russia holds power over Europe's natural gas supply

Gazprom – the Russian government-owned energy behemoth – has shut down a critical natural gas pipeline to Europe. Last week, Gazprom switched off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to perform urgent maintenance work.

There are concerns that Russia may hold Europe hostage with the pipeline over the winter.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies.

Europe is already burdened with record-high energy prices

In August, Spain experienced its most expensive month for electricity since records have been kept.

France 24 reported, ""The year-ahead contract for German electricity reached 995 euros ($995) per megawatt hours while the French equivalent surged past 1,100 euros – a more than tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In Britain, energy regulator Ofgem said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from October 1 to an average £3,549 ($4,197) per year.""

Daniele Franco – Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance – warned that the country's net energy import costs will more than double this year to nearly 100 billion euros ($99.5 billion). Franco said the nation was helpless in the matter, ""To keep offsetting, at least in part, rising energy prices through public finances is very costly and we could never do enough.""

Germany faces a coal shortage

The lack of oil and gas has forced European nations to increase their dependency on coal.

In Germany, the water levels in the Rhine River have hit crisis levels amid summer heatwaves. The Rhine River – one of Europe's key waterways – has already been closed due to low water levels.

""Due to very reduced domestic shipping, accumulated coal stocks could quickly fall,"" Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said in a document obtained by Reuters.

Other major waterways have also prevented large vessels from bringing coal to European countries. That coal is now stuck in ports. Approximately 8 million tons of coal were stranded in ports at the end of July, Politico reported. If the supply chain woes continue, it will have dire effects on Germany, Poland, and Switzerland in the winter.

Scandinavian governments are bailing out energy companies

Finland and Sweden announced that they plan to offer billions of dollars to energy companies to prevent them from ending up in ""technical bankruptcy.""

""The rapid rise in electricity prices has resulted in paper losses on electricity futures contracts of energy firms, forcing them to find funds to post additional collateral with the exchanges,"" according to Reuters.

Finland will offer $9.95 billion, and Sweden will give $23.2 billion to energy companies.

Businesses face bankruptcy over energy costs

MakeUK – the lobbyist group for British factories – said nearly half of all manufacturers in the country have seen electricity bills skyrocket more than 100% in the past year.



Bloomberg reported, ""Soaring energy bills are threatening to put six in 10 British manufacturers out of business, according to a survey that lays bare the extent of the crisis facing the next prime minister.""

Sky-high energy prices are severely curtailing production

""Nordic Greens, one of the largest tomato growers in both Denmark and Sweden, has announced that they will not grow any tomatoes during winter in their Sweden-based cultivation because of the skyrocketing electricity prices, ""according to HortiDaily – a global greenhouse news website.

An estimated 500 tonnes of tomatoes will be lost because of the shutdown.

Multiple European aluminum smelters have drastically cut production or temporarily shut down because of spiking energy prices.

""Industry insiders say the escalating energy crisis is now threatening to create an extinction event across large swathes of the region’s aluminum production,"" Bloomberg reported.

Restrictions on electricity, heat, and water

Since July, some of Germany's biggest cities implemented restrictions on warm water, heat, and lighting.

U.S. Army bracing for energy shortages at a military base in Germany

Last month, the U.S. Army notified troops that there would likely be energy restrictions at the U.S. Army Garrison in Ansbach, Germany.



""USAG Ansbach installations rely solely on local German utility partners for power, heating, and water needs,"" the Army memo stated. ""In spite of all the solar panels and windmills in Germany, a large percentage of the energy used for heating within the EU is imported…much of it from Russia.""



DPW Energy manager Brad Jennings said, ""There is the potential that we will have to endure large cuts in available power and heating.""

The U.S. Army advised servicemembers to put on extra clothing, minimize long, hot showers by lowering the temperature, and use cold water instead of hot.

Civil unrest is on the rise across the globe

Verisk Maplecroft – a risk consultancy firm – released its latest Civil Unrest Index last week. The most recent report found that out of 198 countries, 101 experienced an increase in risk of civil unrest, versus only 42 which decreased.

""The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released,"" the report stated.

The analysts noted that ""rising food and energy prices will make it more difficult for governments to manage popular discontent.""

""A cold autumn and winter in Europe would worsen an already serious energy and cost of living crisis,"" the report said.

On Friday, Italians burned their energy bills in front of the town hall in Naples.

On Saturday, an estimated 70,000 protesters staged a demonstration in Prague ""against soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine,"" according to the Guardian.

"European Commission and the International Energy Agency suggest that people cut energy usage by driving slower, adjusting their thermostats, working from home","The European Commission and the International Energy Agency have suggested that Europeans cut down on energy consumption by adopting practices such as adjusting the thermostat, driving slower on highways, using public transit, working from home, and walking or biking on short trips rather than driving a vehicle.

""Using less energy is a concrete way for Europeans to reduce their bills, cut reliance on Russian fossil fuels, demonstrate solidarity with the Ukrainian people, and support climate action,"" the report declares. Ukraine has been striving to defend itself amid a brutal invasion as Russia has been wreaking death and destruction, killing many, including civilians.

The energy saving proposal suggests setting the air conditioning on a warmer temperature and lowering the temperature target when heating. It also suggests that drivers reduce their speed in order to increase fuel efficiency.

""The average heating temperature within homes across the European Union is over 22 °C, but many could comfortably accommodate 19 °C or 20 °C. Turning down the thermostat in your home by just 1 °C would save around 7% of the energy you use for heating,"" the report states. ""Setting your air conditioner 1 °C warmer could reduce the amount of electricity used by almost 10% and save you EUR 20 a year.""

""Driving too fast is inefficient for the car engine and wastes fuel. The average car in the European Union clocks up around 13 000 kilometres a year. By reducing your average cruising speed on motorways by 10 kilometres an hour, you could cut your household fuel bill by around EUR 60 a year,"" the proposal states.



Many figures and institutions around the globe promote climate alarmism.

""When it comes to climate change, time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations,"" former U.S. President Barack Obama tweeted on Friday.



BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey of ""Relatable,"" responded by tweeting, ""If you believed this, you wouldn’t have a mansion on the beach."" Obama has a mansion on Martha's Vineyard, a Massachusetts island.

European officials allege Russia's energy pipelines into Europe were sabotaged,"Two Russian natural gas pipelines into Europe, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, have both experienced leaks near Sweden and Denmark. The leaks, which Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen indicated were ""hard to imagine"" as coincidences, occurred within hours of one another.

The first leak is suspected to have occurred overnight and was detected early Monday in the NS2 between Russia and Denmark.

Reuters reported this to have occurred within a day of the Tuesday launch of the Baltic Pipe, which will carry gas from Norway to Poland — part of a European effort to wean off of Russian supply. At its inauguration, Frederiksen suggested that the Baltic Pipe would help ""remove energy as a Russian instrument of power.""

Two additional leaks were reported later on the NS1, northeast of the Danish island Bornholm, after the pipeline operator indicated a pressure drop. According to the Swedish Maritime Administration, one of the leaks was in the Swedish economic zone and the other in the Danish economic zone, close to one another.

Network operator Nord Stream AG stated that the ""destruction that occurred on the same day simultaneously on three strings of the offshore gas pipelines of the Nord Stream system is unprecedented,"" noting that it is not yet clear how long it will take to restore the infrastructure.

The pipelines were not in operation at the time of the leaks, although they nevertheless contained gas under pressure.

The Kremlin-controlled energy company Gazprom suspended gas flow to Europe via the NS1 in late August, citing technical difficulties allegedly caused by Western sanctions. In 2021, Europe imported an estimated 155 billion cubic meters of fuel from Russia, 35% of which came by way of the NS1.

The NS2, on the other hand, has yet to begin commercial operations. They were delayed indefinitely ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



Upon learning of the leaks, Denmark restricted shipping in a five-nautical-mile radius around the area. A no-fly zone is also reportedly in effect.

An investigation into the cause is under way.

Below is footage of the gas leaks in the Baltic Sea shared by the Twitter account for Denmark's Armed Forces.

Although the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities suggested, ""It is too early to say anything about the causes of the incidents,"" suspicions of sabotage are mounting.



Sabotage?

Kristoffer Bottzauw, who heads the Danish energy agency, emphasized that ""breaches of gas pipelines happen extremely rarely.""



One European security source told Reuters, ""There are some indications that it is deliberate damage,"" begging the question, ""Who would profit?""

Russia, which has used the power it exports to maintain some political leverage over Europe, indicated the leak was cause for concern. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, suggested, ""No option can be ruled out right now.""

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki explicitly called the leaks the result of ""sabotage, related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.""

According to Der Tagesspiegel, one German government source indicated he or she ""can't imagine a scenario that isn't a targeted attack. Everything speaks against a coincidence.""

Politico's Jakob Hanke Vela said other German officials suspect the leaks were intentional.

These pipelines and the energy they have up until recently supplied Europe with have been the subject of much debate during Russia's war on Ukraine.

Various activists have protested the pipelines' construction and maintenance over the years. For instance, in May 2019, activists occupied a Nord Stream building site in northern Germany, protesting the line's construction.



Political leaders, including former President Donald Trump, have similarly criticized the pipelines, in many cases calling for them to be sanctioned, citing the geopolitical leverage they provide to Russia.

Ukraine has vehemently opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, both before and after the Biden administration ended its opposition to its Russian completion.

This year, Biden pivoted, indicating in vague terms that he might ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2.

A cold winter

Europe finds itself in an energy crisis. People are stocking up on firewood in Eastern Europe. European governments are now considering introducing energy rationing this winter, with the EU having already asked member nations to reduce gas consumption by 15%.

Russian president Vladimir Putin suggested earlier this month that he may leave Europe to ""freeze,"" saying, ""We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests. ... We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything.""

In light of the Nord Stream leaks, even if Russia were to reverse its tack and diplomacy were to prevail, it is unclear whether it will be a matter of days, weeks, or months to restore the pipelines and westward energy flow.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-officials-allege-russias-energy-pipelines-into-europe-were-sabotaged,2022-09-27
'You are a disgrace': European MPs trash Justin Trudeau to his face during Brussels visit over 'trampling' of Freedom Convoy protests,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was forced to sit and watch as members of the European Parliament out-and-out denounced the leader to his face on Wednesday over his dictatorial handling of the Freedom Convoy protests.

The progressive prime minister — who last month invoked the Emergencies Act to quell vaccine mandate protests in Canada's capital city — was in Brussels, Belgium, this week to urge European leaders to step up their opposition to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

But some MEPs were not so keen on taking instruction from someone they view as a dictator, the Toronto Sun reported.

What are the details?

German MEP Christine Anderson offered Trudeau what she called an appropriate ""welcome"" to the European Parliament by calling the leader a ""disgrace"" and condemning him for human rights violations.

""It would have been appropriate for Mr. Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, to address this house, according to article 144, an article, which was specifically designed to debate the violations of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law,"" Anderson began.

""A prime minister who openly admires the Chinese basic dictatorship, who tramples on fundamental rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists just because they dared to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy should not be allowed to speak in this house at all,"" the lawmaker continued.

She then ended her short speech with a bang, declaring, ""You are a disgrace for any democracy. Please spare us your presence,"" as the prime minister looked on.

What else?

Another MEP, Mislav Kolakusic of Croatia, joined in on the harsh denunciation of the Canadian prime minister.

During his floor speech, Kolakusic made specific reference to Freedom Convoy protesters' controversial encounter with police horses near Parliament Hill when he called out Trudeau's ""tramp[ling] of fundamental values.""

The MEP said Canada was once a symbol of the modern world but has recently become a ""symbol of civil rights violation"" under Trudeau’s ""quasi-liberal boot.""

“We watched how you trample women with horses, how you block bank accounts of single parents so they can’t even pay their children’s education and medicine, that they can’t pay utilities, mortgages for their homes,"" he charged, adding, ""To you, these may be liberal methods, for many citizens of the world, it is a dictatorship of the worst kind.""

Following the invocation of the Emergencies Act, the Canadian government took unprecedented actions to halt protests, including freezing private and corporate bank accounts and threatening arrest for parents who brought children to demonstrations.

Kolakusic concluded with a shot at Trudeau's message to the body by saying united citizens of the world ""can stop a regime that wants to destroy the freedom of citizens, either by bombs or harmful pharmaceutical products.""

Anything else?

Still another MEP, Cristian Terhes of Romania, protested Trudeau's speech by refusing to attend the plenary session.

The MEP said in a Facebook post that Trudeau can’t come and ""teach democracy lessons to Putin from the European Parliament when you trample with horse hooves your own citizens who are demanding their fundamental rights be respected.""

""The difference between democracy and tyranny is not determined by the geographical location of political leaders, but by the values they promote,"" Teres added.

German MEP Bernhard Zimniok, too, blasted Trudeau, saying the prime minister should not have been invited to speak. By welcoming the prime minister, he argued the body had sent ""an invitation to someone who has been trampling on democratic rights.""

""Clearly the values of democracy are being despised by this individual,"" Zimniok added. ""Let us not give someone like this any speaking time in this house of democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-parliament-members-denounce-justin-trudeau,2022-03-24
European Union fails to implement Russian oil embargo despite overall unified opposition to Russia,"The European Union was unable to reach a consensus on banning the import of Russian oil into member nations.

The New York Times reported the member nations of the European Union were unable to reach a unanimous decision in Brussels to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin by cutting off imports of Russian oil.

Reportedly, the diplomatic envoy from Hungary put up the most resistance to the proposed ban on Russian oil imports.

In order for the European Union to implement sanctions, as an institution, all 27 of its member states must agree to enforce them in their respective nations. Historically, countries like Hungary and Germany have been hesitant to issue restrictions on oil imports from Russia due to their nations’ dependence on it. Currently, the European Union is the single largest consumer of crude oil and fuel from Russia. In 2019, almost two-thirds of the European Union’s crude oil imports came from Russia.

Despite the roadblock in banning the import of Russian oil, the European Union member states appear to be solidly unified against Russia as the war in Ukraine drags on.

The European Union has already approved five sanctions packages against Russia. This latest package and its subsequent failure to pass underscore what U.S. intelligence officials have warned that the leadership of Russia is counting on: weakening Western resolve as the conflict drags on. That said, this recent round of sanctions would have caused considerable economic distress for the people of the countries implementing the sanctions.

The U.S. director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines, said, “Putin most likely also judges that Russia has a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries, and he is probably counting on U.S. and E.U. resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation, and energy prices get worse.”

Haines delivered these remarks as Russia appeared to be nearing the fulfillment of one its stated goals of the invasion: taking control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. However, Haines suggested that taking control of Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine is likely neither to satisfy Putin nor bring the war to a close. Haines suggested that Putin likely wants to claim territory that stretches across Ukraine’s Black Sea coast but that this goal will take much longer to achieve.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to send Ukraine $40 billion in aid.

PBS reported that the massive spending package was passed 368-57 and splits the money evenly between defense spending for Ukraine and humanitarian programs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-union-oil-embargo,2022-05-11
The European Union plans to phase out Russian oil entirely by the end of 2022,"The European Union (EU) is moving forward to propose a ban on Russian oil by the end of 2022.

Until this ban is put into effect, the EU will continue to implement restrictions on imports of Russian oil.

The EU also plans to push for more thoroughgoing sanctions on Russia and its allies by advocating for more Russian and Belarusian banks to be cut off from the SWIFT telecommunications network. Bloomberg reported that this list of banks includes Sberbank PJSC, Russia’s largest financial institution, which has been providing a vital economic lifeline in recent months. Sberbank was previously sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K.

A decision on the new sanctions may come as soon as next week at a meeting of EU ambassadors. If the sanctions are to go into effect, this would be the sixth package of sanctions placed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine this past February.

In order for the EU to implement sanctions, all of its 27 member states must agree to enforce them in their nations. Reportedly, countries like Hungary and Germany are historically hesitant to issue restrictions on imports of Russian oil due to their nations’ dependence on it. Currently, the EU is the single largest consumer of crude oil and fuel from Russia. In 2019, almost two-thirds of crude oil imported by EU nations came from Russia.

Reportedly, an embargo on Russian oil would dramatically increase tensions between the EU and Russia as the EU tries to pressure Putin into ending his invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions are aimed at hitting Russia’s revenue from oil exports as much as possible without causing turmoil in the global marketplace. One concern is that increasing the costs of Russian oil by sanctioning it could lead to a boost in Russia’s income instead of punishing it.

An ongoing issue that the EU and Russia are experiencing is how to pay for gas that is being imported into EU member nations. With the majority of Russia’s banks being removed from the SWIFT telecommunications network, conducting business with Russian companies is harder than it once was. Making the process increasingly difficult is that Russian entities are demanding EU member states pay for their oil imports in Russian rubles, but doing so would breach sanctions currently in place.

If EU member states don’t comply and start paying for their oil imports in rubles, Russia will cease doing business with them. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off by Russia for failing to meet the country’s standards.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-union-russian-oil,2022-05-01
"Evan Rachel Wood says ex Marilyn Manson forced her to cook dinner after her abortion, repeatedly struck her with Nazi whip, and used electrodes on her genitals","Actress Evan Rachel Wood says her ex-fiancé demanded she cook him dinner in the hours following her 2011 abortion, the New York Post reported on Monday.

She also detailed other disturbing abuse allegations against the musician, with whom she was in a relationship from 2007 to 2011.

What are the details?



Wood — now an advocate for sexual assault and trafficking survivors — in her recent documentary, ""Phoenix Rising,"" said that she realized she was pregnant in 2011 while filming for ""Mildred Pierce.""

“From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using — and I went through, like, every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them, so essentially he didn’t want me using birth control,” Wood said, noting that the musician — whose real name is Brian Warner — refused to wear condoms.

Wood said that she ultimately decided to terminate the pregnancy, and in the hours following the invasive procedure was told to cook dinner.

“He flew out for the abortion,” Wood recalled of the moments she decided to end her child's life. “The second it was over it was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember being like, ‘I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma ... there’s aftermath here.’ And he didn’t care.”

Wood said that the emotionally scarring incident — and more in the same vein — drove her to try to commit suicide.

“I went into the bathroom and I took [a] glass and I shattered it on the floor and just started digging at my wrists as hard as I could,” Wood said of the unsuccessful suicide bid. “When I woke up, I felt different. I feel like whoever I was went to sleep and didn’t wake up that night, and this new version woke up and had to start rebuilding her life. I called my mom and I said, ‘I just tried to kill myself, and I need to go to a hospital, like, immediately.'""

Wood in the documentary said that the rocker used to rape her in her sleep.

“I’d wake up, I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, ‘Just stay, just stay asleep, don’t move, just don’t move.’ So I would just lie limp and still until it was over, and then I swear to God, he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room,” she said, and went on to accuse him of sexual torture including being repeatedly struck with a ""Nazi whip"" as she knelt on a prayer kneeler inside his home and using electrodes on her genitals.

“It hurt so bad that I broke the kneeler in half,” Wood recalled. “I remember in that moment thinking, ‘Just tell him whatever he wants to hear, just tell him whatever he wants to hear’ ... and I said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’ I was begging for forgiveness, and he was cradling me and saying, ‘You understand now.’ And then he cut open his hand ... and made me drink his blood. And then he cut me ... and drank mine.”

At least 15 women have come forward and accused the musician of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, and Warner has said that he ""vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone""

Warner on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Wood in L.A. Superior Court and said that she defamed him with rape allegations.

“As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood ... [or her] hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted,” Warner's attorney, Howard King, told the outlet in a statement. “This is just more of the same.”

Medical experts say anyone receiving COVID vaccine should avoid alcohol around the time of injection,"Medical experts warn that any persons intending to receive the COVID-19 vaccination should avoid drinking alcohol around the time of the shot as alcohol can reduce the body's immune response to the vaccine.

What are the details?

According to a Monday report from the Daily Mail, emergency medicine specialist Dr. Ronx Ikhaira, who conducted a recent experiment, determined that after three glasses of an alcoholic beverage, lymphocyte cells in researchers' bodies decreased by as much as 50%.

""Alcohol changes makeup of the trillions of microorganisms that live in the gut which play an important role in preventing the invasion of bacteria and viruses,"" the outlet reported, noting that it ""leads to the damage of immune cells in the blood, known as white blood cells, including lymphocytes, which send out antibodies to attack viruses.""

Professor Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester, said that the lymphocyte reduction ""could lower the effectiveness of the body's immune response,"" the Daily Mail pointed out.

Because of the drop in lymphocytes, Cruickshank has advised people who intend to receive the immunization to avoid alcohol in the immediate timeframe leading up to — and following — the shot.

""You need to have your immune system working tiptop to have a good response to the vaccine, so if you're drinking the night before, or shortly afterwards, that's not going to help,"" Cruickshank said.

The outlet added, ""Lymphocytes are of 'fundamental importance' in the immune system because they determine immune response to infectious microorganisms and other foreign substances, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to a team of scientists in Wuhan, China.""

What else?

In December, Russian scientists urged citizens seeking a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid alcohol for at least two months.



Russia began issuing its own two-dose coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V — which the country has claimed is at least 95% effective — in December, and delivered the injection with a warning to those citizens who like to imbibe: No alcohol for two months during the immunization process.

Citizens were also urged not to take any immunosuppressant drugs during the course of treatment.

Anna Popova, head of the nation's consumer safety watchdog organization, said that those receiving the vaccine should avoid alcohol for at least two weeks before the first shot and then for an additional 42 days following the second shot, which is administered 21 days after the first shot.

""It's a strain on the body,"" Popova said. ""If we want to stay healthy and have a strong immune response, don't drink alcohol.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/experts-no-alcohol-covid-vaccine,2021-01-04
Facebook temporarily allows violent posts like 'death to the Russian invaders',"The social media giant Meta will permit Facebook and Instagram users in certain nations to advocate violence toward Russian troops as it pertains to the invasion of Ukraine, according to internal emails, Reuters has reported.

Russia has been wreaking death and destruction in Ukraine since invading the sovereign nation last month.



""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson noted in a statement, according to the outlet.



Reuters reported that emails to content moderators indicate that in nations including Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, the social media business is temporarily permitting some material that calls for the deaths of the presidents of Russia and Belarus.

According to the outlet, an email noted that calls for the demise of the leaders will be permitted unless those calls include additional targets or feature two elements denoting credibility like a location and method.



Citing an email, Reuters reported that the temporary policy shift regarding posts advocating violence against Russian troops pertains to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.



""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" Meta noted in an email to moderators, according to Reuters.



""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email noted.

Fareed Zakaria shuts down argument that people only care about Ukraine because they're white and European,"Fareed Zakaria argued eloquently on CNN against those saying that the only reason the world cares about the invasion of Ukraine is that Ukrainians are white and European.

Zakaria appeared on Don Lemon's show Friday where he addressed why the Ukrainian war was unique in its importance to the global order.

""There are people who say why are we, why this conflict,"" asked Lemon, ""there are conflicts, there are skirmishes all over the world. Why is this one so different? Why are we involved with it, why should we upend our lives, the price of our gas, and so on and so forth, you understand what I'm saying.""

""I totally understand, and here's the simplest way to understand it,"" Zakaria replied.

""A skirmish that takes place between two small countries in Africa, the Middle East, in Latin America, they don't threaten to upend the international system. When you have a nuclear power, the largest nuclear power in the world, Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States, a great power with a veto in the security council, when it threatens its neighbor what you are reverting to, is a pattern of great power politics that is more reminiscent of the age of Hitler and Mussolini, more reminiscent of 19th century Europe, where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,"" he explained.

""That is a very different world than what we've lived in for the last 70 years, and certainly, ever since the end of the Cold War, so its not, to put it directly to people who think about this and they say, why are Ukrainians, why do we pay so much attention, is it just because they are white?"" Zakaria continued.

""No, it is not because Ukrainians are white or European, it's because their aggressor, their invader, is a nuclear armed superpower, that's the danger. That if Russia can get away with this, it can get away with invading Poland. It can get away with invading the Baltic states. China can get away with invading Taiwan,"" he added.

""You essentially tear up the rule book on international relations,"" Zakaria concluded.

Many global analysts believe the timeline for the Russian invasion has been significantly stalled by the unexpected efforts of the Ukrainian military and civilians fighting back.

Fast-food giants McDonald's and PepsiCo face calls to end operations in Russia,"Fast food giants McDonald’s and PepsiCo are facing calls to cut business ties with Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Insider reported that Thomas DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, urged American companies to rethink their preexisting business relationships with Russia because they face “significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks.”

DiNapoli added that suspending or ending business in Russia “would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market” and will play a crucial role in “condemning Russia’s role in fundamentally undermining the international order.”

McDonald’s and PepsiCo are just the latest in a long line of Western companies with international operations to consider severing their business relationships with the Russian market.

Last week, Disney announced that it would be halting all theatrical film releases in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Disney issued a statement that said, “Given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis, we are pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia, including ‘Turning Red’ from Pixar. We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation. In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.”

Similarly, the British Petroleum Company (BP) announced that it would be liquidating its holdings and ending its relationship with the Russian state-owned energy company Rosneft.

Helge Lund, the chairman for BP, said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having a tragic consequence across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

Financial sector giants Visa and Mastercard are also cutting ties with Russia in accordance with Western sanctions.

The credit card companies are suspending operations in Russia and once its ban is in place, credit cards issued in Russia will not work abroad and cards issued to people outside of Russia will not work within Russia’s borders.

McDonald’s is known for its cosmopolitan franchising strategy. There are McDonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries. The company has been able to achieve success in Russia by using Russian grown ingredients and catering to the tastes and whims of the Russian people it served.

"Fed chairman says inflation is 'much too high,' is prepared to address it through continued rate hikes","On Monday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed to take tough action against inflation.

“The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,” Powell said when addressing the National Association for Business Economics, CNBC reported.

His comments come less than one week after the country’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than three years as it struggles to battle 40-year-high rates of inflation.

Powell said that the Federal Reserve would continue to hike interest rates until inflation comes under control. He said that the rate hikes might need to be even higher than previously thought.

“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” Powell said.

“In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” he continued, “And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”

Federal Reserve officials noted that a “basis point is equal to 0.01%.”

The increased urgency for policy tightening comes as the consumer price index denotes inflation running at 7.9% on a 12-month basis, while gauges more favorable to the country’s central bank indicate that prices are up over 5.2%.

The Federal Reserve aims for an annual target of 2%.

Powell attributes much of the ongoing pressure the economy is suffering to the COVID-19 pandemic and factors stemming from it that disrupted the flow of goods and services.

Powell has previously suggested that during the pandemic, there was a disproportionate, escalated demand for goods over services that global supply chains could not account for.

He acknowledged that officials from the country’s central bank and many economists “widely underestimated” how long economic pressures stemming from the pandemic would last.

“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” Powell said.

“In the meantime,” he continued, “as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”

Powell indicated that the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine is contributing to factors distressing the global economy as it continues to exasperate pre-existing issues with the supply chain.

Federal judge rules university ‘room scans’ unconstitutional,"A federal judge ruled this week that it was unconstitutional for a university in Ohio to require a “room scan” from a chemistry student before he took a remote test.

Room scans are a common requirement in proctored exams “where students are forced to use their device’s camera to give a 360-degree view of everything around the area in which they’re taking a test,” explains the pro-privacy organization Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF).

The decision could significantly affect how schools use monitoring software that has grown increasingly popular since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2021, Cleveland State University student Aaron Ogletree was preparing to take a remote test. Before starting the exam, Ogletree was asked to show the virtual proctor his bedroom, where he was taking the test.

Reason reports that Ogletree expressed reservations about allowing the scan. Ogletree sent an email to Cleveland State Testing Services to note that he ""currently [had] confidential settlement documents in the form of late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to secure them."" However, Ogletree ultimately complied with the scan. The scan lasted between 10 seconds and one minute.

Ogletree then sued the university, alleging that the room scan violated his Fourth Amendment rights protecting U.S. citizens against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" Cleveland State — a public university — responded that room scans are not ""searches,"" because they are limited in scope, conducted to ensure academic fairness and exam integrity, and not coerced, reports NPR.

The school also argued, according to court documents, that the scan was ""brief, only revealed items in plain view, and the student controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the house to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera.""

U.S. district court Judge J. Philip Calabrese ultimately decided in Ogletree's favor. ""Mr. Ogletree's privacy interest in his home outweighs Cleveland State's interests in scanning his room. Accordingly, the Court determines that Cleveland State's practice of conducting room scans is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,"" Judge Calabrese stated.

""We hope more schools will recognize that just because an invasive surveillance tool exists, it isn't necessarily helpful to education,"" Jason Kelley, the Associate Director of Digital Strategy at EFF, told Reason. ""And as this ruling illustrates, it may in fact be a violation of students' rights.""

The school’s legal representative, Dave Yost, who is also Ohio’s attorney general, is “reviewing the decision and consulting with the university on possible next steps,” according to the New York Times.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-rules-university-room-scans-unconstitutional,2022-08-27
Federal Reserve chairman undercuts White House's attempt to blame GOP for inflation problems,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell undercut the Biden administration's attempt to blame Republicans for soaring inflation on Wednesday.

What is the background?

Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden believed ""that Republicans are AWOL on the fight against inflation at this pivotal moment in our economy.""

The problem, Psaki indicated, was that Biden's nominations were not advancing quickly in the Senate (even though Democrats control the chamber).

""Everyone understands we need a full Federal Reserve Board — the first one in nearly a decade — to tackle inflation and bring prices down for American families,"" Psaki went on to say. ""We believe Republicans need to do their jobs and show up to vote for these nominees.""

One day earlier on Feb. 15, Psaki advanced a similar argument, suggesting Republicans are to blame for ongoing inflation problems.

""So Republicans are out there saying, 'Inflation is a problem. It’s a huge issue.' We agree. And then they’re not even bothering to show up to even vote against these nominees to the Federal Reserve. What message is that sending to the American public?"" she said.

But what did Powell say?

During a press conference on Wednesday after the Fed raised interest rates, Powell was asked about Psaki's comments and the White House's attempt to deflect blame for inflation problems.

Fox Business reporter Ed Lawrence asked, ""The impact that given you're not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed's ability to handle inflation?""

Powell made it clear that Senate business, and the fact that key Fed officials remain unconfirmed, is not hindering the Fed.

""None whatsoever,"" Powell said.

Of course, the Biden administration has moved on from blaming supply chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic, and politics for the ongoing inflation crisis.

Last week, the administration began blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a message that Psaki reiterated on Wednesday.

""We continue to believe that the United States economy is positioned well to deal with the challenges ahead, even as we continue to monitor,"" she said. ""Obviously there are events that impact the economy, including an invasion of a foreign country, and we're seeing that impact as well play out in the economic data.""

Federal authorities reportedly using driver's license databases for facial recognition,"The FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been using driver's license records to develop a facial recognition database, the Washington Post reported.

Here's what we know

According to the Post report, the FBI and ICE have used photos from Department of Motor Vehicles databases in multiple states for facial recognition purposes. In addition, ICE has used databases in states that allow illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses to identify and deport these immigrants.

Overall, the FBI has reportedly used these databases for facial recognition purposes more than 390 times since 2011. Driver's license photos in particular seem to have become a regular resource for federal investigations.

The Post's reporting is based on internal documents and emails provided to the paper by researchers at Georgetown University, who in turn had requested them from the government.

''They've just given access to that to the FBI,'' Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told the Post. ''No individual signed off on that when they renewed their driver's license, got their driver's licenses. They didn't sign any waiver saying, 'Oh, it's OK to turn my information, my photo, over to the FBI.' No elected officials voted for that to happen.''

This criticism was echoed by Jordan's Democratic colleague, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who said in a statement to the Post that ""[l]aw enforcement's access of state databases"" was ""often done in the shadows with no consent.""

What else?

ICE refused The Hill's request for comment on this report.

When asked by the Boston Globe about the use of DMV databases, the FBI pointed to the congressional testimony of Deputy Assistant Director Kimberly Del Greco who had argued that facial recognition was crucial ''to preserve our nation's freedoms, ensure our liberties are protected, and preserve our security.''",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-using-drivers-license-databases-for-facial-recognition,2019-07-08
Female state senators from both parties walk out of chamber as Utah Senate passes pro-life ultrasound bill,"All six of Utah's female state senators walked out of the Senate chamber Tuesday as lawmakers passed a bill that would make getting an ultrasound a requirement before getting an abortion.

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, the women walked out in protest, leaving only the chamber's male members to vote on the bill, which passed 16-7:

Spanish Fork Republican Sen. Deidre Henderson successfully amended the bill to prohibit the use of transvaginal ultrasounds under the bill, a more invasive procedure than transabdominal ultrasounds. But while the bill went too far before the amendment, she said, the amendment resulted in the bill going ""a little less too far.""



Henderson and the other female senators, which included one other Republican, spoke in favor of the amendment and then exited the chamber as their names were called for a final vote on the bill, HB364.

""The six Republican and Democratic women of the Senate decided to walk out in protest,"" Henderson later said in a statement, according to KSTU-TV. ""It wasn't planned, but a spontaneous decision to put an exclamation mark on our concerns regarding the invasive nature of the bill.""

""I am very pro-life, and always vote for pro-life bills. But I'm concerned that we are overstepping with government mandates of medically unnecessary procedures.""

Two of the Democratic legislators who walked out also posted about it on social media afterward.

""Love my sisters in the Senate,"" Sen. Luz Escamilla (D) wrote. ""A spontaneous decision not planned of sisterhood against the invasive nature of HB 364.""

""Thank you to these incredible women,"" Sen. Kathleen Reibe (D) tweeted. ""Invasive and unnecessary medical procedures are never best practice.""

An earlier version of the bill passed the Utah House last week by a vote of 47-20. In response to that passage, Planned Parenthood Action Council of Utah slammed the legislation as ""yet another restriction in a long list of laws the Utah legislature has passed to chip away at the right to abortion,"" and added that it ""could add trauma to an already complex and often difficult experience.""

Contrary to the complaints about the bill, its proponents argue that the grave nature of abortion makes it necessary for women be properly informed before making the decision to end an unborn child's life.

""If you are going to take the life of a child, if you are willing to terminate that life through an abortion, it seems appropriate that you get the best information about the development — the stage of development, heart beat,"" Senate sponsor Curtis Bramble (R) told KSL-FM. ""We are talking about a human being.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-state-senators-from-both-parties-walk-out-of-chamber-as-utah-senate-passes-pro-life-ultrasound-bill,2020-03-12
Reactions to FIFA punishing Russia soccer team over Ukraine invasion,"The International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) took a stand against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. However, soccer fans say the punishment was not harsh enough.

On Sunday, FIFA announced that the Russian national soccer team could no longer compete under the name of ""Russia."" Instead, it could only use the name ""Football Union of Russia"" or the acronym ""RFU.""

In addition, Russia may not display the country's flag or play the Russian national anthem during matches. FIFA also declared that Russia is no longer permitted to play home games. Instead, the Russian soccer team may only play on neutral sites and without any fans in attendance.

""Violence is never a solution and FIFA expresses its deepest solidarity to all people affected by what is happening in Ukraine,"" the international soccer organization said in a statement titled ""Bureau of the FIFA Council takes initial measures with regard to war in Ukraine"" released on Sunday. ""FIFA calls again for the urgent restoration of peace and for constructive dialogue to commence immediately.""

""FIFA will continue its ongoing dialogue with the IOC, UEFA, and other sport organizations to determine any additional measures or sanctions, including a potential exclusion from competitions, that shall be applied in the near future should the situation not be improving rapidly,"" FIFA stated.

However, soccer fans and experts were expecting more severe penalties, such as FIFA expelling Russia from World Cup qualifying.

Soccer journalist Grant Wahl: ""Terrible from FIFA.""

Soccer writer Henry Winter: ""FIFA has blood on its hands. Infantino should stand up to Putin not appease him. Utterly spineless from FIFA to let Russia continue competing in World Cup qualifying just with a different name. While brave Ukrainians die.""

Many soccer enthusiasts pointed out the issue with allowing to continue to compete.

The national soccer teams from Poland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic declared they will boycott games against Russia in retaliation to the Ukraine invasion. However, there will be a major issue if teams forfeit their matches against Russia, including World Cup qualifiers.

President of the Polish Football Association (PZPN) Cezary Kulesza: ""Today’s FIFA decision is totally unacceptable. We are not interested in participating in this game of appearances. Our stance remains intact: Polish National Team will NOT PLAY with Russia, no matter what the name of the team is.""

Former pro soccer player Gary Lineker: ""With Poland, Sweden & Czech Republic refusing to play Russia, @FIFAcom has to support them. It’s hard to envisage a World Cup taking place if Russia are given a free pass to the finals. How many teams will refuse to play them or pull out? FIFA where are you?""



Soccer commentator Iain Dale: ""If FIFA kick Poland out of the World Cup for refusing to play Russia, and allow Russia through on a bye, all other nations should make clear they won't play in Qatar.""

Sportswriter Karolos Grohmann: ""FIFA really doesn't get it that there are national teams out there that will not play against Russia anywhere under any name and what ever FIFA says.""

ESPN noted that the teams forfeiting matches against Russia could be punished, ""A strict reading of FIFA's World Cup regulations would even make the Polish, Swedish, and Czech federations liable to disciplinary action and having to pay fines and compensation if they wouldn't play Russia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fifa-russia-ukraine-punishment-reactions,2022-02-28
"4 arrested for allegedly terrorizing elderly woman while wearing clown masks to rob her, police say one suspect had worked as her caretaker","Four people were arrested for allegedly wearing clown masks to terrorize and rob an elderly Florida woman, and police said one of the suspects had worked as a caretaker for her late husband.

The despicable incident unfolded in East Orange County in December.

Police said that the four people used clown masks to disguise themselves, and they used a sledgehammer to break down the woman's door. She told police she was awakened by the sound of her door being broken down.

One of the assailants used the sledgehammer to try to break into the woman's safe but was unsuccessful. They instead took the safe and left the house.

The woman told police that the robbers had gotten away with more than $40,000 worth of family heirlooms and jewelry in the safe.

Investigators suspected 23-year-old Melissa Martinez might be involved in the robbery when the victim's daughter told them that Martinez had the only key to the home after she had worked as a caretaker for the victim's husband, who had died.

Detectives then ran a pawn search on Martinez and found that she had pawned numerous items of jewelry on Dec. 1, including a 14k gold ring with three diamonds on it and a 14k gold cross pendant. Martinez had provided the pawn shop a phone number that matched the one provided to them by the victim's daughter.

Investigators also said that they were able to locate her phone at the scene of the home invasion before, during, and after the robbery.

Orange County deputies arrested Martinez along with 26-year-old Shakira Rivera Colon, 24-year-old Jaydie Cintron-Mayoral, and 42-year-old Nelson Cruz-Medina. They were charged with grand theft and home invasion robbery.

Video: It's all smiles before crooks invade home; seconds later it's all backsides as they run for their lives from homeowner firing 'AK-47-style gun' at them,"Law enforcement officials have released video of last week's thwarted home invasion in Pensacola, Florida, which features suspects running for their lives after the homeowner began firing an AK-47-style gun at them.

The Escambia County sheriff's office said two of the suspects have been arrested, a third has been identified, and a fourth remains unidentified.

What are the details?

The sheriff's office said in an earlier post that the homeowner was alone his Pinestead Road residence at 11:42 p.m. July 7 when the incident took place.

In its latest post, the sheriff's office said three individuals approached the front door of the victim’s home, and two of them pushed the victim into the house and attacked him after the victim unlocked the door.

One of the individuals can be seen smiling in the video before heading inside the home:

The third individual at the front door — who remains unidentified — pulled a handgun from his pants and waited outside.

During the home invasion, the victim’s gun fell to the ground, and one of suspects picked it up, the sheriff's office said. But the victim ran to a back room, grabbed another gun, and started shooting at the intruders, officials said. In its earlier post, the sheriff's office called the homeowner's second weapon an ""AK-47-style gun.""

With that, the trio ""ran frantically"" from the home, the sheriff's office said:

Image source: Escambia County (Fla.) Sheriff's Office video screenshot

They then entered a vehicle where the fourth suspect — 18-year-old Joseph Roman Sanders — was waiting and drove off, hitting a nearby mailbox, the sheriff's office said.

Here's the Ring doorbell video of the incident:

What has happened since?

Da’Torrance Hackworth, 20, and Antonio Dewayne Dean Jr., 18, were arrested and charged with use/display of a firearm during a felony, possession of a firearm by a felon, larceny, grand theft of a firearm, and robbery/home invasion with a firearm, the sheriff's office said.

Dean has active warrants for other alleged offenses, including domestic violence battery, carjacking, aggravated assaults with a firearm, and robbery with a firearm, Sheriff Chip Simmons told the Pensacola News Journal.

In the below Twitter post, Dean's mug shot is on the left, and Hackworth's mug shot is on the right. The post went up prior to their arrests:

Sanders, the driver, is still wanted for home invasion with a firearm, the sheriff's office said.

The suspect who waited outside the front door and pulled a handgun from his pants remains unidentified, and the sheriff's office is asking for the public's help in identifying him.

If you have any information, please call Crime Stoppers at 850-433-STOP or the ECSO at 850-436-9620, authorities said.

What else has the sheriff said about this incident?

Simmons told ""Fox & Friends First"" Thursday that the homeowner ""did absolutely nothing wrong. If someone breaks into my front door, barges and attacks me or my family, they're going to get shot, and I afford that same consideration to the residents of my county.""

The sheriff also told the News Journal that the homeowner would ""absolutely not"" be charged for shooting at the home invasion suspects.

""The homeowner's protecting himself, and in Florida, in Escambia County, you can protect yourself,"" Simmons noted, according to the paper.

Florida passes law to require parental consent for minors' abortions,"A measure that would require girls under the age of 18 to get parental consent before having an abortion is headed to the desk of Florida's Republican governor, Ron Desantis, after passage in both chambers of the state legislature.



The state's House of Representatives passed the bill on Thursday by a vote of 75-43, mostly along party lines, according to a report at the Associated Press. The Senate passed it by a vote of 23-17 earlier this month.

As the Tampa Bay Times explained, while Florida law currently requires parents be notified if their child receives an abortion, the recently passed measure requires parental consent for the procedure as well.

""What we are talking about is a child, and here [we] are talking about a child who is carrying a child,"" Republican bill sponsor Rep. Erin Grall said, according to the AP. ""By including parents in this decision we empower the family. It is the critical backbone of our civilized society.""

Other supporters of the measure have pointed out that parental consent is required for minor-aged children to do other things, and therefore should be to get an abortion.

""In the Sunshine State, a young girl needs a parent or guardian's approval before she gets a tattoo, but she can undergo an invasive, often dangerous procedure without any input from mom or dad,"" Susan B. Anthony List state policy director Sue Liebel said in a statement praising the bill's house passage. ""Parents ought to have the right to protect and support their young daughters.""

""Children can't go to a movie without a parent, can't receive medications in school without parental consent, so it is consistent,"" GOP House Speaker Jose Oliva said of the measure, according to the Center Square.

However, opponents just see the legislation as yet another effort to erode abortion rights.

""Certain lawmakers insist on claiming that this bill is about protecting minors and ensuring parental involvement or guidance — but that is not the reality,"" a statement from ACLU of Florida Legislative Director Kara Gross said. ""It is about politicians creating a system where minors will be forced to have children against their will, placed in harm's way and stripped of their constitutionally protected right to end an unintended pregnancy.""

DeSantis is expected to sign the bill, which would go into effect July 1. He asked lawmakers to send it to his desk last month during his State of the State address.

The big question is what will happen if and when the legislation gets taken to court, since the Florida Supreme Court struck down a parental consent requirement in 1989. Desantis said Thursday that he welcomes a review of the law by the current court, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Three of the seven members of the current Florida Supreme Court have been appointed by DeSantis.

"'As the sun came up, we started rolling': US military veteran group conducting Florida rescue operations","Floodwaters continue to threaten survivors of Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, government agencies are not alone in the rescue efforts. A group of U.S. military veterans known as Project Dynamo has been hard at work off the coast of Fort Myers, Florida, rescuing people stranded on Sanibel Island.

Bryan Stern, a retired U.S. Navy lieutenant commander, is co-founder of the search-and-rescue team. He told the AP, ""As soon as the sun came up, we started rolling.""



With a small flotilla under its command, Project Dynamo — named after the British evacuation of Dunkirk, France, during the Second World War — has rescued over 20 people. Many of the rescuees are reportedly elderly residents whose escape from Sanibel Island was thwarted when Ian washed away the causeway to the mainland.

The training division chief for the Sanibel Fire Department, Tim Barrett, lauded the efforts of the group and like-minded bystanders who have leaped into action. ""It sort of restores your view of humanity,"" he said. ""You see people chipping in and they aren't getting paid for it.""

Barrett noted that among the rescuers were several whose own homes were obliterated. Nevertheless, ""They're still helping other people.""

Although presently operating domestically in Florida, Project Dynamo has performed rescue operations internationally and claims to have aided over 8,000 people.



The group rescued three Americans who were trapped in Afghanistan after the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal. Stern said that the people the group brought home to Virginia and California would otherwise have faced ""very terrible"" fates.

When it came to rescuing Americans from Ukraine in the early days of the Russian invasion, the group took action when others seemed unwilling. James Judge, a spokesman for the group, told Fox News that ""when the Biden administration said they weren't going to do it, it was kind of like, 'Okay, here we go.'""

WFTS reported in June that Project Dynamo rescued nearly 500 people from Mariupol, Ukraine.

In it together

There are other groups buttressing official efforts. Matt Mengel and his friends took to Sanibel Island to help. ""We had gasoline. We had jet skis. We had water. We had food and snacks,"" Mengel told the AP. ""And our mission was just to go find them, dead or alive.""



There are reportedly at least 68 dead in Florida as a result of Hurricane Ian.

Mengel, whose own home was destroyed, began rescue operations with his compatriots on Friday after first investigating the well-being of a friend the group hadn't heard from. Upon finding that friend safe, they proceeded to look for others they could help and ferry back to the mainland.

In their efforts, Mengel's team aided an elderly couple in waving down a Coast Guard helicopter, reinforced in their effort by Project Dynamo. Mengel indicated his team has made seven rescues so far.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) noted on Sunday that the mobilization of search-and-rescue teams was the largest since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Extra to the eight Urban Search and Rescue Teams that have been performing search and rescue since last week, nearly 5,000 National Guard troops were also activated on Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-search-and-rescue-veterans,2022-10-03
Polk County sheriff warns criminals against looting in Florida,"A Florida sheriff gave advice to homeowners on how to handle looters in the state: ""Shoot him so he looks like grated cheese.""

Hurricane Ian ravaged the west coast of Florida last week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis delivered an unflinching warning to criminals in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Ian: ""Don't even think about looting.""

""The other thing we’re concerned about, particularly in those areas that were really hard hit, is we want to make sure we’re maintaining law and order,"" DeSantis explained. ""Don’t even think about looting. Don’t even think about taking advantage of people in this vulnerable situation.""

""I can tell you, in the state of Florida, you never know what may be lurking behind somebody’s home,"" DeSantis warned. ""I would not want to chance that if I were you, given that we're a Second Amendment state.""

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd issued an even more imposing warning to criminals considering looting. During an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" Grady commented on the cases of criminals being arrested for looting in the areas obliterated by the Category 4 hurricane.

""People have a right to be safe in their homes. They have a right to their property, to be safe even when part of their home maybe torn away,"" Judd said on Friday. “And these looters, that’s unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable.""

Grady advised Florida homeowners, ""I would highly suggest that if a looter breaks into your home, comes into your home while you’re there to steal stuff that you take your gun and you shoot him. You shoot him so he looks like grated cheese because you know what? That’s one looter that will not break into anyone else’s home and take advantage of them when they’re the most vulnerable and the most weak.""

Grady said that law enforcement and the community are ""all gonna come together"" during catastrophes like hurricanes.

""The community is gonna come together, and if there are looters that think they’re gonna take care of these people, they may breaking it, but they should be carried out in a pine box because that is unacceptable, that cuts against all laws and all reality,"" he exclaimed. ""You have a right, and your property has a right to be safe and secure in your home, what’s left of it.""

This isn't the first time the outspoken sheriff has issued a forceful warning to looters.

During the racial riots of the summer of 2020 sparked by the death of George Floyd, Sheriff Grady sternly warned criminals not to loot in the county east of Tampa.

""Let there be no misunderstanding, if you come here to riot, to loot, to injure people, we're going to lock you up in the county jail,"" Judd said in June 2020. ""We are going to hunt you down and lock you up if you engage in any criminal conduct.""

“I would tell them, if you value your life, they probably shouldn’t do that in Polk County. Because the people of Polk County like guns, they have guns, I encourage them to own guns, and they’re going to be in their homes tonight with their guns loaded, and if you try to break into their homes to steal, to set fires, I’m highly recommending they blow you back out of the house with their guns. So, leave the community alone,” the sheriff said.

In December 2021, Grady praised a Florida resident who defended his house from a home invasion.

""The homeowner did exactly what he should have,"" Judd noted of the resident in Lakeland. ""He had a gun, he knew how to use it, it was loaded, and he shot him a lot. He gave him an early Christmas present. Only Santa Claus gets to come in your house — and Santa Claus is invited.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-sheriff-grady-looting-hurricane,2022-10-08
"Florida sheriff 'proud' of homeowner for defending himself after intruder breaks in: 'He had a gun, he knew how to use it, it was loaded, and he shot him a lot'","There was no mistaking where Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd stood in regard to guns and self-defense following a home invasion Wednesday afternoon in north Lakeland, Florida, which culminated in the homeowner shooting the intruder.

“The homeowner did exactly what he should have,"" Judd said, according to WFLA-TV. ""He had a gun, he knew how to use it, it was loaded, and he shot him a lot. He gave him an early Christmas present. Only Santa Claus gets to come in your house — and Santa Claus is invited.”

What are the details?

The homeowner told deputies the intruder threw a flower pot through glass French doors to get inside the home from the back porch — after which the homeowner shot the intruder three times, the station said.

Deputies said that upon their arrival, the homeowner handed them the gun and directed them to the intruder, who was lying on the living room floor, WESH-TV reported.

“I’m proud of our homeowner for defending himself,"" Judd added to WFLA. ""It’s called a ‘Castle Doctrine.’ He has the right to protect himself and his home from unknown intruders.""

'He's lucky to be alive'

Steven Stillwell, 42, was rushed to a hospital, where he was listed in critical but stable condition, WFLA reported.

""He's lucky to be alive,"" Judd told WTVT-TV, adding that the break-in occurred around 1:00 p.m.

Image source: WFLA-TV video screenshot

What's more, deputies told WFLA that Stillwell was seen on surveillance video running into the back yard and standing on the porch, that evidence showed Stillwell was shot inside the home, and that someone had broken the glass to enter the residence.

In addition, investigators told WESH a shotgun belonging to Stillwell was found in the homeowner’s back yard.

The homeowner’s firearm was legal, deputies added to WFLA. The homeowner, who lives near Gibsonia-Galloway Road, does not know Stillwell, WESH reported.

'A person's home is his refuge'

The sheriff’s office considers the homeowner to be the victim in this case even though he shot the intruder; therefore, the homeowner's name is not being released, WFLA said.

""The castle doctrine is very clear in Florida law,"" Judd added to WESH. ""A person's home is his refuge.""

The homeowner’s attorney confirmed his client lives with his wife and young child but was home alone at the time of the shooting, WFLA added.

Charges are pending against Stillwell, WESH reported, adding that sheriff's office officials said he has an extensive criminal history that includes 14 felonies.

'I tell folks to get a gun'

Judd emphasized the importance of protecting yourself since police can't be everywhere at once.

""I tell folks to get a gun, learn how to use it safely, and load it,"" he told WESH. ""You can dial 911 all day long, but when that guy's coming through the back door on you, we can't get there in time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-sheriff-proud-of-homeowner-for-defending-himself-after-intruder-breaks-in,2021-12-17
Former Israeli PM warns Americans that new Iran nuclear deal formed under Biden is 'even worse than its predecessor',"Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the United States on Sunday against entering into a new nuclear deal with Iran.

What is the background?

The Biden administration joined negotiations last year to re-establish the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the ""Iran nuclear deal,"" after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord in 2018.

Two weeks ago, the State Department said a new deal was imminent. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has complicated the negotiation process, and now the deal could fall through. Russia has been a lead negotiator on the new deal.

What did Netanyahu say?

As Israel's top leader at the time, Netanyahu vehemently opposed the Iran nuclear deal when it was first negotiated under the Obama administration. Iran, after all, refuses to recognize Israel's sovereignty and funds terrorist groups that attack Israel.

In a video published Sunday — the same day Iranian missiles struck an area around a U.S. consulate in northern Iraq — Netanyahu explained why the forthcoming deal is ""downright dangerous.""

""The desperate rush to sign this flawed nuclear agreement with Iran is not only absurd — it's downright dangerous,"" Netanyahu said.

""Yesterday, Iran fired missiles in the vicinity of the American consulate in Iraq, and the U.S. continues to charge ahead along with the other powers to sign a nuclear agreement that will give the Ayatollahs a nuclear arsenal,"" Netanyahu continued. ""It would also relieve sanctions and give them hundreds of billions of dollars in order to continue the terror that they waged yesterday and wage every day throughout the Middle East and the world.""

Netanyahu, a staunch supporter of the U.S., said the new deal negotiated under Biden ""is even worse than its predecessor because in three years' time, under this agreement, Iran will be a threshold nuclear state. It will have enough enriched uranium to create dozens and dozens of nuclear bombs and it will have the ICBMs to deliver them to any place in the United States,"" he warned.

""That is ... unbelievable. It's not merely unacceptable, it endangers not only my country, Israel, but your country, the United States, and the entire world,"" Netanyahu continued. ""We should not let an aggressive, rogue, terrorist regime like Iran have nuclear weapons.""

""Have we learned nothing?"" he asked.

Despite Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's lead negotiator on the revived JCPOA, boasting that Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran essentially took the U.S. to the cleaners, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman reiterated Sunday that moving forward with the Iran nuclear deal is the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-israeli-pm-warns-americans-that-new-iran-nuclear-deal-formed-under-biden-is-even-worse-than-its-predecessor,2022-03-14
Former trans man who had gender reassignment surgery — and then de-transitioned — offers warning to Caitlyn Jenner and 7-year-old Texas boy James Younger,"Walt Heyer, a former transgender man, has been making the rounds sharing that gender reassignment surgeries are more harmful than people realize.

He issued a warning to Caitlyn Jenner — formerly Bruce Jenner — via the Daily Mail this week in a new interview. Jenner transitioned in 2015 at the age of 66.

What are the details?

Heyer, 79, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1983 when he was just 43 years old. He was married with children at the time.

He lived as a trans woman for eight years, but ended up de-transitioning, returning to his natural-born self.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Heyer said that people considering gender reassignment surgery need counseling and therapy instead of a sex change and pointed to Jenner as a prime example of hindsight being 20/20.

""I'll be interested to see how Caitlyn Jenner feels in eight years' time,"" he insisted.

""What happened in my childhood had never been dealt with as it should have been with psychotherapy,"" he admitted. ""I thought that my problem was my gender.""

Heyer's grandmother reportedly dressed her grandson up in feminine attire, apparently confusing a young and impressionable Heyer. Heyer also previously revealed that his uncle sexually abused him during his formative years. You can read more about Heyer's disturbing upbringing here.

Elsewhere in the interview, Heyer pointed to the case of 7-year-old James Younger, who is living in Texas, and in the middle of a nasty custody dispute involving a mother who reportedly wants to allow him to transition into a female and refers to the child as ""Luna.""

Younger attended his first day of school last month as his biologically born self: a male. The child's father is accusing his estranged wife of child abuse, and permits the child to live as a little boy when in his custody.

""[James'] father got in touch with me last year when I was in Texas speaking at a conference and I had the opportunity to meet the boy and spend time with him,"" Heyer said. ""He had no idea about being gender dysphoric, but his mother has such a strong influence on him, and she keeps feeding him this idea that he was female. I believe he was fearful about going against his mom.

""When he was evaluated at the gender clinic and asked to pick the name he preferred, James or Luna, he picked James every time,"" Heyer added. ""He only ever picked Luna when his mom was there.""

Heyer noted that such a back-and-forth is going to ""do more damage to [the child] than anything else.""

He explained that the majority of people who have undergone gender reassignment surgery, or considered such drastic measures, were able to ""pinpoint the trauma or abuse that lies at the root of it all.""

""It's not about wanting to be a different gender,"" he reasoned. ""It's about wanting to be a different person — not wanting to be the boy or the girl who was hurt.""

What's his advice?

Heyer said that before choosing such an invasive and life-altering procedure such as gender reassignment surgery, candidates should vet themselves or be vetted with ""really good psychotherapy"" from a person who isn't ""approving them or supporting them, but looking for potential co-morbid disorders"" and treat those issues instead.

""If they treat that and the person still wants to transition, that's a whole different ball of wax,"" he reasoned. ""But right now I'm speaking for people who don't have a voice and think they don't have support. Suicide rates in post-operative transgender community are 19 percent. If we can save one person just by applying good, effective presurgical psychotherapy then it's worth it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-trans-man-who-had-gender-reassignment-surgery--and-then-de-transitioned--offers-warning-to-caitlyn-jenner-and-7-year-old-texas-boy-james-younger,2019-11-08
Formula One drivers boycotted Russian Grand Prix over Ukraine invasion. Now the race is canceled.,"Formula One officials announced Friday that the 2022 Russian Grand Prix has been canceled after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What is the background?

After Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, several F1 drivers announced opposition to the 2022 Russian Grand Prix, which was scheduled to take place in late September at the Sochi Autodrom is southwest Russia.

""For myself, my opinion is I should not go — I will not go,"" said four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel. ""I think it’s wrong to race in the country. I’m sorry for the innocent people who are losing their lives and getting killed for stupid reasons and very, very strange and mad leadership.""

Defending world champion Max Verstappen similarly said, ""When a country is at war, it is not right to race there.""

What did F1 say?

Perhaps the biggest motorsport conundrum related to the Russia-Ukraine war goes to Haas F1 Team.

On one hand, Uralkali, one of the world's leading potash fertilizer producers and exporters, is the team's title sponsor. On the other, Dimtry Mazepin — the father of Haas F1 driver Nikita Mazepin — is a Belarusian-Russian oligarch, key shareholder in Uralkali, and a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sports Illustrated noted.

On Thursday, Haas F1 removed Uralkali's branding from the team's transport trucks and car, which was painted with a red, white, and blue livery meant to resemble the Russian flag.

Haas F1 team principal Gunther Steiner said the team is reconsidering its Uralkali sponsorship and will announce more details next week. The sponsorship was intended to span multiple seasons for an undisclosed dollar amount. Multiyear sponsorships in F1 typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars because F1 is the most expensive form of motorsport in the world.

The team has said it can compete in the 2022 season even without Uralkali's funding.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/formula-1-drivers-boycott-russian-grand-prix-over-ukraine-invasion-now-the-race-is-canceled,2022-02-25
Family of fourth-grader suspended for visible BB gun during virtual class sues school officials,"The family of 9-year-old Ka'Mauri Harrison is suing Louisiana school officials after the Jefferson Parish School Board determined that Ka'Mauri was guilty of flashing a ""full-sized rifle"" during virtual instruction.

It was a BB gun.

The child's father, Nyron Harrison, said that the school is treating the incident as if Ka'Mauri brought a weapon to school.

What's a brief history here?

Last month, the school suspended Ka'Mauri following the incident, and the school even recommended expulsion.

""Ka'Mauri presented a weapon that appeared to be a rifle/shotgun during his Google Meets classroom session,"" September's behavior report on the incident said. ""This is a violation of weapons in the classroom setting and a violation of the internet usage policy. He will be recommended for expulsion as per JPPSS policy.""

According to the New York Post, Woodmere Elementary School in Harvey, Louisiana, suspended Ka'Mauri for six days in September after he pulled out the BB gun.

Citing a school behavioral report, the outlet reported that Ka'Mauri was taking a virtual test on his computer when his brother entered the room and ""tripped over the BB gun that was lying on the floor.""

The report noted that Ka'Mauri left his seat and came back with ""what appeared to be a full-sized rifle in his possession.""

Shortly after being seen with the BB gun in his hand, he was kicked out of the virtual class.

A Sept. 22 school board meeting found Ka'Mauri ""guilty of displaying a facsimile weapon while receiving virtual instruction.""

WDSU-TV reported that the Louisiana Department of Education School Behavior Report lists the incident as ""possesses weapons prohibited under federal law."" The report identifies Ka'Mauri's suspension and also recommends expulsion.

What about the lawsuit?

The outlet reported that the family is seeking at least $50,000 in damages for ""mental pain, suffering, anguish and embarrassment, humiliation and loss of self-esteem, future counseling and tutoring and lost income.""

CNN reported that the school declined to comment on Ka'Mauri's case and pointed to a policy of not speaking about individual school records.

""Regarding discipline, it is our policy that teachers and administrators may employ reasonable disciplinary and corrective measures to maintain order,"" the district said.

According to WDSU, the family filed the lawsuit on Friday.

""[I]t is very important to the family that this be dismissed, that it does not follow him in his educational career,"" Nyron said in the suit. ""[T]he school did not follow his due process rights.""

Chelsea Cusimano, the family's attorney, said, ""The school board, from the moment this incident occurred, mishandled it every step of the way. And it's riddled throughout the paperwork; charging this child with a weapons violation.""

In September, Cusimano added, ""This is a terrible overreaction. This is not a child bringing a weapon to school. This was a toy that was in his bedroom. This would be the same as if you had two siblings in a room and one's ADHD medication was in the background and that child's getting charged with a drug charge.""

Anything else?

In September, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced that the state Department of Justice would open an investigation into the incident.

""I am alarmed by what appears to not only be multiple violations of both the State and Federal Constitutions, but also blatant government overreach by the school system,"" Landry said at the time. ""I have begun investigating this matter and plan to take action in defense of this young man and his family and all families who could suffer the same invasion of their homes and constitutional rights.""

""For anyone to conclude that a student's home is now school property because of connectivity through video conferencing is absurd,"" Landry's statement continued. ""It is ludicrous for this All-American kid to be punished for taking responsible actions just as it is for his parents to be accused of neglect.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fourth-grader-family-bb-gun-lawsuit,2020-10-05
Louisiana 4th grader suspended because BB gun was visible during virtual class session,"A fourth grader in Louisiana was suspended from school and nearly expelled after his BB gun was seen on camera during a virtual class session, according to the New Orleans Advocate.

Ka Mauri Harrison, 9, was participating in a virtual class session with his Woodmere Elementary classmates. He was on the computer in his bedroom.

Ka Mauri's younger brother entered the room and tripped over the BB gun while Ka Mauri was taking an English test. Ka Mauri leaned over and grabbed the BB gun and moved it away from his brother, next to his chair — and within view of his computer's camera.

Ka Mauri was disconnected from the virtual class session minutes later. He had the computer muted during the test, so he hadn't heard his teacher and didn't know why he was kicked out of the class. The school called his parents and informed them of the suspension.

""Ka Mauri presented a weapon that appeared to be a rifle/shotgun during his Google Meets classroom session,"" the behavior report said. ""This is a violation of weapons in the classroom setting and a violation of the internet usage policy. He will be recommended for expulsion as per JPPSS policy.""

The school opted not to expel him, but suspended him for six days, citing the violation as ""displaying a facsimile weapon while receiving virtual instruction.""

Ka Mauri's family is considering legal action against the school system, after their appeal of the suspension was rejected. Their attorney, Chelsea Cusimano, told the Advocate, ""It's not ending here. It's our intent to explore further options..""

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry announced that the state Department of Justice would open an investigation into the incident, citing a possible constitutional infringement.

""I am alarmed by what appears to not only be multiple violations of both the State and Federal Constitutions, but also blatant government overreach by the school system,"" Landry said in a news release. ""I have begun investigating this matter and plan to take action in defense of this young man and his family and all families who could suffer the same invasion of their homes and constitutional rights.

Fox News host allegedly suspended by Twitter for sharing anti-American post from Pensacola shooting suspect,"Fox News host Pete Hegseth says he was suspended by Twitter after sharing a post allegedly written by the Saudi national who reportedly killed three people on a naval base in Pensacola on Friday, according to The Daily Wire.

The suspected killer, who died at the scene of the attack, was a member of the Saudi military. The shooting is believed by the FBI to be an act of terrorism, and the reported shooter, Mohammed Alshamrani, is known to have shown mass shooting videos to attendees at a dinner party the night before the attack.

Hegseth shared a post believed to be written by Alshamrani, in which the suspect expressed anti-American views and anger toward U.S. foreign policy.

""O American people, I'm not against you for just being American, I don't hate you because your freedoms, I hate you because every day you supporting funding and committing crimes not only against Muslims but also humanity,"" Alshamrani allegedly wrote on Dec. 6, hours before the attack. ""I'm against evil, and America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil. What I see from America is the supporting of Israel which is invasion of Muslim country (sic), I see invasion of many countries by its troops, I see Guantanamo Bay. I see cruise missiles, cluster bombs and UAV.""

Hegseth shared that post on Twitter, and said he was banned as a result. He then shared the same post on Instagram, while criticizing Twitter for his suspension.

""Yesterday, I was BANNED from Twitter—because I posted a screen shot of the terrorist from Florida tweeting his Islamist motivations,"" Hegseth wrote in the Instagram post caption. ""That's it, a screen shot of a terrorist in his own words. If they can ban me, they will ban anyone. We need to fight back. Heck, I posted the terrorist screen shot on this post too, so stay tune for Instagram banning me too. Big tech does the bidding of the Left, especially to include anyone who speaks truth about the threat of radical Islam.""

Hegseth has apparently appealed his Twitter suspension.

""You blocked me b/c I shared the words — and motivation — of an Islamist terrorist,"" Hegseth wrote in his appeal. ""What are you afraid of?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-host-twitter-suspension-pensacola-shooting-suspect,2019-12-09
Fox News reporter exposes critical flaw in Biden's plan to 'start blaming Putin for everything',"Fox News reporter Peter Doocy exposed on Thursday the emptiness of President Joe Biden's plan to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for his domestic problems.

This week, the Biden administration coalesced around messaging that blames Putin for sky-high gas pricesand historic inflation, despite both economic problems existing long before the Russia-Ukraine war.

What happened Thursday?

During the daily press briefing, Doocy asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki whether the Biden administration is ""just going to start blaming Putin for everything until the midterms?""

At first, Psaki defended the plan.

""Well, we’ve seen the price of gas go up at least 75 cents since President Putin lined up troops on the border of Ukraine,"" she said.

But Doocy quickly exposed the misleading blame game, noting that just last month the Biden administration blamed inflation and economic woes on the COVID-19 pandemic — not Putin.

""Why is that?"" Doocy pressed.

In response, Psaki claimed that ""all"" global economists agree the pandemic is responsible for inflation before she returned to blaming Putin.

""Well, Peter, the last two years, there was a global pandemic. Global economists have all agreed that that has been the biggest contributor to date of inflation because of the impact on the supply chain. Obviously, global events impact the global economy, as well as global inflation,"" Psaki said. ""And the price hikes, as a result, that have escalated over the course of time of President Putin’s further invasion of the impact on the global oil markets are of course having an impact.""

Earlier in the briefing, Doocy confronted Psaki over her repeated claims that inflation will be temporary.

""We just heard you say, again, that you think inflation is going to be temporary. We’ve heard you say that it was going to be temporary since last spring. So how long do you guys think 'temporary' is?"" Doocy asked.

Psaki, however, deflected blame for the incorrect predictions, saying the Biden administration relies on the Federal Reserve and ""outside economic analysts"" for assessments of the economy.

""The expectations and their assessment at this point continues to be that it will moderate by the end of the year,"" Psaki said. ""There’s also no question that when a foreign dictator invades a foreign country, and when that foreign dictator is the head of a country that is the third-largest supplier of oil in the in the world, that that is going to have an impact. And it is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-reporter-exposes-critical-flaw-in-bidens-plan-to-start-blaming-putin-for-everything,2022-03-11
Rev. Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse Easter message of hope t o all faiths and People of Ukraine,"Rev. Franklin Graham will deliver an Easter message of hope from war-torn Ukraine, where he has seen the resiliency of the Ukrainian people who are fighting back against an invasion by Russia.

""The people that you meet and talk to [in Ukraine] are strong,"" Rev. Graham told Fox News. ""There's no question there's despair and there's fear. But they are determined they are going to fight for their land. And I just admire the [Ukrainian] people for the stand that they're taking.""

Graham said the worst suffering has occurred in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where there is ""famine and great food shortage."" The faith leader revealed that four Ukrainian people distributing food through Graham's humanitarian aid charity Samaritan's Purse were recently killed. The victims died ""trying to help their own citizens, their own people,"" Graham said.

""This may be one of the hardest countries that we have worked in,"" he said of the crisis. ""It's a big country, the size of Texas. And transportation is an issue. They have trains, and trucks, and so forth, but fuel is a big issue. You can't always get fuel.""

Samaritan's Purse said their team of doctors and nurses has treated over 5,000 Ukrainian patients at six medical sites across Ukraine. The Christian charity has also airlifted more than 232 tons of emergency relief supplies to Ukraine, and utilized a network of over 3,200 churches to share medicine and food.

Graham said the Ukrainian ""people are living in the shadow of death,"" but still have the sense that God is with them.

""It's obvious that these people have a strong faith in God,"" Rev. Graham continued.

He pointed out that there are more than 5,000 churches in Ukraine, and they are ""full on Sunday.""

""They're packed. Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical, Pentecostal, Baptist — they're packed. The people's faith is strong in Ukraine right now. Very strong,"" the CEO and president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said.

""In Ukraine, there are billboards that say, 'Our only hope is God.' We need some billboards like that here in this country,"" he added. ""I hope that our nation would wake up and see the problems we're facing and realize that the only hope is God.""

""The problem we have in the world today is a sin problem,"" Rev. Graham stressed. ""People have turned their back on God.""



""The only hope is God. That's the only hope. Only God can turn [our] nation around,"" he proclaimed. ""This Easter, I pray that people will look to God, pray to him and ask him for his help in all that we do — and that he'll bless the nation.""

Graham declared, ""But to do that, we've got to repent, turn from our sins and believe on the name of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ.""



""We [all] need to repent and turn from our sins. And maybe God will hear us from heaven,"" Graham advised. ""Pray for yourself. Just examine your heart. And if something's not right in your life, confess it to God and turn from it. We need to look at ourselves.""

“I will be sharing a message the whole world needs to hear: Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, conquered sin and death 2,000 years ago when He rose victoriously from the grave,"" Graham said of his Easter message. ""This good news changes everything – for individual hearts, for communities, and for entire nations.”



Previously, Graham wrote to Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requesting a ceasefire from April 15-24 in observance of the Easter holiday.



""It's a mess. It's going to get worse, I'm afraid,"" Graham said of the conflict in Ukraine. ""And what President Putin's end game is, I don't know. But I think we just need to pray that God can change his heart.""

""And I would recommend for people to pray for Putin. I don't want to be misunderstood,"" he clarified. ""I want people to pray that God would change his heart. And turn his heart around, and that he would see the sin that he's involved in. That he would repent and turn from it.""

He added, ""And if we pray, that could happen.""

""God loves us, and Easter is about God's love,"" Graham said.

AG Garland reportedly waited weeks to approve Mar-a-Lago raid — but that detail raises critical question,"Attorney General Merrick Garland reportedly deliberated for weeks whether FBI agents should conduct a raid on Mar-a-Lago to retrieve highly classified documents.

What are the details?

At at press conference last week, Garland confirmed that he personally approved the raid on former President Donald Trump's south Florida residence.

On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Garland spent weeks debating whether the Justice Department should take such a drastic action. According to the newspaper, the decision to approve the warrant ""had been the subject of weeks of meetings between senior Justice Department and FBI officials.""

The WSJ framed Garland's decision as one of precision and careful deliberation:

Justice Department officials have defended the Mar-a-Lago search as a necessary step approved by Mr. Garland himself. People familiar with the Justice Department’s approach have said a primary goal of the search was to ensure the security of highly sensitive national-security documents after the Trump team didn’t relinquish them and amid concerns that the security of the material at Mar-a-Lago had been put at risk.

However, the timetable also raises questions whether the matter was serious enough to warrant an invasive FBI raid.

If, in fact, Trump retained highly classified documents in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago and an FBI raid was necessary to retrieve the documents, why did the DOJ wait weeks to retrieve them?

Unfortunately, that question will not be answered any time soon. On Monday, the Justice Department insisted the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant — which also contains the probable cause for the search — should remain under government seal.

Anything else?

Still, attorneys like Alan Dershowitz argue that Garland must answer for why he approved a raid when other means apparently existed to retrieve the items from Mar-a-Lago.

""Why didn’t the Justice Department seek to enforce the subpoena it apparently had issued, rather than seek a search warrant? Was this consistent with the 'standard practice' Mr. Garland articulated in his statement — 'to seek less intrusive alternatives to a search' whenever possible?"" Dershowitz wrote in an essay on Monday.

""Why was the matter handled so differently from the prior investigations of Sandy Berger and Hillary Clinton, who were also suspected of mishandling classified material?"" he also asked.

""[U]ntil Mr. Garland fully and specifically answers the hard questions about what appears to be unequal application of rules and practices, 'what about her emails?' will be a pertinent question.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/garland-reportedly-waited-weeks-mar-a-lago-raid,2022-08-16
Gas prices soar to new high,"As of Tuesday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas reached $4.374, a staggering figure that marks a new record high when inflation is not taken into account.

Gas Buddy also reported that the the national average price of gas had hit a new high, though it pegged the price at $4.36 per gallon.

While the prices mark fresh highs, reports indicate that when inflation is factored into the equation, the new record still does not eclipse high prices experienced in 2008.

High gas prices not only cost drivers dearly when they fill up their vehicles, but the fuel costs also drive up transportation expenses, which can lead to higher prices for various goods and services throughout the economy.

Americans have been getting hammered by soaring gas prices and high inflation, and if they keep experiencing pain at the pump and witnessing the purchasing power of their hard-earned savings erode each month, those economic issues could hurt Democrats during the 2022 midterm election cycle.



The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release April consumer price index data on Wednesday. The all-items index rose ""8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March,"" the agency reported last month.

President Joe Biden said in a speech on Tuesday that inflation is his ""top domestic priority."" He attributed inflation to the COVID-19 pandemic and to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. has prohibited the importation of oil and other products from Russia in response to that country's invasion of Ukraine.

""We have the biggest inflation spike in 4 decades, record high gas prices, a massive border crisis, incompetent foreign policy, endless attacks on liberty and personal safety, and now even a baby formula shortage. The Biden presidency has truly been a epic disaster from the start,"" tweeted GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York — the lawmaker is currently running for governor in the Empire State.

""Liquid fuels have turned into liquid gold, with prices for gasoline and diesel spiraling out of control with little power to harness them as the imbalance between supply and demand globally continues to widen with each passing day. Russia's oil increasingly remains out of the market, crimping supply while demand rebounds ahead of the summer driving season,"" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan said. ""There's little, if any, good news about fuel prices heading into summer, and the problem could become worse should we see an above average hurricane season, which could knock out refinery capacity at a time we badly need it as refined product inventories continue to plummet.""

Average US gas price tops $4 a gallon for first time since 2008 — and it could go even higher,"The average cost of gasoline in the U.S. soared on Monday to more than $4 a gallon amid Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

What are the details?

According to AAA, the average cost per gallon was $4.065 as of Monday morning, a notch up from Sunday when reports over the soaring prices began to circulate widely in American media.

The figure is just shy of the all-time high of $4.103 and the highest since 2008

While most average prices are hovering just below $4, in certain states — such as California, Nevada, and New York — the cost is exorbitantly high. In California, the average cost is well over $5 a gallon.

The skyrocketing prices are driven by fears over crude oil supply as private companies continue to boycott Russian energy and the U.S. and other Western nations consider embargos on Russian oil as a penalty for their attack on neighboring Ukraine.

On Monday, Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was up 14%, trading at nearly $130 a barrel, double what it was trading for just a few months ago.

Even though many Western nations have so far largely kept their hands off Russia's energy sector as they advance crippling sanctions, the market is still responding to Moscow's war.

""The market is self-sanctioning — in other words, buyers are avoiding Russian products,"" CNBC reported. ""According to estimates from JPMorgan, 66% of Russian oil is struggling to find buyers. This is creating supply fears in what was an already tight market prior to Russia’s invasion.""

If the U.S. and other nations follow through with a formal embargo, it's expected that oil and gas prices will rise even more.

What else?

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent rise in oil costs have renewed calls for curtailing America's reliance on foreign energy, specifically from adversaries like Russia. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has doubled its imports of Russian crude oil over the past year.

Many business leaders and lawmakers have responded to the crisis by once again urging the U.S. to produce its own energy, or become energy independent, something quite possible given the country's natural resources. Yet for years the initiative has been thwarted by Democrat-imposed restrictions over supposed environmental concerns.

Over the weekend, influential tech billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk begrudgingly called for an increase in domestic energy production.

""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports,""

Soon after, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz threw his support behind Musk, saying, ""Couldn’t agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!""

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, too, has voiced his support for energy independence while criticizing the current president for continuing to buy up Russian oil.

""We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,"" Manchin said last week. ""We’re buying 650,000 barrels a day from Russia. It’s ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.""

""To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical,"" he added in a statement. ""To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gas-prices-top-4-dollars-gallon-russia-ukraine,2022-03-07
Gas theft is on the rise as prices keep climbing,"Gas prices in the U.S. are reaching record highs and are only set to keep rising after President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on energy imports from Russia. And now some people are reporting incidents of gasoline theft.

In Southern California, a viewer shared photographs with KTVU-TV showing what happened to one vehicle — how a thief had drilled a hole in the fuel tank and drained it of all the gas.







According to the American Automobile Association, gas siphoning and other crimes of theft are on the rise as prices at the pump keep skyrocketing.

""This is a sign of the times you know,"" AAA spokesman Doug Shupe told KTVU. ""It's thieves looking for ways that they can make money by stealing what is becoming an increasingly more expensive and valuable commodity, gasoline.""

The average price for a gallon of regular gas in California is currently $5.44, up from $3.75 last year. Price increases related to inflation have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, where Russia's full-scale invasion of the country has disrupted energy production. Additionally, U.S. economic sanctions and the Biden administration's action to ban oil and gas imports from Russia have restricted supply, further increasing prices.

""[It] used to be $60, then it went to $70, I think two weeks ago it was $90,"" California resident Mona Garcia told the local news station while filling up her car Monday night. When she had finished, the bill was $100.

Garcia said she uses a driveway camera and floodlight are meant to deter would-be thieves from stealing gas from her tank.

But for those who are victims of theft, the cost can be high. If thieves drill into your fuel tank, repairs can run more than $1,000, not including the stolen gas.

""Oftentimes vehicle owners who find themselves victims of this type of gasoline theft, they have to replace the entire gas tank,"" Shupe warned. ""So it is a costly repair and replacement that needs to be made.""

The risk isn't just to Californians. Last week, police in Atlanta, Georgia arrested a man suspected of drilling holes in multiple fuel tanks to steal thousands of dollars of gasoline, WAGA-TV reported.

AAA recommends that people take precautions against thieves while gas prices remain high, including parking the car in a locked garage if you have one. If you do not have access to a garage, it is recommended that you park in a well-lit area with high foot traffic or a fenced-in lot or parking garage, if available. When parking in a garage, vehicle owners should be mindful to park near the exit or elevator, areas with high visibility and foot traffic, AAA says.

Signs that your fuel tank may have been tampered with include the smell of gasoline, a puddle under your vehicle, or a lit check engine light. AAA recommends that anyone who suspects their gas was stolen file a police report and contact their vehicle insurance company to check if the repairs are covered.

George Takei tries to mock gun owners and inadvertently makes the case for owning an AR-15,"Liberal actor George Takei tried to mock gun owners, but many on social media noted that he had inadvertently made the argument in support of AR-15 ownership.

Takei made the comment in the wake of the horrific Uvalde elementary school massacre and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Crazy thought, but those 20 million AR-15s now in this country could sure arm a lot of Ukrainians,"" tweeted Takei.

The ""Star Trek"" icon garnered a lot of retweets and likes in support of his supposition, but gun owners and others supporters of the Second Amendment noticed that he had undermined his own argument for gun control.

""In this episode, George Takei learns about the usefulness of an armed populace against foreign or domestic oppression,"" responded journalist Tony Kinnett.

""So...you're saying that a rifle could be used in a self defense situation against a tyrannical government? That's actually brilliant. Only if the Founding Fathers had thought of that, and enshrined it in some sort of document,"" read another response with more than 1k likes.

""Crazy thought, Americans should have the same right and ability to protect themselves that Ukrainians do,"" replied comedian Tim Young.

Not only was Takei's point taken up by conservatives, but some liberals were incensed that he hadn't thought it through.

""Why are people on this site advocating for a flood of untraceable weapons to Ukraine? Do you understand where this will lead?! Let’s not export our unregulated gun violence to other countries,"" read one tweet. ""For f***’s sake.""

Takei has been very vocal about his leftist beliefs and he has previously offended conservatives with his ill considered tweets. In one instance from June 2017 the actor opined that the universe was dealing a lesson in social justice when a lawmaker was treated by a gay nurse after being shot in the heinous baseball field attack on Republicans.

George W. Bush goes mega-viral over Freudian slip that reignited accusations that he is a 'war criminal',"Former President George W. Bush on Wednesday inadvertently described the invasion of Iraq, which happened under his watch, as ""wholly unjustified"" and ""brutal.""

What did Bush say?

The gaffe happened as Bush was speaking in Dallas about the importance of democracy while comparing Ukraine and Russia.

""In contrast, Russian elections are rigged. Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process,"" Bush said. ""The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq — I mean of Ukraine.""



The former president immediately added under his breath, ""Iraq, too — anyway.""

The crowd responded with laughter as Bush attributed his Freudian slip to his old age. Bush is now 75 years old.

The video of Bush's remarks has since been viewed 16 million times, generating tens of thousands of comments online.

What was the reaction?

While the crowd may have laughed away the Freudian confession, others did not laugh.

The remark reignited criticism against Bush, including accusations that he is a ""war criminal,"" the ""worst president of the last 100 years,"" and a ""trash person.""

After all, the 2003 invasion of Iraq — the pretext of which was the repeated assertion by the Bush administration that Iraqi dictator Suddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction — is considered one of America's greatest military blunders.

As the world knows now, Iraq never had WMDs.

The long, drawn-out war led to tens of thousands of deaths among coalition forces, including approximately 4,500 American soldiers, and a civilian death toll that is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

Even worse, the invasion and subsequent overthrow of Hussein's government created a political vacuum and power struggle that eventually allowed terrorist groups, like the Islamic State, to seize power in the 2010s.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-w-bush-freudian-slip-iraq-ukraine,2022-05-19
Restaurant owner puts up sign hammering Biden over inflation and telling his supporters to eat somewhere else,"A restaurant owner in Cartersville, Georgia, decried the policies of the Biden administration with a sign outside his business that also told the president's supporters to eat elsewhere.

A photograph of the sign outside of Appalachian Grill was posted to Reddit, where it quickly went viral.

""If you voted for Brandon's Build Back BS and don't have remorse or regrets I wish you would leave, I don't need your business,"" the note says.

""Your ignorant, naive decision has more than doubled our costs of goods and depleted our labor force by more than triple,"" the sign added. ""If this is what you consider to be building back better I don't care to look at or serve you, nor should any other restaurant!""

The image was widely circulated on Twitter among people who are critical of President Joe Biden.

Many said they would visit the restaurant in order to support the anti-Biden message, while others on the left were angry that the owner would politicize his business.

Some on social media criticized the restaurant owner by pointing out that the business and another he owned had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in coronavirus relief from the federal government.

The frustration with high inflation under the Biden administration has led to even more dire warnings about how Democrats will fare in the upcoming midterm elections.

The Biden administration has tried to blame high prices on everything from the pandemic to greedy meat conglomerates, but polling shows that more Americans blame Biden and his policies for high inflation. More recently, a Biden administration staffer was excoriated for trying to accuse critics of Biden of siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Germany's biggest cities limit water and heat while preparing for energy crisis over Russian gas,"Some of Germany's biggest cities are preparing for an energy crunch this winter by shutting off warm water, limiting heat, and switching off lighting.

The German city of Hanover is attempting to reduce its energy consumption by 15%.

Between Oct. 1 and March 31, Hanover's municipal buildings will not be allowed to be heated to a temperature over 68F. The city has banned the use of mobile air conditioning units and fan heaters.



The citizens of Hanover will be forced to take cold showers at city-run facilities. The German city will cut off hot water in public buildings, swimming pools, and gyms.

""The situation is unpredictable. Every kilowatt hour counts, and protecting critical infrastructure has to be a priority,"" said Hanover Mayor Belit Onay – who is part of the Green party. ""We are facing hard times due to the Russian aggression on Ukraine. And as we see that there's a looming gas shortage, this is a major challenge for municipalities.""

""I think everyone, not only the municipalities — the federal government also, and also every single person in Germany — is needed for this. Everyone has to save energy as much as possible so we can get through the winter,"" Onsay said. ""Otherwise ... in December or January, we will have much bigger problems than lighting or the showers.""

Hanover isn't the only German city limiting energy use.

Last week, the German city of Munich announced that it would turn off spotlights on its town hall. The city also shut off warm water at its municipal offices. Fountains in Germany's third-largest city would be turned off at night.

Nuremberg closed three of its four public indoor swimming pools run by the city.

""Vonovia, the country’s largest residential landlord, said it would be lowering the temperature of its tenants’ gas central heating to 17C (62F) between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.,"" the Financial Times reported. ""A housing association in the Saxon town of Dippoldiswalde, near the Czech border, went a step further this week, saying it was rationing the supply of hot water to tenants. From now on, they can only take hot showers between 4 a.m. - 8 a.m., 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.""

The district of Lahn-Dill, near Frankfurt, turned off hot water in its 86 schools and 60 gyms until mid-September.

Last week, Berlin's senate voted to turn off the lighting of 200 monuments, buildings, and landmarks in the German capital of more than 3.5 million people to save electricity.

""In April, Berlin had announced measures to keep its outdoor swimming pools at two degrees below the weather-dependent standard temperature throughout the summer season,"" The Guardian reported.



Bettina Jarasch – Berlin’s senator for the environment – said, ""In the face of the war against Ukraine and Russia’s energy threats it is vital that we handle our energy as carefully as possible.""

Germany is one of the countries most heavily dependent on Russian energy.

In 2021, 34% of Germany's crude oil came from Russia and 53% of coal imported into Germany was shipped from Russia. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Germany received 55% of its natural gas from Russia, according to the New York Times.

Last week, Russian gas giant Gazprom PJSC declared that it would limit natural gas shipped through the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany down to 20% of capacity, Bloomberg reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/germany-cities-energy-crisis-russia-gas,2022-07-31
Germany seeks to rebuild its defensive forces with Iron Dome style missile defense systems,"Germany is moving to strengthen its defensive forces in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Bloomberg reported that the formerly demilitarized nation is planning to buy a missile defense system as it moves to modernize its military.

The German government is reportedly considering options that include the American manufactured THAAD missile shield and the Israeli-made Arrow 3 system.

This past week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz — the successor to Angela Merkel — discussed the modernization of Germany’s military with German Chief of Staff Eberhard Zorn. Subsequently, the German government earmarked $110 billion (100 billion euros) for additional defense spending.

Currently, Germany only has 12 Patriot anti-rocket units that are unable to provide the country with comprehensive defense.

The revolutionary, Israeli missile defense system — known as the Iron Dome — is reported to likely cost less than 2 billion euros and according to Marcus Faber, a member of the Free Democratic Party in the German parliament, production on such a system could begin immediately.

Faber indicated that no final decision about what missile defense system to use has yet been reached by the German government.

Germany isn’t the only country after Iron Dome technology in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.

In late March, while addressing the Israeli Knesset, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew comparisons between the ongoing Russian invasion of his country to Nazi Germany’s attempts to exterminate the Jewish people, reported Reuters.

In doing so, Zelenskyy insisted that the Israeli government had an obligation to share its Iron Dome technology with Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said, “Everybody knows that your missile defense systems are the best, and you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews.”

Zelenskyy went on to question Israel’s commitment to reaching a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine since the country’s leadership opts to remain neutral.

“We can ask why we can’t receive weapons from you, why Israel has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business,” Zelenskyy said. “Either way, the choice is yours to make, brothers and sisters, and you must then live with your answer.”

According to the German news network n-tv, installing Iron Dome defense systems would enable Germany to proactively defend itself and a number of other nearby countries.

N-tv said, “The radar devices are so powerful that the protective shield could also cover Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States.”

"Germany suspends critical oil pipeline with Russia, triggering astronomical threat by Russia","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Tuesday that his country has stopped the certification process of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline after Russian troops moved into Ukrainian territories.

""The situation now is fundamentally different,"" Scholz said, explaining that he needed to ""send a clear signal to Moscow that such actions won’t remain without consequences.""

Why does this matter?

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was not yet functional, has been a hotly contested pipeline in European affairs. The pipeline would permit Russian oil to flow directly to Germany, thereby depriving Ukraine of billions of dollars in oil-transit taxes. The pipeline would also increase Russia's geopolitical influence in Europe, an undesirable prospect for Western allies considering that Germany is already reliant upon Russian oil.

Thus, Scholz's announcement means Germany is serious about causing Russia economic harm, which in theory could deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from moving forward with plans for a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. But it remains to be seen whether a temporary setback of the Nord Stream 2 would convince Putin to back down.

What was the reaction?

Russia responded by threatening to significantly raise energy prices, underscoring Europe's dependence on cheaper Russian energy supply and Russia's desperation for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to become operational.

""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has issued an order to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Well. Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2.000 for 1.000 cubic meters of natural gas!"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council and former Russian president, said.

To give an idea of the scope of Medvedev's threat, natural gas in the U.S. was $7.03 per 1,000 cubic feet last November, according to the most recent government data. Raising energy prices to that extent, then, would be a double-edged sword; while it would likely send Europe into an energy crisis, it would also damage Russia's economy, which is reliant upon oil export revenues.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba celebrated Germany's announcement.

""I welcome Germany’s move to suspend the certification of Nord Stream 2. This is a morally, politically and practically correct step in the current circumstances,"" Kuleba said. ""True leadership means tough decisions in difficult times. Germany’s move proves just that.""

Still, Richard Grenell, the former U.S. ambassador to Germany, explained why Scholz's announcement is but a small victory, noting the certification process for Nord Stream 2 was only temporarily halted.

""This is purely TEMPORARY. And is entirely too late,"" Grenell said.

What about President Biden?

Just last year, President Joe Biden lifted sanctions on the company behind the pipeline project, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its chief executive, Matthias Warnig, who is reportedly a close Putin ally.

Although the move essentially approved the completion of the pipeline, the Biden administration reportedly lifted the sanctions in an effort to improve relations with Germany. The sanctions had been implemented by former President Donald Trump.

Just two weeks ago, Biden promised the U.S. ""will bring an end"" to the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the Biden administration will announce its ""own measures"" later Tuesday, but did not immediately offer details about any forthcoming sanctions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/germany-suspends-critical-oil-pipeline-with-russia-triggering-astronomical-threat-by-russia,2022-02-22
Invasive giant lizards concerning Georgia wildlife officials,"The Argentine black and white tegu, also known as the Argentine giant tegu, is a lizard species that can grow up to four feet long. The invasive lizards native to South America have been spreading in Georgia and Florida. Wildlife officials are concerned about the lizards because of their insatiable diet.

The Argentine black and white tegu is native to tropical rain forests, savannas, and semi-deserts of eastern and central South America. These animals were brought to the U.S. as pets because they are extremely intelligent and can even be housebroken.

The large lizards have found their way into the wild in Florida and Georgia. Now, wildlife officials in the Southeast are concerned that these invasive lizards are threatening other species.

Florida's state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said that the Argentine giant tegu has been spotted all over the state starting in 2006, and have since established populations in South and Central Florida.

In Georgia, the lizards have established populations in Tattnall and Toombs counties. Wildlife officials said the lizards, which can live for 20 years, have been spotted for three straight years, meaning that they can survive the cold of Georgia's winter.

""Releasing it into the wild is the absolute worst thing to do,"" said Georgia Department of Natural Resources biologist John Jensen. ""It will affect our native species and we can't have that.""



Please tell me these things eat murder hornets. Tegus are omnivores that have sharp teeth and a strong bite. They eat insects, spiders, snails, small birds, eggs from reptiles and birds, seeds, and fruit.

""They eat just about anything they want, plant and animal matter, and one of their favorite foods are eggs from ground nesting animals such as gopher tortoises, our protected state reptile,"" Jensen said.

First murder hornets, then gypsy moths, now giant lizards. What will be next? An invasion of poisonous frogs? Maybe killer bears?

Have You Seen Tegus in the Wild in Georgia? www.youtube.com

""Established from escaped or released pets, these large lizards are voracious predators that have been found consuming a variety of native wildlife in the longer-established Florida populations,"" according to the Orianne Society, a group dedicated to the conservation of reptiles and amphibians.



Jensen added that the lizards could take over the homes of burrowing animals, such as gopher tortoises.

""We're trying to remove them from the wild because they can have negative impacts on our native species,"" Jensen said in a YouTube video warning of the dangers of the invasive lizard.

Jensen encouraged Georgians who spot the lizard to take a photo and report any tegu sightings online.

""If you're able to safely and humanely dispatch of the animal, we encourage that and we want that information, too,"" Jensen said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/giant-lizard-georgia-invasive,2020-05-14
Economic experts expect the global economy to worsen,"Global stock markets are expected to continue hemorrhaging money as more heavy selling continues this summer while central banks around the world hike interest rates to try and combat spiraling inflation.

Brunello Rosa, the CEO and head of research at the financial consultant firm Rosa & Roubini, believes that central banks around the world are going to continue monetary tightening while markets continue to spiral downward, CNBC reported.

Rosa said, “Now it’s time for a reappreciation of the economic fundamentals around the world in terms of growth. It’s hard for markets to be totally optimistic when inflation is going up, growth is going down, and interest rates are rising fast across the globe.”

This past Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,000 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 5%. This 5% decrease erased all the gains from a short-lived rally the day before when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would be raising interest rates. The short-lived rally was spurred on by investor optimism that the Federal Reserve hadn’t implemented a larger rate hike, but this optimism quickly gave way to fears of subsequent smaller rate hikes throughout the coming months.

Rosa suggested that investors initially were optimistic about the news of a 75 basis point hike being off the table but that the fact that there remains a strong possibility of several 50 basis point increases throughout the next months spooked investors.

Rosa said, “It’s clear that all of them [central banks] are talking tough at this stage. But the reality is that lots of tightening will eventually lead to economic contraction.”

He also suggested that most European governments and the U.S. are naïve to continue suggesting that economic shrinkage is avoidable.

He said, “In the eurozone and in the U.S. they are nowhere near realizing that actually there will be some form of contraction of economic activity.”

Rosa said that he expects the Russian invasion in Ukraine to last far longer than many investors are anticipating, which will continue to exasperate ongoing supply chain disruptions and inflation while adding fuel to the fire of rising interest rates.

Stoxx 600, a pan-European market index, fell 1% on Friday morning on the heels of Wall Street’s Thursday sell-off. Stoxx 600 is down more than 11% so far this year.

"Good news: a species of giant, invasive, parachuting spiders is expected to blanket the east coast","According to experts, the Joro — a 3-inch invasive spider species from Japan — will likely soon blanket the entire east coast of the United States.

Joros were originally spotted in the United States in Georgia, and it is unknown how the species first made its way here; however, most experts guess that it likely arrived stowed away inside a shipping container. The spider is much larger than the average spider, commonly reaching up to 3 inches in diameter, and can float around in the air using a parachute made from its webbing material.

The species has largely been contained to the southeastern portion of the United States since its arrival; however, researchers now believe that the spider is much more resistant to cold temperatures than previously believed, and thus find it likely that the spider will soon proliferate at least throughout the eastern seaboard, given the lack of natural predators here in the states and the ease with which the spider travels.

However, while the size and parachuting behavior may be alarming to arachnophobes, scientists say that, like most spiders, the Joro is almost completely harmless to humans and will help to control the population of biting insects.

""Its fangs are so small relative to most human skin that it probably won’t be able to get its fangs into you even if it wanted to,"" said Benjamin Frick, one of the co-authors of a recent study on Joros. Additionally, Joros generally seek to evade contact with humans and do not exhibit aggressive behavior towards them. Although Frick noted that the spiders are technically venomous, their venom is extremely mild and a bite would likely hurt ""less than a wasp sting"" in the unlikely event that you end up being bitten by one.

Despite their alarming appearance, Joros appear to not have any harmful effects on the foliage or wildlife here in the United States, and researchers advise people to get used to the sight of them. ""People should try to learn to live with them,"" said Andy Davis, one of the study's other co-authors. ""If they're literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they're just going to be back next year.""

As noted in this video from the University of Georgia, the Joro spider is likely here to stay:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/good-news-a-species-of-giant-invasive-parachuting-spiders-is-expected-to-blanket-the-east-coast,2022-03-05
Good news America: Scientists found the first ever 'murder hornet' nest in the U.S. and will destroy it,"Weeks of searching have finally paid off as scientists in Washington state located the first Asian giant hornet nest in the United States.

The Washington state Department of Agriculture confirmed on Friday that the nest of ""murder hornets"" was discovered in a tree on a property east of Blaine, Washington, in Whatcom County, KOMO News reports. The nest was found after entomologists captured one of the hornets and equipped it with a radio tag to follow it back to the nest.

The entomologists intend to destroy the nest on Saturday in an effort to eradicate the invasive species before they have chance to spread their reign of terror first throughout Washington and then the rest of the United States.

Officials told KOMO that the successful discovery of the nest came after a trapper captured two live Asian giant hornets on Wednesday using a new kind of trap the state agency deployed in the area.

Two more living hornets were found in another trap on Thursday morning, when scientists returned to attach a radio tracker to the first hornet. All three were outfitted with the transmitters and one of them led entomologists back to its nest Friday.

Video from the Washington Department of Agriculture shows the massive deadly hornets, which can grow as big as 2 inches long, entering and exiting their nest.



More from KOMO:

The nest is inside the cavity of a tree located on private property near an area cleared for a residential home. While Asian giant hornets normally nest in the ground, they are occasionally found nesting in dead trees. Dozens of the hornets were seen entering and exiting the tree.



The discovery of the nest follows two previous unsuccessful attempts to live-track hornets captured in the same immediate area just south of the Canadian border. It's believed there may be at least one other murder hornet nest in the same area of Whatcom County.



The first confirmed detection of an Asian giant hornet in Washington state was made in December 2019 and the first hornet was caught in July after agents spent months placing traps in the area. Several more were subsequently caught, all in Whatcom County.

Beekeepers in Washington have lived in terror of the invasive giant hornets since their discovery was first reported in Washington state in late 2019. The hornets prey on honey bees, using their lethal mandibles to decapitate up to 40 bees per minute, devastating colonies and ruining the fortunes of beekeepers.

Their sting is also deadly to humans. Over just three months in 2013, Asian giant hornets killed 42 people and injured 1,675 more in China. The hornets kill about 50 people annually in Japan.

Scientists believe there is at least one other nest somewhere in Whatcom County.

Who knows where else they might be in America?

Google ordered to pay $43 million by Australian court for misleading users,"Australia's Federal Court has ordered Google to pay A$60 million ($42.7 million) in penalties for misleading users on collection of their personal location data, reports Reuters.

The court found Google breached Australia’s Consumer Law between January 2017 and December 2018 by misleading customers about location data collected through their Android devices.

The court previously found that Google had breached the Australian Consumer Law by representing to some Android users that a setting titled “Location History” was the only setting that affected whether Google used personally identifiable data about a user’s location. However, another Google account setting — “Web & App Activity” — also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data, according to Australia’s Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC.)

The ACCC initiated proceedings against Google and its Australia subsidiary in October 2019. An estimated 1.3 million people with Google accounts in Australia may have ""viewed a screen found by the Court to have breached the Australian Consumer Law,"" the ACCC said in a statement.

“This significant penalty imposed by the Court today sends a strong message to digital platforms and other businesses, large and small, that they must not mislead consumers about how their data is being collected and used,” said ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb.

“Personal location data is sensitive and important to some consumers, and some of the users who saw the representations may have made different choices about the collection, storage and use of their location data if the misleading representations had not been made by Google,” Cass-Gottlieb added.

Google confirmed that the company agreed to the settlement.

“We’ve invested heavily in making location information simple to manage and easy to understand with industry-first tools like auto-delete controls, while significantly minimizing the amount of data stored. As we’ve demonstrated, we’re committed to making ongoing updates that give users control and transparency, while providing the most helpful products possible,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

This ruling comes as Google faces increasing scrutiny around the world. In June, European consumer rights groups accused Google of deceptive design around the account creation process. The groups argue that Google’s design coaxes users into agreeing to invasive processing of their data.

And earlier this year, Google was sued by attorneys general in Indiana, Texas, Washington state and Washington, DC over its use of location data.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-ordered-to-pay-43-million-by-australian-court-for-misleading-users,2022-08-13
Republican senators demand Biden send fighter jets to Ukraine: 'Enough talk. People are dying.',"A group of Republican Senators demanded that President Joe Biden follow through with a Polish plan to supply fighter jets to Ukraine as they try to fend off an invasion by Russia.

Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Joni Ernst of Iowa joined 40 other Republican senators who signed a letter calling on Biden to expedite the transfer of jets in order to ""prevent a brutal and unlawful takeover of Ukraine.""

The debacle began when the U.S. encouraged NATO allies to supply Ukraine with fighter jets and said that they were working with Poland to do just that. Poland surprised the U.S. with a plan to deliver a fleet of MIG-29 jets to the U.S. in the hopes they would deliver them to Ukraine. The Biden administration balked at the plan and then rejected the idea altogether.

“We need to be careful about every decision we make so that we aren’t making the potential for escalation worse,” explained Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby Wednesday.

Romney and Ernst decried the refusal in a media briefing Thursday.

""We had a hearing this morning with the Foreign Relations Committee. Chairman Menendez said the same thing, Senator Shaheen said the same thing. Democrats are saying the same thing: Send these MiGs. And the question is, why aren’t they being sent?"" asked Romney.

The administration faced vociferous criticism from both sides of the aisle over the failure to orchestrate the handoff.

""Enough talk. People are dying. Send them the planes that they need. They say they need MiGs. People say, well maybe that’s not the ideal weapon for them. That is what they say they want. They are there. They have the eyes to determine what they want,"" Romney continued.

""They want MiGs,"" he concluded. ""Get them the MiGs.""

GOP launches voter registration drive at gas stations as fuel prices reach historic highs: 'Biden and the Democrats do not care',"Are you upset about historic gas prices under President Joe Biden? If so, the Republican National Committee hopes you join the party — at the very location of your gas price-related frustration.

What is the RNC doing?

The RNC is capitalizing on historic fuel prices by launching a new voter registration program targeting gas stations nationwide.

Over the weekend, the RNC held voter registration drives at gas stations in Arizona. The party will expand its campaign to other states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin in the coming weeks, The Hill reported.

""Under Joe Biden, families are paying more for gas than ever before,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.

""After killing American energy independence, Biden is turning to our adversaries abroad for America’s energy needs,"" she added. ""American families are feeling the pain at the pump, and Biden and the Democrats do not care and are making it worse.""

Gas prices hit a historic high on March 11 when the average price of gas in America reached $4.33 per gallon. The price has dropped about 10 cents from its high to $4.24 per gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA.

Gas prices have climbed for two years straight after reaching historic lows at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average price of gas in 2020 — former President Donald Trump's last year in office — was $2.18 per gallon. Prices rose under Biden to an average $3.02 per gallon in 2021.

What is the background?

Whether or not Biden's administration is fully to blame for historic gas prices, the narrative from the administration is certainly playing into the hands of Republicans.

Case in point: The administration has abdicated any responsibility for historic fuel prices, looking toward anyone and everything else to blame for economic woes.

Last year, Biden blamed growing economic problems — like inflation and high gas prices — on the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain problems. Now, the administration is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, some Democrats are even targeting oil companies, while climate groups hope Democrats exploit the moment to further demonize the oil industry as greedy profiteers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gop-launches-voter-registration-drive-at-gas-stations,2022-03-22
Gov. Greg Abbott declares an 'invasion' at the southern border,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared an ""invasion"" at the southern border on Tuesday and indicated that he would be taking a series of ""unprecedented measures ... to keep our state & country safe.""

What are the details?

On Monday, Abbott wrote a letter to county judges along the Texas-Mexico border, claiming, ""President Biden has abandoned his responsibility to enforce immigration laws, and Congress has refused to hold the President accountable and has abandoned its own responsibility to use the immigration power given to it in Article I, § 8 of the U.S. Constitution.""

The Republican governor invoked Article 4, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution, which states that the governor ""shall have power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the State, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions.""

Accordingly, Abbott stated that he would use his constitutional authority, as well as other authorization and executive orders, to:

""Deploy the National Guard to safeguard our border & to repel & turn back immigrants trying to cross the border illegally"";

""Deploy the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) to arrest & return the border immigrants who crossed illegally & deploy DPS to arrest illegal immigrants for criminal activity"";

""Build a border wall in multiple counties on the border"";

""Deploy gun boats to secure the border"";

""Designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations"";

""Enter into a compact with other states to secure the border"";

""Enter into agreements with foreign powers to enhance border security""; and

""Provide resources for border counties to increase their efforts to respond to the border invasion.""

On Tuesday, Abbott announced via social media that he had ""invoked the Invasion Clauses of the U.S. & Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.""

This announcement came just hours after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told the House Committee on Homeland Security that the border was secure.

Fox News reported that FBI Director Christopher Wray painted a different picture of the situation at the border than had Mayorkas, saying on Tuesday: ""What I would say is that we see significant criminal threats coming from south of the border — whether it's guns, drugs, money, violence.""

Hopkins County declared first

Abbott's public, statewide declaration of an invasion was both preceded and implored by citizens of Hopkins County, Texas.

KETK reported that the Hopkins County commissioners court approved the declaration of a local state of disaster in the county on Monday.

The declaration stated that the ""health, safety and welfare of Hopkins County residents are under an imminent threat of disaster from the unprecedented levels of illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling coming across the U.S. border from Mexico.""

The Hopkins County declaration said the ""ongoing immigration crisis on the Texas border is not acceptable and has resulted in a security threat and humanitarian disaster with overwhelming consequences to the residents of Hopkins County.""

Over 2.76 million illegal aliens stole over the southern border into the United States during fiscal year 2022.

So far this year, there have been 1,142 criminal noncitizens convicted of assault; 1,614 convicted of driving under the influence; 62 convicted of homicide; 365 convicted of sexual offenses; and thousands more convicted of other crimes.

The Hopkins County declaration requested that Abbott, ""as Commander-in-Chief of the military forces of the State, declare the existence of an invasion on its border with Mexico and take necessary actions to preserve and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Texas.""



Abbott did just that.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gov-greg-abbott-declares-an-invasion-at-the-southern-border,2022-11-15
"Granddad shoots one of two armed home invaders in ill-fated heist — and victim's granddaughter came up with idea for the crime, cops say","The good news? A 65-year-old Florida homeowner successfully fought back against two armed home invaders Thursday morning — managing to turn the tables on the pair by using his own gun and shooting one of them before they took off from his Pensacola residence, WKRG-TV reported.

The bad news? The victim's granddaughter came up with the idea for the ill-fated heist, authorities told the station.

What are the details?

Cynthia Register and her friends were trying to come up with bail money for another friend when Register said her grandfather had some, the station said — and then they hatched a plan to rob Register's grandfather, WKRG reported.

So just before 4 a.m. Tayari Crear and Jemarquz Cromwell entered the home of Register's grandfather in the 7300 block of West Jackson Street.



Escambia County Sheriff Chip Simmons offered a bit of a play by play on what happened next.

""Mind you Cynthia Register, granddaughter, does not go in the house. Why? Because she knows that Grampa has a gun. So she decides to stay outside,"" Simmons said. ""But she allows Tayari Crear and Jemarquz Cromwell to enter the home. And granddaughter was right. Granddaddy did have a gun. He did use the gun because he was being burglarized. So Granddaddy shot Cromwell in the chest area, and then they fled the home.""



Then what happened?

Crear and Cromwell climbed in a vehicle and drove off, but they wrecked the car a few blocks away, the sheriff's office said.

Then another vehicle pulled up to the crash site and drove away with both suspects, authorities said, adding that the two suspects were dropped off at a local hospital where they were met by deputies. Natalie Gagne was the driver who picked up Crear and Cromwell after they wrecked their vehicle, the sheriff's office said.

Graphic bodycam footage captures moment wounded Bristol officer blasted suspected cop killer,"On October 12, in Bristol, Connecticut, police officers responding to a fake domestic violence call were met by a hail of bullets in what is now believed to have been an ambush. Two officers were killed in the attack. A third was wounded. Newly released bodycam footage shows that, amid screams and under fire, the injured officer coolly circled back to restore order with a well-placed shot.

The state inspector general's office released Officer Alec Iurato's bodycam footage on Saturday.

The other two officers who were slain in the ambush, 35-year-old Sergeant Dustin DeMonte and 34-year-old Officer Alex Hamzy, similarly wore bodycams, but that footage will not be disclosed at this time, as doing so would reportedly ""constitute an unwarranted invasion"" of their privacy.

According to the inspector general's report, DeMonte, Hamzy, and Iurato responded to 310 Redstone Hill Road. The 911 call that prompted their presence was allegedly made by Nicholas Brutcher, the 35-year-old suspected cop killer.

WNBC reported that sometime prior to the incident, Brutcher had been thrown out of an establishment for being disorderly and issued a summons by police. He allegedly returned home, armed himself with a semiautomatic rifle, and made the fraudulent 911 call.

When Bristol police arrived on the scene, they went to the side door of the house. There they spoke to Nathan Brutcher, the suspect's 32-year-old brother. When they ordered Nathan to show his hands and step outside, his brother, lurking behind, allegedly opened fire.

In the ensuing gunfight, Brutcher reportedly fired over 80 rounds at police, fatally striking DeMonte and Hamzy, and wounding Iurato in the leg. Nathan Brutcher was also injured.

The bodycam footage shared by the inspector general's office revealed what happened next from Iurato's perspective.

Iurato announced over his radio, ""Shots fired, shots fired. Send everyone.""

Ostensibly fighting to maintain his balance in light of his leg wound, Iurato then noted, ""Officers shot.""

In the video, a woman's cries can be heard, punctuated by additional gunshots.

The wounded officer limped around the front of the house and to cover behind a Bristol Police Department cruiser.

Iurato passed alongside one vehicle and beside another. Against the driver's door of a second cruiser parked in front, closer to the sound of the screams and shooting, he peered over the top of the vehicle.

Around 1:45 in the video, an agonized female voice cries out, ""He's dead."" A distant male voice responds with what may have been taunting.

Having spotted Brutcher, Iurato took aim. With a single shot, he made forever sure the suspect would never take another.

Illuminating the suspect's corpse with his flashlight, the wounded officer provided an update over radio: ""One down. Suspect down.""

Bristol Final youtu.be

Although multiple agencies, including the Connecticut State Police Central District Major Crime Squad and the New Britain Judicial District state's attorney's office, are investigating the officer-involved shooting, the inspector general's release nevertheless noted that ""it is evident from the evidence collected so far that Officer Iurato's use of deadly force was justified.""

One witness, Ken Przygocki, told Channel 3, ""I probably heard 12 to 15 bangs, looked around about a minute later, [then heard] another rapid fire and then one single shot.""

Przygocki spoke to the ultimate sacrifice made by the police killed in the incident: ""Words can't explain it. These guys protect us. ... They know every day you got out there life or death.""

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong tweeted: ""Today is a tragic day for our state, for the Bristol community, and for the families of Sgt. Demonte and Officer Hamzy who died as heroes responding bravely to the most dangerous and volatile of emergency calls.""

At the vigil held last week for DeMonte and Hamzy, Bristol Police Chief Brian Gould stated, ""They were incredible, remarkable men. ... They showed up, they answered the call of service. They thought they were going somewhere to give help and their lives were needlessly taken and another seriously injured.”

DeMonte is survived by a wife and two young children. Hamzy was reportedly planning to celebrate his first wedding anniversary on October 14.

Officer Iurato survived his injury and was released from St. Francis Hospital on Thursday. Outside, he was greeted by applause from members of law enforcement.

Great Barrier Reef records highest coral cover,"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is flourishing despite previous reports sounding the alarm about the looming extinction of Australia's natural wonder.

According to new findings reported on Thursday, a majority of the thriving Great Barrier Reef boasted the highest coral cover ever recorded. Two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef had the largest amount of coral cover in the 36 years that it has been monitored.

The northern and central areas of the Great Barrier reef experienced growth, according to surveys conducted between August 2021 and May 2022 by the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. The northern section soared from an all-time low of 13% coral coverage in 2017 to 36% in the most recent report. The central region jumped from a low of 12% in 2019 to 33% coverage in the latest AIMS annual report.

The coral coverage in the southern section fell by 4% – from 38% in the previous year to 34% in the latest report. The environmental experts believe the decrease stems from outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish.

AIMS considers a hard coral cover of more than 30% as ""high value.""

AIMS CEO Paul Hardisty downplayed the positive news in a statement: ""This shows how vulnerable the Reef is to the continued acute and severe disturbances that are occurring more often and are longer-lasting.""

“Every summer the Reef is at risk of temperature stress, bleaching and potentially mortality and our understanding of how the ecosystem responds to that is still developing,"" Hardisty said.

""What we're seeing is that the Great Barrier Reef is still a resilient system. It still maintains that ability to recover from disturbances,"" AIMS Long-Term Monitoring Program leader Mike Emslie told Reuters, but he cautioned, ""But the worrying thing is that the frequency of these disturbance events are increasing, particularly the mass coral bleaching events.""

For nearly 40 years, AIMS has examined the status of the Great Barrier Reef through its Long-Term Monitoring Program – which claims to have conducted the ""most comprehensive and extensive record of coral status on any reef ecosystem in the world."" Each year, marine scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences survey between 80 and 130 reefs on the GBR.



Despite the promising report from the respected environmental organization, it wasn't long ago that there were experts claiming that the Great Barrier Reef could soon die off completely.



The New York Times has published several articles foretelling doomsday scenarios for the Great Barrier Reef.

In December 2016, the Times ran an article titled: ""The Great and Dying Barrier Reef.""

In March 2017, the outlet said, ""Large Sections of Australia's Great Reef Are Now Dead.""

In April 2018, the New York Times published an article titled: ""Damage to Great Barrier Reef From Global Warming Is Irreversible, Scientists Say.""

The Washington Post also claimed that climate change was killing the Great Barrier Reef, and it ""might never recover.""

In April 2019, the paper declared, ""The Great Barrier Reef is being battered by climate change, it might only get worse.""

In October 2020, the Washington Post published an article titled: ""Half of the Great Barrier Reef's coral is gone. It might never recover.""

Just in March, the Washington Post reported, ""Climate warming deals yet another blow to the Great Barrier.""

PBS News Hour featured a segment in March 2017 titled: ""Climate change is killing the Great Barrier Reef.""

In November 2020, Business Insider asserted, ""Experts say the time to take action is now, and if nothing is done, this world wonder as we know it today could be gone by 2050.""

The website Outside wrote an obituary for the Great Barrier Reef in October 2016.

In March, UNESCO considered labeling the Reef as ""in danger"" after the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority reported ""low to moderate bleaching"" of the natural wonder. UNESCO confirmed that two scientists would examine the Reef for 10 days, according to The Guardian.

A World Heritage Committee meeting on determining the status of the Great Barrier Reef was scheduled to happen in June in Russia, but it was postponed after the invasion of Ukraine.

Ground beef and chicken prices reach all-time highs just before Memorial Day,"Ground beef and chicken breasts are more expensive than ever before and with all-time high prices that leave consumers with few alternatives some people may experience a meatless Memorial Day this upcoming Monday.

Bloomberg reported that ground beef and chicken are now retailing at historic highs of just under $5 per pound and over $4 per pound respectively. With Memorial Day serving as the unofficial start to the outdoor grilling season some grill enthusiasts might opt to order pizzas for the holiday instead.

The price spikes in meat come as inflation, in general, continues to spiral out of control, but in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine agricultural products are experiencing additional price hikes. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stalled crop exports in the Black Sea which has increased the global costs of animal feed.

Even the price for propane — which is essential for many grill owners to cook meat — has soared.

Michal Nepveux, a senior analyst of animal protein commodities at the risk-management firm Stable USA, said, “The inflationary environment is starting to take its toll. Instead of steak or chicken, we might have pasta or a pizza.”

The seemingly unending rise in inflation is having a considerable impact on how many Americans feel about President Joe Biden’s job performance.

According to a recent poll published by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research only 39% of adults in the U.S. approve of Biden’s performance as president.

Overall, only about two in ten adults believe the U.S. is headed in the right direction or that the economy is in a good condition. As Americans grow increasingly frustrated with record high gas prices and historic levels of inflation, Biden’s approval continues to plummet. Notably, his approval among Democrats is also starting to slip.

Biden’s approval among registered Democrats currently sits at 73% which is down from 82% last year.

Only 18% of Americans believe that Biden’s policies have helped the economy more than they have hurt it.

Small business owners — who employ large swaths of the American population — are also feeling increasingly pessimistic about the economy. 57% of small business owners said that they predicted the U.S. economy will continue to worsen into the next year.

As inflation continues to cut into the profit margins of small businesses, the number of small business owners that are expecting their revenues to increase in the coming year dropped to 61% marking a steep decline from May 2020’s level of 79%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ground-beef-and-chicken-prices-reach-all-time-highs-just-before-memorial-day,2022-05-28
"Group of men kick in front door in middle of night. But homeowner fires his gun, and they flee — except for one who gets shot, hospitalized.","A suspected home intruder is recovering in the hospital after the owner of a Katy, Texas, residence shot him early Friday morning, KTRK-TV reported.

What happened?



The sheriff's office said a group of men kicked in the front door of the home in the 18700 block Sandelford Drive around 3:35 a.m.

The homeowner — who didn't know the men — fired a handgun at one of the suspects who exchanged gunfire with the homeowner, the sheriff's office told TheBlaze.

While two or three of the suspects fled the scene in an unknown vehicle, cops arriving to the house said they found a 21-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the arm.

Emergency medical services transported the man to a hospital. KTRK said he was in stable condition.

The sheriff's office told TheBlaze that charges are pending against the wounded suspect and that the names of his accomplices also are under investigation.

But their roommate had a gun — and other ideas.



One unit resident, who didn't want to be identified, told the station his roommate shot the intruder who was ""literally sticking his arm inside"" the apartment.

Police confirmed that a unit resident shot the intruder to stop the burglary, WMC reported.

The roommate who pulled the trigger has a permit for the gun, the resident added to the station.

Apparently it wasn't an atypical scenario, as another apartment complex resident told the station he's heard ""a lot of gunshots"" in the area.

What happened to the suspect?

The wounded suspect was taken to a hospital where WMC reported he was in ""extremely critical condition.""

A reporter for the station said she observed a maintenance worker nailing wooden planks on the unit's door and window — and washing blood off the walkway.

Gunman caught on camera firing into home amid break-in attempt. But homeowner has a gun as well — and wins shootout.,"A California homeowner's surveillance video cameras outside his residence underscore the stark truth: One never knows when a gun will come in handy.

What are the details?

One of the video cameras next to the front door of the Hesperia home showed a man approaching the door and then repeatedly kicking it. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it all commenced around 3:30 a.m. Monday, KTTV-TV reported.

The homeowner told the station he and his wife woke up to the pounding — and also heard the man demanding to be let in.

""I run to the front door to see who it is,"" the homeowner later told KTTV, ""and then I see him ... and he's trying to kick the door in, demanding to come in, and then I see him pull out a gun.""

The homeowner told the station at that point he retreated, got his own gun, put his wife and child in a closet, and then went back to the front door, where he said he saw the man ""aiming"" his gun at the door.

Then a 45-second shootout commenced, the homeowner told KTTV, with shots being fired by both individuals on either side of the front door.

The homeowner said in another portion of KTTV's video that it appeared the man also shot at another neighbor's house amid his getaway.



What happened next?

No one was injured, KTTV reported, and authorities arrived about five minutes after the shootout and eventually tracked down and arrested 39-year-old Erick Contreras.

Turns out Contreras is a neighbor who lives only a few doors from the homeowner, KABC-TV reported, adding that the homeowner said he didn't know the gunman or have any previous interaction with him.

The homeowner's residence was left with bullet holes in the walls and doors, KABC noted.

The homeowner was armed with a 9mm gun, the station reported and said based on the bullet casings, it appeared the intruder had a .22.

"Gunman kicks down door, charges at homeowner — who's also armed. It doesn't end well for gunman.","A Florida gunman kicked down a door at a Land O' Lakes home Saturday afternoon — apparently angry at a family for supporting and protecting his estranged wife amid divorce proceedings — but the gunman was met by the homeowner, who also was armed, WTSP-TV reported.

What happened next?

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the gunman — 55-year-old Ronald Fleet — exchanged fire with the homeowner and then exited the home, the station said.

But Fleet then ""starts charging"" back into the house, Nocco told WTSP, after which the homeowner fatally shot him.

Deputies responded around 12:30 p.m. to the home in the Sunset Lakes subdivision, where Fleet was pronounced dead, the station said.

""He was defending himself and his family,"" Nocco said of the homeowner. ""Any loss of life is tragic, but the victim was utilizing his Second Amendment rights to protect himself and his family from the fear of Ronald who was carrying a gun, kicking in a door, trying to harm them. I can't imagine the fear that they were going through, but I'm very happy [about] the fact that he was able to defend himself ...""

The sheriff added that Fleet was carrying a .380 caliber handgun and that the state attorney's office will review the case.

Nocco also said Fleet's estranged wife was trying to get out of a ""horrific marriage."" Records show Fleet had prior arrests for domestic battery and driving under the influence, WTSP reported.

'I do not want to think what would have happened'

Nocco in his video statement underscored how crucial it was that the homeowner was armed and able to protect himself and his family.

""It was because of his rights, his ability to defend himself and his family, that [his] family is OK and safe,"" the sheriff said. ""Because I do not want to think what would have happened if they were unarmed, [Fleet] got in the house with that gun, and what he would have done to that family.""

Hershey warns of Halloween candy shortage,"The Hershey Company – the fifth-biggest candy company in the world in 2021 – is sounding the alarm that they will experience a Halloween candy shortage this year.

The Hershey Company warned that it would not be able to supply enough candy for Halloween and the Christmas holiday season. The candy company blamed a scarcity of raw ingredients on the insufficient supply.

Reuters reported, ""Pandemic-induced global supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war have crunched supplies of cocoa, edible oil, and other food ingredients, pinching production lines of packaged food companies around the world.""

Hershey Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said on Thursday, ""We will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints.""

Buck said that the company sources a great deal of its equipment and supplies from Europe – which has faced an economic downturn because of its reliance on energy from Russia. The invasion of Ukraine has also put a strain on getting products such as cocoa and edible oil.

Buck also noted that despite the candy shortage, the company expects sales to top last year still.



""Historically, Hershey's sales growth has been driven by higher prices and not necessarily volume ... The company is entering this period from a position of strength with that expertise,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.



The Hershey Company saw its net sales rise more than 19% in the second quarter – raking in $2.37 billion compared to estimates of $2.22 billion.

The Halloween season is Hershey's best-selling time of the year – comprising approximately 10% of the company's annual sales.

The 128-year-old company manufactures some of the most beloved Halloween candy – including Hershey's Chocolate Bars, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Kit Kats, Mounds, Good & Plenty, Bubble Yum, Twizzlers, Jolly Ranchers, Whatchamacallits, Milk Duds, 5th Avenue, and Hershey's Kisses.



On Thursday, food behemoth Nestle said it raised prices by 6.5% in the first half of 2022 because of an ""unprecedented"" rise in costs.

"Hate speech against transgenders — even when spoken in private — outlawed in Norway, punishable by year in jail","Hate speech against transgender people — even when uttered in private — has been outlawed by Norway's parliament in an expansion of the country's penal code that's protected gays and lesbians since 1981, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

Those found guilty of hate speech spoken in private face a fine or up to a year in jail, the outlet said, adding that those found guilty of public hate speech face a maximum of three years in jail.

""I'm very relieved actually, because [the lack of legal protection] has been an eyesore for trans people for many, many years,"" Birna Rorslett, vice president of the Association of Transgender People in Norway, told Reuters.

More from the outlet:

Norway is one of the most liberal countries in Europe for LGBT+ people, allowing trans people to legally change gender without a medical diagnosis in 2016. But reported homophobic crimes have risen, according to advocacy group, ILGA-Europe.



Minister of Justice and Public Security Monica Maeland told Reuters that transgender people are ""an exposed group when it comes to discrimination, harassment, and violence"" and that ""it is imperative that the protection against discrimination offered by the criminal legislation is adapted to the practical situations that arise.""

The amendments approved in late November outlaw discrimination based on ""gender identity or gender expression"" and ""homosexual orientation"" was changed to ""sexual orientation,"" meaning bisexual as well as lesbian and gay people will be explicitly protected from discrimination, the outlet said.



And those charged with violent crimes can receive harsher sentences if judges decide their actions were motivated by victims' sexual orientation or gender identity, Reuters reported, citing the penal code.

Pushback

Professor and legal scholar Jonathan Turley argued that the move is deadly to free speech in Norway.

""In their homes, people will often share religious and political views that depart from majoritarian values or beliefs,"" Turley wrote. ""This law would regulate those conversations and criminalize the expression of prohibited viewpoints.""

More from Turley's column:

The most chilling fact is that European-style speech controls have become a core value in the Democratic Party. Once a party that fought for free speech, it has become the party demanding Internet censorship and hate speech laws. President-Elect Joe Biden has called for speech controls and recently appointed a transition head for agency media issues that is one of the most pronounced anti-free speech figures in the United States. It is a trend that seems now to be find support in the media, which celebrated the speech of French President Emmanuel Macron before Congress where he called on the United States to follow the model of Europe on hate speech.



For free speech advocates, we need to educate the public on where this road leads in places like Norway. What is at stake is the very right that has long defined us as a nation. Once we cross the Rubicon into speech criminalization and controls, Europe has shown that it is rarely possible to work back to liberties lost. We are moving into potentially the most anti-free speech period of American history — and possibly the most anti-free speech Administration. Many politicians are already arguing for citizens to give up their free speech rights in forums like the Internet. With the media echoing many of these anti-free speech sentiments, it will require a greater effort of those who value the First Amendment and its core place in our constitutional system.

Heartbreaking text messages between slain Russian soldier and his mother revealed by Ukrainian ambassador: 'I'm afraid',"Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, revealed Monday heartbreaking text messages between a Russian soldier and his mother that were obtained from the soldier's smartphone after he died in combat.

What are the details?

While speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, Kyslytsya presented screenshots of the messages that he said were from the slain Russian soldier and his mother just moments before the soldier died.

""I would like to read from this screenshot of the smartphone of a killed Russian soldier. It’s an actual screenshot from someone who is dead already,” Kyslytsya said before reading the exchange in Russian.

The mother: ""Why has it been so long since you responded. Are you really in training exercises?”

""Why has it been so long since you responded. Are you really in training exercises?” The soldier: ""Mom, I’m no longer in Crimea. I’m not in training sessions.”

""Mom, I’m no longer in Crimea. I’m not in training sessions.” The mother: ""Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel.""

""Where are you then? Papa is asking whether I can send you a parcel."" The soldier: ""What kind of a parcel, Mama, can you send me? I just want to hang myself now.""

""What kind of a parcel, Mama, can you send me? I just want to hang myself now."" The mother: ""What are you talking about? What happened?""

""What are you talking about? What happened?"" The soldier: ""Mama, I’m in Ukraine. There is a real war raging here. I’m afraid. We are bombing all of the cities together, even targeting civilians. We were told that they would welcome us and they are falling under our armored vehicles, throwing themselves under the wheels and not allowing us to pass. They call us fascists. Mama, this is so hard.""

The text messages are further evidence that Russian soldiers were unaware they were being mobilized in preparation for war against Ukraine.

Over the weekend, a viral video showed captured Russian solders telling their Ukrainian captors that they were told by their commanders they were going to Ukraine for training missions, but felt ""cheated"" when they were ordered to engage in war.

""We were told we were being sent for training at first, but we were put on the frontline,"" one Russian soldier said. ""We do not want this war. We just want to go home and we want peace.""

Another captured Russian said, ""They told us that everything would be fine. We knew nothing. We were deceived and abandoned.""

Anything else?

During his U.N. speech, Kyslytsya also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to kill himself like Adolf Hitler did in May 1945. Kyslytsya's remarks came after Putin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert, which Kyslytsya implied meant Putin is ready to die.

""Following Putin’s order to put in alert Russian nuclear forces— what a madness,"" Kyslytsya said. ""If he wants to kill himself, he doesn’t need to use nuclear arsenal. He has to do what the guy in Berlin did in a bunker in May 1945.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/heartbreaking-text-messages-between-slain-russian-soldier-and-his-mother-revealed-by-ukrainian-ambassador-i-m-afraid,2022-03-01
'An invasion': More illegal aliens steal over southern border in 2022 than ever before in recorded US history,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced this week that the number of illegal aliens encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022 will not only overshadow last year's record-breaking totals, but constitute the highest number on record.

In 2020, there were 458,088 land border encounters. In 2021, that number skyrocketed to 1,734,686. Already this year, the total is reportedly 1,946,880 land border encounters with illegal aliens.

According to the Washington Office on Latin America's Adam Isacson, even if totals were skewed by ""repeat crossers"" — illegal aliens who had been picked up and expelled previously in the same fiscal year — this year's numbers will still break previous records. ""No matter how you measure it,"" he said, ""this will be the largest year ever.""

67% of all illegal aliens encountered in July were single adults. Only 37% of illegal aliens met at the border were processed for expulsion under Title 42, whereas the remainder were processed under Title 8 and placed into removal proceedings.

66 illegal aliens listed in the Terrorist Screening Database were among those CBP encountered this year at the border.

Republican Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.) responded to the recent CBP statistics, claiming that ""The Biden Regime has facilitated an invasion of our sovereign borders of more than 4.2 million illegal aliens since January 2021.""



On August 8, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it ended the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy. This policy, officially known as the ""Migrant Protection Protocols,"" required asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for immigration hearings, as opposed to permitting them to enter and remain in the U.S. until processed.

President Joe Biden indicated his intention to end the policy and took steps to do so beginning in January 2021.

Texas and Missouri sued the Biden administration in April 2021, arguing that the cancellation of the policy violated immigration laws, would boost human trafficking, and would burden American states with the cost of expenditures on resources expected by illegal aliens. After a District Court in Texas agreed that the Biden administration violated immigration law, that case reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled on June 30 in Biden's favor, permitting his administration to rescind the program.

Biden officially ended the policy in June 2022.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/historic-number-of-illegals-encountered-at-southern-border,2022-08-18
"Intruder allegedly breaks down door of home, threatens to rape woman in bedroom — then gets beaten to a pulp","A homeless man allegedly broke down the door of a Florida home Friday morning and threatened to rape a woman in a bedroom, WOFL-TV reported.

'Able to fight back'

But the woman and another person inside the Cocoa residence ""were able to fight back,"" the station's correspondent said in a video report about the incident. ""You can see they did some damage.""

Indeed, a neighbor told WOFL that Brevard County sheriff's deputies brought the handcuffed suspect out the home on School Street and then put him on a stretcher and placed bandages on his face.

The station's correspondent said 40-year-old Christopher Sloan's mug shot shows the ""aftermath of the struggle,"" during which he suffered a ""huge cut"" on his forehead, and one of his eyes is ""swollen shut.""

What went down?

Deputies responded to the home around 6:30 a.m. after Sloan allegedly broke in and entered one of the home's bedrooms where a woman was lying in her bed, WOFL said, adding that an affidavit indicates the suspect threatened rape.

The home's residents defended themselves and called for law enforcement, WESH-TV said, citing Sloan's arrest report.



Deputies found Sloan in the back bedroom, where he was handcuffed and then taken to a hospital for his injuries, WESH added.

While the WOFL report indicated that Sloan was arrested without bond, WESH said Sloan was in the Brevard County jail on a combined $42,000 bond for burglary of an occupied dwelling, assault with intent to commit a felony, and criminal mischief totaling over $1,000.

KCBS said the apparent intruder was shot three times — and when officers arrived after 7 a.m., they found a man in his 20s dead inside the home and signs of forced entry.

Police added to KCBS that the homeowner and apparent intruder got into a physical struggle before the homeowner fired his gun and that it's not clear if the intruder was armed — no weapon was found on the suspect. Detectives also told the station it's too early to determine if the shooting was a matter of self-defense.

The homeowner, a woman, and a dog in the home were not injured, KCBS said.

What else?



Investigators added to KCBS that the suspect tried to get into a house one street over prior to the shooting at the retired firefighter's home.

Authorities told the station that the suspect banged on the door of the first home and yelled, ""Let me in, I live here. I'm trying to get in.""

KCBS said the suspect didn't get into the home but got the homeowner's car keys, drove the car to the retired firefighter's home, and then entered it.

'We're very sorry for him'



Neighbors of the retired firefighter defended his actions, KCBS said.

""We're friends, and he's very nervous,"" neighbor Ericka Winters told the station. ""We are very sorry for him. It's a really bad thing to happen in the neighborhood.""

The suspect hasn't been publicly named, KCBS said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/home-intruder-reportedly-says-f-the-police-when-resident-says-hell-call-cops-intruder-allegedly-makes-move--so-homeowner-lets-gun-do-the-talking,2019-09-20
"Home invader pushes door open, shoots at homeowner — but victim is armed, too, and shoots crook dead after multiple warnings: 'There was no way around it'","A western Michigan homeowner fatally shot a career criminal who, in the dead of night last week, broke the windows of his truck, hollered at the homeowner demanding the keys, pushed open a door of the home, and even shot at the homeowner.

Hours after last Thursday's ordeal, Alan Lenhart told WOOD-TV he had no other choice: “I told him to go away, ‘I have a gun on you,’ and he would not go away and kept advancing on us. So … had to do it. There was no way around it. Absolutely no way around it.”

What are the details?

The Kent County sheriff’s office said shortly after midnight the intruder tried to break into a home on 108th Street SW near Wilson Avenue in Byron Township, the station reported, adding that the suspect was armed with a handgun.

Lenhart told WOOD he and his wife saw the man breaking the windows of his pickup truck in the driveway.

“We yelled at him to go away. He proceeded to advance on us. We shut the door, locked him out, called 911,” Lenhart recounted to the station, adding that he retrieved his deer hunting shotgun from a safe and loaded it.

Then the intruder went to the back of the rural home, which is about 20 minutes south of Grand Rapids — and where Lenhart has lived for 28 years, the station said.

“When he was in the back yard, he was going, ‘Give me the keys, give me the keys,’ and kept approaching,"" Lenhart told WOOD.

The station said the intruder walked up the back steps and pushed against the door at the top of the steps, which was barricaded. Lenhart told WOOD the intruder got the door partially open.

“I told him, ‘Go away, I’ve got a shotgun on you,’ and he kept coming,” Lenhart recalled to the station, adding that the intruder ""started shooting at me"" and described bullets flying by his head.

That's when Lenhart opened fire, WOOD said.

What happened next?

Arriving deputies found 39-year-old Christopher Worth of Middleville near Lenhart's home, the station reported, adding that Worth died at the scene.

Image source: WOOD-TV video screenshot

Worth had a criminal history dating back to 2000 with convictions for drug offenses, vandalism, and unarmed and armed robbery, WOOD said, adding that the Michigan Department of Corrections listed him as a parole absconder at the time of his death.

Deputies believe Worth may have been involved in a car crash earlier in the night in another county, along with two vehicle thefts — and that he tried to steal a car along 108th Street, the station reported. Lenhart added to WOOD it was his understanding that Worth’s stolen car broke down on his street and that Worth was looking for another one.

Lenhart also told the station he couldn't fathom why Worth broke the windows of his locked truck expecting the keys to be inside: ""He was crazy.""

'I'm a religious man, so it’s still tough'

During the interview on his doorstep, Lenhart was asked if shooting Worth was tough on him. He told the station, “Oh, yeah. Sure. For sure.”

“I'm a religious man, so it’s still tough,” he told WOOD as his eyes seemed to tear up. “Scared to death. Who knows when we’ll be done with that, I guess. Hard to go back in your own home after this happens, isn't it.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/home-invader-pushes-door-open-shoots-at-homeowner-but-victim-is-armed-too-and-shoots-crook-dead-after-multiple-warnings-there-was-no-way-around-it,2022-04-07
"Three armed men attempt home invasion on a gun collector, but the homeowner is ready","According to police, three armed men attempted a home invasion on a self-described gun enthusiast, and only one of the three made it out alive.

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco related what the police believed happened in a video statement on Friday. The incident occurred at a home in Wesley Chapel, Florida, that morning.

Nocco said that a homeowner was playing video games by himself when he heard someone break the glass toward the back of his house.

The homeowner grabbed a firearm and accosted the three intruders in a narrow hallway of his home. He told police that the first intruder was wearing a black mask and dark clothing, and pointing a gun in his direction.

According to Nocco, the homeowner then shot the first intruder, who fell to the ground. He then saw a second intruder wearing a mask, also with a gun. The homeowner shot the second suspect, who also fell to the ground.

One of the suspects did manage to get a round fired off, but did not hit the homeowner.



The homeowner then saw a third intruder, fired at him, and saw him fall on top of the other bodies. According to the homeowner, his gun jammed, allowing the third intruder to run away while the homeowner went to get another gun.

The third suspect was captured by a neighbor of the homeowner, who called him and said that he was holding the suspect at gunpoint.

The third suspect was identified by police as Jeremiah Tramel. Nocco said that Tramel will be charged two counts of second degree homicide of his accomplices, and also with home invasion robbery.

""He is accountable for the deaths because it was during the commission of a felony that he was involved in that those two people died,"" Nocco explained.

Here's a local news report about the incident:

Pasco homeowner kills two during home invasion, third suspect held at gunpoint for deputies www.youtube.com

The homeowner said that he might have been targeted because he posted photographs of his gun collection on social media.



""This victim exercised their Second Amendment right. The Second Amendment allows you to protect yourself by carrying and bearing arms. In his home he protected himself,"" Nocco added.

He also said that the two dead suspects had extensive ""extremely violent"" criminal histories.

"Home invasion fails in spectacular fashion: Crook drops gun after getting shot, apparently by accomplice; victim in home picks it up, shoots the other crook dead","A home invasion went way wrong for crooks who posed as cops at the front door of a residence in suburban Houston last week.

After breaking in, one of the bad guys dropped his gun after getting shot, apparently by his accomplice — and then one of the victims in the home picked up the gun and fatally shot the other intruder.

What are the details?

A mother and her two adult sons were inside the Katy home in the 3200 block of Windmoor Drive at the time of Thursday night's incident, KTRK-TV reported.

The victims told investigators that the suspects — identifying themselves as Houston police officers — were pounding on the door, the station said. The two sons added to KTRK that they were trying to fall asleep at the time.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told the station that two men dressed in body armor kicked down the front door of the home and for unknown reasons began shooting immediately once inside.

The sons, who had gotten up to see what was happening, confronted the intruders — and then the intruders began firing toward the sons, KTRK reported.

Gonzalez told the station one of the intruders may have inadvertently shot his own accomplice, who then dropped his gun and fled.

One of the sons said he grabbed the dropped pistol from the floor and started firing, fatally shooting the suspect who initially began shooting at them, KTRK reported.

The inadvertently shot suspect ran out of the house and took off with a getaway driver in a dark-colored car, Gonzalez told the station.

Deputies responded to the scene just before 11:30 p.m., KTRK said. They found a man in body armor dead in the home's entryway, KPRC-TV reported.

Deputies also checked the home for evidence, KTRK said.

""There are some firearms,"" one sheriff's office official told the station. ""There's ballistic evidence inside the house.""

KHOU-TV said investigators worked the scene for nearly 11 hours and walked out of the home with at least two dozen evidence bags.

Neighbors added to KHOU that the family of three moved into the home about six months ago and are renting it. Neighbors also told KHOU that while they never saw anything overly suspicious, they have seen a lot of cars and people going in and out of the house.

Investigators added to KTRK that they're searching for the two suspects who got away and are working to determine the motive but believe the home invasion was targeted and not random.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/home-invasion-goes-way-wrong-for-crooks-posing-as-cops,2022-11-15
"Intruder enters home wielding large stick, locks door, orders homeowner and child to get on floor. But homeowner grabs gun, and the tables quickly turn.","A stick-wielding intruder entered a home in Gainesville, Georgia, on Thursday morning and threatened the homeowner and a child, authorities told the Gainesville Times, adding that the homeowner grabbed a gun and told the intruder he'd shoot if he didn't get out.

The intruder left the house but wouldn't leave the yard — so the homeowner fired a shot into the ground, after which the intruder ran into the woods, authorities added to the paper.

What are the details?

The homeowner and his 12-year-old stepdaughter were getting ready for school around 7 a.m. in their Joe Chandler Road home, Hall County sheriff’s office spokeswoman B.J. Williams told the paper.

Miguel Villapando-Gomez, who's believed to be homeless, hit the glass storm door of the residence with a 6-foot tree branch, Williams noted to the Times.

“The suspect opened the storm door and entered the house, closed the main door behind him and locked it,” Williams added to the paper. “He then told both occupants to get on the ground.”

With that, the homeowner grabbed a gun from his bedroom and ordered the 48-year-old intruder out of the house, the Times said.

But Villapando-Gomez continued waving the stick around and refused to leave, Williams explained to the paper — that is, util the homeowner threatened to shoot.

The intruder got out, but Williams told the Times he then refused to leave the yard.

“The homeowner says he stepped into the doorway of the home and fired a shot into the ground,” Williams added to the paper, which convinced the suspect the best course of action was to run into the woods.

What happened next?

The homeowner called 911, the Times said, and shortly afterward deputies found Villapando-Gomez hiding under a truck in an area near the home.

The suspect was charged with felony home invasion, two counts of simple assault, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of drug-related objects, the paper said, adding that no attorney information was available Friday.

Villapando-Gomez was booked in to the Hall County Jail, where he remained Friday without bond on the home invasion charge, the Times reported.

Williams added to the paper that no one was hurt, but the homeowner and his stepdaughter were “shaken up.”

The incident took place around 10 p.m. local time Sunday in Anderson County, South Carolina, according to WSPA-TV.

What are the details?

The suspect, 39-year-old Efren Nectali Ramirez from Honduras, reportedly forced his way into Antwain Moton's home.

Moton's wife, mother-in-law, and 4-year-old daughter were in the home when Ramirez reportedly broke down the door.

Moton, who was playing Xbox at the time, jumped to his feet and pulled out a weapon.

""He was in the front door and closed the door behind him when I had to shoot him,"" Moton recalled.

Moton, 35, fired his weapon once, striking Ramirez in the chest.

""Eventually I took it [into] my own hands,"" he said. ""That's my 4-year-old daughter in the bedroom.""

Moton told WHNS-TV, ""His hands were just coming toward us, like he was going to do some type of harm.""

Moton explained that Ramirez reportedly bit his wife and shoved his mother-in-law.

The homeowner called 911, but Ramirez was dead by the time first responders arrived.

What else?

""As soon as I shot him, I called 911, and tried to keep him responsive while I [spoke to the dispatcher],"" he said.

Moton said that he didn't want to take the intruder's life, but he didn't feel like he had another option.

""It hurts me that I took his life,"" Moton admitted. ""I didn't want that to happen, but I had no other choice.""

Moton wonders what would have happened if he hadn't been at home that fateful night.

""What if I wouldn't have been home? What would he have done then?"" Moton asked. ""I had to protect them. That's my family.""

Moton told the station that he wasn't even sure why Ramirez chose his home.

""Why? Why did he have to come here?"" he asked.

According to the station, Moton will likely not face charges in connection with the Sunday incident.

WSPA reported that the Anderson County Sheriff's Office said the shooting appears to be self-defense.

Home invasion suspect picks the wrong home to enter — and ends up dead when he meets armed homeowner,"An armed homeowner reportedly took the life of a home invasion suspect during a Thursday night encounter, police say.

The incident took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the famed French Quarter neighborhood.

What are the details?

According to a Friday report from the Times-Picayune and New Orleans Advocate, the suspect — identified by WVUE-TV as 29-year-old Matthew Clark — reportedly entered a French Quarter home around 7 p.m. local time and lunged toward the homeowner.

The homeowner — who is not facing charges at the time of this reporting — remains unnamed at this time.

Neighbors later told police that they witnessed a male who appeared to have been intoxicated and who was yanking on buildings' door handles along the block.

Two witnesses said that the suspect was banging his fists on neighborhood doors and appeared to be so drunk he could barely remain on his feet.

When the suspect arrived at what would be his final destination and began pounding on its door, the homeowner reportedly retrieved a gun and opened the door.

At that point, the suspect reportedly lunged at the homeowner, who, in turn, fatally wounded the would-be intruder.

A New Orleans Police Department spokesperson told the outlet that the homeowner is not facing charges ""based on the investigation and circumstances of this incident.""

As such, the department said it would not release any further information about the armed homeowner.

Area resident Dereck ""Woody"" Terry told WVUE-TV that the situation is ""unfortunate.""

"93-year-old homeowner shoots, critically wounds intruder after crooks kick in his door, attack him: 'I kept telling them I have a shotgun'","UPDATE: The critically wounded intruder has died.

Original story below

A 93-year-old southern California homeowner shot and critically wounded an intruder who was part of a group he said kicked in the door of his Moreno Valley residence after midnight Wednesday and began attacking him.

What are the details?

Homeowner Joe Teague told KNBC-TV the group — which consisted of ""ladies and men"" — ""kicked the door open,"" after which ""the big guy, he came at me"" and the rest of the group ""started throwing objects that [were] in the house at me.""

Teague added to the station that ""when they broke in, they got a lot of my equipment, and I approached them to put them under citizens arrest,"" he noted to the station, adding that ""I kept telling them, 'I have a shotgun with three shells in it,' but I actually only had one. And they kept throwing stuff at me.""

Image source: KNBC-TV video screenshot

With that, Teague fired his shotgun once, hitting one of the intruders, KNBC reported.

The Riverside County Sheriff's Office said the wounded intruder was in critical condition, the station said, adding that Teague was told by authorities that the intruder won't survive — information that KNBC said it's trying confirm.

The Central Homicide Unit was investigating Wednesday morning given the severity of the intruder's condition, the station said.

'They've been watching him'

Oscar Malma — who's married to Teague's granddaughter — explained to KNBC that Teague has been living with his daughter since his wife died a few months ago, so he hasn't been at his home in the 24300 block of Eucalyptus Avenue as much.

""Recently he's been having break-ins,"" Malma told the station.

""It happened once on Friday; on [a] bright day they went to break in the house. And now this happened in the middle of the night? ... They were looking for him. They've been watching him. They've been watching the house for a while.""

Image source: KNBC-TV video screenshot

Malma added to KNBC that Teague has grown tired of the break-ins and police taking too long to respond.

""He was tired because every time he calls the police, [they take] forever to come and assist him,"" Malma told KABC-TV. ""He took the law into his own hands."" The station said authorities have not confirmed how many reported break-ins there have been at Teague's home.

Malma added to KNBC that Teague is ""an old retired plumber, and he has a lot of tools. ... He was a musician as well, so he's got a lot of ... instruments,"" Malma told the station. ""And little by little they've been ripping him off.""

Teague taken in for questioning

Teague was taken in for questioning following the shooting, a process that took multiple hours to complete, KNBC said.

""I don’t blame Joe,"" Malma told the station. ""He’s been working all his life, he’s 93 years old ... and whatever little things he has, he needs to protect them.""

It isn't clear if any arrests have been made, KNBC said.

Malma told KABC he doesn't believe his relative will be arrested because ""he was defending his property. That happened inside his house. So I don't think there's any reason for him to be arrested.""

Wounded individual identified

The wounded individual was identified as 33-year-old Joseph A. Ortega of Moreno Valley, the sheriff's office said as part of a press release titled, "" Homeowner Justified in Shooting of an Intruder."" The release added that Teague was unharmed.

But once again, an American citizen chose to exercise his Second Amendment rights and had a gun on hand.

Emergency services said the suspect was dead when they arrived at the scene, KOB reported.

Who is the suspect?

Police released the identity of the suspect — Felix Yazzie — on Wednesday, the station said.

Gilbert Gallegos, a police spokesman, said the department ruled the shooting a ""likely justifiable homicide,"" the Albuquerque Journal reported, adding that the case was turned over to the district attorney for review.

But this particular homeowner has a gun — and fatally shot the suspect, police told the station.

'I know the law on that'

A neighbor, who didn't want to be identified, told WSB that she heard shots from two guns, but police told the station they haven't confirmed if the burglar had a weapon.

And while the neighbor told WSB the shooting is unusual for the neighborhood, as a gun owner herself she's sympathetic toward the homeowner who opened fire.

""If someone is in your home, I know the law on that — and yeah, you do have a right,"" the woman told the station.

Police added to WSB that the homeowner has a right to defend himself.

Homeowner discovers intruder hiding in his closet. Intruder gets combative — so homeowner fights back with his gun.,"There are a few things wrong with this picture.

For starters, you have an alleged burglar hiding in an Arkansas homeowner's closet, having gained entry to the residence after possibly bunking in the backyard camper without permission.

Image source: KHBS-TV video screenshot

And then after the homeowner discovers the intruder hiding in his closet, the intruder actually becomes combative with the homeowner and ignores — or completely forgets — one commonsense rule: Don't assume even for a second that those you target as crime ""victims"" aren't armed at least as well, if not better, than you are.



What happened?

Had the intruder heeded that simple rule when his jig was up around 10 a.m. Thursday and instead begged the homeowner for mercy, he may have escaped pain.

But instead he got a big dose of it.

""He opened the door of the closet, and he actually saw this person looking at him in the closet,"" Van Buren Police Sgt. Jonathan Wear told KHBS-TV of the homeowner's actions. ""He confronted the man that was in his home. That man became combative, and then at that point he ended up having to fire shots at him.""

Wear told the station the suspected burglar was shot in the leg.



And when police arrived at the residence on Blueberry Hill Street, the homeowner was holding the intruder at gunpoint and told cops he didn't know him, KHBS said.

The homeowner thought that perhaps the intruder was staying in his backyard camper, the station noted.

What happened next?

Police told KHBS the suspect, who is from Gentry, was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries — and when he's released, police said he'll be arrested and most likely will face burglary charges.

""He actually had the homeowner's wallet and a pair of his shorts,"" Wear added to the station, ""and so we think he was actually in the house trying to steal things from the homeowner.""

Law enforcement officials also will try to determine if the suspect has ties to any other burglaries in the area, KHBS reported.

Homeowner exchanges gunfire with pair of would-be burglars in middle of night. Homeowner's aim is much better.,"Chalk up yet another crook who's learned the often painful lesson that fewer and fewer Americans are succumbing to victimhood as more and more of them take charge of their own protection, put the Second Amendment into practice, and arm themselves with guns.

What happened?

Sheriff's deputies said two individuals attempted to burglarize a home in Joshua Tree, California, just after 1 a.m. Monday, the Hi-Desert Star reported. At least one of the burglars was armed with a gun.

Unfortunately for the crooks, the homeowner also had a gun at the ready.

And after the homeowner confronted the burglars, a shootout ensued at the home in the 6000 block of Del Oro Road, the paper said.

When the smoke cleared, one of the burglars — 36-year-old Joshua Watson of Apple Valley — was shot in the leg, the Star said.

The homeowner was not hurt, the paper added.

The whereabouts of Watson's unnamed accomplice aren't clear.

Several people called 911 to report the shooting, the Star noted.

“There was an exchange of gunfire between the homeowner and either Watson or his unknown friend,” Sgt. Scott Stafford told the paper. “At this point we are still trying to figure out who it was.”

What happened next?

Watson was treated for his injuries and arrested for attempted burglary, weapon charges, and a probation violation, the Star said, adding that he was booked into the West Valley Detention Center without bail.

Turns out this wasn't the first time Watson had a run-in with the law. The paper said he also faces charges for inflicting corporal injury to a spouse or cohabitant and making criminal threats in a case filed last May.

The Star said court dates for the burglary charges had not been set.

'He was acting like he was possessed': Homeowner explains why he shot mud-covered intruder after the man left his house,"A Jacksonville, Florida, homeowner told WJAX-TV he was worried about his safety and his neighbors' safety when he shot a mud-covered intruder who broke into his residence and then departed from it Wednesday morning.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

“He just looked like he was possessed, and he was acting like he was possessed,” William Kerr told the station.

What are the details?

Kerr told WJAX that his wife was leaving for an appointment when he encountered the intruder inside his home office.

“I got the door open about a foot, and I see this guy standing there,"" Kerr recounted to the station. ""He’s got my ... BB rifle – he’s standing there with the rifle like this, the butt facing me, and he’s fixing to clock me … I quick slammed the door, and I heard him messing with the other door in the room. So I’m thinking, ‘Oh, man, Tina’s out there in the car fixing to go.’ So, I ran through the kitchen, grabbed me a cleaver, and went out the door. By the time I went out the door, he’s already at the mailbox.”

Kerr — now armed with a gun — followed the intruder down the street because he was worried about his neighbors, WJAX reported.

“I got a next-door neighbor with a little kid,"" he explained to the station. ""The lady across the street is kind of elderly.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Police were in the area at that point, WJAX said, and Kerr said he even pointed them in the direction of the intruder. He added to the station that he decided to continue down the road to make sure the intruder couldn't hurt anyone.

Kerr saw the intruder again while heading farther down the street, adding to the station that the man had broken off a piece of a privacy fence — and Kerr called out to the intruder: ""Come on out … the police officers are driving up the street; they’ll be here in just a second.""

The man was holding ""this big stick – it’s probably three or four inches around and about three feet long, and he wields the stick,"" Kerr recalled to WJAX. ""Well, I jump back … I had my gun, I tried to shoot him in his hands to get the stick out of his hands. About that time a police officer drives down the street, and I wave him down. I’m like, ‘He’s right here!’"" Kerr added to the station that the intruder still tried to run.

A different homeowner encounters intruder

Another neighbor saw the intruder before he entered Kerr’s home, WJAX said — and that neighbor shared video with the station of the man walking up his dock, naked and muddy.

The neighbor told WJAX he gave the man a pair of shorts, water, and food before calling 911 — but the man took off and headed toward Kerr’s residence.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

“He was jacked up on something,"" Kerr added to the station. ""He was dirty as heck. The time he tried to ram me in there he was going, ‘Wooo! Wooo!’ And even when he was swinging the stick, he was like, ‘Wooo!’ And his eyes were like golf balls.”

What happened after Kerr shot the intruder?

Police questioned Kerr and released him Wednesday evening, WJAX said, adding that Kerr wasn't arrested and claimed self-defense.

Kerr added to WJAX that the intruder also stole $400 — and that he wishes the intruder would have just asked for help, adding that he would gladly have given him the money.

“I hope the best for him. I don’t hope anything bad,” Kerr told the station. “It was a traumatic situation on both our part.”

Investigators on Wednesday said the man Kerr shot was in surgery, WJAX said.

Legal expert weighs in

Dale Carson, a law and safety expert, spoke to the station about whether or not Kerr could face charges.

“If you are in imminent fear of death or great bodily harm, you can probably defend yourself and claim self-defense,” Carson told WJAX.

But Carson added to the station that a self-defense argument can be difficult to prove.

“My advice would be, don’t follow people out of your house. Call law enforcement and allow them to manage it,"" he told WJAX. ""Because if you get involved there’s a possibility that you could ultimately be charged with manslaughter or even murder.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-explains-why-he-shot-intruder-after-man-left-his-home,2022-08-05

Pleasant Hill police said they received several 911 calls about a man behaving erratically in the area of Shadow Mountain Court and Camelback Road.

Police said callers reported that a male suspect was vandalizing parked vehicles and banging on the windows of homes and trying to gain entry into them.

As officers arrived in the area, they heard a number of gunshots — and 911 dispatchers still speaking to callers in the neighborhood heard them as well, police said.

Police said a male suspect was found in the living room of a home and suffering from at least one gunshot wound.

The suspect was taken to John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek where he died, police said.

Police said involved parties and witnesses remained on scene and have been cooperative with investigators. No other suspects are being sought, police added.

The police department and the coroner's office may provide additional information at a later time, police added.

No arrests have been made, KRON-TV reported.

Anything else?

The incident in Pleasant Hill was the third in less than a month in the northern California region involving homeowners fatally shooting intruders.

In late July, an elderly homeowner in Guinda — which is about 80 minutes northeast of Pleasant Hill — arrived at his residence after being away for a few days and discovered a break-in and noticed a gun had been stolen. So he armed himself and was prepared for further trouble that night. Sure enough, intruders with extensive criminal records broke into his home, and he shot one of them dead and wounded the other intruder.

And in early July, a couple in their 60s were having breakfast when they heard a knock at the door of their home in Fairfield — which is about a half hour northeast of Pleasant Hill — followed by an attempt to kick down the door after they didn't respond to the knock. Turns out it was an armed man on parole, and after he kicked the door in and entered the residence, the husband in the home shot the intruder dead.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-fatally-shoots-intruder-cops-find-shot-man-in-living-room,2021-08-04
"Crooks steal cash from man, then a day later break into his home. But this time victim shoots two of them dead, holds other two at gunpoint until cops arrive.","An Indiana homeowner fatally shot two armed intruders who broke into his DeKalb County residence early Sunday morning — and then held at gunpoint a third intruder, as well as a fourth person who was outside, until police arrived.

The crooks and the homeowner weren't exactly strangers. Turns out the foursome stole cash from the homeowner the day before, WPTA-TV reported.

How did this all unfold?

The homeowner was asleep inside his residence in the 1600 block of State Road 8 just outside Auburn on Sunday, the station said, citing court documents. It was around 6 a.m. when a break-in commenced, Indiana State Police told WXIN-TV.

The homeowner told police he woke up to his dog barking and saw three people in his home — Tabitha L. Johnson, Dylan Morefield, and Rameica Moore, WPTA said.

The homeowner said Morefield and Moore threatened him and at times held a gun to his head, the station said, adding that all three began stealing items from his home and demanding money, the station reported.

But he reminded them that they took all his money the day before, so the homeowner told police they made him write a check with no name on it for $500, WPTA said.

A fatal turning of the tables

The homeowner said he was able to retrieve his shotgun, and he fatally shot Morefield and Moore, the station said. The coroner confirmed that the pair died of their injuries, WPTA reported. Moore was 36 and Morefield was 22, state police told WXIN.

The homeowner said he took the third burglar — Johnson, who is 42 years old — out of his home, where he found another man, 42-year-old Shaun T. Kruse, WPTA said.

He said he held the pair at gunpoint and told Kruse to call 911, the station said. The homeowner said his home phone was destroyed, and his cell phones were stolen before he could call for help, WPTA reported.

Kruse is on the left in the below Facebook post; Johnson is on the right.

What happened the day before?

The homeowner told police the same four people came to his home Saturday aggressively demanding money, the station said, citing court documents.

Turns out he knows Johnson — the third burglar — as she occasionally stayed with him over the last decade, and she had been messaging the homeowner about needing $3,000 because “some bad people thought she had stolen it from them,"" WPTA reported.

The homeowner told police he had only $65 cash on him Saturday, which the group took, the station said. He added to police that they wanted him to go to the bank and get money, continuing their threats, but eventually left because his bank was closed Saturday, WPTA said.

Kruse admitted to police that he drove Johnson, Morefield, and Moore to the victim's home Saturday, the station said, citing court documents. Kruse added that while they were there, Morefield and Moore engaged in a confrontation with the homeowner in an attempt to get money from him, and Morefield was the aggressor, WPTA said.

Kruse said all four of them got together later Saturday and discussed going back to the victim’s house to get more money and take his car and other property, the station said.

When the foursome returned to the home, Morefield was “talking about being gangster over and over,"" Kruse told police, WPTA reported. Morefield also told Kruse to get in the driver’s seat while he and Johnson and Moore entered the home, the station said.

Kruse said the three began bringing stolen items to the car, but shortly afterward the homeowner came out with a shotgun and told Kruse to call 911, WPTA said.

Police added that Johnson admitted to being at the home both days and said that she was trying to get her items from the home, the station said.

Now what?

Kruse and Johnson are charged with two counts of murder and burglary with a deadly weapon, WPTA said. In Indiana, people can be charged with murder if a death takes place while they're committing a felony — even if they didn't actually do the killing, WPTA reported in a separate story. Indiana State Police are investigating, the station added.

The homeowner is not facing criminal charges at this time, police told WPTA.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-fatally-shoots-two-intruders,2022-05-17
Homeowner fatally shot two intruders over fear 'he was going to die' — and got thrown in jail for criminal possession of a firearm,"Ronald Stolarczyk heard people climbing up the stairs leading into his Deerfield, New York, home last month, his lawyer told Syracuse.com.

The 64-year-old yelled at them to stop, but one of them was soon coming at him, his attorney Mark Wolber added to the outlet.

'Scared to death'



""He said he was scared to death and thought he was going to die,"" Wolber told Syracuse.com.

With that, Stolarczyk picked up a handgun from the kitchen counter and fired three to four shots at the intruders, his lawyer noted to the outlet, adding that two people fell down the stairs to the bottom.

Stolarczyk then called 911, Wolber told Syracuse.com.

A police officer responding to the call found Stolarczyk at the end of the driveway and told him to put the gun down, the outlet said, citing a felony complaint.

Intruders killed



The fatally shot intruders were identified as Patricia Anne Talerico, 57, and Nicholas A. Talerico, 27 — an aunt and nephew — New York State Police told Syracuse.com, which added that Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara said it appears the pair were unarmed.

Wolber said Stolarczyk didn't know they were unarmed or didn't have time to notice, the outlet reported.

Patricia Talerico was on parole for a weapons charge and was sentenced to prison for up to three years for third-degree attempted criminal possession of a weapon in 2016, Syracuse.com said, citing state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision records. She was released in June 2018, the outlet added.

She also was imprisoned for grand larceny in 2010 and released in 2011, Syracuse.com said, citing state records.

Now the homeowner is in trouble

While Stolarczyk wasn't charged in connection with the intruders' deaths, WKTV-TV reported, he was charged with criminal possession of a firearm, a Class E felony, police said.

Turns out Stolarczyk had lived in the home with his parents, both of whom are deceased, Wolber told Syracuse.com. His father owned the 38-caliber Rossi revolver used in the shooting, the outlet added, citing court papers. Stolarczyk said he recently discovered the gun in the home and never registered it himself, Syracuse.com noted.

Stolarczyk was arraigned and his bail was set at $15,000, but he didn't have the money, his attorney told the outlet. And since his home was still cordoned off as a crime scene — and he had nowhere to go — Stolarczyk told Wolber he might as well remain in jail, Syracuse.com added.

""Yesterday he was minding his own business in his kitchen, and today he's in jail,"" Wolber also noted to the outlet.

Out of jail — but homeless



But earlier this month, Stolarczyk was finally released from jail with no bail requirement, WKTV noted.



However, he's due back in court August 5 over the felony charge of criminal possession of a firearm, the station said, adding that Wolber is asking for dismissal of the charge in the interest of justice.

In the meantime, Stolarczyk's house has since been condemned, and he can't go back, WKTV reported — but his attorney said he's receiving temporary shelter and benefits through Social Services.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-fatally-shot-two-intruders-over-fear-he-was-going-to-die-and-got-thrown-in-jail-for-criminal-possession-of-a-firearm,2019-06-21

Crimes Against Persons detectives were called to the scene around 7:30 p.m., KVIA said, adding that the female victim wasn't seriously injured and didn't require medical treatment.

The station said there were no arrests.

Police identified the deceased ex-boyfriend as Aram Sida of Horizon City, adding that the homeowner who pulled the trigger is Hunter Joseph, the station said.

A police spokesman said the homeowner and his girlfriend — also in her 20s — claimed the fatal shooting was an act of self-defense and were cooperating with authorities, KVIA reported. But investigators still were looking at whether that was the case or if murder charges may be warranted, the station said.

Justifiable homicide

But by Monday investigators ruled the shooting death a case of justifiable homicide, KVIA reported.

"Homeowner: Intruder scaled fence after midnight, tried to break in. Also homeowner: So I introduced him to my gun.","Some folks just can't seem to get it through their heads that there's an armed populace in America, and when gun owners are threatened, they're more than willing to pull the trigger.

Yet another case in point occurred over the weekend in the Lone Star State.

You see, a Houston homeowner told authorities he heard an individual scaling his six-foot fence at his residence on West Mount Houston Road around 1:45 a.m. Sunday, KTRK-TV reported.

"'I'll cut your head off, dude, if you even move': Homeowner flips the script on intruder who could have choked him to death","Travis McKee told KHQ-TV he opened the door of his home Friday night in Spokane, Washington, to find a stranger — 36-year-old Randall Davis — asking for a cigarette.

And just moments later, McKee said he was in a battle for his life.

""He got on top of me and just pounded me for 10 minutes,"" he noted to KHQ. ""The side of my face ... he had me in some kind of hold where my chin was pressed against my neck, and I couldn't get any air.""

Turns out Davis is a convicted felon with a history of assault, the station said. But all McKee likely was considering at the time was how to stay alive, as Spokane police said he began to lose consciousness amid the intruder's grip, KHQ said.

What happened next?

Enter McKee's faithful dog, Mutt, who gave his owner a spark of mental clarity — so to speak.

""When my dog came up and bit my leg, it woke me up,"" McKee told the station. ""I remembered I had that knife in my pocket. I got my knees under me and started to try to kind of worm my way out of [the intruder's grip]. It was just a last ditch effort. I was going to die.""

Davis still had McKee pinned to the floor, but McKee managed to slash at his attacker's arm, stomach, and neck until he let go, KHQ said.

It gets better

Believe it or not, the beaten-down victim who may have died in his assailant's grip resolved to prevent Davis from dying, the station said.

""I held a knife up to him. I told him, 'I'll cut your throat. I'll cut your head off, dude, if you even move. You know, period. I'm going to tourniquet you, and you'd better not move,'"" McKee recalled to KHQ telling the attacker.

And the bleeding assailant — the tables turned on him — wisely listened.

""He let me do it,"" McKee told the station, ""and I [put a tourniquet on] him and came back and found my phone and called 911.""

Police who arrived on the scene gave Davis first aid until medics arrived, KHQ said, adding that McKee and Davis both were taken to local hospitals.

Blood was all over the house, too, the station said:

Once Davis is released from the hospital, the station said he'll be booked into jail on charges of first-degree burglary and second-degree assault.

When a KHQ reporter asked McKee why he couldn't let his attacker die, he had a relatively simple answer: ""'Cause I'm just not into hurting people, you know?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-knife-intruder-choke-to-death,2020-10-26
Homeowner opens fire on crook who broke into his residence in search of BMW key fob — and the perp is caught on video running for his life,"A New Jersey homeowner opened fire on a suspect who broke into his Roseland residence early Monday morning in search of a key fob for a BMW parked in the homeowner's driveway — and the would-be car thief was caught on video running for his life, WNBC-TV reported.

What are the details?

Police said two would-be thieves went to the home on a cul de sac off Route 280 just after 5:30 a.m., the station said. One of them got through a garage window and entered a mud room looking for the BMW key fob when the homeowner, carrying a handgun, confronted him and fired, police told WNBC.

About a minute after entering the home, surveillance video shows the suspect and his apparent accomplice running away from the home and back to a car on the street, the station said.

The luxury car the pair used is believed to have been stolen, WNBC noted.

The station said home security cameras showed that the pair initially looked at a car parked next door but soon moved to the house with the BMW in its driveway.

The street where the home is located was hit two years ago by car thieves, WNBC said, citing a different video, and Roseland Mayor James Spango warned constituents to keep their homes and vehicles secure.

""Not only lock your car door and take your key fob, [but also] take your garage door opener out of your car, do not program those garage door openers in your car, and lock the actual door from your garage into your house,"" Spango said.

The mayor also defended the homeowner shooting at the would-be thief, the station said — and homeowner's neighbor did, too.

""If someone's in my house, I'd much rather be judged by a jury of 12 ..."" Dan Piccirillo told the station, referencing the maxim about the use of self-defense in the face of courts of law.

In this case, no charges are expected to be filed against the homeowner, WNBC said, adding that police are still searching for the two suspects.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-opens-fire-on-crook-who-broke-into-his-residence-in-search-of-bmw-key-fob-and-the-perp-is-caught-on-video-running-for-his-life,2023-01-10

"Two armed men try breaking down home's door, get greeted by armed homeowner. One crook gets away; the other is found shot dead on porch.","When a pair of gun-toting men tried breaking into a South Carolina home last week, the also-armed homeowner quickly introduced himself to them. While one of the crooks got away, the other was found shot dead on the front porch.

What are the details?

The homeowner was inside his Madison Street home near Walterboro around 10 p.m. Sept. 14 when two armed men tried to break in, Walterboro Live reported.

Walterboro is a little over an hour west of Charleston; about 5,400 residents populate the city, according to the 2010 census.

One of the intruders fled from the scene in a dark-colored sedan, the outlet said — but the other crook wasn't as fortunate, as authorities found him dead on the victim's front porch.

When Colleton County sheriff’s deputies got to the scene, the “homeowner exited the home, unarmed, and confirmed he shot the man when he and another individual tried to break down his door,” Shalane Tindal, sheriff's office spokeswoman, told Walterboro Live.

The suspect who escaped hadn't been found as of the outlet's press deadline, Walterboro Live said.

Who is the dead suspect?

The outlet said the deceased suspect was identified as 25-year-old Brandon McDonald-Sharmk, citing county coroner Richard Harvey, who confirmed McDonald-Sharmk died at the scene from a gunshot wound.

What happened to the homeowner?

Local authorities told Walterboro Live it's unlikely that the homeowner will be charged; the outlet added that that homeowner's identity hasn't yet been released.

“The homeowner cooperated with detectives, citing the location of the used firearm and providing footage from a home security camera,"" Tindal added to Walterboro Live in a statement, also noting that ""detectives worked through the night to process the scene.

Homeowner shoots all four armed men who broke into his house — two of them fatally. Surviving suspects face murder charges for accomplices' deaths.,"It appears to be yet another case of crime suspects getting charged with murder when their accomplices are fatally shot by the crime victim.

What are the details?

A Louisiana homeowner had just about all he could handle last Tuesday morning when four men carrying guns invaded his residence in Lacombe, WVUE-TV reported. Lacombe is about an hour's drive north of — and directly across Lake Pontchartrain from — New Orleans.

Thing is, the homeowner also had a gun — and used it far more successfully than the quartet of intruders. The homeowner, in fact, shot all four suspects, killing two of them during the ensuing shootout.

The St. Tammany Coroner's office identified the dead suspects as 25-year-old Renard Causey Jr. and 21-year-old Justin Hill, WVUE added.

But now the two suspects who survived the shooting — Renard Causey Sr. and Jason Leblanc — both face charges of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and home invasion, the station reported in a follow-up story.

Both men will be booked after they are released from a hospital, WVUE reported.



The homeowner's 4-year-old daughter apparently was struck by a bullet in the crossfire, the station said, adding that family members said she received an operation and is expected to be OK.

The homeowner also is expected to be OK, and WVUE added that deputies say the homeowner won't face charges at this time. A relative told WVUE the homeowner may have been pistol-whipped before he fired at the intruders.

St. Tammany Sheriff's deputies are investigating the incident, the station said.

Anything else?

WVUE said the community on Palmer Drive is close — the kind of place where everyone either is related or has known each other for years — and many are stunned by what happened.

""It was late morning and we heard patrol cars, one after another and detective cars and then there would be ambulances,"" Shannon Bordelon told the station. ""There were several dozen emergency vehicles involved.""



Neighbors aded to WVUE that they waited 24 hours to learn about the shooting, but sheriff's officials said they didn't want to put out information sooner that might impede the investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-shoots-four-armed-intruders,2020-12-14

"'He's back there screaming': Homeowner shoots one of two intruders, tells 911 'they fell out the back of the house through the sliding glass door'","A Florida homeowner shot one of two intruders who broke into his Leesburg home Monday morning — and a recording of the homeowner's 911 call, during which he described the wounded intruder as ""screaming,"" was released Wednesday, WKMG-TV reported.

Leesburg is about 50 minutes northwest of Orlando.

Police told the station they responded to the home on Flora View Lane around 7:30 a.m. after the homeowner called saying he shot one of two men who entered his residence.

“I need an ambulance here, and I need a police officer immediately,"" the homeowner told the 911 operator, according to WKMG. ""Somebody just broke into my house. He got shot. Please hurry.""

The homeowner continued saying ""they fell out the back of the house through the sliding glass door. He’s on my back porch. There’s somebody else here, too, ma’am. I don’t know which way he went,"" the station said.

The homeowner then told the operator he walked outside to the front of the house with his dog — and with the gun in his hand, WKMG reported.

“I’m gonna set [the gun] out on the ground, is that OK?” he asked the 911 operator, the station said. “It’s still gonna be loaded, but it’s on the ground.”

The homeowner again told the operator to “please hurry"" and added that ""he’s back there screaming, rolling” in reference to the wounded intruder, WKMG said.

What happened next?

The wounded alleged intruder was flown to a hospital where he underwent surgery, the station said, adding that the homeowner was uninjured.

The homeowner noted that his house was broken into the day before he caught the intruders inside his home and opened fire, WKMG said. The homeowner filed an incident report after the first break in, the station added.

Anything else?

The Leesburg Police Department said the alleged intruders likely believed the home was abandoned after a tree fell on it a few days prior to the first break in, WKMG said.

The second suspect is still on the loose, the station said, adding that those with surveillance video or information should call the Criminal Investigations Division at 352-728-9862.

Female homeowner shoots intruder after he refuses to obey her order to leave; sheriff calls it 'excellent example' of 2nd Amendment 'importance',"One guy sure picked the wrong Texas home to mess with.

What went down?

The Harrison County Sheriff's Office said a man forced his way into a Longview residence in the 1500 block of Juanita Road around 8 p.m. Friday.

But the problem for him was that the woman inside was armed with a gun. Authorities said she ordered the intruder to leave her home, but he refused.

Fearing for her safety, the homeowner fired one shot, striking the intruder, the sheriff's office said.

Arriving deputies found the intruder wounded by a single gunshot and determined the shooting occurred while he was committing a burglary.

What happened next?

The intruder was taken to Longview Regional Hospital, then later transported to a Tyler hospital, the sheriff's office said.

Harrison County Sheriff Brandon Fletcher — who told the paper George would be extradited from Smith County — said “this entire incident is an excellent example of the importance of our Second Amendment.

What happened?

The shooting was reported about 9:30 a.m. after three people tried to break into a home north of the city of Anderson on Walker Circle near Liberty Highway, Anderson County deputies told WYFF.

""There were three people [the homeowner] ... caught and he believed were breaking in,"" JT Foster of the sheriff's office added to the station. ""One of the suspects made a move toward him, and he felt threatened, so he fired at least one time, striking one of the suspects.""

Deputies, forensic investigators, and detectives responded to the scene, WHNS-TV reported, adding that the homeowner wasn't injured.

What happened to the suspects?

The shot suspect was taken to a hospital, but his condition was unknown, WYFF said.

The other two suspects ran from the scene, WYFF added, after which deputies brought in a K-9 officer and ATVs to track them down.

""It's absolutely one of the most difficult tasks around,"" Foster told the station, referring to how hard it is to conduct searches in heavily wooded areas. ""Not only are you worried about not being attacked by someone you may find in the woods, but you gotta watch your step for poisonous plants and snakes.""

Deputies told WYFF they captured and detained the second suspect — a woman — shortly after the incident.

Even worse, the suspect fired multiple times at the homeowner with what Stanislaus County Sheriff's deputies said was a previously reported stolen gun, KTXL noted.

Fortunately for the homeowner, he had made certain to exercise his Second Amendment rights and had a gun on hand. The station said the homeowner fired back at the suspect — and a gun battle was on.

But the homeowner's aim was true. The break-in suspect, identified as 41-year-old Rodney Lee Martin, was found dead at the scene by responding authorities, KTXL reported.

Deputies added to the station that the homeowner disarmed Martin after delivering the fatal gunshot wound and then called 911, investigators told the station.

The homeowner is cooperating fully with the investigation, KTXL said, adding that no arrests have been made.

""He did receive some sort of an alert that there was an activation on the property,"" sheriff's office spokesman Sgt. Erich Layton told the station prior to authorities identifying Martin. ""When he arrived, he located what seems to be the now deceased, unidentified male on the property.

Homeowner who fatally shot intruder won't be charged; DA calls it justifiable homicide under Colorado's 'Make My Day' law,"A Colorado homeowner who fatally shot an intruder late last year won't be charged in the incident, as the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office determined it was a justifiable homicide under the state's ""Make My Day"" law, Wheat Ridge Police said.

What does the 'Make My Day' law say?

The Denver Post explained that the 1985 law gives homeowners or any occupant of any dwelling the right to shoot and kill intruders who they believe will cause serious bodily injury or death. The paper indicated that fists can be deemed deadly weapons that justify shooting under the law — but that the right to shoot in self-defense doesn't apply on front porches or in backyards.

""Make my day"" is, of course, part of the famous one-liner from Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" Callahan character in ""Sudden Impact.""

What's are the details of this fatal shooting?

During the initial 10:57 p.m. call to dispatch Nov. 6, the caller said an unknown man entered the home, police said.

The homeowner said he fired one shot at the intruder because he feared for his life and the lives of his family members after the intruder became aggressive, police said.

Responding police found 24-year-old Takwon Wilson unresponsive with a gunshot wound to the chest, police said, adding that Wilson was pronounced dead at the scene despite lifesaving measures by officers and the fire department.

""This was a difficult case for our detectives as well as both families who were devastated by the death of the intruder,"" Wheat Ridge Police Chief Chris Murtha said. “Regardless of the crime that was committed, one family lost a loved one and another is faced with the long-term impact of taking a life in the course of protecting his family.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-who-fatally-shot-intruder-wont-be-charged-da-calls-it-justifiable-homicide-under-colorados-make-my-day-law,2020-03-11
Homeowner won't face charges after fatally shooting shirtless man caught on video forcing front door open,"A Maryland homeowner won't face charges after fatally shooting a shirtless man who forced open the front door of his Woodbine residence earlier this summer, Howard County State's Attorney Rich Gibson said Tuesday, WJZ-TV reported.

Gibson said at a news conference there was ""no criminal violation"" when Charles Dorsey shot Gerardo Alberto ""Gary"" Espinoza — and that the case is covered by the Castle Doctrine, which lets homeowners use force and doesn't require them to retreat when others force their way inside their residences, the station said.

What happened?



Police said at the time of the shooting, 46-year-old Espinoza had a blood-alcohol level of .22 — almost three times the legal driving limit — and may have gotten lost as he was staying at a friend's home nearby, WJZ reported.

A doorbell video shows Espinoza at first apparently smiling and joking at the front door around 1 a.m. July 21 when Dorsey told him to go away — and Espinoza did just that, the station said.

At some point prior to the shooting Dorsey's wife reportedly called 911, WJZ noted.

After police entered the neighborhood minutes later, the deadbolt was opened, and Espinoza returned. Video shows him yelling and jostling the door handle, which gave way, WJZ said.

The clip shows the front door opening and Espinoza reaching inside.

Dorsey, 56, fired a single shot as Espinoza tried to gain entry, police told the station.

What else did the state's attorney have to say?



""From the mindset of the Dorseys, it's one o'clock in the morning, and there's a shirtless man who's demanding to be let in and will not go away,"" Gibson told WJZ.

Image source: WJZ-TV video screenshot

Gibson added to the station that he believes Espinoza mistook Dorsey's home for his friend's home and thought he was being pranked.

""It is clear that there was no crime that occurred, although there was a terrible loss of life,"" Gibson added, according to WJZ.

Image source: WJZ-TV video screenshot

Along with the video, the state's attorney's office reviewed 911 calls, toxicology reports, and statements from the Dorseys and neighbors, Gibson added to the station.

Officials also met with the Espinoza family and their attorneys for two hours Tuesday to explain the decision not to charge Dorsey, WJZ said.

Dorsey's lawyer said in a statement to WJZ several days after the shooting that it was ""a defense of last resort.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeowner-wont-face-charges-after-fatally-shooting-shirtless-man-caught-on-video-forcing-front-door-open,2019-09-04

The resident told troopers that the two men broke into his home on Rumsey Hill Road just before 7:30 a.m. July 25, and the homeowner shot them after they refused to leave the property, the station said.

Investigators said they found 50-year-old Mark Ward of Covert, WBNF reported, adding that 38-year-old Jaimie Coleman drove 32-year-old Frisco Meeks of Ithaca to Guthrie Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre.

Ward and Meeks were both treated for gunshot wounds, the station said, and were charged with felony burglary when they were released from the hospital. WBNF said Coleman of Trumansburg was arrested the same day and charged with felony burglary.

Ward and Meeks were sent to the Tompkins County Jail without bail while Coleman had bail set at $15,000, the station said, adding that the homeowner was not injured in the incident.

Harrowing video captures moment Ukrainian nuclear plant employees plead with Russian soldiers: 'Stop shooting! You are endangering the security of the entire world!',"New video from inside Ukraine's Russian-controlled nuclear power plant showed the moment Ukraine employees began pleading with Russian invaders to ""stop shooting.""

On Friday, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted that Russia's shelling of a nuclear plant is a war crime. Fortunately, contrary to initial reports released during the fog of war, no reactors were hit during the attack and authorities stated that there was ultimately no risk of a radiation leak.

What are the details?

Following an attack, Russia began occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, and according to a report from CNN, management at the Zaporizhzhia is ""now working at gunpoint.""

CNN on Saturday aired disturbing footage taken from inside the plant.

CNN ""New Day Weekend"" co-anchor John Berman cued the video, telling viewers, ""We have new video from inside a nuclear power plant as it was under fire from the Russians, we told you about the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that broke out after this Russian attack. This is now a look inside the plant as those shots were being fired, employees using a public address system to try to stop the Russian troops.”

In the video, employees could be heard begging, ""Stop shooting! You are endangering the security of the entire world!""

Berman in the segment added that Russian troops are commencing an advance on Yuzhnoukrainsk Nuclear Power Station in Mykolaiv Oblast.

What else?

According to the report, Petro Kotin — head of state-owned nuclear power generator Energoatom — said that Russian forces ""entered the territory of the nuclear power plant"" and ""took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.""

Kotin added that if the nuclear facility happened to be hit by shelling, it would surely lead to nuclear disaster.

A senior U.S. defense official on Friday told Fox News that Russia was likely seeking ""leverage"" over Ukraine’s civilian population by moving on the nuclear power sites.



""If your goal is to control population centers, if your goal is to supplant the government of Ukraine and replace it with one that that's more suitable to you, if your goal is to control Ukraine, one can surmise that you would want to control the infrastructure and to make sure that you can meter it to your needs,"" the defense official told the outlet in a statement. ""You can use your leverage in that regard to punish a population, to make it harder for that population to resist you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/horrific-video-captures-moment-russian-soldiers-storm-ukrainian-nuclear-plant-as-employees-plead-stop-shooting,2022-03-06
House Democrat declares it is 'un-American' to blame Biden for gas crisis: 'This is Putin's fault',"Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier claimed Monday that bucking the Biden administration's narrative on the intensifying gas price crisis is ""un-American.""

What is the narrative?

The Biden administration launched a full-court press last week blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for soaring gas prices and out-of-control inflation.

The problem, of course, is that inflation rates were already at historic highs and gas prices were already sky-high before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February.



What did Schrier say?

During an interview with journalist Brandi Kruse, the Washington Democrat regurgitated the Biden administration's talking points and charged that dissenters are ""un-American.""

""I believe a couple things: Right now, in the last two weeks, this is Putin. You should be blaming Putin if anybody for this,"" Schrier said. ""To not blame Putin, first of all, is denying reality, and second, frankly, I think is un-American.""

""So, this is Putin's fault,"" she declared.

Strangely, Schrier then immediately blamed the COVID-19 pandemic and supply problems — just as the Biden administration did before Putin invaded Ukraine.

""Before this because people were already suffering at the gas pump before this, right? We saw an increase of over $1/gallon over the past year and a half or so, that can be blamed realistically on— during the pandemic, when people were not going to work and driving was down, gas prices were down,"" she claimed. ""As demand increased and rigs had not yet been turned on, there was a supply-demand issue like with everything else in this country, and that was to blame.""

While Biden has abdicated any responsibility for the problem with gas prices and vulnerable Democratic lawmakers have indicated they will happily repeat Biden talking points, Biden recently bragged about dropping gas prices.

""I was able to bring it down 12 cents a gallon and will come down more, I believe,"" Biden said in December 2021.

The national average gas price as of Tuesday afternoon is $4.31 per gallon, according to AAA. That figure is down four cents from Monday, but still up since last week.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrat-declares-it-is-un-american-to-blame-biden-for-gas-crisis-this-is-putin-s-fault,2022-03-15
House Democrats propose gas stimulus to slap bandage on rising prices,"House Democrats have put forward a bold new proposal to address inflating gas prices: Have the government spend more money.

Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), John Larson (D-Ct.), and Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) have put forward the Gas Rebate Act of 2022, which they say will address rising energy prices by providing small stimulus checks to lower-income Americans.

The plan is to offer a rebate of $100 per month and $100 for each dependent for the rest of the year in any month where the national average price of gasoline is more than $4.00 per gallon.

“Americans are feeling the impact at the pump of Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and right now we must work together on commonsense policy solutions to ease the financial burden that my constituents are feeling,” Thompson said in a statement.

“The Putin Price Hike is putting strain on our economy, and I am proud to be working with Reps. Larson and Underwood to introduce this legislation to provide middle-class Americans with monthly payments to ease the financial burden of this global crises,"" he added.

The rebate payments are structured to phase out in the same manner as the COVID-19 stimulus payments. A single filer earning less than $75,000 would be eligible for the $100 rebate, which would be phased out to $80,000. Joint filers earning less than $150,000 can claim the $100 rebate, but the program is phased out at $160,000, according to a press release.

National gas prices reached record highs in March as inflation, increased demand for gasoline, constricted supply, and the war between Russian and Ukraine combined to push prices skyward. The national average price for a gallon of gas was $4.24 on Wednesday, according to the American Automobile Association. Gas is about six cents cheaper this week over last, as analysts predicted it would be after the price of crude oil declined last week. But experts say that as the weather improves in the spring and summer, gas prices could rise again because more Americans will be traveling.

In the meantime, prices are still high in various parts of the country. In Los Angeles, California, for instance, gas surged to an average of $6.00 for a regular gallon.

While Democrats blame Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine for the high prices, oil and gas industry representatives say President Joe Biden's policies are contributing too.

""Which is it? You can’t blame Putin and us at the same time. The bottom line is we are not price makers, we are price takers. We suffer from low prices and then we have higher prices. That is based on the price of oil globally,"" Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma said on Fox News Wednesday.

She said the industry ""would love to produce more [energy] in the United States and help to bring those prices down.""

Independent Petroleum Association of America Executive Vice President Dan Naatz added that fossil fuel energy companies are ""frustrated"" with the Biden administration's ""relentless assault"" on domestic oil and gas manufacturing.

""Increased regulations, talk of taxes, our members get frustrated when the administration, Jen Psaki just seem to say, now that we are facing an energy crisis, go out and produce like the snap of a finger. It is just not possible and as we face this relentless attack, we will have to do a lot of work. And you want to start a dialogue with the administration to address the challenges,"" he told Fox News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrats-propose-gas-stimulus-to-slap-band-aid-on-rising-prices,2022-03-23
House passes $1.5 trillion spending package,"Even as Americans continue suffering under the financial strain caused by high inflation, the House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a massive $1.5 trillion spending package.

The measure, which was passed in two votes, will head to the Senate.

The plan will fund the government through the end of the fiscal year. It will raise defense and nondefense spending as compared to the prior year. The package also includes funding related to Ukraine. It also contains earmarks for lawmakers in both parties.

Americans are suffering under the financial strain of rapidly skyrocketing gas prices, and the situation could get even worse in the days ahead.

President Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order banning the importation of Russian crude oil and other products, a move meant to turn up the heat on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The order prohibits importation of ""crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products"" from Russia.

Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the January consumer price index data that showed rapid price increases.

""The all items index rose 7.5 percent for the 12 months ending January, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending February 1982,"" BLS reported.

"Houston homeowner shoots burglars attempting to break in, kills three","A Houston homeowner single-handedly shot at least four suspected burglars and killed three of them when they tried to break into his home on Saturday, KHOU-TV reported.

What happened?

The suspects reportedly tried to force their way into the house at Sherman Street near 71st Street around 12:45 a.m. Saturday, reports state. The homeowner told detectives he grabbed his gun and shot the suspects in self-defense. He was not injured.

Police said one of the suspects was found dead in front of the house, one fled on foot and the others fled in a car, KPRC-TV reported. The car crashed into a pole near Harrisburg Boulevard and a man was found dead inside. Another man ran out of the car, fell in the street and later died. The man who tried to run away sustained a gunshot wound to the leg and was found by police. He was taken to a nearby hospital to undergo surgery.

Police were still questioning the homeowner and were continuing to investigate Saturday afternoon, according to reports.

Evidence markers placed around the outside of the home suggested that dozens of rounds were fired, KHOU. reported.

On Saturday morning, a ""group of tearful women,"" were seen down the block from where the shooting happened. They said they are relatives of the men who were shot but asked media for privacy, according to KHOU.

Any witnesses?

A neighbor reportedly said he was sitting his porch with his baby when two men showed up with large rifles. He said he believed they were there to rob his neighbor, so he ran into his home to take cover.

The neighbor said he did not know what they might be after. He also told KHOU he did not know the neighbor's full name, just that he goes by ""Flaco.""

Obama's ethics chief eviscerates White House for reportedly devising art scheme to sell Hunter Biden paintings to secret buyers for as much as $500K,"Art is a big business. Worldwide sales of art and antiques reached an estimated $64.1 billion in 2019, according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report. One of the more curious artists to begin selling their artwork is Hunter Biden. The son of President Joe Biden is selling his artwork for potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars presents a potential headache for the White House.

The Biden administration reportedly stepped in and helped broker a deal that would allow a purchaser of Hunter's artwork to remain anonymous, which has concerned many over the possibility of bribery and money being exchanged for influence. One of the critics who slammed this alleged secret selling situation is Walter Shaub, former President Barack Obama's onetime ethics chief.

Hunter's art dealer is Georges Berges, who ""plans to host a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles this fall, followed by an exhibition in New York,"" according to Artnet. ""Prices range from $75,000 for works on paper to $500,000 for large-scale paintings.""

Shaub told Fox News that Hunter's art deal is ""the opposite of government ethics."" In effect, the Biden administration got the ""art dealer to promise not to give us the means to monitor whether the buyers are getting preferential access to government"" by keeping buyers anonymous, according to Shaub.

""Nobody ever said secrecy was the best disinfectant, but that's what we have now. And White House officials getting involved in any way other than to request transparency amounts to effectively putting an official stamp of approval on the president's son trading on his father's public service,"" Shaub said. ""Instead, the president should be begging his son not to go through with this sale, even if that means threatening to banish him from the family's Thanksgiving table this fall and publicly condemning his actions.""

""The idea's that even Hunter won't know, but the WH has outsourced government ethics to a private art dealer,"" Shaub wrote on Twitter. ""We're supposed to trust a merchant in an industry that's fertile ground for money laundering, as well as unknown buyers who could tell Hunter or WH officials? No thanks. Is this amateur hour for government ethics?""

The former Office of Government Ethics director emphasized, ""The WH has put its stamp of approval on the president's son profiting off his father's public service again.""

""Yeah yeah, I know some folks aren't going to like this thread because we're not supposed to criticize the president who's way better than the ethical disaster named Trump,"" Shaub explained. ""But, you know what? With democracy on the ropes, ethics has never been more important. And this ain't it.""

Richard Painter, who was a top ethics official in the George W. Bush administration, told the Washington Post, ""The whole thing is a really bad idea.""

""The initial reaction a lot of people are going to have is that he's capitalizing on being the son of a president and wants people to give him a lot of money,"" Painter said. ""I mean, those are awfully high prices.""



Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pointed out some potential issues with Hunter selling expensive art to unknown entities, ""Some very tough ethical questions about whether the president's son, who is still investing in CCP-linked firms, should take $500,000 in payment (bribes) for his 'artwork.' Better consult the experts on this one!""

White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Hunter had done nothing wrong with his new business endeavor.



""The president has established the highest ethical standards of any administration in American history, and his family's commitment to rigorous processes like this is a prime example,"" Bates responded to the criticism.

A bipartisan Senate investigation released last July alleges that the art industry is ""largely unregulated,"" and ""uncovered a complex set of facts involving shell companies with hidden owners, intermediaries who mask purchasers and sellers, and lax money laundering safeguards in the U.S. art industry.""

""There is a lack of transparency in private art sales,"" the 150-page congressional report states. ""As such, Congress should add high-value art to the list of industries that must comply with BSA requirements. Given the intrinsic secrecy of the art industry, it is clear that change is needed in this multi-billion-dollar industry.""

The report alleges that ""certain Russian oligarchs appear to have used transactions involving high-value art to evade sanctions imposed on them by the United States on March 20, 2014, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.""

Last month, Shaub blasted President Biden for allowing children and relatives of powerful administration officials to be hired for key government positions.

""[T]his royally sucks. I'm disgusted,"" Shaub said in June. ""A lot of us worked hard to tee him up to restore ethics to government and believed the promises. This is a real 'f*** you' to us—and government ethics.""

Georges Berges describes Hunter Biden's jump into art:

Biden has been a lifelong artist that has devoted his artistic career to both the written word and the visual arts. A lawyer by trade who now devotes his life to the creative arts - he brings a myriad of experiences creating powerful and impactful pieces of art. Biden's paintings range from photographic mix-media to abstract works on canvas, yupo paper, wood and metal. He incorporates oil, acrylic, ink and the written word within his work to create a distinctively unique experience that have become signature Biden.

Artnet notes that some of Biden's artwork are ""geometric abstractions, filled with patterns and somewhat hallucinogenic.""

Hunter admitted in February 2020, ""For years I wouldn't call myself an artist,"" but, ""Now I feel comfortable saying it.""



""I don't paint from emotion or feeling, which I think are both very ephemeral,"" Biden said. ""For me, painting is much more about kind of trying to bring forth what is, I think, the universal truth.""



When asked what President Joe Biden thinks of his art, Hunter responded, ""My dad loves everything that I do, and so, I'll leave it at that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-art-paintings-ethics,2021-07-08
"Husband, wife hear footsteps in their home in middle of night, so husband grabs gun, then gets in shootout with armed burglar.

'I put lead in him going down the steps': 74-year-old homeowner known as 'Lurch' can't imagine why he'd be charged for shooting teen intruder,"A 74-year-old homeowner in Akron, Ohio, said he can't image why he'd face charges after shooting a 16-year-old male who broke into his residence Tuesday morning by crashing through his glass front door.

What are the details?

The homeowner — known as ""Lurch"" — was watching television the morning after his birthday when he said the intruder knocked all the glass out of his front door and broke in, WKYC-TV reported.

“I heard this hellacious crash, and he comes running right through my front door,” Lurch told WOIO-TV.

Lurch added to WKYC he stepped into the hall and saw a person opening his basement door. Lurch fired his 380 Luger, which he keeps close by him, WOIO said.

“He dives down the basement as I put lead in him going down the steps,” he told WOIO.

Lurch noted to WKYC that the suspect ""rolled on the steps and started moving that way and I shot him again. And he lived.""

What happened next?

Akron police were called to the scene in the 700 block of Johnston Street just before 7:30 a.m., WKYC said, adding that the teen was taken to Akron Children's Hospital in stable condition with multiple gunshot wounds.

Lurch was not injured, the station said.

Police told WKYC that the incident “will be further evaluated to determine if or when charges might be applied.""

Lt. Michael Miller with Akron police added to WKYC that ""most would agree that within reason someone has a right to defend themselves, so in that someone broke into his house, in that he's confronted with an unknown person with an unknown motive, all those things will be taken into consideration.""

'Those shots were good'

“Those shots were good,” Lurch told WOIO. “I don’t like people breaking into my home.”

When the station asked him if he believes he might face charges, Lurch replied, ""I better not. I am in my own home, and he breaks into it.""

ACLU threatens to sue if Idaho passes law banning biological males from competing against biological females in sports,"LGBT groups are decrying the state government in Idaho as a bill banning biological males from competing against biological females in sports comes closer to becoming a legal reality.

The bill was approved by the Senate and will go the House for approval. Critics say the bill is unconstitutional and allows for discrimination against transgender persons.

Supporters of the law say it will protect females from unfair competition by biological males.

""It started to level the playing field. But now we are in a new crisis,"" said Republican Sen. Mary Souza according to the Associated Press.

""Girls who have been struggling and training and competing in their sport are suddenly confronted by biological males,"" she explained.

Trangender advocates and supporters complained about the bill on social media.

""The notion the Idaho House would spend time during #CoronavirusOutbreak looking for new ways to persecute transgender people is just beyond the pale. Don't do this,"" pleaded Montel Williams.

""While the world grapples with #coronavirus the Idaho Senate focused on discriminating by legislating against #transgender people and voting 24-11 to pass a bill barring transgender girls and women from women's high school and college sports teams,"" said Democratic strategist Meghan Stabler.

"Israeli military baits Hamas terrorists using ingenious tactical move, then unleashes massive air attack","The Israeli Defense Forces successfully duped Hamas terrorists into believing Israeli soldiers would initiate a ground attack in Gaza, drawing the terrorists into underground tunnels before unleashing a massive air campaign on them.

What happened?

Late Thursday night, the IDF began assembling ground forces along the Israel-Gaza border, indicating that a ground assault was imminent into the areas where Hamas terrorists have been launching a barrage of missiles into Israel.

At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli ""would exact a very heavy price from Hamas and the other terrorist organizations."" Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Benny Gantz called up 9,000 reserve soldiers, according to the Jerusalem Post.

""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip,"" the IDF tweeted.

Media outlets across the world then reported the alleged development, including the Washington Post and ABC News, the Jerusalem Post noted. The Post, for example, reported, ""Israeli troops have entered the Gaza Strip as conflict with Palestinians escalates, Israeli military says.""

Did Israeli ground troops actually invade Gaza?

According to Israeli officials, assembling ground troops near the Gaza border and publicly claiming a ground invasion was occurring was tactical deception.

The intended goal was to provoke Hamas terrorists to enter their underground tunnel system, allowing Israeli forces to systematically target the tunnels and Hamas soldiers.

In total, more than 450 bombs were dropped on more than 150 Hamas targets during the air campaign.

From the Jerusalem Post:

Yes, the IDF had deployed troops along the border, but they did not cross into Gaza. What did happen was in the air where 160 aircraft had assembled for a massive bombing run over the Gaza Strip. Their target was what the IDF called Hamas's ""Metro"", an underground network of tunnels which Hamas used to store its weapons and to move throughout Gaza hidden from Israeli aircraft. The ""Metro"" had been built in the years after the 2014 war in the Gaza Strip, also known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. It was a network of dozens of kilometers of tunnels that crisscrossed Gaza and provided safety from Israeli aerial incursions.



According to reports, due to the deployment along the border and the news coming out in the foreign media of a ground incursion, Hamas and Islamic Jihad sent their first-line of defense into the tunnels to start taking up positions. These were the anti-tank missile teams and mortar squads meant to strike at incoming Israeli ground forces. What these Hamas operatives did not know was that there was no ground offensive. Instead, once they were out of the tunnels, they were exposed to Israeli aircraft. Within minutes, the ""Metro"" attack went ahead. This led to speculation that the tweet about the ground incursion was intentional and made to get Hamas to believe it was safe to enter the tunnels.

Despite nearly one week of fighting, Israeli officials are not interested in a ceasefire as casualties mount on both sides, the Times of Israel reported.

The Jerusalem Post, however, reported that senior Israeli officials are now urging Netanyahu and Gantz to begin working toward a ceasfire.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/idf-tactical-deception-hamas-terrorists,2021-05-15
Possible genocide in Chinese concentration camps in Xinjiang province,"United States National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien delivered warnings regarding China on Friday, while also praising Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters. Speaking at a webinar hosted by the non-partisan Aspen Institute, O'Brien expressed concern over China's iron-fisted rule in the Xinjiang region.

""If not a genocide, something close to it going on in Xinjiang,"" O'Brien told the online audience. Xinjiang is home to millions of China's ethnic minority of Uighur Muslims. The northwest region of China is also home to internment camps, which the Chinese Communist Party officially calls ""vocational education and training centers.""

There could be as many as 3 million Uighur Muslims detained in the secret re-education camps, according to Randall Schriver, former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.

O'Brien said, ""The Chinese are literally shaving the heads of Uighur women and making hair products and sending them to the United States.""

O'Brien is citing the seizure of 13 tons of hair products worth more than $800,000 at the Port of New York/Newark by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in June. The confiscation of human hair products, which originated from Xinjiang, points to ""potential human rights abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment"" by China.

O'Brien was also troubled by the crackdown of Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators by the Chinese government.

""Anyone who's been to Hong Kong and spent time there, it's sad what's going to happen. Hong Kong has been fully absorbed into China,"" O'Brien stated. ""It'd be great if we had more immigrants from Hong Kong. They're terrific people.""

The National Security Adviser also warned Taiwan to bolster its military to defend against a possible invasion by China.

""I think Taiwan needs to start looking at some asymmetric and anti-access area denial strategies and so on and really fortify itself in a manner that would deter the Chinese from any sort of amphibious invasion or even a gray zone operation against them,"" O'Brien said at the event.



O'Brien added that China doesn't want to do an amphibious landing on Taiwan, ""It would be a hard operation for the Chinese to do."" He added an animal aphorism, ""Lions generally don't like to eat porcupines; they can, but they prefer not to.""

Earlier this week, the Trump administration informed Congress that it plans to sell advanced weapons systems to Taiwan.

""The U.S. sales involve the Lockheed Martin-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, a truck-mounted rocket launcher; the Boeing-made over-the-horizon, precision strike missile Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response; and external sensor pods for Taiwan's F-16 jets,"" as reported by Defense News.

Last month, the Trump administration announced they would sell 66 new F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan.

O'Brien said that Beijing would be forced to consider possible retaliation by the United States for China's aggression. ""We have a lot of tools in the toolkit that, if we got involved, could make that a very dangerous effort for China to engage in,"" O'Brien said.

""China is truly the challenge for the United States for this generation,"" O'Brien said, ""I hope we're not enemies, although I understand that Xi Jinping was telling his troops this morning to prepare for war.""

O'Brien is referring to Xi's appearance at a military base near Shantou in the east of the province this week, where he reportedly told troops, ""[You should] focus your minds and energy on preparing to go to war, and stay highly vigilant.""

These allegations come on the heels of the New York Post's bombshell report that Hunter Biden allegedly pursued ""lasting and lucrative"" deals with a Chinese energy company that he said would be ""interesting for me and my family."" A source familiar with the negotiation of the deal and who was one of the people included on the reported email claimed that Joe Biden was named in the email and would profit off the deal with CEFC China Energy Co.

""Green iguanas are not protected in Florida except by anti-cruelty laws and can be humanely killed on private property year-round with landowner permission,"" read the statement from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

""The FWC encourages removal of green iguanas from private properties by landowners,"" they added.

Then a pool worker got shot by an iguana hunter.

Paramedics treated a pool worker at a Boca Raton home for minor injuries from being shot by a pellet gun in the leg. Boca Raton Police said that an iguana hunter had been hired to exterminate the animals from the home.

""Unfortunately, the message has been conveyed that we are asking the public to just go out there and shoot them up,"" said FWC Commissioner Rodney Barreto in a new statement.

""This is not what we are about,"" he added, ""this is not the 'wild west.'""

The iguana hunter who shot the pool worker was not charged with any crime.

Here's the latest on the green iguana infestation:

'This is wildly immoral': Ilhan Omar is outraged that Biden is considering asking Saudis to pump more oil,"Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was outraged at a report saying President Joe Biden, also a Democrat, is considering asking Saudi Arabia to pump more oil as gas prices skyrocket at home.

Axios reported that Biden may make a trip to Saudi Arabia in spring to ask for increased gas production as energy prices jump skyward as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Omar lashed out at Biden over the suggestion.

""Our response to Putin’s immoral war shouldn’t be to strengthen our relationship with the Saudis who are currently causing the worst humanitarian crisis on the planet in Yemen,"" tweeted Omar.

""Yemenis might not matter to some geopolitically but their humanity should,"" she added. ""This is wildly immoral act.

Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has helped the Yemeni government fight against an insurgent movement by the Houthi Islamists, a group which has been labeled as a terror group.

Others criticized the report for different reasons. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas excoriated the Biden administration for seeking foreign sources of oil after shutting down domestic production.

""Two weeks after Biden banned new drilling on federal lands he's begging Saudi Arabia to drill for more oil. Does he think that only American energy is bad for the environment?"" tweeted Cotton.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that there was no plan yet for Biden to visit Saudi Arabia. She also went on to say that they would not be increasing domestic oil production to ease the oil crisis but instead spun the crisis to validate their anti-oil policies.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” she claimed.

Also on Monday, the stock market continued to tank in response to high oil prices and the escalating war in Ukraine from Russian invasion.

"'Sadistic' illegal alien involved in multiple armed robberies, home invasions, and murders receives 29-year sentence","27-year-old Honduran national Denis Matute has been sentenced to 29 years in jail, after which time he will deported. Matute, in the United States illegally, was a member of a gang of robbers who perpetrated numerous crimes in Texas dating back to 2017.

On August 16, now-retired U.S. Circuit Judge Gregg Costa handed Matute a 9-year sentence for two counts of interference with commerce by robbery and two 10-year sentences for a pair of counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.

According to the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of Texas, the court was made aware of ""the details surrounding three additional murders and two home invasions Matute had committed."" Extra to murders, assaults, and home invasions, he had also hijacked a vehicle on his way to rob other American citizens.

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement press release characterized the approach taken by Matute to his victims as ""sadistic.""

In one instance exemplifying his cruelty, he and his gang handcuffed a security guard at Houston's A1 Flea Market. They kicked the victim repeatedly while he was down and defenseless.

While never reluctant to physically terrorize his victims, Matute also utilized psychological torments. He routinely aimed guns at those he was robbing.

When robbing the R&R Pawn Shop in January 2017, for instance, he pointed his weapon at employees' heads while smashing glass and snatching up expensive watches.

Matute is one of many illegal aliens who have stolen into the United States and committed crimes in recent years.

In Texas, between June 1, 2011, and July 31, 2019, over 297,000 non-citizens were booked into local jails for crimes not including immigration violations. Two-thirds of those non-citizens were confirmed by the federal government to be illegal aliens. Of the convictions meted out, there were 500 for homicide, 23,954 for assault, 8,070 for burglaries, 297 for kidnappings, 14,178 for thefts, 2,026 for robberies, and 3,122 for sexual assaults, along with various others.

These numbers do not reflect the surge in crimes committed by illegal aliens that took place more recently in 2021.

Last year, illegal immigrants committed 1,178 assault and domestic violence crimes nationwide. There was also a 1,900% increase in murders committed by illegal aliens across the United States.

In the way of convictions for illegal aliens in 2022, there have so far been 892 for assault and battery; 693 for burglary; 53 for homicide; 1,241 for driving under the influence; 249 for illegal weapons possession; and 283 for sexual offenses.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) noted earlier this year that roughly 2,000 Americans are killed annually by illegal aliens. Murders of citizens by illegal aliens are one “of the dozens of negative effects of illegal aliens in America, aided and abetted by Socialist Democrats who seek political power via a tsunami of illegal aliens.”

Nearly 2 million illegal aliens have stolen across the U.S. southern border in 2022, breaking previous records.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegala-alien-criminal-sentenced-29-years,2022-09-06
In-N-Out Burger in LA apparently remaining defiant as restaurants aren't checking customers' proof of vaccination — a violation of citywide mandate,"In-N-Out Burger restaurants in Los Angeles apparently are remaining defiant and not checking proof of COVID-19 vaccinations for customers who dine inside the iconic burger joints — a violation of the city's mandate, which KCBS-TV reported is the strictest in America.

What are the details?

A reporter from the station, Tom Wait, visited five In-N-Outs across the city Tuesday night and found it was ""business as usual,"" with restaurant workers not once asking for vaccination proof from Wait, KCBS said.

At least one customer told the station he agrees with In-N-Out: ""You have the right to eat here or not. It's their business, not ours ...""

KCBS said In-N-Out didn't immediately respond to its request for comment.

What's the background?

The controversy surrounding In-N-Out and vaccine mandates began in October when the chain ripped San Francisco's proof of COVID-19 vaccination requirements after the city's Department of Public Health closed one In-N-Out for serving customers without proper papers.

""After closing our restaurant, local regulators informed us that our restaurant Associates must actively intervene by demanding proof of vaccination and photo identification from every Customer, then act as enforcement personnel by barring entry for any Customers without the proper documentation,"" In-N-Out Burger's chief legal and business officer, Arnie Wensinger, said in a statement.

He added that ""we refuse to become the vaccination police for any government"" and called the requirements ""unreasonable, invasive, and unsafe.""

Later in the month, officials in nearby Contra Costa County shut down an In-N-Out in Pleasant Hill for the same reason after the location had garnered four citations over several weeks and had to pay fines totaling $1,750.

After the Pleasant Hill location shutdown, In-N-Out's Wensinger issued a similar, defiant statement: ""It is unreasonable, invasive and unsafe to force our restaurant associates to segregate customers into those who may be served and those who may not, whether based on the documentation they carry or any other reason. This is clear governmental overreach and is intrusive, improper, and offensive.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/in-n-out-burger-in-la-apparently-remaining-defiant-as-restaurants-aren-t-checking-customers-proof-of-vaccination-a-violation-of-citywide-mandate,2021-12-02
In-N-Out Burger tells San Francisco 'we refuse to become vaccination police' after city temporarily closes restaurant,"In-N-Out Burger blasted the city of San Francisco's proof of COVID-19 vaccination requirements after the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) closed one of the popular California burger joint's locations for serving customers who were not carrying the proper papers.

""On Thursday, October 14, the San Francisco Department of Public Health closed our restaurant at 333 Jefferson Street because In-N-Out Burger Associates (employees) were not preventing the entry of Customers who were not carrying proper vaccination documentation,"" In-N-Out Burger's chief legal and business officer, Arnie Wensinger, said in a statement.

""Our store properly and clearly posted signage to communicate local vaccination requirements,"" Wensinger said. ""After closing our restaurant, local regulators informed us that our restaurant Associates must actively intervene by demanding proof of vaccination and photo identification from every Customer, then act as enforcement personnel by barring entry for any Customers without the proper documentation.""

""We refuse to become the vaccination police for any government,"" Wensinger declared, slamming the San Francisco Department of Health's requirements as ""unreasonable, invasive, and unsafe"" and accusing the city of asking restaurants to ""segregate Customers"" based on vaccine documentation.

Wensinger's statement was first reported by The HighWire.

SFDPH said in a statement that the notices of violation and closure to In-N-Out Burger at 333 Jefferson Street were issued on Oct. 14 for noncompliance with the Safer Return Together Health Order. The business was instructed to cease all operations on the site ""because of the threat it poses to public health."" Since then, the restaurant has taken steps to comply with the city's proof of vaccination requirements and has resumed operations for outdoor dining and take-out only.

""Vaccines remain our best tool to fight this disease and come out of the pandemic. Vaccination is particularly important in a public indoor setting where groups of people are gathering and removing their masks, factors that make it easier for the virus to spread. That is why San Francisco requires proof of vaccination for indoor dining,"" SFDPH said.

In August, San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced that the city would require businesses in ""high-contact indoor sectors,"" including bars, restaurants, clubs, and gyms to obtain proof of COVID-19 vaccination from patrons and employees before servicing them. The health order was implemented to ""protect against the continued spread of COVID-19, particularly among the unvaccinated,"" according to a statement from the mayor's office.

""Many San Francisco businesses are already leading the way by requiring proof of vaccination for their customers because they care about the health of their employees, their customers, and this City. This order builds on their leadership and will help us weather the challenges ahead and keep our businesses open. Vaccines are our way out of the pandemic, and our way back to a life where we can be together safely,"" Breed said at the time.



San Francisco was among the first major U.S. cities to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter indoor restaurants and other businesses. The city also implemented a vaccine mandate for workers at these places of business, which went into effect on Oct. 13.

In his statement, Wensinger accused San Francisco of forcing businesses ""to discriminate against customers who choose to patronize their business.""

""This is clear governmental overreach and is intrusive, improper, and offensive.""

'Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown': Congress declares American independence,"Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

PHILADELPHIA (JULY 4, 1776) — Two days ago, the Continental Congress, assembled in Philadelphia, voted to declare that the 13 British colonies of America are “Free and Independent,"" establishing at once the “united States of America"" as a separate nation entirely.

“We … the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do,"" Congress announced.

On July 4, delegates of the 13 colonies adopted the “Declaration,"" formally severing the colonies from the authority of king of England. This momentous declaration will doubtless serve to escalate the military conflict between Britain and her colonies. Sources close to Congressional leaders indicate that the formal declaration was considered necessary to enlist the aid of the French army, which the colonists consider necessary to winning any military conflict with Britain.

Relying on the “self-evident"" truths that “all men are created equal"" and “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,"" the members of Congress firmly proclaimed the right of the American people to self-governance and listed a number of “repeated injuries and usurpations"" imposed on the colonies by the British crown.

Among those grievances listed are the king's failure to allow the colonists — despite having been full citizens of England — to have adequate representation; the king's decision to repeatedly close the colonies' legislative bodies for choosing with “manly firmness"" to reject “his invasions on the rights of the people""; quartering British soldiers in American homes; unjustly “imposing Taxes … without our Consent""; “cutting off … Trade with all parts of the world""; and for waging war against his own people.

Despite its clear declaration of independence from the British kingdom, Congress insisted it has not desired such extreme action, but that it has become necessary because of the unrelenting “Oppressions"" of the crown.

“In every stage of these Oppressions,"" Congress wrote, “We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.""

TheBlaze has learned on July 8, Gen. George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, learned of the “Declaration"" in a letter from Congress President John Hancock.

“That our affairs may take a more favorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary to dissolve the connection between Great Britain and the American colonies, and to declare them free and independent states; as you will perceive by the enclosed Declaration, which I am directed to transmit to you, and to request you will have it proclaimed at the head of the army in the way you shall think it most proper,"" Hancock reportedly wrote to Washington.

Where these “united States of America"" go from here is greatly in dispute, with most European leaders speculating the rebellion will soon be crushed by the British, who have since won a series of important battles against the American forces. However, regardless of how this chapter in history ends, the leaders of the world's newest nation have made it clear where they have placed their trust: in God and each other.

“And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor,"" congressional members wrote.

The full text of the ""Declaration of Independence"" appears below:

In Congress, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.



We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.



He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.



He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.



He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.



He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.



He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.



He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.



He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.



He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.



He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.



He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.



He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.



He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.



He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:



For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:



For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:



For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:



For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:



For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:



For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:



For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:



For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:



For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.



He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.



He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.



He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.



He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.



He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.



In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.



Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.



We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

British forces capture New York; Washington lucky to escape with Continental Army intact,"Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

NEW YORK (AUGUST 31, 1776) — The first major battle since America officially declared its independence from Great Britain did not go well for the Continental Army, as American troops were driven from New York in headlong flight.

Worse, Gen. George Washington's conduct in the war has some questioning his strategic ability, as many military experts say that only a series of extremely lucky missteps by the British Army allowed Washington — and the Continental Army with him — to escape the island intact.

The British invasion of New York has long been expected, ever since Gen. William Howe quit the city of Boston following a months-long siege by American forces. Since Howe's flight, American military leadership has anticipated that Great Britain would order him to capture New York, as Britain has made no secret of its plans to win the war by choking off access to the vitally important Hudson River, which is often referred to as the ""backbone"" of the Mid-Atlantic colonies.

Gen. Washington prepared for the hammer's blow by directing Gen. Charles Lee to prepare the city for battle. Lee devised a plan and erected a series of intricate defenses in the city, envisioning a guerrilla fight in which the British would be forced to take New York ""street by street,"" hopefully suffering tremendous casualties during the course of the battle.

However, when New York's civilian authority learned of this plan, they balked in horror at the possible devastation that might be done to the city by the British war machine if Lee's plan were carried out. Due to confusion about the extent of Washington's authority, Washington felt forced to abandon Lee's plan in favor of a more traditional defense.

According to sources within the Continental Army, some of Washington's officers felt hamstrung by Washington's decision to allow Lee's defenses to be dismantled. According to one Army officer, who asked to remain anonymous, ""We never really stood a chance of holding New York, but with those defenses, we at least had a chance to give the British a bloody nose. Without those defenses? We were sitting ducks out there.""

Indeed, the chances of a traditional defense were doomed when the British ships, Phoenix and Rose , easily overcame the Continental's river defenses and took control of the harbor virtually unopposed. This allowed the British fleet, numbering some 130 ships, to land aground a force that was many times over the size of Washington's.

In retrospect, Washington was doomed to lose the battle of New York before the first shot was fired; however, some claim that mistakes made by Washington put the Continental Army in position to suffer much heavier losses than they otherwise would have done, and almost caused them to be obliterated entirely.

First, some sources within the military criticized Washington's decision to send home some 900 cavalrymen from Connecticut who arrived to participate in the defense, telling them that they would not be needed. According to one Continental Army officer, who asked not to be identified, Washington's failure to understand the scouting value of this cavalry force allowed the British to achieve complete surprise and completely flank Gen. Israel Putnam, whom some in Congress have blamed for the Army's failure in New York.

Some officers, however, have noted that Putnam was flanked because he was totally unaware that the British had landed some 10,000 soldiers on Long Island, who marched unnoticed for miles up roads unoccupied by Americans. According to this officer, ""those troops had to have been kicking up an awful lot of dust and making a ton of noise, and some troops on horseback would have really allowed us to at least know they were coming.""

As it was, the main force of the British invading army was able to get completely to the rear of Putnam's forces before Americans were aware, and the result was predictable: Total carnage, combined with chaos and headlong flight. In the first day of fighting, the Continental Army lost around 1,300 men; almost 15 percent of the entire force on Long Island.

Others criticized Washington's decision to split his forces in the face of a numerically superior foe, attempting to defend both Manhattan and Long Island, albeit inadequately.

Although many would have taken advantage of Gen. Howe's curiously slow pace after his initial rout of Putnam's forces on Long Island to quit the defense of the island entirely, Gen. Washington ignored the advice of many on his staff and actually committed reinforcements to Brooklyn, determined to make a show of defending a by-now indefensible position.

Eventually, however, Washington was faced with the reality that his men on Long Island were completely encircled by the Royal Navy and vastly outnumbered, and after a council with his top generals, ordered an attempt to evacuate the remaining troops from Long Island.

The army ultimately may have been saved by a blustering storm that immobilized the Royal Navy and allowed Washington to assemble a rag-tag team of small craft to evacuate his troops to Manhattan under cover of the storm and an extremely dense fog that limited visibility to mere feet.

Although Washington publicly acknowledged the urgent need to leave New York lest the Continental Army be ""cut to pieces,"" sources within the Army said that Washington was obsessed with scoring a ""Bunker Hill"" style victory of his own, and thus prepared to attempt an ill-advised defense of Harlem Heights. According to sources in the army, Washington only abandoned this surely suicidal plan when Gen. Charles Lee arrived in New York and delivered a dire warning concerning the probable fruits of Washington's proposed plan.

At the very last minute, the Continental Army fled Manhattan, saved by the incredible bravery of Col. John Glover and his Massachusetts soldiers, who fought a desperate action around Pelham Bay to delay the British attack so that the Continentals could achieve a semi-orderly retreat and preserve precious artillery and weaponry, which are already in short supply for the Americans.

Washington was also accused of defying Congress' orders during his retreat from the city. According to congressional sources, Washington sought permission to destroy the city of New York upon his exit, so as to deny its comforts to British soldiers, but Congress refused to acquiesce. However, according to witnesses, fires that destroyed substantial portions of the city were set by men who were known members of the Continental Army.

For his part, Washington has refused to join in the public condemnation of Putnam, and promises that he will avoid risking the fate of the entire Continental Army in a single skirmish with the British in the future.

Americans hope that the lessons Washington has learned in this battle will serve him well as America settles in for what it looks like might be a long war for independence.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/independence-day-george-washington-new-york,2020-07-04
India and Russia working to launch a rupee-ruble trade agreement that circumvents Western sanctions and weakens the dollar's global standing,"The government of India is expected to announce an agreement with its counterparts in Russia that will allow the countries to continue trading with one another while circumventing Western sanctions on Russia.

In a move that will surely shake up the global economy, the two countries are working on establishing a trade agreement that removes the U.S. dollar from the equation. CNBC reported that in order to continue conducting business with one another, India and Russia are going to implement a rupee-ruble trade mechanism.

This mechanism will eliminate the countries' reliance upon the SWIFT telecommunication network to conduct trade with each other, and it will provide them with an additional layer of security that prevents Western nations from meddling in their business affairs.

The rupee-ruble trade mechanism would also allow India to continue buying Russian energy exports when many global leaders have forbidden its import.

Dr. A Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said that the Indian government is working on a proposal to allow ""four to five nationalized Indian banks"" to be engaged directly in trade with Russia. He said that the country's central bank governor and the finance minister have been in conversations with the banks to get lay the groundwork for the rupee-ruble mechanism.

Sakthivel suggested that the Western sanctions placed on Russia provide Indian exporters with an opportunity to grow their presence in the Russian market.

He said, ""Export to Russia is not much, only in agriculture and pharmacy products. Now that the whole of the West is banning Russia, there will be a lot of opportunities for Indian firms to enter Russia.""

Despite making logistical sense, India's move runs the risk of angering Western nations with whom the South Asian country still does business.

The United States, for instance, is India's largest market for exports. According to official government data, in 2021, the United States bought $71 billion worth of goods from India.

Conversely, Russia imported a measly $3.3 billion worth of goods from India in the same year. Most of these purchases were pharmaceutical products and exotic regional beverages like coffee and tea.

Historically, India and Russia have had a close relationship, and in an era of heightened geopolitical tension, it is unlikely that the Indian government is going to stop importing 85% of its military equipment from Russia or Russia's close allies.

That said, India's official stance of neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine has angered its Western allies, and strengthening its economic relationship with Russia runs the risk of eliciting Western retaliation.

Sakthivel said, ""The government will take into account all the factors. The government is playing it very carefully.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/india-russia-rupee-ruble-trade-agreement-circumvents-sanctions,2022-03-29
"India, the world's second-largest wheat producer, bans all wheat exports after record-breaking heat wave","India has banned all wheat exports following a widespread heat wave that affected the country’s supply of the crop.

A notice that was sent out in the government gazette by the directorate of foreign trade on Friday said the food security of India, and its neighboring and vulnerable countries was being threatened by the rise in global wheat prices. Global wheat prices have increased by more than 40% since the beginning of the year.

The Guardian reported that one of the Indian government’s key aims is to control the rising cost of domestic food prices.

Prior to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the two countries accounted for a third of global wheat and barley exports. Since Russia’s February invasion, Ukraine’s ports have been blocked and civilian infrastructure and many grain silos have been destroyed.

Western nations have also issued thorough sanctions on Russia, making trade with the country incredibly difficult.

While Russian and Ukrainian wheat exports were being tied up due to war, India’s own wheat harvest experienced stunted production rates due to a record-breaking heat wave.

Even though India is the world’s second-largest producer of wheat, its population consumes the lion’s share of the crop it produces. Hoping to capitalize on the global disruption of supply chains and decreased wheat access due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Indian government had set a goal of exporting 10 million tons of domestically produced grain in 2022-23.

Indian wheat producers were preparing to find new markets for their product in Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, this plan has been halted for the foreseeable future. Much of the wheat and barley that was expected to be exported in this lot would have been sent to developing countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The recent heat wave, however, wasn’t the only issue facing India’s wheat supply. The country’s historically vast stocks of wheat and barley — which in years past have served the country well as a reliable buffer against famine — became strained during the COVID-19 pandemic as the Indian government began to dole out grain to roughly 800 million people.

The Indian government needs about 25 million tons of wheat and barley each year for its extensive food welfare program that usually feeds more than 80 million people annually.

Statista reported that in 2018-2019, the United States had the fifth-largest production volume of wheat worldwide at 51.29 metric tons.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/india-the-world-s-second-largest-wheat-producer-bans-all-wheat-exports-after-record-breaking-heat-wave,2022-05-14
"'I work hard for what I’ve got. If you come and take it, there’s consequences': Homeowner who shot armed intruder dead issues no-nonsense warning ​to crooks","An Indianapolis homeowner who fatally shot an armed intruder late last month issued a no-nonsense warning to others intent on similar crimes.

“I hate that it happened. I hope these other guys learn a lesson from it. If not, there’s plenty of spots over in Crown Hill,” Howard Murphy told WANE-TV, presumably in reference to a city cemetery. “I don’t want it to be like that, but just like the average worker, I work hard for what I’ve got. If you come and take it, there’s consequences behind that.”

What happened?

Murphy said he heard someone breaking into his West 34th Street home through a side window just after 4 a.m. July 29, WANE reported, adding that he came downstairs to confront the intruder.

“He took a video game system and threw it at me, and after that shots rang out,” Murphy told the station.



Murphy admitted he shot the stranger, who then ran upstairs while holding a knife and died in a bedroom, WANE said.

“I honestly didn’t even know if he had been shot because he was still moving around and running around,” Murphy added to the station.

He cooperated with police and was soon released from custody, WANE reported.

Murphy also told the station his home had been broken into earlier in the same week as the July 29 incident and that that thousands of dollars in electronics were stolen.

Image source: WANE-TV video screenshot

""You shouldn't have to be armed inside of your own house,"" he added to WRTV-TV. ""It's sad, but it is like that over there in this neighborhood.""

Murphy was unsure whether 64-year-old Steve Sheppard, Jr. — the man he fatally shot — was involved in the prior break-in, WANE said.

“I don’t go out looking for trouble,"" Murphy noted to WANE. ""I mind my own business.""

He shot intruder in 2014

Citing police reports, WANE said it wasn't the first time Murphy shot someone who broke into his home.

The station said police were called to the same address in November 2014 after an intruder kicked in his door.

“He took a gamble thinking I wasn’t there, and I happened to be there,” Murphy told WANE at the time.

He added to the station that he shot the intruder in the leg: “He reached for something. I don’t know if it was a sledgehammer, but he reached for something and was getting ready to strike me, and that’s when shots were fired.""

The wounded man ran off, WANE said, adding that he was eventually convicted of breaking into Murphy’s home — and Murphy was cleared of any wrongdoing.

"Inflation surged to 8.5% in March, fastest increase in more than 40 years","Consumer prices rose 8.5% through March, marking the fastest inflation increase since 1981.

The New York Times reported that the “stubbornly rapid price increases have been exacerbated by a surge in gas costs tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” with the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. peaking at $4.33 on March 11.

However, as the Times noted, “gas is not the entire story.”

Without accounting for the volatility of fuel and food, core prices rose 6.5% in the year through March, which is up from 6.4% in the year through February.

Citing data from the Consumer Price Index, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that energy costs increased an average of 32%, with energy commodities (crude oil, ethanol, electricity, etc.) increasing by 48.3% and energy services by 13.5%.

Food has increased by an average of 8%, with groceries increasing by 10% and “food away from home” by 6.9%.

Clothing has increased 6.8%, new vehicles set a historic record with a 12.5% increase, used cars and trucks are up just over 35%, “medical care commodities” have increased in price by 2.7%, and medical services have increased 2.9%.

The cost of housing increased 5%.

Prominent conservative figures were quick to comment on the numbers. Florida’s popular Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, took aim at President Joe Biden’s energy policy and the federal government’s spending habits.

DeSantis said, “Inflation is at a 40-year high of 8.5% due to federal policies of borrowing and printing money at unfathomable levels and bad energy policy, which is hurting Floridians. Biden could unleash domestic energy production to provide relief. Instead, he is content watching people suffer.”

Podcast host and pundit Jack Posobiec said that the “White House wants to blame inflation on the Russia-Ukraine war in Eastern Europe but the US itself went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and more and we didn’t see inflation like this from it.”

Robert Sprague, the current Republican treasurer for the state of Ohio, said, “Inflation isn’t just hurting consumers. It’s hurting our businesses, and it’s leading to shortages, delays, and spikes in prices.”

Gregory Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young’s strategy consultancy EY-Parthenon, told the Times that “these numbers are likely to represent something of a peak” in inflation as consumers begin to stop purchasing goods in response to higher prices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/inflation-march-fastest-increase-in-more-than-40-years,2022-04-12
"International airlines cancel flights to Ukraine, fearing Russian violence","Airlines are canceling and diverting flights to Ukraine as the international community increasingly dears an imminent Russian invasion.

Notably, the Dutch airline KLM a subsidiary of Air France KLM has ceased service to Ukraine. Reuters reports that the Dutch airline announced that it would no longer be chartering flights to Ukraine shortly after the government of the Netherlands told Dutch citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as they possibly can.

Germany’s largest commercial airline and the second-largest airline in Europe, Lufthansa, began rescheduling flights to Kyiv in late January, citing the ongoing “problems” preventing airline staff from staying overnight in the Ukrainian capital.

Reuters reports that the United States Federal Aviation Administration has also instituted a ban on U.S. airlines flying over specific parts of Ukraine’s eastern region.

The Associated Press reports that SkyUp, a Ukrainian charter airline, said that a flight from Madeira, Portugal to Kyiv was diverted to the capital city of Moldova after the plane’s lessor banned flights into Ukrainian airspace.

In 2014, a Malaysia Airlines flight, providing service from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Dutch officials accused Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine of shooting down the jet with a surface-to-air missile manufactured by the Russians.

There were no survivors.

On Saturday, President Joe Biden had an hourlong phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden allegedly told Putin that there would be “widespread human suffering” should Russia invade Ukraine.

Biden also reportedly told Putin that Western nations were committed to finding a diplomatic way to end the ongoing debacle but that they stand ready for military intervention should it become necessary. Biden said the West is “equally prepared for other scenarios” should diplomacy fail.

The United States and its allies in NATO currently have no plans to send troops to Ukraine.

Russian leadership continues to deny that it intends to invade Ukraine, but it continues to amass military forces along the Ukrainian border. Russian troops have also been sent to Belarus to conduct military exercises.

The United States believes that Russia has amassed enough firepower along the Ukrainian borders that they could invade the country on short notice.

Should armed conflict occur following a Russian invasion of Ukraine the aftermath will affect far more than just Russia and Ukraine.

Western nations in NATO and the European Union are prepared to issue sanctions on Russia which will kneecap its economy and greatly impact the distribution of energy supplies throughout the continent.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/international-airlines-cancel-flights-to-ukraine-fearing-russian-violence,2022-02-13

The residents of the home came outside voluntarily without incident, the station said, and gave their account to detectives.

What happened to the alleged intruder?

In response to statements from the residents and evidence collected at the scene, Tallant was arrested and charged with aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, and criminal damage to property, KZRG said.

Tallant was taken to a hospital, where he remained Tuesday night in good condition, the station said. Once released from the hospital, Tallant will face extradition to Cherokee County in regard to the charges against him, KZRG said.

Officers also seized a 9mm handgun from the scene, the station added.

No others had been charged as of Tuesday, KZRG reported.

Intruder attacks homeowner after entering house through window in broad daylight. But homeowner has a gun — and shoots intruder dead.,"Despite the preponderance of accountsindicating folks not only are acquiring guns to protect themselves, their families, and their property — but also not hesitating to pull the trigger when necessary — lawbreakers continue to push into the teeth of an armed American populace with potentially deadly consequences for themselves.

What happened this time?

Atlanta police said a male entered a residence Monday afternoon in the 100 block of Howell Street NE through a window and attacked the homeowner after the homeowner confronted him.

But the homeowner had exercised his Second Amendment rights and had a gun on hand — and didn't hesitate to put it to use.

Anything else?

The station, citing Atlanta Public Schools, said the exterior doors of David T. Howard Middle School — which is across the street from the shooting scene — were locked while police conducted their investigation, and no students or staff were allowed outside.

She immediately fired off a shot from her handgun — which struck the suspect and sent the intruder screaming and running.

Intruder forces his way into residence — and ends up in hospital after homeowner fights back,"Barry Sands was asleep in his Miami home about 10:20 p.m. Saturday when what sounded like a ""hysterical female banging on the front door ... asking for help"" roused him from his slumber, WTVT-TV reported, citing an arrest affidavit.

Sands opened the front door, and a man identified by police as Mark Katsnelson, 35, allegedly attacked him, the station said, citing court records.

Katsnelson forced his way into the home and began striking Sands with his hands, WTVT reported, citing the complaint, which added that the homeowner had a cut on his lip and toe as a result of the alleged attack.

Oh, how the tables turned

But the homeowner wasn't about to let the intruder continue without some resistance.

With that, Sands punched Katsnelson several times in the face in what police said seemed like an act of self-defense, the station reported, adding that the homeowner then called 911.

Katsnelson suffered facial injuries and was transported to a hospital, KTVT said.

"He breaks into home through rear door — and fittingly gets shot in rear end, courtesy of homeowner","A 42-year-old man forced his way into a Chicago home through a rear sliding door just after midnight Friday — and got a bit of poetic justice to boot.

See, the 39-year-old homeowner was armed with a handgun and shot the home invader — in the rear end, police told WGN-TV.

The homeowner wasn't injured and has a valid Firearm Owners Identification card, the station said, adding that no one else was inside the residence at the time of incident.

Police said intruder was taken to a hospital where his condition stabilized, WGN reported, adding that charges are pending.

""Honestly, he got what he deserved,"" neighbor Anthony Rosado told the station. ""I mean, you go in somebody's house at night, you don't know if they're home or not, it could've went worse.""

"'You wanna f***in' play? Let's play!': Intruder kicks in door, allegedly threatens his kids' mother. But woman in home has a gun — and ends threat for good.","A terrifying home surveillance video shows an incensed man walking up to the front door of a home a few miles north of Pensacola, Florida, last week and beginning to kick in the front door.

""F***in' play, bitch? You wanna f***in' play? You wanna f***in' play? Let's play! F***in' bitch!"" the man yells into the home before turning his back to the front door and bashing it with the bottom of his boot.

After the 10th kick, he enters the residence and was heard screaming, ""Let's f***in' play! Let's f***in' play! You wanna f***in' play with my kids?""



What happened next?

The surveillance clip of the May 5 incident ended at that point, but the Escambia County Sheriff's Office told NorthEscambia.com that once inside, the suspect armed himself with a knife and hollered that he was there to harm his children's mother.

The sheriff's office said the man searched room to room and threatened the occupants who had taken refuge in a bedroom in the back of the house, the outlet said.

The ESCO told NorthEscambia that the man confronted a female in the rear bedroom, who feared for her life, so she shot the intruder twice.

Deputies arrived at the scene just after 5 p.m. Tuesday to investigate a call about a disturbance that included a shooting, the outlet said.

Deputies found a 54-year old man dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the head, NorthEscambia reported.

At the time of the incident, the outlet said the suspect had an active domestic violence injunction filed on him, adding that investigators said he was reportedly on his way to anger management when it all went down.

Now what?

The sheriff's department said charges will not be filed against the individual who shot and killed the intruder, NorthEscambia noted.

""Florida State statute allows people to take reasonable steps to protect themselves from harm,"" Sheriff Chip Simmons said, according to the outlet. ""You can see from the video; his demeanor and intent were clear. The Escambia County Sheriff's Office will defend a person's right to reasonably protect themselves against harm, even with the use of deadly force. We do not intend to bring charges against the occupant of the home.""



No names have been released in relation to the incident, NorthEscambia added.

"Intruder breaks into home, grabs kitchen knives, tries to stab resident who uses wheelchair. But gun-toting homeowner intervenes and opens fire.","A male intruder broke into an Atlanta home just after 11 p.m. Wednesday, and after entering the Dahlia Avenue residence through a window, police said he grabbed two kitchen knives, WAGA-TV reported.

What happened next?

Investigators told the station the intruder then allegedly entered another room and tried to stab a resident who uses a wheelchair.

But the homeowner intervened in the attempted attack on the disabled resident — and armed himself with something a bit more powerful than a pair of kitchen knives.

Yes, the homeowner had exercised his Second Amendment rights and had a gun at the ready — and wasted no time using it, either.

WAGA noted that the homeowner opened fire on the intruder, shooting him in the stomach and arm.

What happened to the intruder?

The station said paramedics rushed the injured intruder to Grady Memorial Hospital where he was in stable condition and undergoing surgery.

Investigators were waiting at the hospital to question the suspect following his surgery, WAGA reported.

According to WGCL-TV, the suspect has been identified as Tyrell Jamal Johnson. Johnson, 36, was charged with burglary and will be taken to the Fulton County Jail once he's released from the hospital, Patch reported, citing police.

Johnson remained in the hospital Thursday morning, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said.

Johnson is expected to survive his injuries, WGCL noted, adding that it appears Johnson also was arrested in 2017 for aggravated assault (family violence).

What happened to the homeowner and disabled resident?

"Intruder who broke into home, threatened owners that he'd return does so the very next day — and gets violent. But this time one homeowner shoots him dead.","An intruder who allegedly broke into a California home Saturday and took off after the owners called 911 threatened them that he'd return, the Modesto Bee reported.

Well, that intruder did so the very next day — kicking his way in through the front door of the Valley Springs residence and then attacking the homeowners, the paper said.

But one homeowner grabbed a gun and shot him dead, the Bee said.

And the tale of what was behind the incident — and how it evolved — is pretty wild.

What's the background?

Lennin Elizalde, 28, allegedly broke into the home through a side door Saturday, the paper said.

Turns out he's the son of the former owner and claimed his father still owned the home, the paper noted — and Elizalde refused to leave the premises.

But when the new owners called 911, the Bee said Elizalde departed with a threat that he'd come back.

More from the paper:

Deputies contacted Elizalde later Saturday and arrested him on suspicion of illegal entry into a dwelling, vandalism, and possession of methamphetamine.



Elizalde was booked at the Calaveras County Jail, and a deputy asked a judge to increase the bail because of the threat he had made. The judge denied the request because of a 2014 state ballot measure that made meth possession a misdemeanor.

With that, Elizalde was released from jail at 6:20 p.m. Saturday — about six hours before he returned to the home, the Bee reported.

Suspect returns

The two male homeowners told Calaveras County Sheriff's Office deputies early Sunday that Elizalde had just kicked his way through the home's front door and assaulted them, the paper reported.

One of the homeowners shot him in self-defense, the Bee added.

Deputies entered the home in the 7000 block of Gabor Street around 12:30 a.m. and found Elizalde, the paper said, adding that medical responders declared him dead at the scene.

What happened to the homeowners?

The homeowners were treated for injuries at a hospital and released, the Bee reported, adding that the homeowner who shot Elizalde was not arrested and that the District Attorney's Office is investigating.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/intruder-returns-violent-homeowner-shoots-dead,2021-10-15
"Break-in suspect shot by 93-year-old homeowner late last month dies; homeowner said crooks kicked in his door, attacked him","Officials said a break-in suspect shot by a 93-year-old southern California homeowner late last month has died, KABC-TV reported.

What are the details?

Joseph A. Ortega, 33, was shot shortly after midnight June 29 after he and several others reportedly broke into a home on Eucalyptus Avenue in Moreno Valley, the station said, citing the Riverside County sheriff's department.

Ortega was taken to a local hospital in critical condition after deputies and paramedics responded to the scene, KABC said. Investigators established that several individuals, including Ortega, were inside the homeowner's residence when the shooting occurred.

Authorities at the time told the homeowner — Joe Teague — that the wounded man wouldn't survive, KNBC-TV reported. The sheriff's department didn't give a date of Ortega's death but announced it Thursday as a press release update.

What's the background?

Teague added to KNBC that a group of people — consisting of ""ladies and men"" — ""kicked the door open,"" after which ""the big guy, he came at me"" and the rest of the group ""started throwing objects that [were] in the house at me.""

Teague also told the station that ""when they broke in, they got a lot of my equipment, and I approached them to put them under citizens' arrest,"" and ""I kept telling them, 'I have a shotgun with three shells in it,' but I actually only had one. And they kept throwing stuff at me.""

Teague fired his shotgun once, hitting one of the intruders, KNBC reported.

Oscar Malma — who's married to Teague's granddaughter — explained to KNBC after the incident that Teague was living with his daughter since his wife died a few months ago, so he hasn't been at his home as much.

""Recently he's been having break-ins,"" Malma told the station.

""It happened once on Friday; on [a] bright day they went to break in the house. And now this happened in the middle of the night? ... They were looking for him. They've been watching him. They've been watching the house for a while.""

Image source: KNBC-TV video screenshot

Malma added to KNBC that Teague has grown tired of the break-ins and police taking too long to respond.

""He was tired because every time he calls the police, [they take] forever to come and assist him,"" Malma told KABC-TV. ""He took the law into his own hands."" The station said authorities have not confirmed how many reported break-ins there have been at Teague's home.

Malma added to KNBC that Teague is ""an old retired plumber, and he has a lot of tools. ... He was a musician as well, so he's got a lot of ... instruments. And little by little they've been ripping him off.""

Teague was taken in for questioning following the shooting, a process that took multiple hours to complete, KNBC said.

Image source: KNBC-TV video screenshot

""I don’t blame Joe,"" Malma told the station. ""He’s been working all his life, he’s 93 years old ... and whatever little things he has, he needs to protect them.""

Malma told KABC he doesn't believe his relative will be arrested because ""he was defending his property. That happened inside his house. So I don't think there's any reason for him to be arrested.""

The sheriff's office said as part of a press release titled ""Homeowner Justified in Shooting of an Intruder"" that Teague was unharmed.

Teague is not facing any charges, KABC said.

What happened?

Police in the St. Louis suburb were called at 2:51 a.m. Friday for a ""burglary in progress"" in the 1400 block of Grant Road, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

A man had entered a home through a back door but was soon confronted by the homeowner, police told the paper.

And the homeowner planned ahead for just such an occasion by exercising his Second Amendment rights. Police noted to the paper that the homeowner was armed with a shotgun.

The odds now heavily in his favor, the homeowner reportedly gave the intruder a chance to correct his mistake. The homeowner — whose name was not released — ordered the intruder to get out, police added to the Post-Dispatch.

""When the suspect refused to comply with verbal commands to exit the residence, the suspect was shot by the homeowner,"" Lt. Andrew Miller of the Webster Groves Police told the paper.

What happened to the intruder?

Police told the Post-Dispatch that the intruder died at a hospital and that police were still trying to identify him.

What happened to the homeowner?

Miller said the homeowner wasn't arrested, the paper reported, adding that detectives remained at the home hours later. Miller added to the paper that the case was still being investigated and that a couple in their late 40s owns the home.

But Miller declined to comment on whether or not the homeowner and intruder knew each other, the Post-Dispatch said, noting that Miller cited the ongoing investigation.

Anything else?

The paper said that under Missouri law, such shootings can be considered justified under the ""castle doctrine"" — the state's expanded self-defense law.

The Post-Dispatch said that under the castle doctrine, those who encounter intruders in their homes or vehicles — or on their properties, under a recent expansion of the law — are given more leeway in using deadly force.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/intruder-shotgun-toting-homeowner-shoots-him-dead,2021-08-16

What are the details?

Authorities received a 911 call around 5:44 a.m. about a burglary in progress, Dale County Chief Deputy Mason Bynum told the Dothan Eagle.

“The suspect attempted several ways gain entry into the home, including entering through a child’s bedroom window,” Bynum told WTVY-TV.

Bynum's statement noted that ""while the caller was updating dispatchers, the suspect broke an exterior window of the residence and began to make entry,"" the Eagle said.

However, like a growing number of Americans, the homeowner was prepared for such an encounter, exercised the Second Amendment, and had a gun on hand for protection.

With that, Bynum said, the homeowner ""discharged a firearm striking the suspect in the head,"" the paper added. The homeowner fired one shot, WDHN-TV reported.

A deputy arrived on the scene at 5:50 a.m. and found the suspect lying unresponsive near the residence, the paper reported. Authorities added that a broken window where the suspect tried to break into the home was visible, WDHN said.

The suspect was transported to a local hospital and listed in critical condition, the paper said. Bynum described the suspect's injuries as life-threatening, WTVY reported.

Both the suspect and the homeowner are adult males, AL.com reported.

Now what?

Citing Bynum's statement, the Eagle said the investigation is still in the preliminary stages, but after consulting with the Dale County district attorney’s office, the sheriff’s office doesn't anticipate any charges at this time.

Bynum told WTVY there's no indication the suspect and homeowner know each other; he added that the suspect’s name will be released after his family is notified about the incident.

El Cerrito police told KPIX-TV a woman called 911 at 1:13 a.m. saying she was huddled with her young daughter in a bedroom while her armed husband went to confront someone who was trying to break into their home.

Officers who arrived at the scene were told the husband confronted the intruder as he tried to enter the home through a glass door, the station said. The homeowner told police he shouted at the intruder, but the suspect didn't respond, KPIX said.

Believing his life — as well as the lives of his wife and daughter — were being threatened, the homeowner shot at the intruder, who immediately fled, the station said.

What happened to the intruder?

KPIX said the officers found a deceased male lying in the road near the house.

Intruders break through back door of home before dawn — and then say good morning to homeowner's shotgun,"An Oklahoma homeowner told the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office he was awakened by a window breaking at his residence in the Pumpkin Hollow area before dawn last Friday — and so he made sure his shotgun was at the ready.

Soon two males he didn't know were breaking through his back door, authorities said — and with that the homeowner called 911, confronted the pair, and fired his shotgun at them.

Leaving so soon?

Perhaps they experienced a sudden hankerin' for breakfast, because at that moment they immediately fled the scene, authorities said.

Sheriff Jason Chennault and a deputy responded to the incident around 5:15 a.m. and found the suspects' vehicle parked in the house's yard, the sheriff's office said. Turns out it was loaded with items stolen from the property's outbuildings.

The sheriff and deputy then noticed a trail of footprints in the wet grass headed away from the house — and with that another deputy and his K-9 partner Lucas were called to the scene, the sheriff's office said.

Lucas always gets his man

Lucas tracked the suspects' trail to a dirt road where it appeared they met another vehicle, authorities said. But soon — with the help of a deputy marshal — they found a male who matched the homeowner's description of one of the suspects.

James Levesque, 22, admitted to his part in the burglary — and the vehicle parked at the crime scene was registered to Levesque, the sheriff's office said.

Then the hunt began for Levesque's alleged accomplice — and they found 21-year-old Chase Baker at a residence in the Briggs area and arrested him, authorities said.

What happened to the suspects?

Levesque and Baker were booked into jail for first-degree burglary and knowingly concealing stolen property, both felonies, and neither was injured by the shotgun blast, the sheriff's office said.

The recovered stolen property will be returned to the burglary victim, authorities said.

Intruders with extensive criminal records break into house. But elderly homeowner is waiting for them with his gun — and one crook ends up dead.,"A homeowner had been gone for a few days from his residence just north of Guinda, California — but upon his return Tuesday, he discovered a break-in at his home and a gun had been stolen, KOVR-TV reported.



So the homeowner already was on edge that same night when he noticed headlights in his driveway, Lt. Gary Hallenbeck of the Yolo County Sheriff's Office told the station.

What happened next?

This Second Amendment practitioner was not left out in the cold after one gun was taken from his house — he had another one at the ready.

And with the earlier break-in very likely on his mind, the homeowner presumably got himself ready for what might go down next.

""He did not go out to confront these people,"" Hallenbeck told KOVR. ""He stayed in the house, and eventually, these people came into the residence.""

The culprits were a man and a woman, both with extensive criminal records, the station said. And both had just entered the wrong place at the wrong time.

Boom

""The homeowner ended up firing his weapon at them,"" Hallenbeck told KOVR. ""On face value, it points to that self-defense side.""

Indeed.

The elderly homeowner called 911, and when sheriff's deputies arrived, they found the man and woman had been shot, authorities said, adding that the woman was responsive while the man was not.

So deputies performed CPR on the man until paramedics arrived, but he died, the sheriff's office said. KOVR said the woman's injuries were ""serious,"" and authorities said she was taken by air ambulance to a hospital and is expected to survive.

The homeowner remained on the scene and was cooperative with investigators, the sheriff's office said, adding that tools also were stolen from the homeowner in the earlier break-in. Authorities said the homeowner did not know the intruders and that his statements were consistent with the preliminary crime scene investigation.

The sheriff's office also said no other suspects were believed to be involved in the incident, and no arrests were made. At the completion of the investigation, investigators will forward their findings to the Yolo County District Attorney's Office for review, authorities said.

Anything else?

The sheriff's office added to KOVR that if residents decide to depart their homes for vacation, or if they're leaving them empty for a period of time, it's a good idea to tell neighbors so they can keep an eye on the place for a bit, and also make homes appear as lived in as possible.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/intruders-face-armed-elderly-homeowner,2021-07-22
Multiple intruders break into rural home in middle of night. But homeowner fires his gun — and kills one alleged culprit while the others run for it.,"Multiple home intruders most definitely met their match as they broke into a rural Oklahoma residence and encountered a homeowner with a gun.

What happened?

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said around 2:30 a.m. Friday a man heard multiple people breaking into his home on Backhaus Road near Guthrie, so he grabbed his gun and fired in the direction of the intruders.

After firing shots, the homeowner called 911 and said he shot an intruder inside his home, and Logan County deputies responded to the scene, the agency said.

Upon arrival, deputies found a female with gunshot wounds, and she died at the scene, OSBI added.

""[He] fired shots at the sounds he heard from the break-in,"" Brook Arbeitman with OSBI told KWTV-DT. ""When deputies arrived to the home, they found a deceased female.""

However, the other person or persons who broke into the home took off after hearing the gunshots, the agency said. KWTV reported that they haven't been found.

""Two to three people,"" Arbeitman added to the station. ""The homeowner isn't sure how many people were inside his home.""

Anything else?

Police told KWTV they believe the intruders left some things behind.

More from the station:

Investigators said the suspects possibly used a dirt bike to get to the scene. It stayed parked on the side of the road, mostly hidden behind a downed tree branch. Investigators loaded it into a truck and took the bike for further processing.



Also left at the house was a number of tools that include varied sizes of wrenches, a battery charger, bottles of octane booster, a helmet and what looks like a cattle prod. OSBI said it the items could have been brought to be used on the dirt bike.

'The invasion is real': Border county officials call on Texas to use Constitution to end Biden's border crisis,"Republican officials in several Texas border counties have declared that the illegal immigration crisis is an ""invasion"" of their communities and called on Gov. Greg Abbott to declare an emergency and begin deportations.

Officials from Uvalde, Terrell, Kinney, and Goliad Counties held a press conference Tuesday in which they announced that emergency declarations would be forthcoming to call attention to the harms inflicted by the federal government's failure to secure the border.

""I am here to let you know that the invasion is real,"" Terrell County Judge Dale Lynn Carruthers said.

""We are here to protect the sovereignty of our nation, not just the border of Texas,"" she added.

The officials said that residents in their communities have seen property damage, increased crime, and other dangers brought by the flow of drugs and human trafficking across the border. They are dissatisfied with the Biden administration's handling of the crisis and are demanding that the Texas state government step in to enforce federal immigration law in the absence of federal law enforcement.



A press release from Kinney County states that in the month of June, local law enforcement has prevented more than 67 smuggling attempts along county roads and encountered over 4,000 illegal aliens ""who avoided apprehension by Border Patrol and whose whereabouts are currently unknown.""

Since January 2021, more than 3.2 million migrants have been apprehended by law enforcement after entering the country illegally and upwards of 800,000 have slipped past Border Patrol and disappeared into the country, officials pointed out.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said rampant illegal immigration has brought an influx of pedophiles, convicted murderers, drug dealers, and gang members into his community.

""It’s a nightmare. With the tragedy that we just had, our kids are going to be going back to school in the next 45 days or so, and here we’re going to start agin with the bailouts and so forth. It needs to stop. We need to make them come across the right way so we know who they are and where they’re going,” he said.

Goliad County Judge Mike Bennett told reporters there's been an increase in stolen cars and property damage reported over the last two years. He said increased crime rates are ""stealing our resources"" because more and more of the county budget has to be directed towards law enforcement.



""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan said. ""We’re in over our head. We need help and we need for Attorney General Ken Paxton and our governor to adopt an invasion under its definition in the Constitution. Adopt that invasion and let’s move forward.”

The counties invoked Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution and Article 4, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution to declare the existence of an ""invasion"" of the country. They urged Abbott to do likewise and ""take necessary actions to preserve and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Texas.""

Their appeal to the Constitution to have state governments enforce federal immigration law is a strategy that has been put forward by conservative activists, including former Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli, who has advised the county officials and spoke at the press conference.

Cuccinelli said that using the “self-help provision of the Constitution to declare an invasion … gives the governor, decided similarly, the authority to repeal that invasion.”



An Abbott spokeswoman told the Houston Chronicle that ""all strategies remain on the table"" to confront the border crisis.

“As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take additional unprecedented action to address those challenges caused by the Biden administration,” she said.

But legal experts like David Bier, the associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, have criticized the counties' use of the term ""invasion,"" discounting the criminal elements coming over the border and emphasizing that the federal government has broad powers over immigration policy.

“The people coming are actively seeking to place themselves under the laws of the United States by seeking asylum,” Bier told the Chronicle. “So the idea that the first ‘invasion’ in the history of the world where invaders seek to subject themselves to the law of the country that they’re invading — it’s a total mischaracterization of what an invasion is.”

Legal scholar Jonathan Turley made similar comments to Fox News Tuesday.

""I'm afraid I'm skeptical. As they say in Texas, this dog won't hunt. They're relying on the guarantee clause of Article Four, Section Four, and that deals with an invasion, which is generally interpreted and long interpreted to mean an actual foreign invasion in the form of an army, an organized force,"" Turley said.

""I don't think a court would seriously consider expanding the term 'invasion' to cover this.""

Still, conservative lawmakers are supporting the counties' declaration.

""We are dealing with an invasion,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told Fox News Wednesday. ""We are dealing with Texans dying from fentanyl pouring into our communities. Our ranchers are getting overrun, their livestock are getting out, their fences are getting cut. Our communities are dealing with that. So all that these leaders in the counties in south Texas are asking for is that Texas step up and we go do what the federal government refuses to do.""

""Texas is the collateral damage of a federal government that is leaving us dangling,"" Roy said.

"Poll: Majority of Americans say there is an 'invasion' happening at the southern border, NPR blames 'extreme rhetoric' by Republicans for immigration concerns","More than half of Americans say there is an ""invasion"" happening at the southern border. A new poll revealed that it isn't just Republicans concerned with the overwhelming flow of illegal immigrants into the country – a significant number of Democrats are also troubled by the inrush of migrants.

According to an NPR/Ipsos poll released on Thursday, 54% of Americans believe that it is at least somewhat true that there is an ""invasion at the southern border."" Broken down by political affiliation, 76% of Republicans say that there is an invasion happening at the U.S. border with Mexico, compared to 40% of Democrats and 46% of independents.

The poll was heavily skewed towards Democrats. Of the 1,116 survey participants, 516 were Democrats, 317 were Republicans, and 141 were independents.

The survey found that nearly half of all Americans say that ""Democrats are working to open our borders to more immigrants,"" including more than 70% of Republicans.



The poll found that 56% of Americans feel as though ""immigrants are an important part of our American identity,"" a steep decline from 2018 when 75% said the same.

Support for building a wall or fence along the entire border between the U.S. and Mexico increased from 38% in 2018 to 46% in 2022.

The popularity of giving legal status to undocumented or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children has dropped from 65% in 2018 to 51% in 2022.

In the poll, 73% of Americans said that the vast number of migrants apprehended at the southern border is a problem.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have made more than 2 million migrant encounters this fiscal year – which is a record.

Last year broke the previous record with 1.7 million encounters.

""The migrant crisis escalated around the time the Biden administration took office, jumping from around 72,000 encounters at the end of 2020 to 173,000 by March 2021,"" according to Fox News. ""The numbers have not come close to dipping below the 150,000 encounters-a-month mark since then.""



Earlier this week, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) stated, ""For the seventeenth straight month, more than 150,000 illegal aliens crossed the southern border including 200,000 illegal aliens in July 2022. The Biden Regime has facilitated an invasion of our sovereign borders of more than 4.2 million illegal aliens since January 2021.""

NPR attempted to blame Republicans for deteriorating public opinion regarding immigration.

"Invasive, feral monkeys potentially carrying deadly virus have moved into northeast Florida","Wild monkeys carrying a potentially fatal form of herpes virus have made their way into a new section of Florida, according to a local news report.

First Coast News — an NBC and ABC-affiliated station in northeast Florida— reported last week that there have been over a dozen sightings of rhesus macaques in Jacksonville-area neighborhoods over the past eight months.

Videos and photographs – grainy and shaky, shot by homeowners – track the trail of a species expansion that experts call concerning and possibly dangerous.



""The potential ramifications are really dire,"" University of Florida wildlife ecologist Dr. Steve Johnson told First Coast News. ""A big male like the one in that video in Jacksonville -- that's an extremely strong, potentially dangerous animal.""



First Coast News obtained two videos and several photographs taken of the monkeys. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officials call the reports credible, a likely expansion of the feral monkey population in Central Florida.

www.youtube.com





The monkeys aren't at all native to Florida but rather a large portion of the Asian continent. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the invasive species was first introduced to central Florida's Silver Spring State Park in the 1930s by a river cruise attraction owner in an effort to draw in more tourists. He put them on an island in the Silver River, the newspaper explains; but as it turned out, they didn't have to stay on the island because they could swim and the population grew in woods nearby.

Since then, the've been spotted in different areas outside of the park, but First Coast News says this is the first time they've been seen in the northeast Florida ""first coast"" region.

In addition to the potential for primate-on-person violence, contact with the animals could prove dangerous — or even potentially deadly — for humans due to macaques' ability transmit the Herpes B virus.

""B virus infection is extremely rare, but it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately,"" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey, or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth.""

2018 CDC numbers found that that up to 30 percent of Florida's macaques could be carrying the Herpes B virus.

But so far, none of the feral monkeys have infected anyone in the wild. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says ""No confirmed cases of a human contracting herpes B from a macaque in the wild have been documented, but fifty incidents of human infection contracted from macaques in captivity have been reported.""

""I personally am concerned,"" Johnson told The Guardian about the possibility of human infection in December. ""There's a low risk, but very high consequence should something happen. Fortunately nothing has happened yet, but I wouldn't want to have that looming over me if I was the state.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/invasive-feral-monkeys-potentially-carrying-deadly-virus-have-moved-into-northeast-florida,2020-02-03
Iowa bill proposes video cameras in nearly every classroom. State teachers union calls measure 'completely outrageous and dangerous.',"The Iowa State Education Association is dead set against a state bill proposing video cameras in nearly every K-12 classroom so that parents can keep an eye on what's happening with their children.

""The inappropriateness of belief that there should be continual videotaping in a classroom is something that should not even be considered,"" Mike Beranek, president of the ISEA told KCCI-TV reported.

Beranek put it more bluntly to NBC News, calling the bill “completely outrageous and dangerous.”

What are the details?

The bill, H.F. 2177, requires cameras in every public school classroom in the state, except for physical education and special education classes, the network said, adding that parents, guardians, and others could then view classroom livestreams.

Republican state Rep. Norlin Mommsen, who authored the bill, told KCCI he believes the measure ""continues the parental involvement that has occurred due to COVID.""

But NBC News said advocates for teachers are saying the underlying idea is to censor classrooms and intimidate educators who focus on subjects such as race and history.

Indeed, education groups and unions aren't thrilled.

""Some politicians around the country want to limit not only what history our kids can learn about and what books they can read, censor the truth of our history in some cases, and, now in Iowa, they want to install classroom cameras for live monitoring of teachers,"" Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association — the largest educators union in the U.S. — told NBC News.

Pringle added to the network that instead of forking over cash for ""monitoring equipment,"" money should be spent on more teachers and programming and getting to smaller class sizes.

Who would pay?

KCCI said the bill indicates schools would pay for the cameras.

""Our funding is shrinking,"" Beranek told the station. ""We're being asked to take more out of that instead of finding more to serve the students we have.""

Mommsen, however, told KCCI that ""we already have a system through COVID,"" adding that cameras on teachers' laptops could be set in the backs of classrooms so student privacy is protected.

But Beranek added to the station that ""there are federal laws that this bill violates in terms of privacy and the work that our students do in our classrooms.""

What if teachers don't comply?

If the bill passes and teachers don't comply, they could face fines, KCCI said. Those fines could be as much as 5% of weekly salary per infraction, NBC News said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowa-bill-proposes-video-cameras-in-nearly-every-classroom-state-teachers-union-calls-measure-completely-outrageous-and-dangerous,2022-02-04
"Iowa, North Dakota join other states in banning TikTok on state-owned devices","Iowa and North Dakota have joined seven other states in banning employees from having TikTok on state-owned devices, bringing the total to nine states where the app is banned from being used in such a manner.

Federal authorities have committed to stymieing the video application over concerns of data harvesting and threats to national security at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, as reported by TimCast.

Both gubernatorial offices of Iowa and North Dakota announced the ban on state-owned devices on Dec. 13, 2022.

Effective immediately, Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa announced her directive to the Iowa Department of Management’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, issuing a ban on TikTok on all state devices and furthermore, prohibiting any state agencies from subscribing to or owning a TikTok account.

“It is clear that TikTok represents a national security risk to our country and I refuse to subject the citizens of Iowa to that risk,” said Gov. Reynolds on the ban.

“They trust us with their personal and confidential information and we will take every step possible to protect it, including from the Chinese government,” the governor stated.

The office of the governor of North Dakota issued its ban by way of executive order. Governor Doug Burgum's ban forbids TikTok from state-owned devices that are issued by executive branch agencies over ""growing national security concerns.""

Executive branch agencies and employees in North Dakota are prohibited from visiting TikTok's website or downloading the app on any government-provided equipment. The ban also extends to the scope of the state's internet servers, prohibiting the use of TikTok when connected to state networks.

The state's IT department is advised to enforce the ban and assist any state partners in securing their equipment.

“Protecting citizens’ data is our top priority, and our IT professionals have determined, in consultation with federal officials, that TikTok raises multiple flags in terms of the amount of data it collects and how that data may be shared with and used by the Chinese government,” Governor Burgum said in his statement.



Concerns and cries continue to mount over TikTok's invasive policies, with even Democrats echoing the viewpoints once brought forward by Donald Trump.

""I think Donald Trump was right,"" said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in November 2022. ""It is a massive collector of information, oftentimes of our children,"" he continued.

Similar bans of the app are in place in Alabama, Maryland, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowa-nd-ban-tiktok-statedevices,2022-12-15
Iran nuclear deal talks put on 'pause' after Russia demands sanctions exemption,"Negotiations on a revived Iran nuclear deal were put on ""pause"" Friday after Russia made several new demands and raised objections to the economic sanctions enacted as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.

European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell Fontelles announced the delayed talks in a tweet, writing, ""A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors."" He added that the final text of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran's nuclear program is ""essentially ready and on the table,"" pending resumed talks. Since assuming power, President Joe Biden's administration has worked with European partners, including Russia, and Iran to hammer out the details of a new arrangement after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal reached by the Obama administration.

As part of the new deal, the U.S. would end the harsh sanctions Trump imposed on Iran and in return Iran would scale back its nuclear program.



According to the Washington Post, the negotiations were halted after Russia issued a series of demands Saturday for its trade deals with Iran to be exempted from U.S. sanctions. Russia says these exemptions must be included as a condition for participating in any revived nuclear deal.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov cited the ""avalanche of aggressive sanctions [on Russia] that the west has started spewing out,"" and said, ""This meant Moscow had to ask the US for guarantees first, requiring a clear answer that the new sanctions will not affect its rights under the nuclear deal.

“We requested that our US colleagues ... give us written guarantees at the minimum level of the secretary of state that the current [sanctions] process launched by the US will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with Iran,” he said, according to the Guardian.

Western officials have accused Russia of essentially taking the Iran nuclear deal hostage while the country continues its unjust war in Ukraine. Some are worried that Russia's late objections will prevent talks from resuming, which could kill the deal.

“It’s certainly serious. If you lose momentum at this late stage the dynamics shift in ways that it could become impossible to resume the talks,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of the European Council on Foreign Relations,"" according to the Washington Post.

Republicans have lambasted President Biden for negotiating with Russia on the Iran deal while simultaneously insisting that Russia become an international ""pariah"" for continuing the invasion of Ukraine. At a press conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said the Iran deal would be ""a massive win for Vladimir Putin"" if it includes ""a carveout"" for Russia to trade with Iran without threat of sanctions. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) called on Biden to walk away from the negotiations, and other GOP senators joined in with severe rebukes of the president.

Diplomats that spoke to the Washington Post said that informal talks are expected to continue and considerations will be made as to whether a final deal can be achieved without Russia. But Tehran has said it will not risk deteriorating relations with Russia by ignoring Moscow's concerns, making any deal difficult to achieve.

"Amid Russian invasion of Ukraine, Peter Schiff suggests that while 'times are hard,' Ukrainian President Zelenskyy should have worn a suit while addressing the US Congress","Peter Schiff faced significant backlash Wednesday on Twitter for posting a tweet suggesting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who delivered an address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, should have worn a suit instead of a t-shirt.

""I understand times are hard, but doesn't the President of the #Ukraine own a suit? I don't have much respect for current members of the U.S. Congress either, but I still wouldn't address them wearing a t-shirt. I wouldn't want to disrespect the institution or the Unites States,"" wrote Schiff, an economic and financial pundit who hosts ""The Peter Schiff Show"" podcast. Schiff is the chief economist and global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital.

Zelenskyy's address, and Schiff's comment about the man's attire, came as Russia continues to brutally bombard Ukraine, killing many, including civilians.

Schiff, who faced heavy pushback on social media, defended his comments.

""Peter, I agree with you on countless issues, but the guy is in the midst of war....I think it’s understandable and acceptable. Few in our congress would go to the frontlines of war...."" one person tweeted.

""If he was speaking live from a foxhole I would agree. But this was a planned historic event. He was not under fire. It makes no sense that he could not have dressed in something more formal than a t-shirt,"" Schiff replied.

""Dude, not only is he in a war-zone, where I'm sure it's hard to get a suit press and dry clean, but even if it was possible, it's favorable for people to see him as one of them sharing the struggle,"" someone else commented.



Schiff replied, ""He would not have had to press a suit. I'm sure he had a clean suit hanging in the same closet as his t-shirts. Plus even if there were not suits available, maybe a long-sleeved shirt with a collar.""

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger responded to Schiff's suggestion that the Ukrainian leader should have stepped up his attire for the speech: ""I'm ok with it man. You know, war and all,"" Kinzinger tweeted.



""Imagine not just thinking this, but sending it out into the universe. What an ass. 'Times are hard' is the takeaway when Ukrainian lives are being destroyed simply for wanting to exist without intrusion? Talk about privilege. Here’s an example,"" Kimberly Ross tweeted.

""It's only March, but you, sir, have just posted the dumbest thing I'll see on Twitter all year,"" someone else declared.

""Then you don't spend much time on Twitter,"" Schiff responded.

Is war coming between Russia and Ukraine? Here's what that could mean for you,"President Joe Biden held a rare video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as tensions mount between Russia and neighboring Ukraine.

For months now, Russia has built up troops on its border with Ukraine, sparking fears in the international community that the former Soviet superpower intends to invade. Satellite images reported by Insider in November showed Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.



A recent U.S. intelligence estimate first reported by the Washington Post found that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops. Russia has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO and that the military alliance further refrain from certain military activities in and around Ukrainian territory.

Moscow has denied having plans to invade, despite having the clear capability to do so.

Though few analysts in either the West or the East believed a breakthrough would happen in the talks, Biden was reportedly ready to attempt to dissuade Putin from invading. The president was expected to threaten Russia with various sanctions and other punishing economic actions should it go through with any plans to attack Ukraine. U.S. intelligence believes that Putin has not made up his mind to launch a military offensive, and Biden was reportedly set to tell him the U.S. is prepared to take ""substantive economic countermeasures"" that will inflict ""significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy"" should an invasion happen, a senior administration official told reporters Monday.



The two world leaders spoke for about two hours, beginning at 10:07 a.m. ET and ending at 12:08 p.m. ET, the White House said.

Is Russia about to go to war?

There are good reasons to hope for peace and good reasons to believe Russia means war.

The troop buildup on Ukraine's borders is not unprecedented. Russia sent roughly 100,000 troops there last April as part of a military exercise before pulling those troops back and announcing that they had ""demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defense for the country."" Military leaders and Western analysts interpreted Russia's actions at the time as saber-rattling.

It may be the case that Russia simply wants to bring the U.S. to the table to make demands. After April's military exercise, Biden met with Putin in person for a summit in Geneva last June. Since then their last publicly known conversation was in July.

Russia has previously complained about ""aggression"" from Western countries because of U.S. and NATO naval patrols in the Black Sea and U.S. and British soldiers being present in Ukraine on training missions. Putin said last week that during Tuesday's meeting he would ask Biden for specific agreements that would prohibit NATO from expanding eastward or deploying weapons near Russia's borders.

But Biden is not likely to agree to Russia's demands that NATO must not admit Ukraine to the alliance. And Ukraine's desire to build stronger ties with the West may be what ultimately provokes Russia to act.

Ukraine is at the center of a geopolitical rivalry between the East and the West. The nation was the second-most populous and powerful of the 15 communist states that made up the Soviet Union, with important agricultural, industrial, and military resources. But it has deep ties to Russia that go back all the way to the Middle Ages — Russia traces its founding to the Ukrainian city of Kyiv.

The country itself is divided. Its western half has a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population that favors greater relations with Western Europe. But a largely Russian-speaking population in the east wants closer ties with Russia. There is ongoing violent conflict in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting against the pro-Western government.

Russia would like to see Ukraine come under its control once again. Putin once famously said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."" He seeks to restore Russia to the perceived greatness of the Soviet Union as a superpower, after decades of humiliation following the collapse of the union.

In 2014, under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was in the eastern region of Ukraine, becoming the first European state to annex the territory of another sovereign state since World War II.

Russia could attempt to take more territory from Ukraine under the same pretext, especially if it views the pro-Western government's desire to join NATO as a national security threat. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN that there will be a ""really bloody massacre"" should Putin invade, said the West must draw a red line in Ukraine, and warned that provoking Russia ""will not work.""

Reznikov stressed that an invasion would have ""disastrous"" consequences for the rest of Europe, estimating that as many as 4 to 5 million Ukrainians could become refugees. He also emphasized that Ukraine is a major producer of food for Europe and Africa and that war would disrupt production of those supplies.

What remains unclear is whether the U.S. and the rest of the West are prepared to impose steep costs on Russia for taking such action — although the West previously demonstrated an unwillingness to fight Russia over Crimea.

What would war between Russia and Ukraine mean for me?

The United States' interests in Ukraine are to ensure that the country is stable and sovereign, to act as a buffer against Russia and discourage Putin from taking further military action against other European states.

Before the Russian annexation of Crimea, the U.S. provided Ukraine with an average of more than $200 million in foreign aid per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. After Russia's aggressive action in 2014, Washington bolstered aid to Kyiv to more than $600 million annually. The U.S. also provides Ukraine with military training, weapons, and equipment, and NATO allies hold joint military exercises with Ukrainian forces each year.

The U.S. does not recognize Russia's claims to Crimea and has imposed economic sanctions on Russia that will not be lifted until control of the peninsula is returned to Ukraine.

Ukraine wishes to join NATO. In 2020, the country became one of six enhanced opportunity partners, a special status for close NATO allies. But it is not an official NATO ally.

War between Russia and Ukraine would test U.S. and NATO commitments. Biden's administration has already made clear there will be economic consequences for Russia's action. And Congress and other European states would almost certainly approve more foreign aid for Ukraine in the event of war, which could mean additional unfunded government spending.

But that is likely to be the extent of the Western response. It is highly improbable that military intervention from the U.S. or any other state on behalf of Ukraine is politically feasible, or even desired. The U.S. has stated its goal of helping Ukraine defend its ""sovereign territory,"" but military action is not on the table. American troops will not be deployed to fight the Russians any time soon.

If war does break out, it could lead to further disruptions in global energy markets, as Ukraine is a major producer of oil and gas. And if Ukraine's defense minister's predictions about refugees come to fruition, the U.S. may agree to accept some Ukrainian refugees.

President Biden faces the daunting task of balance. He must put enough pressure on Russia to maintain U.S. commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty and independence while avoiding making a promise or threat the U.S. will ultimately not be able to deliver. If he fails, the U.S. will look weaker, America's enemies may be emboldened to take further aggressive action, and potential allies throughout the world would be sent a signal that the United States cannot back up its promises.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/is-war-coming-between-russia-and-ukraine-heres-what-that-could-mean-for-you,2021-12-07
Report: ISIS operative plotted to kill George W. Bush in Dallas by smuggling team of assassins in through the southern border,"An ISIS operative living in the U.S. had elaborate plans to assassinate former President George W. Bush in Dallas, Texas, but his schemes were foiled by two confidential informants, according to an FBI search warrant application recently obtained by Forbes.

According to the report, the ISIS operative — who had been residing in Columbus, Ohio, since 2020 under a pending asylum application — went so far as to travel to Bush's former residence in Dallas in November 2021 to conduct surveillance and record video of the property.



He also had plans to recruit as many as seven other ISIS members to help with the assassination and hoped to smuggle them into the U.S. through the country's southern border with Mexico using visitor visas.

Forbes reported that the relevant documents were filed by the FBI in March and unsealed in the Southern District of Ohio this week.



As of Tuesday, no charges had been filed against the suspect and so his identity is being concealed. The Department of Justice has yet to publicly comment regarding the investigation.

The FBI uncovered the alleged plot through information provided by two confidential informants with explicit knowledge of the plan. One informant reportedly posed as a human smuggler, while the other pretended to be a fellow customer of the smuggler.

Agents also surveilled the alleged plotter's conversations on WhatsApp, a worldwide messaging platform, after the suspect began using a phone given to him by one of the informants.

In communication with the sources and on his WhatsApp account, the alleged plotter claimed to be part of an ISIS-linked unit called ""Al-Raed,"" or ""Thunder,"" led by a now-deceased former Iraqi pilot for Saddam Hussein based in Qatar.

As part of the unit's mission, as many as seven other members would be sent to the U.S. to carry out the assassination of Bush. The plotter's specific job was ""to locate and conduct surveillance on former president Bush’s residences and/or offices and obtain firearms and vehicles to use in the assassination,"" the warrant stated.

The plotter allegedly expressed that he wanted to kill Bush as revenge for the former president killing many Iraqis and breaking apart the country after the 2003 U.S. military invasion.

In response to the report, Bush's chief of staff, Freddy Ford, said, ""President Bush has all the confidence in the world in the United States Secret Service and our law enforcement and intelligence communities.""

Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, added that the ""sophisticated counterterrorism"" efforts show that the U.S. believed the assassination plot was also sophisticated and serious.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/isis-plotted-to-assassinate-george-w-bush,2022-05-24
Israeli leadership urged Ukraine to accept Putin's peace offer and cede territory to Russia,"Israeli leadership urged their Ukrainian counterparts to accept the peace offer made to them by Vladimir Putin.

On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone and urged the Ukrainian president to accept an offer extended by Russia to end the military conflict, the Jerusalem Post reported.

An official with the Ukrainian government said that Zelenskyy did not accept Bennett’s advice.

Bennett reportedly said, “If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer.”

To which Zelenskyy responded with, “I hear you.”

The same Ukrainian official told the Jerusalem Post that “Bennett told us to surrender. We have no intention of doing so. We know Putin’s offer is only the beginning.”

Russian leadership said that it would end its invasion if Ukraine ceased military actions, changed its constitution to ensure geopolitical neutrality, recognized Crimea as Russian territory, and recognized the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s office has claimed that Israel’s mediation efforts force both Ukrainian and Russian leadership to seek a more cautious and balanced approach to the conflict. In this spirit, Israeli leadership asked the Russian government to cease its requests for military and defense aid from other nations.

According to the Ukrainian official, however, Zelenskyy is growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of results from Bennett’s mediation. The official said that Zelenskyy feels as though Bennett is functioning more as a middle-man who passes along messages from parties in Russia and Ukraine without doing much to help the two nations find an agreeable compromise.

“We don’t need a mailbox,” the official said, “We have enough of those. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would expect to see him appoint someone to work on it day and night and try to get a compromise.”

The Ukrainian ambassador to Israel — Yvgeni Kornichuk — is expected to meet with Knesset Chairman Mickey Levi to discuss the details of Zelenskyy’s planned address to Knesset members.

Previously, Kornichuk said that Israel’s mediation efforts were a valuable resource for the Ukrainian government.

He said, “Thank you for the peace effort. This is priceless for us. This is much more important than sales of weapons and of munitions, which we are still fighting for, but we understand [your reasons for not sending them].”

In a Saturday briefing, Zelenskyy reaffirmed his belief that Israeli leadership serves an important role as a mediator.

He said, “I believe [Bennett} can play an important role, because Israel is a country with a lot of history and parallels [to our situation], as well as having a large migration of Jews from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-leadership-urged-ukraine-to-accept-putin-s-peace-offer-and-cede-territory-to-russia,2022-03-12
"'It's you or him': Trio tries breaking into home with crowbar. So homeowner, 78, answers door with a bang.","Things seemed shady from the start.

A 78-year-old Chicago homeowner told WBBM-TV three men posed as repairmen and asked if they could fix his concrete steps and walkway Monday afternoon, repeatedly asking the homeowner to let them inside to get water.

""The first time he came was afternoon, about 4:30, 5 o'clock, and he said, 'I want to fix your cement, but I've got to get in the house to get water,'"" the homeowner told the station, which did not identify him. ""When I heard that, I said no. He wants to get in the house to get at me, you know, attack me, and I said, 'I don't want nobody in the house.'""

But it appears the trio came back that evening — and this time they weren't asking for permission to come inside.

The homeowner told WBBM he saw three men — the same ones, he believes — using a crowbar to get inside his home.

""I was in fear for my life,"" the homeowner told the station.

Something with a little more power than a crowbar



When the homeowner opened his door after hearing a noise, one of the men trying to break in raised the crowbar to smash the glass, WBBM said.

So the homeowner shot one of the men through the storm door, the station said, and police added that he limped away from the house.

""He should have never came back,"" the homeowner added to WBBM.

The other two men got away in a red Dodge Caravan, police told the station.

'It's you or him'

""That was a tough decision,"" the homeowner told WBBM. ""It's not like going hunting. It's hard to shoot a human and not think about it. It's going to stay with me the rest of my life, what happened. You hate to do something like that, but like the police said, it's you or him. I didn't feel good doing that, but he would have gotten me with that crowbar. If I get hit with something like a baseball bat or a crowbar, you ain't gonna make it.""

Does the homeowner think the three men — particularly the one who got shot — will return at some point?

""I doubt it,"" he added to the station. ""Not when he knows that he's got trouble on his hands, too.""

Ivanka Trump met with Ukrainian refugees during a recent visit to Poland,"Ivanka Trump, the popular eldest daughter of former President Donald Trump, recently traveled to Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees and deliver food to families.

The former president’s daughter shared the experience with her followers on social media, the New York Post reported.

She said, “Grateful to have spent the last few days in Krakow & Warsaw to meet Ukrainian and Polish faith leaders who have shown so much compassion & love to Ukrainian families in need & for the opportunity to bear witness to the love, strength & resilience within each of these families.”





Ms. Trump shared photos of her playing the guitar alongside a young girl, chatting with teenage refugees, and standing with a mother and her newborn child.







Her trip materialized through an invitation from CityServe, a non-profit organization that has been delivering food and aid to refugees.



The Daily Mail reported that a spokesperson for the organization said, “There [Ivanka Trump] met with dozens of pastors serving Ukrainians on the frontlines, many of which helped support the one million meal distribution in March.”

“This week, they brought meals, financial support and toys to dozens of Ukrainian families seeking both short-term and long-term refuge in Poland until they can safely return to Ukraine,” the spokesperson added.

Reportedly, Ms. Trump has been involved in several efforts to provide relief to Ukrainians in need since March. CityServe says that she has purchased and helped distribute one million meals into Ukraine and was vital in delivering several cargo planes worth of requested medical supplies that will be distributed among hospitals and clinics throughout Ukraine.

Ms. Trump is just the latest high-profile American figure to visit the Ukrainian people.

In late April, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the U.S. federal government’s role in providing the Ukrainian military with more than $300 million in financing. In early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a delegation of Congressional Democrats met with Zelenskyy to show support for the Ukrainian government. Shortly after Pelosi’s trip to Ukraine, First Lady Jill Biden made a surprise trip to Ukraine and met with her Ukrainian counterpart, Olen Zelenska.

About a week after the first lady’s trip to Ukraine, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell led a delegation of Congressional Republicans to meet with Zelenskyy in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admits Biden's spending worsened inflation,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted in an interview Wednesday that President Joe Biden's big spending has worsened inflation in the United States.

She made the comments in an interview with Matt Murray, the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal.

""As you know, one of the criticisms made for the administration and for the Fed really, in underestimating the toll of inflation, a year ago, one of the criticisms made of the administration, and it really goes back to the prior administration as well, is government stimulus spending related to COVID and the bill that the administration passed over the last year helped feed this,"" Murray said.

""You're an economist, you understand the causes of these phenomena. What's your take on how responsible government spending was in helping contribute to the problem that we're facing now on this front,"" Murray asked.

""So look, inflation is a matter of demand and supply, and the spending that was undertaken in the American Rescue Plan did feed demand,"" Yellen admitted.

""But I do think it was justified and appropriate at the time, given the risks the economy faced,"" she continued. ""At the time that President Biden was inaugurated, we had an economy where forecasters were envisioning very high unemployment for a very long time. We had especially low-wage workers who had been laid off in massive numbers. We saw cars lined up for miles in food banks, Americans worried about not being able to feed their families, get enough to eat. Forecasts were really quite dire.""

Yellen went on to say that high inflation was an unintentional result of the administration trying to avoid another recession and focusing on full employment, which she said was a success.

She also argued that the economy was strong despite facing the impact of the economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Despite the administration trying to pin the blame for high inflation on other causes, polls show that more Americans blame Biden and his policies for the spike in high prices than any other one contributing cause.

Japan moves to accept Ukrainian refugees and rebuild its military as countries continue to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"Japan announced this past week that it would accept Ukrainian refugees displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will send bulletproof vests to Kiev.

Historically, Japan has resisted taking in refugees and has maintained a pacifistic approach to foreign conflicts since the end of World War II. The Washington Post reported that Japan decided to break with its more isolationist tendencies “without ‘gaiastu,’ or foreign pressure.”

It is believed that Russia’s recent attack on a Ukrainian power plant inspired the Japanese government to accelerate debates over its pre-existing defense and national security policies. The Japanese government has been growing wary of China’s rising presence on the global stage and has been reevaluating its approach to stave off the growing territorial threat that China poses.

Akihisa Shiozaki, a member of Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, indicated that the Japanese government is growing increasingly skeptical of the United Nations’ ability to reign in the aggression of its member states.

He said, “It’s a big awakening that there are limitations to what the U.N. can do, limitations to what diplomacy can do, limitations to what economic sanctions can do.”

Regarding the shift in Japan’s policy approach, Shiozaki said, “It’s not about rewriting the boundaries of what Japan can do, but filling in the details of what we may not fully anticipate, or may have overlooked in our preparation.”

He added that Japan’s willingness to accept Ukrainian refugees enables the Japanese government to begin preparing for future refugee crises that may arise.

He said, “In considering future crisis scenarios in East Asia, including the Taiwan contingency, it is necessary to build and maintain the capacity to respond to refugees in times of emergency, even in peacetime.”

Japanese leaders are looking to their former ally, Germany, to see how a pacifist nation might reinstitute defensive measures.

Yoichi Funabashi, the chairman of the Asia Pacific Initiative think tank, said, “Japan is watching now, very much attentively, how Germany is responding to the Ukraine crisis and how fundamentally Germany is transforming to adapt itself to new reality.”

Within a week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany would vastly increase its spending on defense.

And, it appears, that Japan is following suit.

At a recent press conference, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, “Japan needs to implement a fundamental upgrade of its defense capabilities.”

Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, said in a recent T.V. interview that the ongoing reconfiguring the of the global power structure should be cause for the Japanese government to reconsider its approach to self-defense.

Abe said, “We should firmly consider various options when we talk about how we can protect Japan and the lives of its people in this reality.”

He also suggested that Japan should offer to hold nuclear weapons on behalf of the United States as a preemptive defensive measure.

Abe said, “In NATO, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy take part in nuclear sharing, hosting American nuclear weapons. We need to understand how security is maintained around the world and not consider it taboo to have an open discussion.”

Jennifer Rubin is getting hammered on social media for saying Biden's economy is great if you ignore inflation,"Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin was hammered on social media for giving a defense of the economy under President Joe Biden in her newest column.

Rubin argued in her column that if inflation were not a factor that Biden's ""economic performance"" would be ""unmatched.""

She touted the latest jobs report while admitting that high inflation had eaten into the gains made in Americans' wages. Rubin went on to blame inflation on the pandemic, the actions of the Federal Reserve, and finally blamed high gas prices on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Critics of the Biden administration took to Twitter to excoriate Rubin for the nonsensical economic defense.

""This article is incoherent. Much of Biden's 'extraordinary' economic accomplishments (like rising nominal wages) are just side effects of rising prices. You cannot divorce the two & act like inflation is some some separate branch that can be cut off while keeping the good stuff,"" argued Brien Riedl of the Manhattan Institute.

""If the economy weren’t doing badly, it would be good, area woman says,"" replied commentator Drew Holden.

Others used the same formulation Rubin used to mock her claim that Biden was doing a great job despite inflation.

""If it weren’t for the cost, I could afford to fly private,"" joked Charles C.W. Cooke of the National Review.

""If it weren't for IQ points, you would be Einstein,"" replied Ben Shapiro.

""If it weren't for the assassination of her husband, Mary Todd Lincoln would have enjoyed the play,"" joked Andrew Follett of the Club for Growth.

""If it weren't for my lack of a medical degree, my surgical skills would be unmatched,"" mocked Noah Blum.

""Opinion by Cheating Husband: If it weren’t for my ongoing affair, my marriage would be on really solid ground,"" read another mocking tweet.

Disastrous polling and other indicators point to a catastrophic outcome for Democrats in the upcoming November midterms election over high inflation, increasing gas prices, and embarrassing missteps by the Biden administration. Some on the far left, like socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), blame the polling on Biden not pushing for progressive policies.

"First lady Jill Biden made a surprise Mother's Day visit to Ukraine, White House confirms there are no plans for Joe to travel to Kyiv","First lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine this Sunday marking a rare solo as the spouse of a sitting president to visit an active war zone.

Fox News reported that the first lady entered Ukraine by crossing the border from Slovakia on Sunday morning after visiting with Ukrainian refugees at a processing center. Reportedly, she met with Ukrainian first lady Olen Zelenska. The Ukrainian first lady has not been seen in public since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Mrs. Biden said, “I wanted to come on Mother’s Day. I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.”

Zelenska praised her American counterpart for making a “courageous trip” which reportedly occurred as an impromptu stop on the U.S. first lady’s four-day trip to Eastern Europe without her husband.

The first ladies met in a small classroom in front of reporters before holding a private meeting. Zelenska and her children have reportedly remained in an undisclosed location due to safety concerns as Russian officials made it an early priority of their invasion to assassinate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and members of his family.

The two women later joined a group of children who live at the school where they met in making tissue-paper bears to give as Mother’s Day gifts.

The first lady’s visit to Ukraine marks the third high profile meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials.

In late April U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to discuss the U.S. federal government’s role in providing the Ukrainian military with more than $300 million in financing. And in early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi along with the Democratic U.S. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks of New York, and Adam Schiff of California met with Zelenskyy to show support for the Ukrainian government.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also visited Ukraine and held a private meeting with Zelenskyy in the country’s capital city of Kyiv.

President Joe Biden has yet to visit Ukraine or host Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy previously told CNN host Jake Tapper that he thought Biden ought t visit Ukraine because ‘’he is the leader of the United States, and that’s why he should come here to see.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, however, confirmed that there are no plans to send Biden to Ukraine.

She said, “No. No, we are not sending the president to Ukraine.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jill-biden-visits-ukraine,2022-05-08
'Hell freezes over': CNN's Jim Acosta heaps praise on President Trump for D-Day speech,"CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta — a frequent critic of President Donald Trump who just wrote a book about ""the dangers he faces reporting on the current White House"" — delivered high praise for the commander in chief's D-Day speech in Normandy on Thursday.

Acosta's comments were so stunning it caused Fox News to declare hell had frozen over.

What did he say?

President Trump delivered an address overlooking the beaches of Normandy on the 75th anniversary of the World War II allied invasion, with dozens of D-Day veterans seated directly behind him on stage, the Washington Examiner reported.

When the president finished speaking, CNN cut to Acosta, who was reporting on-site from the American cemetery in France, and asked for his assessment of President Trump's remarks.

""I think this is perhaps the most on-message moment of Donald Trump's presidency, today,"" Acosta began. ""We were all wondering whether he would veer from his remarks, go off his script there, but he stayed on script, stayed on message, and I think, rose to the moment, and as he was talking about the men gathered behind him, he described them as being among the greatest Americans who have ever lived. I mean, that could not be any more of a fact check true if we could have found one.""

The reporter and pundit went on to say, ""It really was one of those moments that I think Donald Trump needed to rise to in order to — I think — walk away from the cemetery, walk away from this hallowed ground, and have people back at home saying 'You know what, no matter what I think about the current president of the United States, he said the right thing at Normandy, he did the right thing at Normandy,' he really hit all of the right, I think, moments in that speech when he was paying respect to these heroes who are still with us.""

Acosta also complimented French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke at the ceremony as well, saying he and President Trump both ""were just hitting all the right notes throughout their remarks"" despite the fact that the two ""lately have not been getting along very well with one another.""

What else?

The White House correspondent did feel the need to mention that President Trump was delayed in arriving because he was giving an interview to Fox News ahead of the ceremony, but added, ""Honestly, you have to put all of that to the side and recognize that this was just a really captivating, stirring, remarkable moment for the entire world to witness as politics was just put aside, washed aside, as we remember the bravery and the courage of these men today.""

CNN's Jim Sciutto gets roasted for claiming inflation 'took a breather' in latest economic report,"The latest economic report showed a very minor decrease in the rate of inflation, and many on social media roasted CNN's Jim Sciutto for his characterization of the news on Twitter.

Americans have been struggling with the plague of high inflation caused by the big spending policies of the Democrats, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering damage from the pandemic and an economic shutdown.

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation for the month of April was recorded at 8.3%, a rate historically high, but slightly lower than the rate for March, which clocked in at 8.5%.

Sciutto responded by referring to the minor pause as inflation taking a ""breather"" for the month.

""US inflation took a breather last month for first time since August. Prices still increased, but at a slower pace than in previous months,"" Sciutto tweeted.

""CPI was up 8.3% in 12 mos ending in April - a decrease from the 8.5% recorded in March,"" he added.

Many on social media ripped into Sciutto for the tweet they saw as biased.

""You are an embarrassment,"" read one very popular response.

""Good news! Yesterday the quicksand enveloped me up to my chest, but today it's only up to my nose! I'll be out of here in no time,"" read another popular reply.

""Breaking news…the economy is fixed — in CNN land,"" said Matt Vespa of Townhall.com.

""Embarrassing, you are,"" responded Curtis Houck of Newsbusters.

""You never disappoint,"" said Charles C.W. Cooke of National Review.

The Biden administration has tried to pin the entire blame of inflation on the Russian invasion but polling suggests a plurality of Americans blame Democrats and their policies for the damaging decrease in the value of money.

Outrage mob turns on Jimmy Kimmel after he usurps Quinta Brunson's Emmy Award acceptance,"Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is being accused of using his ""white privilege"" to upstage Quinta Brunson at the Emmy Awards ceremony.

What happened?

While Brunson, creator and lead actress of ABC's hit show ""Abbott Elementary,"" was accepting her award for best Writing for a Comedy Series, Kimmel acted out a skit in which Brunson was forced to step over his body.

When it was time to present the award, Will Arnett dragged Kimmel's body onto the stage and joked about Kimmel having drunk too many ""skinny margaritas."" But Kimmel never got up, and Brunson was forced to give her acceptance speech while standing over his body.

To her credit, Brunson remained professional throughout, gave a touching speech, and then left the stage.

The antics, however, did not go over well.

In fact, fans, especially black fans, saw the incident as yet another instance of a white man stealing the spotlight from the accomplishments of black women.

""If #QuintaBrunson stepping over #JimmyKimmel who literally laid in her spotlight on the day she won an Emmy isn’t a metaphor for what it means to be a [women of color] in a white mans world I don’t know what is,"" Boston University professor Heba Gowayed said.

""Jimmy Kimmel should have left the stage during Quinta’s speech. Highly disrespectful,"" HuffPost editor Philip Lewis said.

""Jimmy Kimmel owes Quinta an apology but the messed up part is every image of her accepting her award has his a** in it. White men really are insufferable,"" Candice Marie Benbow said.

""To me, what Jimmy Kimmel did is worst than Will Smith,"" one person said.

""Where’s Will Smith when you need him?"" another person reacted.

""Just a reminder of how Jimmy Kimmel doesn’t seem to be able to let Black folks shine in really important moments,"" April Reign said.

""I don’t know of a better example of invasive white male privilege than Jimmy Kimmel laying in the middle of Quinta Brunson’s #Emmys2022 speech. He had no business/right to take up space in the way that he did,"" another person said.

""Caucasity is centering your unfunny self and joke as someone wins their first Emmy Award. Jimmy Kimmel ol’ by golly whillickers face a** owes Quinta an apology. Foolishness,"" Luvvie Ajayi said.

""I really don't know how to define white, male privilege more clearly than Jimmy Kimmel not getting out of the way of Quinta Brunson's moment,"" another person said.

What did Brunson say later?

After the awards ceremony, Brunson was asked about Kimmel's controversial skit. She responded with total grace.

""I know Jimmy Kimmel, and I don’t know, I felt like the bit didn’t bother me that much. I don’t know what the internet thinks,"" she said. ""I know him. Jimmy gave me my first big late-night spot and was one of the first people to see ‘Abbott.' He Instagram messaged me that he saw this comedy and thought it was one of the greatest comedies of all time and he was so excited it was going to be on ABC.""

""So in that moment I think I was just really happy that it was Jimmy up there. I kind of consider him one of the comedy godfathers,"" she continued.

""Tomorrow maybe I’ll be mad at him. I’m going to be on his show on Wednesday, so I might punch him in the face,"" she quipped. ""I don’t know. We'll see what happens.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-outrage-quinta-brunson,2022-09-13
Joe Biden remains isolated in Delaware as Putin flexes his nukes,"Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine continuing to escalate, President Joe Biden remains at his private estate in Delaware.

Fox News reported that Biden remains at his private residence in Delaware and that the media is having difficulty making contact with the administration.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed ""aggressive"" rhetoric from NATO members and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he chose to increase Russia's preparedness to use nuclear weapons.

Putin said, ""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country.""

""Senior officials of the leading NATO countries also allow aggressive statements against our country,"" the Russian president continued, ""Therefore I order the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.""

Last week, Putin warned that countries who interfere with the Russian invasion of Ukraine will face ""consequences you have never seen.""

Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer, said, ""[Putin] is right now threatening a nuclear escalation. This is a veiled threat – or maybe such a veiled threat – he just met with his chief of general staff and minister of defense. He is escalating the conflict into the nuclear domain in order to de-escalate – that is, topple Kyiv's regime quickly.""

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, ""It is not entirely clear if Mr. Putin has designs beyond the Ukraine, and it's because that's not perfectly clear that we continue to look for ways to bolster our NATO capabilities and to reassure our allies. I mean, one of the reasons we're doing this is because we want to make it clear to him that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

The Republican congressman from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger, referred to Putin's nuclear escalation as a ""bluff"" and suggested that Putin was merely posturing to make people fear Russia's capabilities.

He said, ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind blowing. We used to call his bluff. This is the Soviet Cold War play to make the public fear Russia.""

On Saturday, Western leaders issued a joint statement committing them to ending Russia's ability to access and use the SWIFT financial telecommunication network. By doing so, the West isolated Russia's economy, making it virtually impossible for them to conduct trade with their international partners.

Joe Biden signs bills authorizing $40 billion in aid to Ukraine and to increase access to baby formula while in Asia,"On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed legislation that would authorize giving Ukraine an additional $40 billion in financial support as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine drags on.

This new legislation previously passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, CNBC reported, and deepens the U.S.’s commitment to Ukraine at a time of uncertainty as the Russian invasion enters its fourth month.

Ukraine has successfully defended its capital city of Kyiv as the Russian military refocuses its forces in the country’s eastern regions. Reportedly, American officials are warning that the Russian invasion could drag on for even longer.

The $40 billion aid package is intended to provide support for Ukraine through September and is considerably larger than an earlier emergency financing package that approved $13.6 billion.

Of the $40 billion, $20 billion is allocated for military assistance, ensuring the Ukrainian military has access to advanced weapons that will be used to slow the Russian military’s offensives; $8 billion is being allocated for general support of the Ukrainian economy; $5 billion will be used to address “global food shortages” that may arise from the recent collapse of Ukraine’s agricultural industry; and, more than $1 billion will be used to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees.

Biden signed the spending package while in the middle of his trip to Asia. According to a White House official, a separate U.S. official brought a copy of the unsigned bill on a commercial flight to Seoul for Biden to sign.

The fact that Biden signed the spending bill while abroad reflects the U.S.’s growing sense of urgency to continue providing support for Ukraine while overlapping international challenges pressure the president. While the Biden administration is reportedly working to reconfigure policy to confront China, it also is working to redirect American resources to accommodate Ukraine amid the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

While on his trip to Asia, Biden also signed an unrelated measure intended to increase access to baby formula while supplies remain scare in the U.S. This legislation is said to allow government benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — also known as WIC — to be used to buy more types of infant formula.

According to Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, the Biden administration knew that a baby formula shortage was imminent as early as this past February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-signs-bills-authorizing-40-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-and-to-increase-access-to-baby-formula,2022-05-21
John Kerry's response to Ukraine invasion: 'I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate',"John Kerry cautioned Wednesday that Russia's war on Ukraine will distract the international community from one of the Biden administration's top national security priorities: climate change.

The former secretary of state and current U.S. special envoy for climate was discussing Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine during an interview on BBC Arabic when he said the war will have ""massive emissions consequences"" for the entire world.

""I'm very concerned about, I'm concerned about Ukraine because of the people of Ukraine and because of the principles that are at risk, in terms of international law and trying to change boundaries of international law by force. I thought we lived in a world that had said no to that kind of activity. And I hope diplomacy will win,"" Kerry said.

""But massive emissions consequences to the war but equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know hopefully President Putin would realize that in the Northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk. And the people of Russia are at risk,"" he added. ""And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry's comments echo comments he made in an interview Sunday, when he told GZERO Media's Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what's necessary"" to fight climate change.

""Ukraine, one way or the other — we're going to resolve it, ultimately, over X number of years. But the climate crisis remains existential, just as it was before the Ukraine crisis came up,"" Kerry said, before the invasion began.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its sovereign neighbor Ukraine Thursday with ground, air, and naval forces in the largest military campaign by one state against another in Europe since World War II.

Ukrainian cities have been attacked with shelling and airstrikes. Civilians have either attempted to flee or made makeshift bomb shelters in subway systems. Reports indicate there are hundreds of casualties, although the exact numbers of injured or dead remain unknown in this chaotic, ongoing war.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Thursday that the Russian army destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities, including 11 airbases, just hours after launching the invasion.

Ukraine said Thursday morning that at least 40 soldiers and 10 civilians had been killed in the conflict.



In the context of widespread suffering in Ukraine caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin's war, Republican lawmakers blasted Kerry's statements about climate change.

""Climate change religious zealot John Kerry is worried that the first major ground war in Europe in 80 years & #Putin’s threat of nuclear consequences is getting more attention than his climate agenda,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted.

""As Sec. of State, John Kerry did nothing to stop the invasion of Crimea, all for an unenforceable agreement to fight the air. Now that his chickens came home to roost, he’s more worried about emissions from war & distraction from the climate than the slaughter in #Ukraine,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.).



""Putin is killing innocent Ukrainians and John Kerry is asking him to stay 'on track' for the climate? Despicable,"" Rep. August Pfluger (R-Fla.) remarked. ""Russian energy is some of the worst for the environment. The Biden Admin climate religion has made our world less safe.""

"Boris Johnson says 'toxic masculinity' led to war in Ukraine, suggests that a woman wouldn't have started the war","A female Russian president would never have invaded Ukraine, so says British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

According to Business Insider, Johnson sat down with German news outlet ZDF shortly following the G7 summit and blamed much of Vladimir Putin's behavior, especially the war in Ukraine, on his male identity.

""If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn't, if he were, I really don't think he would have embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has,"" Johnson said, per ZDF.

""If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it's what he's doing in Ukraine,"" Johnson continued.

However, despite his criticisms of Putin, Johnson does not foresee the war in Ukraine coming to a conclusion any time soon, telling ZDF that there is ""no possible deal"" between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at present.



The gendered nature of Johnson's comments likely stems from various gender equality conversations he and other leaders had throughout the three-day summit. According to Kevin Liptak of CNN, ""Gender equality was one of the themes of this year's G7, where leaders dedicated an entire working session to the subject.""

Though there was no formal G7 discussion about the Dobbs decision from the United States Supreme Court, which effectively overturned Roe v. Wade, the topic did simmer under the surface.

""We have discussed gender equality and indeed, there were many voices, very sad and very worried about the setback,"" European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

President Biden has expressed similar frustrations about the Dobbs decision.

Biden and Johnson joined Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi for the summit. Though many of their conversations were of a serious nature, Johnson and others still found a way to poke fun at Putin, who was not in attendance.

When Johnson joked with photographers about whether the group should keep their jackets on or take them off, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replied, “Let’s wait for the picture.”

“We all have to show we’re tougher than Putin,” Johnson then said in jest, referring to the famous photograph taken of Putin while he was riding horseback shirtless in 2009.

“We’re going to get the bare-chested horseback-riding display,” Trudeau agreed.

“Oh, yes! Horseback riding is the best,” von der Leyen added.

“We got to show them our pecs,” Johnson said to close out the joke.

Jon Stewart defends Joe Rogan from misinformation claims,"For the second time in the past two weeks, liberal Jon Stewart defended Joe Rogan. In his latest defense of Rogan, Stewart highlighted a major news narrative that the corporate media previously got incorrect, while simply wondering who gets to decide what is misinformation.

Legacy media pundits and musician Neil Young have accused Rogan of spreading COVID-19 pandemic misinformation, which the prolific podcaster has refuted.

During a recent episode of ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"" podcast, the former host of the ""Daily Show"" warned of ""shifting sands"" when reporting ever-changing news. Stewart rehashed how legacy media pushed the ""weapons of mass destruction"" narrative in the early 2000s that led up to the Iraq War. In 2005, the CIA's top weapons inspector in Iraq declared that Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction – which the premise was used to justify the 2003 invasion.

""In the Iraq War, I was on the side of what you would think on the mainstream is misinformation,"" Stewart said. ""I was promoting what they would call misinformation.""

""But it turned out to be right years later and the establishment media was wrong,"" he continued. ""And not only were they wrong, in some respects, you could make the case that they enabled a war that killed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people and never paid a price for it and never had accountability. And just having an ombudsman print a retraction to me isn't accountability.""

""The New York Times,right, was a giant purveyor of misinformation, and disinformation,"" Stewart recalled. ""I don't know if the Times was purposeful, but misinformation. And that’s as vaunted a media organization as you can find, but there was no accountability for them.""

""And I think where I get nervous is in the run-up to the Iraq War and in the prosecution of the Iraq War, I was very vocal … about that. But the mainstream view, the New York Times, was, ‘They have weapons of mass destruction, they have these tubes that can only be used for nuclear war, Saddam Hussein is this, he's that.'""

Stewart notes that his beliefs weren't labeled as ""misinformation"" at the time and wasn't censored by Comedy Central or Viacom when he railed against the popular legacy media narrative regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

""So it's very easy to attack Rogan … and I'm not saying that that's not your right and that there aren't things there to talk about, but what I'm saying is let's be careful because the sands can shift,"" Stewart added.

Earlier this month, Stewart defended Rogan.

""Don't leave, don't abandon, don't censor, engage,"" Stewart advised critics of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" host. He emphasized, ""Someone like a Joe Rogan who is not, in my mind, an ideologue in any way,"" is a ""person that you can engage with.""

Another person who pointed out that the legacy media has been ""so catastrophically wrong about so many important things"" is political commentator Dave Smith.

In a recent episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" featuring Smith, he listed all the ""lies"" that the mainstream media propagated in the past 20 years, including weapons of mass destruction.

""These are lies where hundreds of thousands of people have died as a result of the lies,"" Smith said. ""So not just spreading misinformation, misinformation with catastrophic consequences where real human beings have had their lives ruined.""

The libertarian podcaster also noted that the corporate media spreads misinformation about Rogan, making a reference to CNN repeatedly claiming that Rogan used ""horse dewormer"" to treat COVID-19.

"Journalist Glenn Greenwald reveals horrifying home invasion story in which he was bound, tortured, and held at gunpoint by 5 suspects","Journalist Glenn Greenwald says that no less than five men robbed him at gunpoint during a home invasion in March.

What are the details?

In a lengthy essay, Greenwald revealed that he was alone at a Rio de Janeiro-area farm he and his family were renting when the harrowing incident took place.

Greenwald, who is married to Brazilian politician David Michael Miranda, said that his husband and their two children were not at the farm when the purported robbery took place.

""I've begun my day for the last five months by feeding the chickens, rabbits, ducks, swans and peacocks that are there: a perfect way to connect to farming life,"" he wrote. ""My husband and our two children had spent the week in Rio because the kids had school entrance exams that required a faster internet connection than is available at the farm. Because March 5 was the day before my birthday, they had all planned to come to the farm that day, but decided at the last second that they would come early the next morning instead.""



That evening, he recalled, he was at the farm with an off-duty police officer working security for Greenwald and his family.

""At roughly 9:30 p.m. that night, I was speaking with a friend on the telephone when I noticed that our dogs — twelve of whom were at the farm, with the rest at home — were barking incessantly and intensely for a sustained period of time, which is unusual,"" he continued. ""I ended the call to see why they were so agitated and walked out of the house toward the gate where I heard them.""

Greenwald explained that within seconds, three suspects wearing black masks and pointing guns swarmed him.

""They told me to walk toward a small stand-alone room near the house and began pushing me to go faster,"" he explained. ""Soon as I entered, I saw that two other armed men had detained the security guard, the off-duty cop, and had him laying face-down on the floor as they stood over him with guns pointed at his head.""



Greenwald said he first suspected he was victim of a targeted political attack due to threats he said he'd been receiving.

""I was relieved, to the extent one can be in such a situation, when they began demanding money,"" he said. ""Because most of what we have has remained in our home, I did not have much of value there: a couple hundred dollars, some kitchen appliances, and clothes for ourselves and our kids. They did not believe that, which drove them to a considerable amount of anger.""

It got worse from there.

'Psychological terror'

Keeping him tied up for at least an hour, the suspects reportedly grilled him over whether there were more valuables at the farm.

""Driven by the belief that I was hiding valuables — refusing to believe my assurances that I would not do that with five men pointing guns at me — they attempted various forms of psychological terror,"" Greenwald recalled. ""They repeatedly threatened to shoot the police officer in the head, repeatedly kicked him so hard that they cracked several of his ribs, ordered me to open my mouth and stuck a gun in it as they demanded to know where the rest of the money was, smashed my phone and tablet against a wall when they could not figure out how to erase the hard-drive, and just generally tried to create a climate of extreme fear. Most of the hour was spent with them ransacking every part of the farm, including our kids' rooms.""



Greenwald said that when they were satisfied that there were no more valuables with which to abscond, they demanded his car keys.

""They then ordered both of us to go to a separate small house near the back of the farm,"" he wrote. ""They put us in a room, used cords to tie our arms behind our backs and bound our legs together, then locked the door. Once we heard the car leave, we worked on freeing ourselves, which took roughly fifteen minutes, and then used the computer they had idiotically left to call my husband and the other police officers who work with us at the farm.""



Greenwald said that police were able to quickly identify the suspects after they made several missteps, including using a car registered to his husband, a member of Congress, and more.

""Between the five of them, they stole ... no more than two thousand dollars worth of value: a small amount of cash, a microwave, kitchen appliances and even food such as large packs of rice and beans,"" he wrote. ""The most valuable item they took was the police officer's gun.""



It took three weeks for the officer — who is now on psychiatric leave from the force — to recover physically from the attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/journalist-reveals-horrifying-home-invasion-story-in-which-was-bound-and-held-at-gunpoint,2021-04-05
Leftist Joy Behar blasted for saying Biden gets 'the benefit of the doubt' over classified documents because he's not a 'liar and a thief' like Trump,"Leftist co-host of ""The View"" Joy Behar is getting blasted on social media for saying that Democrat President Joe Biden gets ""the benefit of the doubt"" over classified documents found in an office he used when he was vice president because Biden isn't a ""liar and a thief"" like former President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

A segment on Tuesday's show dealt with classified documents found last fall in Biden's private office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. Some of the documents reportedly are labeled ""top secret.""

""The View"" played a CNN clip showing Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds criticizing how the Biden situation is being handled compared to when classified documents were found at Trump's Florida home in Mar-a-Lago.

“Number one, what was [Biden] doing with classified information in his possession?"" Donalds asked. ""Number two, why did it take six years? I want to stress this for the American people: Joe Biden left the vice presidency in 2017. Point number three, and this is the one that’s most important, everybody can go back to the Hillary Clinton email saga, we know other presidents have had classified information, but why was there a raid on Mar-a-Lago, but now this [Biden] story just kinda seeps out, and everybody's saying, ‘Oh, we want to get down to the bottom of it,’ and everybody’s giving the benefit of the doubt.""

With that, Whoopi Goldberg — another well-known, left-leaning co-host of ""The View"" — got a tad perturbed: “Well, aside from the facts that Biden turned over the documents as soon as they were found and has been cooperating with authorities — unlike some folks who had to have a subpoena and said they turned over everything.""

The audience reacted with applause.

She continued: “We do not know anything about the nature of this, okay? So let’s keep that in mind. But I’m just saying, Byron needs to calm down a little bit, 'cause there are some, perhaps, differences here. The optics are not necessarily the best. So, is it good news for you-know-who [i.e., Trump]?”

'We all know that Trump is a liar and a thief'

Behar then doubled down on Goldberg's defense of Biden.

“Not really. I think what you just said is right, that there are differences in what happened,"" Behar said before dropping her first big bomb. “We all know that Trump is a liar and a thief, you know? We know that.""

The cheering crowd loved it.

'We don’t think that Biden is a liar and a thief, so we give him the benefit of the doubt'



""So, it’s not that big a jump to say that he obstructed and he lied,"" Behar continued. ""We don’t think that Biden is a liar and a thief, so we give him the benefit of the doubt. That’s partly what’s going on.”

Behar added that ""no matter what the truth of it is,"" Republicans ""will spin it,"" saying the Biden classified document controversy is ""just as bad as Trump. And so the lie gets out there ... people believe it ...""

After a bit of chatter, Behar concluded by saying that ""the lying has been so invasive, so ubiquitous, that no one will believe the truth anymore. And you can put that at the feet of Donald Trump, who started the lying.""

Pushback

New co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin interjected: ""Absolutely no one's gonna like this take, but I'm gonna go there anyway. It is a big deal. I held a [top secret] security clearance; I would've been in prison if I took one classified document home.""

Goldberg and Behar immediately went to bat for Biden again, saying he didn't actually take the documents home, and then Griffin acknowledged that ""the facts are different than the Trump case.""

""However,"" she added, ""I think this is a huge win for Trump because if you're [U.S. Attorney General] Merrick Garland — who is already extremely cautious and doesn't want to break the long-standing precedent of not indicting a president — it's very hard to make the case that Donald Trump should be indicted for this, even though the facts are different ...""

Here's the clip:

How are folks reacting to Behar's take?

Behar got thumped on social media for saying Biden gets the ""benefit of the doubt"" in regard to handling classified documents compared to Trump. The following are but a few examples:

""Leave it to Behar to make monumentally stupid statements in her effort to outdo Whoopi in the race to prove who is the most ignorant and biased leftist on 'The View,'"" one Twitter commenter stated.

""Behar is a moron,"" another user said. ""Not a bit of common sense … we should ignore Biden taking classified documents when only a VP just because he is not Trump. Close similarities to a horse [with] blinders on.""

""You gotta love how Joy (less) Behar says rules are only applied toward Trump because she doesn't like him, but not to Biden,"" another commenter declared. ""'Nothing to see. This is fine...everything is fine...'""

Another user observed that Behar ""doesn't think the guy whose entire 50+ year career has been nothing but lies... literally nothing but lies...she doesn't think he's a liar. Everyone lies. Politicians especially lie. But if Trump lived to be 200 years old, he couldn't hold a candle to Biden's record.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-behar-says-biden-benefit-of-doubt,2023-01-11
Joy Behar shredded for jaw-dropping complaints that Ukraine invasion might interfere with her swanky European vacation plans,"Joy Behar, co-host on ""The View,"" is facing heavy backlash after selfishly complaining that the Ukraine-Russia crisis could derail her plans for a European vacation.

What are the details?

Behar on Thursday — the very day Russian forces invaded Ukraine — expressed her concerns that the ongoing conflict might affect her plans to visit Italy for a lavish vacation.

The panel began by discussing the escalating war during the broadcast, prompting co-host Sunny Hostin to express her fears for those Ukrainians who might end up injured or dead due to the ongoing conflict.

""What I also thought about was the fact that estimates are 50,000 Ukrainians will be dead or wounded and that this is going to start a humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis in Europe,"" she explained. ""We’re talking about 5 million people that are going to be displaced. It’s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.""

Even co-host Whoopi Goldberg added that the conflict was ""so disheartening.""

""The people in Russia, they don't want this war,"" she added. ""[Putin] wants it because he's trying to hold on.""



Behar, however, appeared to care little for human suffering, casualties, and displacement and said that she was concerned that her trip to Italy might be derailed.

""Well, I'm scared of what's going to happen in Western Europe, too. You know, you plan a trip, you want to go there,"" she attempted to reason. ""[I wanted] to go to Italy for four years. I haven't been able to make it because of the pandemic — and now this. It's like, what's going to happen there, too?""

What was the reaction?

Much of social media condemned Behar's remarks.

Leading the criticism was Barstool Sports writer Kevin Clancy, who castigated Behar for her apparent selfishness.

""The true horror of the worldwide pandemic and Russia invading Ukraine? Joy Behar hasn't been able to take her trip to Italy,"" Clancy wrote on Twitter. ""Thoughts and Prayers for Joy. We hope she makes it through this tragedy.""

New York Post and Fox News writer Karol Markowicz added, ""Did Putin even stop to think how his invasion would affect Joy Behar's trip to Italy?""







Washington Times columnist Tim Young spat, ""Joy Behar is elitist trash.""

He later added, ""Joy Behar is the perfect liberal Karen... she doesnt care about people getting killed in Ukraine, just that this might interrupt her trips to Italy.""

A widely liked tweet from user Joanne Mason read, ""God grant me the absolute confidence and egocentricity of Joy Behar complaining that a war ruined her vacation plans while the bombs are still literally dropping.""

Even Behar fans turned their backs on the co-host over the remarks.

One user wrote, ""She sounded so damned entitled when she said that and I actually like her.""

""I'm old and say dumb stuff sometimes too, but holy hell, she was being just startlingly oblivious,"" another user added.

Twitter user Sarara chimed in, ""Can you even imagine being so privileged, so removed from reality, so far up your own colon that you’d respond to a massive humanitarian crisis by complaining about your hypothetical vacation being disrupted? Seriously, what the hell @JoyVBehar?""

Behar has yet to issue a clarification or apology for the offending and insensitive remarks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-behar-shredded-for-complaining-that-ukraine-invasion-could-interfere-with-her-swanky-european-vacation-plans,2022-02-25
Judge authorizes forced abortion for UK Catholic woman due to her disabilities and mood disorder,"A Catholic woman in the United Kingdom may be forced to get an abortion against her will after a judge ruled that it was ""in her best interests"" to terminate the pregnancy due to her developmental disabilities and mood disorder, according to the Catholic News Agency.

The unidentified woman in her 20s is 22 weeks pregnant, and suffers from developmental disabilities that reportedly have left her with the mental capacity of a grade school-aged child. The origin of the pregnancy, whether it was conceived consensually or not, is unknown and under police investigation.

Justice Nathalie Lieven acknowledged how invasive her ruling is to the woman's rights, but still said the need for the abortion outweighed that.

""I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" Lieven ruled. ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""

The woman is under the care of the United Kingdom's National Health Service under an NHS trust, and her doctors have said the abortion would be less traumatic for the woman than giving birth and giving up the child to foster care. The judge agreed, and suggested that the baby, while unborn, is not ""real"" yet.

""I think [the woman] would suffer greater trauma from having a baby removed [from her care],"" Lieven said. ""...it would at that stage be a real baby.""

The woman's mother has told both the doctors and the court that she would take care of the baby. She is reportedly a registered midwife. Lieven believes that it would be too much for the mother to care for her daughter and granddaughter.

Abortion is legal in the UK until 24 week of pregnancy. After that, doctors must certify that it is in the medical interest of the mother to have an abortion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-rules-uk-catholic-woman-must-get-an-abortion-against-her-will-due-to-disabilities-mood-disorder,2019-06-22
"Judge: Teen rape suspect accused of filming act shouldn't be tried as adult since he's from 'good family,' could attend 'good college'","A New Jersey judge denied a prosecutor's request to try a 16-year-old rape suspect — accused of filming an assault against an intoxicated girl and sending video to his friends — as an adult because he's from a ""good family"" and is likely to get into a ""good college,"" NBC News reported.

The ""young man comes from a good family who put him into an excellent school where he was doing extremely well. He is clearly a candidate for not just college but probably for a good college. His scores for college entry were very high,"" Judge James Troiano said as part of a July 2018 decision, the network noted, while adding the accused also is an Eagle Scout.

But an appeals court last month overturned Troiano's ruling and warned him against showing leniency to juveniles of privilege, noting that ""juveniles who do not come from good families and do not have good test scores"" may not receive the same treatment, NBC News said. The teen now can be tried as an adult, the outlet added.



What's the background?



The suspect — identified in court papers as G.M.C. — videotaped himself in 2017 with a 16-year-old girl called ""Mary"" in a closed off area of a dark basement during a ""pajama-themed"" party and sent the clip to friends with a text: ""When your first time having sex was rape,"" the network said, citing the appeals court ruling.

While the suspect also was drunk, the girl's ""speech was slurred, and she stumbled as she walked,"" NBC News said, citing the ruling.

""While on the sofa, a group of boys sprayed Febreze on [the girl's] bottom and slapped it with such force that the following day she had hand marks on her buttocks,"" the network said, citing the ruling.

More from NBC News:

G.M.C. then penetrated Mary from behind in a home-gym portion of the basement. In the video he sent to seven friends, her torso is exposed, and her head is hanging down. One of the friends said that the video showed Mary's head hitting against the wall repeatedly.



Prosecutors said that during the assault, the door to the gym was blocked by a foosball table, and the lights were off.



""[G.M.C.'s] conduct as it relates to the charged offenses was both sophisticated and predatory. He was aware of the off-limits areas in advance of the party,"" prosecutors said, adding that ""filming a cellphone video while committing the assault was a deliberate act of debasement.""

The victim learned that G.M.C. was sending the video to his friends and asked him to stop, the network said — and when he didn't, her family pressed charges.

New Jersey prosecutors can push juvenile cases to adult trials for serious crimes if suspects are age 15 and older, NBC News said, adding that the teen in this case — if tried as an adult — would have faced counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, two counts of third-degree invasion of privacy, and would have had to register as a sex offender.

What else did the judge say?



Troiano — now 69 — ""expressed concern that the prosecutor did not indicate ... that she had explained to Mary and her mother the devastating effect"" adult charges would have on G.M.C.'s life, the network said, citing the appeals court ruling.

""Some people would argue that, you know ... how could she possibly have gotten as drunk as she says she was?"" he also asked, NBC News said. ""That's really not important. I think it's an issue here, whether or not this young lady was intoxicated to the point that she didn't understand what was going on.""

Troiano also questioned the rape accusation, the network said, saying a rape to him means ""two or more generally males involved, either at gunpoint or weapon, clearly manhandling a person into ... an area where ... there was nobody around, sometime in an abandon[ed] house, sometimes in an abandon[ed] shed, shack, and just simply taking advantage of the person as well as beating the person, threatening the person.""

As for G.M.C.'s text saying the act was a rape, Troiano said his words were ""just a 16-year-old boy saying stupid crap to his friends,"" NBC News said.

""[D]o I believe that it shows in any way a calculation or cruelty on his part or sophistication or a predatory nature?"" the judge added, according to the network. ""No, I do not.""

Appeals court disagrees

But the appeals court said the prosecution showed ""the delinquent act in question, if committed by an adult in this case, would have been aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault,"" and that ""the judge decided the case for himself,"" NBC News said.

G.M.C.'s attorney, Mitchell J. Ansell, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the network reported.

More from NBC News:

Three days after the ruling on Troiano's decision, the New Jersey appeals court reversed a decision by another state family court judge, Marcia Silva of Middlesex County, against having a 16-year-old accused of raping a 12-year-old charged in adult court.



Silva argued that the alleged victim and the 16-year-old were the only witnesses, and ""there is little, if any, tangible evidence.""



""The judge went on to say that even if this 12-year-old's statement was true, the offense is not an especially heinous or cruel offense,"" the appeals court's ruling said.



""Beyond losing her virginity,"" Silva said of the 12-year-old, prosecutors did not claim that she ""suffered any further injuries, either physical, mental or emotional.""



But the appeals court ruled that the 16-year-old was culpable, even if the victim had not said ""no"" — as prosecutors said she had — because she was 12 at the time of the alleged assault.



""It was not the judge's role to essentially try the matter or substitute her judgment for that of the prosecutor,"" the appeals court said in the decision.

Peter McAleer, director of communications and community relations for New Jersey Courts, told the network that neither Troiano or Silva were commenting on the cases — and that Troiano is retired but still serves periodically.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-teen-rape-suspect-not-adult-since-hes-from-good-family-could-attend-good-college,2019-07-03
"Despite evidence, Jussie Smollett's lawyer claims the actor is victim of 'media gangbang'","Hours after it was announced a grand jury indicted actor Jussie Smollett on 16 felony charges for filing two false police reports related to his alleged hate crime hoax, the actor's defense attorney, Mark Geragos, claimed his client is the victim of a ""media gangbang.""

Geragos, speaking with CNN's Anderson Cooper, emphasized the unprecedented nature of Friday's announcement, condemning the fact that Smollett has been found guilty in the court of public opinion.

""What is happening here is, frankly, a media gangbang of this guy of unprecedented proportions,"" Geragos claimed. ""That's the reason I got into this. I've never seen a media pendulum swing more quickly and more viciously and rob somebody of their presumption of innocence like this case has. It's startling the way people assume he's guilty.""

Geragos also took issue with the indictment itself, which included one charge of disorderly conduct for each of Smollett's eight alleged lies to two separate police officers.

""I defy anybody to find any indictment anywhere where somebody has brought 16 counts for being a victim of a hate crime,"" Geragos said.

For his part, Cooper did not buy much of what Geragos was selling, noting how ""weird"" Smollett's story is — if true at all.

In a separate statement after Cook County announced the indictment, Geragos called the charges ""overkill.""

""This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal invasion of Jussie's privacy in tampering with his medical records. Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,"" he said, according to TMZ.

Three kids ages 12 to 15 wanted for murder and home invasion lead police on a wild 120 mph chase,"A group of kids aged 12 to 15 were arrested in Georgia on Friday after leading police on a wild 120 m.p.h. highway chase — three of them were wanted on murder and home invasion charges.

What are the details?

Police in Camden County, Georgia, had to use spike strips to stop a black Honda Accord they encountered traveling southbound on Interstate 95 at dangerous speeds Friday night, according to a post on the Kingsland Police Department's Facebook page.

Officers reportedly first noticed the car traveling 96 m.p.h. on the highway and attempted to conduct a traffic stop, but the driver responded by speeding up to 120 m.p.h. in an attempt to flee. The vehicle eventually exited the interstate and made a U-turn allowing the officers to lay down the strips.

Upon successfully stopping the vehicle, officers discovered that it was a 12-year-old boy who had been driving. Inside the vehicle were three more passengers all under the age of 15.

4 Jacksonville kids arrested after high-speed chase, 3 wanted for murder www.youtube.com

But the shocking news only continued after officers ran the occupants' names through a police database and discovered that three of them, including the driver, had active warrants out for their arrest for home invasion and second-degree murder in Duval County, Florida.



In all, police arrested three boys aged 12, 14, and 15, along with a 15-year-old girl. The four individuals are currently being held at a youth detention center, WJAX-TV reported.

The 12-year-old faces a litany of new charges as a result of the high-speed chase, including theft by bringing stolen property into the state, speeding, reckless driving, fleeing and attempting to elude, and fugitive from justice.

The other occupants face charges of theft by receiving stolen property and with fugitive from justice.

What else?

Authorities have so far refused to say which deadly home invasion the juveniles were arrested for taking part in, though WJAX pointed to a report from last week involving a group of minors breaking into a home on Huron St. and killing a 28-year-old man.

The break-in was reportedly caught on surveillance video and showed seven boys and one girl coming into the house, five of them with handguns.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office sent the news outlet the following statement: ""It does appear at least two of the subjects located in the stolen vehicle in Georgia are tied to an active investigation here in Jacksonville. Detectives continue to work diligently to identify those that may have played a part in the crime. As such, we are unable to provide additional details into the investigation at this time — to do so would impede further investigative efforts, arrests and/or prosecution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/juveniles-arrested-murder-home-invasion-after-high-speed-chase,2021-09-15
"Despite 2 million illegal immigrants stealing into US under her watch, Vice President Kamala Harris claims, 'We have a secure border'","In an NBC ""Meet the Press"" segment filmed in Texas, which aired on September 11, Vice President Kamala Harris discussed border security with host Chuck Todd. Citing the record-breaking number of illegal aliens who have stolen across the southern border into the U.S. over the past year, Todd asked Harris, ""Would you call the border secure?""

Harris first responded by suggesting what needs to be done is ""pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship."" She then answered Todd's question with a caveat: ""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system.""

So far in 2022, there have been over 1,946,780 encounters with illegal aliens at the southern border, surpassing last year's totals, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection had 1,734,686 such encounters. Over 69% of these illegal aliens are single adults. As a point of comparison, in former President Trump's final year in office, there were 458,088 encounters at the southern border.

Todd pressed Harris on whether she was indeed confident in the border's security.

Harris responded: ""We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration.""

She reiterated her earlier claim that it is a priority of the Biden administration to ""put into place a law and a plan for a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people who are here and are prepared to do what is legally required to gain citizenship.""

The amnesty push

Democrats have long sought to confer amnesty and ultimately citizenship on millions of illegal aliens.

Then-candidate Joe Biden indicated during his 2020 campaign that he would seek to work with Congress on ""providing a road map for citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants.""

Upon taking power, the Biden administration introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would have set illegal aliens up for citizenship and provided green cards to others present in the U.S. illegally. Since Republicans would not support such a measure, the bill died.

Democrat lawmakers tried to get amnesty provisions into the Build Back Better Act, which would have provided amnesty to at least 7 million illegal aliens and work authorizations to many more. The bill passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate.

Is the border really ""secure""?

In response to Harris' remarks on ""Meet the Press,"" Rep. Mayra Flores (R-Texas) told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Harris ""has done nothing for us in South Texas to secure the borders. She's useless.""



Arizona Governor Doug Ducey (R) tweeted on Sunday that ""VP Harris and President Biden are clueless when it comes to border security. Let's call this for what it is: an Open Border Policy.""

In another tweet, Ducey wrote: ""Border security is clearly NOT a priority for the Biden Administration. They have NO IDEA what's happening at their nation's southern border.""

Referencing the recent revelation that over 66 suspects on a U.S. terror watch list had been caught illegally crossing the border, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) wrote: ""How many got away undetected? Border security is national security. Under the Biden administration, we have neither.""

In August, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) suggested that ""The Biden Regime has facilitated an invasion of our sovereign borders of more than 4.2 million illegal aliens since January 2021.""

According to Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, the perception that illegal aliens are permitted into the U.S. under the Biden administration's policies has spurred more criminal traffic across the border. ""In my experience, we have seen increases [in illegal immigration] when there are no consequences.""

Harris' past remarks regarding border security



Harris stated on ABC's ""The View"" in 2019 that illegal aliens should not be treated as criminals. ""It should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal one,"" she said. ""We can't treat people like criminals when they are crossing the border.""



In her 2019 book ""The Truths We Hold,"" Harris noted that ""a wall on the border with Mexico was a total waste of taxpayer money.""

She explained to NPR that she ""would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge.""

When Trump suggested he would send the U.S. military to secure the southern border until the border wall was completed, Harris claimed that doing so was about ""vilifying people"" and that there were more pressing issues such as ""climate change, because guess what, guy, it's real and it's a crisis.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-claims-border-is-secure,2022-09-12
"Kamala Harris mercilessly mocked for saying voters 'got what they asked for' by electing her, Joe Biden","Vice President Kamala Harris was torn to shreds on social media after saying during a speech Monday that voters ""got what they asked for"" by electing her and President Joe Biden to office.

What are the details?

Harris was speaking at a Black History Month event at the White House, and she brought up Biden's recent nomination of Judge Ketanji Jackson to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Jackson would be the first black woman to sit on the highest court in the land.

Harris noted what she viewed as ""the assault on the freedom to vote"" in the U.S. and then mentioned Jackson.

""And that is why I felt such pride and such hope — understanding how votes lead to action through elections — it is why I felt such pride and such hope this past Friday when President Joe Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ... to sit on the United States Supreme Court,"" Harris said to applause. ""Because, as we all know, elections matter. And when folks vote, they order what they want. And in this case, they got what they asked for.""

Amid further applause, Harris admitted that she ""went off script a little bit"" and then let loose with her familiar laugh.

It's not clear which of her words were ""off script,"" but one could argue Harris meant Jackson's nomination when she said voters ""got what they asked for."" However, there's a bit of a factual problem with such a conclusion.

Because even though Biden made it a campaign promise that he would choose a black woman as his first Supreme Court nominee, a recent poll showed the vast majority of Americans — 76% — wanted Biden to ""consider all possible nominees"" and not nominate anyone to the high court based solely on race or gender. Only 23% of the ABC News/Ipsos poll respondents wanted Biden to stick with his campaign promise.

So exactly how is Jackson's nomination what voters ""asked for""? If that's not what Harris meant, has the Biden/Harris administration given voters ""what they asked for"" so far?

What happened next?

Charlie Spiering — White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — tweeted a shortened version of Harris on the microphone saying ""elections matter. And when folks vote, they order what they want. And in this case, they got what they asked for. I went off script a little bit.""

And then Shane Goldmacher — national political reporter for the New York Times — piggybacked on Spiering's clip:

With that, notable critics blasted Harris to bits, turning their attention to the Biden/Harris administration's colossal failures after just one year running the show:

Others couldn't have agreed more:

Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota quipped, ""Please tell me some talented impersonator dubbed audio over video of a funny thing she said.""

Jesse Hunt, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, asked, ""Wonder what the WH staff thinks of the Kamala reboot?""

"Kamala Harris blunders about NATO again, this time in a deleted tweet","Vice President Kamala Harris was caught in a precarious blunder again when she implied in a tweet that Ukraine was a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin has cited the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO as part of his justification for invading the former Soviet republic as a matter of national defense.

""When I was in Poland, I met with U.S. and Polish service members, thanking them for standing with our NATO allies for freedom, peace, and security,"" read the tweet from the @KamalaHarris account. ""The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

Harris' false claim that Ukraine had already joined NATO was an embarrassing and potentially harmful blunder.

That tweet was deleted and replaced with one clarifying that the U.S. stood behind Ukraine and also behind NATO.

Harris had made the exact same mistake in a speech on Saturday at the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C.

""Russia’s invasion threatens not just Ukraine’s democracy, it threatens democracy and security across Europe,"" Harris said during her speech. ""So I will say what I know we all say, and I will say over and over again: The United States stands firmly with the Ukrainian people in defense of the NATO alliance.""

The White House altered the transcript of the event to add the word ""and"" in parenthesis to fix the gaffe.

After deleted the tweet, Harris' office blamed the DNC for the mistake.

""The 'and' was omitted by accident, so we took it down and reposted with the correct remarks,"" the DNC said in an email to Fox News.

The vice president's office has been plagued by staffers leaving amidst rumors of dysfunction and contentious bickering with the president's staff. Harris has been accused by some of being unprepared for media briefings and other official meetings.

Kari Lake is 'not a fan' of DeSantis sending illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. She would go farther to secure the border,"Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake had a contrarian take for a Republican on the news that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) sent two planes full of illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard as part of his state's plan to relocate migrants to sanctuary cities.

Appearing on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Wednesday, Lake said that while it's fun to watch Democratic officials complain that sanctuary cities like New York and Chicago are turning into ""unofficial border towns,"" illegal immigrants should be deported, not transported into the U.S. at taxpayer expense.



""I actually, I get a kick out of it, watching these liberal mayors just, you know, throw their hands up and say, 'We can't handle it,' because it's life every day for us in these border states,"" Lake told Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

""However, I'm not a fan of it, Tucker,"" she added. ""I mean, we're just taking people here illegally who shouldn't be here. We're moving them further inland.""

Fox News first reported Wednesday that DeSantis had sent two planes full of migrants to the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, a popular summer vacation spot for affluent Americans. DeSantis spokeswoman Taryn Fenske said the migrants were relocated as part of a $12 million program approved by the Florida legislature to remove illegal immigrants from the state.

The actions by DeSantis follow those of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), who since April have bused thousands of illegal immigrants to Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.

Lake, who is running against Democrat Katie Hobbs to succeed Ducey, said that as governor her priority would be to stop migrants and human and drug traffickers from entering Arizona in the first place. She drew a distinction between herself and other Republicans including DeSantis, who campaigned for her in April. Lake's plan is to declare an ""invasion"" at the southern border, which she argues would grant Arizona constitutional authority to use National Guard troops to secure the border.

Border-state Republican governors Abbott and Ducey have faced pressure from conservatives to make such a declaration in their respective states, but so far have refused to do so. Immigration attorneys have derided the idea as a political stunt that is sure to face lawsuits and probable defeat at the U.S. Supreme Court, which has previously ruled states cannot set immigration policy. Abbott acknowledged in April that state law enforcement officials who attempt to deport illegal immigrants could be prosecuted under federal law.

There is also debate over whether the border crisis meets the definition of an ""invasion."" More than 1 million migrants have been admitted into the U.S. temporarily by President Joe Biden as they apply for asylum, the New York Times reported. Immigrant activists say asylum-seekers presenting themselves at the border are not a hostile, invading force and that constitutional powers meant for use against a foreign army do not apply to the border crisis. Conservatives like Lake argue that violent drug cartels trafficking human beings and deadly drugs like fentanyl over the border need to be treated like foreign invaders to be stopped.



""My plan is the most aggressive plan on the border. We're going to secure the border. We're going to call it what it is, issue a declaration of invasion on day one,"" Lake told Carlson. ""Get troops on the border in the form of our National Guard. We're going to stop people from coming over. And we're going to stop the cartels from having control of our border.""

"Katie Hill resigns from Congress amid allegations of improper sexual relationships, paints herself as victim","When allegations surfaced against Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) that she was engaged in improper sexual relationships with staffers, she denied the accusations, blaming her ""abusive husband"" — and the mainstream media covered for Hill.

Now, the Democratic freshman lawmaker, less than 10 months into her first term in Congress, is resigning.

""It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,"" Hill said in a statement Sunday. ""This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.""

News of Hill's resignation comes days after the House Ethics Committee initiated an investigation into allegations that Hill was engaged in a sexual relationship with her legislative director. Such relationships — between lawmakers and their staffers — are strictly prohibited under congressional ethics rules.



Hill, the first openly bisexual member of Congress, was a rising star in the Democratic Party, even assuming the powerful role of vice chair on the House Oversight Committee. But her demise came just as quick as her rise to prominence.

Conservative blog RedState first reported just 10 days ago that Hill and her husband, Kenny Heslep, were involved in a three-way ""throuple"" relationship with a young female campaign staffer. RedState also reported that Hill was actively involved in a sexual relationship with Graham Kelly, her legislative director. RedState obtained text messages and photos backing the allegations.

Hill, 32, initially denied that she had an improper relationship with Kelly, but admitted to the relationship with the campaign staffer. She then tried to reframe the story as her being a victim of ""revenge porn"" — which she called a ""crime"" — because nude photos of her, which attested to the allegations, had been published. She also blamed her ""abusive husband"" for the allegations; she and Heslep are currently going through a bitter divorce.

The situation turned from bad to worse for Hill last Thursday when the Daily Mail published numerous additional troubling allegations and photos of Hill, including one of Hill holding a bong used to smoke marijuana while nude. Hill responded by threatening to sue the Daily Mail for publishing the photos.

In her resignation statement, Hill refused to take responsibility for her scandal, instead blaming her ""abusive husband"" and ""political operatives.""

She wrote:

This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation. Having private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It's also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options.

Hill is expected to officially vacate her office sometime next week. She is the first female member of Congress to resign over allegations of improper sexual relationships, the Washington Examiner reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/katie-hill-resigns-from-congress,2019-10-28
Kentucky AG Daniel Cameron responds to racially charged criticism over Breonna Taylor case,"Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron responded to racially charged criticism launched at him for his handling of the Breonna Taylor investigation, saying the names he's been called are ""repugnant.""

""It is so unfortunate that because I have a different political philosophy and because in my role as the attorney general and as the special prosecutor in the Breonna Taylor investigation, because I led with the facts and the truth, and had that lead to the conclusion, somehow I betrayed my race,"" Cameron told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview Thursday.

After Cameron announced that the officers involved in Taylor's death would not be charged with murder, outraged commentators called him names like ""sellout negro,"" ""Uncle Tom,"" and said he was ""skinfolk"" but not ""kinfolk."" The only charge was issued against one officer for wanton endangerment.



""It is repugnant. It is so disappointing, but it's par for the course,"" Cameron said in response to his critics. ""Anytime someone stands for the truth, and when that truth is different from a narrative that has been pushed by others, this is how they respond.""

Kentucky AG responds to harsh criticism he faced on Breonna Taylor decision www.youtube.com

""I'm here tonight to say that enough is enough,"" he added. ""Black Republicans, folks that believe in the truth ... we are going to stand up.

""That's what I did in presenting all of the information to the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor investigation, and that is what I'm charged to do. That is my responsibility as the attorney general of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,"" he continued.



On Sept. 23, Cameron held a news conference to announce the results of the state attorney general's investigation into Taylor's shooting death.

TheBlaze covered the news conference and the facts of the night Taylor died as recounted by Cameron:

When the three officers charged into Taylor's apartment around 1 a.m. March 13, Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot at them. The officers were not in uniform, and Walker said he thought it was a home invasion. Walker shot Mattingly in the leg. The three officers returned fire with more than 20 shots. Taylor was shot five times.



Attorney General Daniel Cameron said that despite reports that it was a no-knock raid, the officers did knock and announce themselves before entering the apartment.

Cameron said that because the police were fired upon first, the returned fire was justified and Kentucky state law prevented him from charging the police with Taylor's killing. Two of the officers Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, did not face any charges. The third officer, former LMPD Sgt. Brett Hankison, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for allegedly firing his gun recklessly.

Asked by Carlson to dispel the biggest ""myth"" surrounding the facts of the shooting, Cameron criticized the claim that the police officer who was allegedly shot by Kenneth Walker actually shot himself.



""Well, the biggest myth that is being promoted right now is the idea that Sgt. Mattingly, one of the office officers who was administering the search warrant in the morning hours at Breonna Taylor's apartment, was shot by friendly fire, meaning shot by another officer,"" Cameron said. ""Look, I've taken to calling this a conspiracy theory. In order to believe this narrative that's being promoted by the defense attorney in Louisville, Kentucky, you have to believe, (1) to defy physics and disregard the trajectory analysis, but you have to believe that the officer that was standing outside the apartment shooting into the apartment, that he had a magic bullet, and that that bullet went through the apartment unit and then made a sharp turn left without any obstruction or any impediment to match it up with the entry point of the wound that Sergeant Mattingly suffered.

""It is a silly notion; it's one of the biggest myths that has been promoted here in the last few weeks,"" Cameron continued. ""Before three weeks ago and before this defense attorney uttered this statement, it was a foregone conclusion that what happened that evening was that Kenny Walker, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, fired a shot at the officers. The officers responded and returned fire, justified in doing so because they had been fired upon. And the tragedy, and again, I've said this from the very beginning, the tragedy here is that Breonna Taylor was in that hallway as well and was hit.

""But the tragedy doesn't allow for me to not present the facts and the truth, and that's what we've done here,"" he said.

Cameron blamed celebrity and media commentators for driving false narratives about the shooting, leading to confusion about what happened.



""Well, again, there were a lot of people inside and outside, a lot of celebrities, a lot of folks that were either misrepresenting the facts because it was to their advantage, or didn't know all the information,"" Cameron said. ""They made conclusions first and then want to cherry-pick the facts to meet those conclusions. I don't have that luxury as the attorney general here in the commonwealth. My responsibility is to the truth and to the information, and then that is ultimately what leads to the conclusion. We presented all the information to the grand jury. Ultimately, we presented to them as well the fact that the officers, Mattingly and Cosgrove, were fired upon and they were justified in returning their fire.

""We obviously have a prosecution into a third officer that was there that night,"" he continued. ""I can't get into the specifics because that is an ongoing prosecution, but again, a lot of folks had already made up their mind and weren't interested in what the truth is, and now are still trying to cherry-pick so that they can fashion a narrative that meets their agenda and advances their own interests.""

Since Cameron delivered his news conference in September, several new facts have come to light that raise questions about the findings the Kentucky attorney general's office presented.

Bodycam footage made public days after the investigation's findings were released appear to show Louisville Metro Police Department officers and SWAT team members breaking department policy regarding officer-involved shooting incidents.

As Leon Wolf wrote for TheBlaze:

Notably, for obvious reasons, officers who are involved in a shooting are prohibited per LMPD policy from being involved in the investigation of those shootings and are furthermore explicitly required to be promptly separated from the scene and paired with a ""peer support"" escort who can both comfort shaken officers and also vouch for the fact that the officers did not fabricate evidence or otherwise adulterate the crime scene.



Videos taken of the shooting aftermath show that this policy was flagrantly disregarded, particularly by the now-terminated Hankison and Cosgrove, and that the SWAT and Public Integrity Unit officers who were there complained aloud about the officers they were investigating still being ""in the mix"" and even actually in the active crime scene. One of the other officers involved in the raid was also observed to have left the scene and been canvassing witnesses.

Also, a ballistics report released recently contradicted Cameron's claim that Walker shot first and struck Mattingly and that friendly fire was ruled out.

From the New York Post:

Kentucky State Police said that ""due to limited markings of comparative value,"" the bullet that hit Mattingly was neither ""identified nor eliminated"" as coming from a 9mm pistol fired by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, the outlet said.



The ballistics report also contradicted Cameron's claim that the cops only carried .40-caliber handguns, when the shot that hit Mattingly was a 9mm.



The report said Police Officer Brett Hankison had also been issued a 9mm handgun.

A separate FBI ballistics report has been received by Cameron's office but has not yet been released.

Kentucky teachers' retirement system lost millions in Russian bank stock — and narrowly avoided losing way more,"Kentucky teachers' pensions were rumored to be on somewhat shaky ground this week after a report circulated online alleging the state pension system remained a major shareholder in a tanking Russian bank stock.

What allegedly happened?

Russia's largest lender, Sberbank of Russia, cratered 95% on the London stock exchange Monday upon announcing it would be pulling out of the European market. News of the stock free fall turned up an interesting note: as of Dec. 30, 2021, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System was listed as the bank's second-largest U.S. institutional shareholder.

In a tweet posted Thursday night, the Twitter account ""Market Sentiment"" claimed that as a result of Sberbank's collapse, the teachers' pension system suffered a concurrent 95% loss in its position, amounting to more than $12 million.

Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie picked up on the tweet and remarked, ""It's obviously part of a much larger portfolio, but still unfortunate and notable."" Later he added, ""Buy the ticket, take the ride.""

The pension system sets the record straight

But on Friday, one of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System's lawyers shut down the rumors, claiming them to be ""completely false.""

Beau Barnes, TRS' general counsel, said in a statement that TRS sold off its direct investments on Feb. 23, one day before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

The sell-off resulted in the pension system losing $3.2 million of its initial $15.6 million investment, Barnes acknowledged.

""TRS’s holding was in an over-the-counter, American-exchange portion of Sberbank known as an American depositary receipt. This is a small piece of the overall Sberbank capital structure,"" Barnes clarified against the implication that TRS's holdings accounted for a sizable ownership of the massive Russian bank.

The lawyer went on to further calm any hysteria by noting that TRS' previous holdings in Sberbank and its ""remaining exposure to holdings in Russia is proportionately negligible in a portfolio of about $26 billion.""

According to the Lousiville Courier-Journal, he previously disclosed that approximately $30 million — or about 0.12% — of the pension system's $26 billion investment portfolio was in Russian investments.

Anything else?

Several other states have recently begun withdrawing Russian assets amid the country's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, especially as sanctions levied by the U.S. and its Western allies begin to take effect, crippling the Russian economy.

""I strongly encourage divestment from all Russian holdings,"" said Kentucky Treasurer Allison Ball in a statement, according to WSIL-TV. ""Outside fund managers who maintain indirect holdings of pension funds should proceed with divestment from Russia. Any individual holdings of pension funds should also be divested through best efforts as soon as possible.""

""The world has been inspired by Ukraine’s heroic fight for freedom, and Kentucky is committed to doing its part to support U.S. sanctions against Russia to stand alongside the sovereign nation of Ukraine,"" Ball added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kentucky-teachers-retirement-system-russian-bank-stock,2022-03-04
CNBC host grills Rep. Jeffries on inflation: 'You don’t take any responsibility? It's just all a Putin price hike?',"CNBC host Joe Kernen grilled a congressman over the Democrats' excuses for increasing inflation and high gas prices.

Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York appeared on Kernen's show on Tuesday just ahead of a new report that showed inflation worsening instead of improving. Jeffries tried to offer talking points as an excuse for inflation, but Kernen bulldozed through them and pressured him to take responsibility.

“In this country, we’re still down front from peak production. You don’t you think there’s anything that you can do in Congress or to convince a Biden administration, you don’t think there’s any regulations that need to be eased? You don’t think there’s any offshore activity?” asked Kernen.



“You don’t take any responsibility? It’s just all a ‘Putin price hike’?” he added.

“Yeah, part of the challenge domestically in terms of production is that the oil and gas companies have refused to actually act on the permits to drill that they currently ...” Jeffries began to respond.

Kernen blasted the talking point as a ""red herring"" and explained why he thought the excuse was unreasonable.

“So there’s leases. There’s, you know, there’s also just the overall pressure from ESG and the green lobby about whether an oil company is going to make plans five or 10 years down the road when, you know, a large part of the population wants to put them out of business completely,” Kernen said.

Jeffries went on to blame corporations for their high profit margins which didn't persuade Kernen much.

On Wednesday, the Labor Department issued its latest consumer price index report that found inflation in June rising to 9.1% on an annual basis. The stock market dropped farther as a result of the report that many took as a sign that the economy was sinking into a recession.

Many economists say that the high spending policies of the Democrats worsened inflation despite other causes like the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. A recent poll found that many Americans were unconvinced by the excuses the Biden administration was making for high inflation.

Mob of kids force autistic child to expose himself and post video on social media; police have filed charges,"Police have filed charges against several teenagers and a 10-year-old they say forced an autistic child to expose himself and then posted video on social media.

The disturbing incident allegedly occurred at the Berdan Grove Park in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

Police were contacted by the Fair Lawn Board of Education about the video posted to TikTok and Snapchat, two social media sites popular among children.

The video apparently shows a 14-year-old male being cornered by a group of kids led by a 19-year-old. The victim appears to be in distress, and crying through the ordeal.

A 10-year-old male pulls down the boy's pants and underwear while a 13-year-old holds the boy in place, according to an account of the video from WABC-TV. While the incident occurred in broad daylight, no one tries to help the victim.

Police say that 19-year-old Alis Fidrya and an unidentified 16-year-old recorded the incident and posted it on social media.

Police file charges

Police charged Fidrya with invasion of privacy, cyber harassment and harassment. The 16-year-old was charged as a juvenile with invasion of privacy, cyber harassment and harassment. The 13-year-old and 10-year-old will be charged as juveniles with harassment.

Fair Lawn Mayor Kurt Peluso said the incident was especially abhorrent because the park where it happened was specifically built to be welcoming to kids with disabilities.

""What's really disturbing is at that park, Berdan Park, that's an Access For All playground that this community invested a lot of money in to be especially welcoming to those with special needs,"" Peluso said.

The Fair Lawn school district sent a letter to parents of their students, condemning the incident and asking parents to inform their children about the dangers of social media.

""This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable and I implore you to speak to your children about the dangers of such actions and social media,"" the letter said in part.

""We have zero tolerance for such behavior,"" the letter continued, ""however, at this point we must first allow law enforcement to conduct their investigation.""

Police added to the station that the homeowner couldn't get in his residence through the side door and soon figured out somebody was inside.

""As he's walking around to the front of his residence, a man approaches him with a knife,"" a detective told KTRK. The station added that the intruder came from inside the home and tried to stab him.

""The homeowner attempts to retreat, but the man continues to follow him with a knife in a threatening manner,"" the detective also told KTRK. ""The homeowner discharges his firearm one time, striking the individual.""

What happened next?

The intruder was taken to a hospital where he died of injuries, the station said, adding that the intruder's identity has not yet been released.

KTRK noted that the homeowner did a check of his residence with police and told officers that it seemed as though cash was missing.

The case will go to the Harris County District Attorney's Office, the station said.

Kremlin spokesperson says 'this can be stopped in a moment' if Ukraine meets several conditions,"Russia has told Ukraine that it is prepared to end military activity if Ukraine satisfies several conditions, a Kremlin spokesperson said, according to Reuters.

""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc.""

"'Lawfully armed' homeowner orders crook to stop kicking in back door. Crook keeps trying to break into residence, so homeowner pulls the trigger.","A homeowner in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told police an intruder tried to break in around 4:45 p.m. Oct. 21.

Police learned the intruder was attempting to kick in the back door of the home, which is located in the area of Disbrow and Carnation Streets.

Police said the homeowner — who was ""lawfully armed"" with a gun — confronted the intruder and gave him warnings, specifically orders to stop his attempted break-in and to leave the premises.

It isn't clear what was going through the intruder's mind upon coming face to face with an armed homeowner whose first instinct was to warn rather than shoot — but the crook apparently didn't take the homeowner seriously.

Police said the intruder ""continued to attempt to gain entry into the house.""

With that, the homeowner shot the intruder — identified as 32-year-old Keon J. Washington.

Leaked audio from a top-secret meeting confirms the Chinese military is preparing to invade Taiwan,"According to leaked audio from a top-secret meeting of Chinese military officials, China may soon launch an invasion of Taiwan.

The Times of India reported that an audio clip revealing dialogue between officials from China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), surfaced on YouTube marking the first time since the formation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 that a recording of a top-secret meeting of China’s military command has leaked.

The Times reported that the video containing the meeting’s conversation, along with English translations of what is being discussed, “appears authentic.”

Exclusive: Top-classified PLA meeting audio held on 14/5/2022 has been obtained youtu.be

Reportedly, “allies” within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the PLA recorded the audio. There is now an ongoing manhunt to uncover the source of the leak.

According to the audio, during the operation against Taiwan the Chinese military will have to safeguard the Pearl River Delta area in the Guangdong province. The Guangdong province is a densely populated part of China and home to much of China’s domestic industry.

The Guangdong province is often credited as being the heartbeat of Chinese industry. It includes the world class trading hub and hi-tech capital, Shenzhen, where digital behemoths Huawei and Tencent Industries are headquartered. It also includes Hong Kong, Macau, and the furniture capital Dongguan.

It’s reasonable to conclude that the protection of the Pearl River Delta is crucial to the CCP preserving stability of the Guangdong region and China in general. Should these areas be compromised by China’s enemies, large swaths of the Chinese economy will become extremely vulnerable.

Some of the leaked audio from the top-secret meeting confirmed that the invasion would be a massive operation.

A speaker at the meeting said, “First, the mobilization tasks issued to our province by the eastern and southern war zones totaling 20 categories and 293 items, mainly 1,358 detachments of various types with a total of 140,000 personnel, 953 ships of various types, and 1653 units/sets of various unmanned equipment.”

The leaked audio also confirmed that companies involved in the manufacture of military technologies, telecommunication companies, and satellite service companies located in China will all play a crucial role in supplying the PLA throughout the invasion of Taiwan. Many of America’s largest defense contractors have extensive ties to the PLA and CCP.

The leaked audio confirms that the meeting was held to discuss pre-war preparation and that the meeting was held to discuss orderly transition from peace time to war and to discuss military mobilization and planning.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leaked-audio-confirms-the-chinese-military-is-preparing-to-invade-taiwan,2022-05-28
LeBron James wore a customized MAGA hat to a game to make a social justice statement,"NBA superstar LeBron James and his Los Angeles Lakers teammates wore customized ""Make America Great Again"" hats to Tuesday night's playoff game against the Portland Trail Blazers, making a statement about the death of Breonna Taylor, Business Insider reported.

The hats had ""great again"" crossed out, with text added underneath, so the hats said, ""Make America Arrest the Cops who Killed Breonna Taylor."" The message is a reference to the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department shooting of Taylor while serving a no-knock drug warrant in March.

""You know the situation that's going on in Louisville, Kentucky,"" James told reporters after the game, which the Lakers lost. ""An innocent woman being killed, by the name of Breonna Taylor. A woman who had a bright future. Her life was taken away from her. There's been no arrests, there's been no justice, not only for her, but for her family. We want to continue to shed light on that situation because it's just unjust. That's what it's about.""

Taylor's death occurred on March 13, but wasn't widely publicized nationally until May when it made national headlines shortly after video of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia was released to the public. Although one of the three officers involved in the Taylor shooting has been fired, no charges have been filed and the investigation is ongoing.

LMPD officers had a no-knock warrant for Taylor based on her suspected involvement with drug trafficking. When they entered the home in the middle of the night, Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a legal gun owner, fired one shot at the officers, who responded by shooting back more than 20 times.

Walker was not hurt, but Taylor was shot eight times and died at the scene. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but those charges were later dropped. He has told investigators he believed a home invasion was taking place, and didn't know he was shooting at police officers. The officers were not in uniform.

Protests have been taking place in Louisville for months as people demand criminal charges against the officers. However, some legal experts believe that it will be difficult to bring charges against officers who only fired their weapons after being shot at first.

""The young man shot at them,"" said Louisville lawyer and former judge Aubrey Williams, according to The Washington Post. Williams is a former head of the Louisville NAACP. ""Whether he knew who they were or not, he shot at them. And at that point, the officers have every reason to shoot back. They are trained to defend themselves, and that is what they did.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lebron-james-customized-maga-hat,2020-08-19
AP reporter berates State Dept. spox on claim that Russians planned false flag operation in order to invade Ukraine,"Associated Press reporter Mike Lee berated State Department spokesperson Ned Price over a report that the Russians were planning a false flag operation in order to justify an invasion of Ukraine.

The report claimed that the Russians were planning to fake a mass attack on Russian-speaking people in Ukraine in order to give them a pretext to invade and retake the country.

""One possible option the Russians are considering, and which we made public today, involves the production of a propaganda video, a video with graphic scenes of false explosions, depicting corpses, crisis actors pretending to be mourners, and images of destroyed locations or military equipment, entirely fabricated by Russian intelligence,"" said Price at the media briefing Thursday.

""To be clear, the production of this video is one of a number of options that the Russian government is developing as a fake pretext to initiate and potentially justify military action against Ukraine,"" he added.

Lee and other reporters pressed Price to produce evidence of the claims against Russia beyond the word of the State Department.

""It is an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that,"" said Lee. ""What is the evidence that they've planned, I mean, this is like, crisis actors? Really? This is like Alex Jones territory that you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?""

""Matt this is derived from information known to the U.S. government, intelligence information that we have declassified,"" responded Price.

""Well OK? Where is it? Where is this information?"" interjected Lee.

""It is intelligence information that we have declassified,"" Price said.

""Well where is it, where is the declassified information?"" Lee asked.

""I just delivered it,"" Price laughed.

""No, you made a series of allegations and statements,"" replied Lee. ""That's not evidence, that's you saying it, that's not evidence, I'm sorry.""

The situation devolved into a yelling match about whether Price's statements should be constituted as evidence of the accusations made against Russia. Price later fired back that Lee was more willing to trust Russia than the U.S. and its allies.

""If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" said Price.

Other reporters then pressed Price in the same way Lee did.

""The facts that we are able to go into such great detail, obviously I am not going to spell out what is in our possession, but I will leave, I will leave it to your judgement,"" said Price to another reporter.

""There are no facts that you've spelled out!"" interjected Lee.

""We are making clear what we know so that in the event it does take place, it will be clear to the world what this actually was and what it was not,"" explained Price later on.

Price tweeted about the heated exchange and praised Lee despite their disagreement.

""Clearly, he’s no one’s dupe, and I’d never want to suggest otherwise. Nothing but respect for him, which I underscored in a call to him after the briefing,"" tweeted Price.

Russia has amassed more than a hundred thousand troops outside of the border of Ukraine, sparking fears of a military invasion with the intent reconquer the country that was once part of the former Soviet empire.

President Joe Biden has more than once intimated that he believes an invasion is imminent. The statements have elicited bitter recriminations from Ukraine officials who have warned him against spreading rumor and panic.

"Left-wing mag: Outlawing abortion akin to slavery, violates 13th amendment because it subjects women to 'involuntary labor'","Ever since a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicated that a majority of justices on the bench stood poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, aghast abortion advocates in the U.S. have been scrambling in search of ways, however preposterous or implausible, to derail the looming decision.

Some Democratic politicians and progressive mainstream media personalities immediately pushed for the codification of federal abortion rights before they could be rolled back in the aftermath of Roe's reversal. Others resorted to bad-mouthing and scaremongering in hopes of pressuring certain conservative justices to change their minds. Still others took to the streets — apparently in violation of federal law — to picket and protest against the forthcoming decision outside several Supreme Court justices' homes.

Over and against the findings expressed in Justice Samuel Alito's opinion, countless abortion advocates vehemently argued that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy was clearly spelled out on the pages of the Constitution and is, in fact, ""deeply rooted in the country's history and traditions.""

One might expect that advocates would herald an individual's right to privacy as found in the 14th Amendment — the 1973 court's determination — to bolster their support for legalized abortion. Many did.

But this week, left-wing news outlet Ms. Magazine cited a different constitutional amendment in its argument against restrictions on the procedure: the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.

""Abortion bans force pregnant women to endure the dangerous work of pregnancy, labor, and childbirth against their will. Abortion bans place pregnant women seeking abortion under state control and require them to perform involuntary labor,"" wrote contributing editor Carrie Baker, also a women and gender studies professor at Smith College, in an article published by the magazine on Monday.

""This is a violation of the 13th Amendment,"" she asserted.

In order to make her point, Baker argued that ""pregnancy, labor, and childbirth"" should be interpreted merely as ""difficult forms of work.""

""Pregnancy causes nausea, fatigue, tender and swollen breasts, constipation, body aches, dizziness, sleep problems, heartburn and indigestion, hemorrhoids, itching, leg cramps, numb or tingling hands, swelling, urinary frequency or leaking, varicose veins — and many more deeply invasive and painful experiences,"" she offered as evidence.

""Pregnancy takes over the entire body, affecting the cardiovascular system, kidneys, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, skin, hormones, liver and metabolism. It increases blood volume by about 50 percent and depletes calcium from the bones, decreasing bone density. Risks of pregnancy include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, anemia, depression, infection, and death,"" she continued.

""To force these experiences on an unwilling person is a form of involuntary servitude,"" Baker concluded, given the side effects.

Elsewhere, she compared forcing someone to continue their pregnancy to ""bodily assault"" and even ""rape,"" adding that such behavior has ""surprisingly similar dynamics to domestic violence and sexual assault.""



It's unlikely that Baker and Ms. Magazine's radical arguments will persuade any of the court's conservative justices, however, or anyone on the conservative side of the issue, for that matter. If anything, the arguments might weaken abortion advocates' standing on the issue.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-mag-outlawing-abortion-akin-to-slavery,2022-05-23
Leftist pundit Cenk Uygur says 'right wing' loves Vladimir Putin 'because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader' — and gets torn to shreds for it,"Left-wing pundit Cenk Uygur — founder of radical show the Young Turks and known for descending to further extremes when things don't go his way politically — tweeted Thursday that the ""right wing"" loves Russian President Vladimir Putin ""because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader.""

Here's his full tweet:

""Right-wing doesn't love Putin just because he is an authoritarian, tyrannical leader, they love him because he's a WHITE authoritarian leader,"" Uygur wrote. ""Race has become more important than even nationality. They've turned on democracy and now even America, in favor of a white warlord.""

Putin has launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, and Russia's Defense Ministry claimed early Thursday that its military already destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities — including 11 airbases — only hours into its operation.

How are folks reacting?

If Uygur was starving for some attention — even of the negative variety, which he almost certainly must be used to by now — he sure got the job done: Uygur's inflammatory tweet was getting ratioed early Thursday afternoon, with nearly 10,000 comments and counting compared to about 4,300 likes.

And noted commenters responding to Uygur's claim that the color of Putin's skin is any kind of factor at the moment put him in his place with gusto:

Podcaster Graham Allen replied, ""You are the dumbest human in history…..literally the most insane thing I’ve read in a very long time.""

Conservative commentator and author John Ziegler said, ""Nailed it… that’s why we white conservatives here in California love our King Newsom so much!!""

Comedian Yannis Pappas quipped back at Uygur, ""As a Greek, your ethnicity and the name of your show is triggering for me. Please change it.""

During an interview with CBS News, Vasylenko lamented that fact that instead of going to school, her children are now learning about how to protect themselves during attacks. She said that ""the education they are getting now is about where to hide from which kind of attacks: Where to hide from an airstrike, where to hide from a missile strike, where to hide from an artillery attack.""

""In August 2019 I was elected by my people to parliament and I swore an oath to stay with my people and to stay with my country no matter what,"" she said. ""For freedom I am prepared to fight and for freedom I am prepared to stay.""

"'Let me in, I will kill you all': Armed husband saves barricaded wife and child from knife-wielding menace","A police officer responding to a burglary call in west Las Vegas Valley heard a gunshot upon arriving on the scene. He rushed inside the residence, finding a bloody mess. The individual yelping and screaming out in pain on the ground wasn't the victim, but rather someone who made the mistake of allegedly threatening an armed citizen and his family.



What are the details?

Around 5:30 a.m. on Oct. 22, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police responded to a burglary call near West Sahara Avenue and South Hualapai Way. They found 28-year-old David Valle with a gunshot wound and a shattered tibia.

According to the arrest report, Valle had stolen into a family's home through an unlocked back door, grabbed a knife, and besieged the master bedroom on the second floor.

How did it go down?

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that a ""loud, breaking sound"" woke the residents — a husband, wife, and daughter, all together in the second-floor master bedroom. The family immediately took action.

The wife was first up, telling her husband to call the police. Both parents then barricaded the door.

On the other side of the barricade was a shirtless man, later identified as Valle, wielding a knife. He allegedly had been beating on doors in the house, and threatening, ""Come out, come out, you are running out of time.""



The husband behind the impromptu barricade readied his handgun and announced he would use it. Since Valle had allegedly been shouting in Spanish, the homeowner indicated he had a ""pistola.""



The arrest report indicated Valle responded out, ""Let me in, I will kill you all!""

Having given one warning, the husband gave another, firing a shot into the ceiling. When that didn't work, he reportedly fired a shot through the bedroom door.

The arrest report suggested his aim was to strike Valle in the leg. It turns out, his aim was good.

The police officer who heard the gunshots outside kicked in the front door. Announcing himself as a Metro officer, he raced upstairs and found Valle bleeding from his left leg.

Valle was brought out by two police officers in handcuffs. He was captured on video laying handcuffed on the front lawn.

Valle was charged with burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon and assault with a deadly weapon, and booked into Clark County Detention Center. He is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 9 and his bail was set at $35,000.

A crazy night

Police suspect that Valle was either mentally unstable or intoxicated. After all, his alleged burglary attempt was not his first incident recorded early Oct. 22.

KLAS reported that just over four hours prior to the alleged burglary attempt, Valle had called police, claiming that someone outside of his apartment had ""pushed a sword through the hole in the door and disconnected the phone call.""

In another apparently paranoid call to police, Valle claimed several people were following him and ""hiding in bushes and behind bus stops.""

Two other police reports that morning mentioned an anxious man trying to evade people allegedly ""trying to kill him.""

The knock-back

This is the second time in the past week that a homeowner has stopped an intruder with a well-placed shot through a bedroom door.

TheBlaze reported that on Tuesday night, a man allegedly broke into a woman's home in rural Edinburg, Texas, prompting the mother to lock herself and her children in her bedroom.

Officials said that the woman warned the alleged intruder that she was armed, but 36-year-old Carlos Garcia nevertheless tried to break into the bedroom. The warning didn't work, but a single gunshot through the door did.

Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra extolled the woman's bravery, saying, ""You have the right to defend yourself in your own home against an intruder ... she did what she had to do, and we support her.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/let-me-in-i-will-kill-you-all-armed-husband-saves-barricaded-wife-and-child-from-knife-wielding-menace,2022-10-29
"Liberal activists decry red state border security efforts as 'invasion,' 'insurrection'","A major immigrant activist group is calling on President Joe Biden to put down growing efforts by Republican governors to send law enforcement personnel from their own states to fight illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border, calling the endeavor an ""invasion"" and ""insurrection.""

What are the details?

Over the last several weeks, governors in Arizona, Arkansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Idaho, Florida, and South Dakota have sent law enforcement personnel down to the country's southern border in response to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's request.

Abbot, in a letter sent to all 50 governors last month, asked states to send ""all available law enforcement resources"" to the border ""in defense of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

But on Sunday, Independence Day, the League of United Latin American Citizens sent a letter to the White House urging the president to use executive authority to order an immediate stop to the efforts, calling it an illegal ""pay for hire"" scheme.

""We told the President in no uncertain terms, this is an insurrection by recalcitrant and rebellious states that must be stopped,"" LULAC National President Domingo Garcia said in a news release. ""This unilateral action by governors hijacks the Emergency Assistance Management Compact (EMAC) and involves our armed forces in a 'pay for hire' scheme, funded in part by private donations.""

Garcia went on to accuse Abbott and former President Donald Trump of ""fomenting dangerous racial hatred targeting Latinos"" in their recent visit to the border.

""LULAC cannot say strongly enough that this militia action must be dealt with before it spreads,"" he added.

What else?

Rodolfo Rosales, Jr., the group's state director for Texas, ironically decried the border security efforts as an invasion. That term, however, was not employed to describe the situation taking place at the border as unprecedented numbers of migrants continue to rush into the country in hopes of lenient treatment from the Biden administration.

""This is insane!"" Rosales Jr. said. ""We are being invaded by governors of the defeated confederacy to arm the border against brown women and children escaping political persecution, hunger, and death.

""These governors are using the sacred chain of command to mobilize forces meant to defend us from military invasion by a foreign nation, as mercenaries to save white people from the brown threat,"" he exclaimed.



In the letter, LULAC argued that the deployment of National Guard troops and other law enforcement is a breach of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, an agreement that allows one jurisdiction to send assistance to another.

Republican governors, on the other hand, have maintained that their assistance is needed due to the federal government's failure to secure the border.

Just last week, Democrats unveiled plans to bring border wall funding to zero even while spending $870 billion on border security measures in the Middle East.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-activists-decry-gop-border-security-efforts,2021-07-06
Biden adviser says Americans need liberal world order,"President Joe Biden's director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, said Americans paying high gas prices is needed for the ""future of the liberal world order."" Reactions to the statement erupted on Twitter.

The Biden administration has repeatedly blamed high gas prices on Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, President Biden said Americans should expect to pay high fuel prices for ""as long as it takes, so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine.""

CNN anchor Victor Blackwell interviewed Deese on Thursday and cited that Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Wednesday the war between Russia and Ukraine could be a ""grinding struggle"" for years.

Blackwell said, ""I think everybody understands why this is happening, but is it sustainable? What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years? This is not sustainable.""



Deese – who was formerly the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock – replied, ""What we heard from the president today was about the stakes. This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand firm.""

""But at the same time what I'd say to that family, to Americans across the country, is you have a present administration that is going to do everything in its power to blunt those price increases and bring those prices down,"" Deese added.



Biden's director of the National Economic Council added, ""Good news, over the past two weeks, we've seen the price at the pump come down 20 cents, but it is still unacceptably high. That's why the president earlier this week was working to bring the G7 allies together around, exploring something around a price cap. To cap the price that can be paid for Russian oil. Which will actually target the pain more directly on Vladimir Putin and not on the rest of the world.""

In reactions on Twitter, conservatives blasted the Biden administration for prioritizing the ""liberal world order"" ahead of Americans.

TheBlaze contributor Carol Roth: ""A liberal world order is a place where feelings replace facts and hopes replace realities. It may sound nice in theory, but it is actually an epic disaster.""

Conservative commentator Tom Bevan: ""Another great election slogan for the Dems & Biden: 'Hey, America, suck it up for the Liberal World Order.'""

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.): ""The White House openly stated that you’re just going to have to pay more in gas so that they can hold the 'liberal world order' together and it barely registers as breaking news. They’re telling you EVERYTHING they plan to do and most don’t even care. WAKE UP!""



Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.): ""Inflation is causing money to be tight for many people, especially senior citizens barely able to buy food. Sustained high gas prices are causing people to drives less because they can’t afford it. We will not be paying for Biden’s liberal world order. People are angry.""

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas): ""$5 gas? No problem - do it for the 'the liberal world order…'""

Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance: ""Ohio families shouldn’t be expected to pay a dime for the 'liberal world order.'""

Republican congressional candidate for Washington's 3rd District Joe Kent: ""The ruling class’s obsession w/ the liberal world order got us to this point - putting our sovereignty & prosperity after the security of every other nation. Time to cast off the failed old ways.""

Republican congressional candidate for Ohio's 9th District J.R. Majewski: ""When White House advisors go on TV & say that we’re just going to have to keep paying high gas prices to keep the 'liberal world order' intact, that’s when every American needs to wake up and start paying attention. This is not your standard Democrat. This is a globalist coup.""

Republican congressional candidate for New York's 14th District Desi Cuellar: ""Anyone else notice how they don’t care about saying stuff like 'liberal world order' right out on television for everyone to hear anymore? They truly act like they don’t need our approval or out vote. Scary stuff.""

Conservative commentator Steve Cortes: ""The 'liberal world order.' He’s trolling us, right?! How about 'American nationalism' instead?""



Former Trump administration adviser Stephen Miller: ""Biden’s 'Liberal World Order' is a war on the working and middle class: — Domestic drilling bans to explode energy costs — Run printing presses to inflate dollar — Open borders to drain erode family income, resources, stability — Open jails to let loose predators upon the community — Destroy nuclear family, discourage childbirth, promote abortion as 'family planning' — Replace religion with regime ideology — Put gov’t between parents & children — Use schools & corps to instill woke propaganda, sow gender confusion, teach hatred of self/family/faith/nation — Erase distinctions of biological sex & force doctors to elevate ideology over science — Police speech, punish dissent, jail dissenters — Racial discrimination & stereotyping to divide/demean populace —Transfer wealth from workers to Wall Street via outsourcing — Globalist wars.""

In 2017, President Biden also used the term ""liberal world order"" while attacking former President Donald Trump.

“Violating the norms of personal conduct generates more anxiety and fear than any policy prescription that this president has enunciated,” Biden said during an event held at the University of Delaware. “This breaking down of international and national norms is the glue that holds the liberal world order together, and holds together our system. That is what is being attacked and that’s what’s most dangerous.”

In March 2022, Biden raised eyebrows when he used the terms ""liberal world order"" and ""new world order"" while speaking to corporate leaders.

""We’re at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy, not just the world economy, the world, that occurs every three or four generations,"" the president declared. ""[A general told me] that 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946, and since then we’ve established a liberal world order, and it hasn’t happened in a long while.”



""And now is a time when things are shifting,"" Biden added. ""We're going to — there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it. And we’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-world-order-biden-adminstration,2022-07-01
Majority of likely voters think Biden should prioritize boosting domestic energy production,"According to a recent Trafalgar Group poll, a whopping 77.3% of likely general election voters think that in the wake of the Russian incursion into Ukraine, President Joe Biden should make boosting U.S. energy production a priority. Just 9.3% did not think so, while 13.5% were unsure.

While 88.6% of Republicans thought the president should prioritize boosting the nation's energy production, just 67% of Democrats felt that way, according to the poll.

The poll was carried out March 7 to March 11 amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Americans, who have already been facing high gas prices, have recently been hit by even higher prices — according to AAA, the national average for a gallon of regular gas as of Wednesday is $4.305.

Last week, Biden issued an executive order to ban the importation of crude oil and other products into the U.S. from Russia.

High gas prices not only impact drivers, they also raise the cost of transporting goods at a time when Americans have already been getting hammered by rising prices — according to consumer price index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the all items index increased by 7.9% over a one-year period.

Some have been critical of the Biden administration's green energy push, including the move last year to revoke a permit related to the Keystone XL Pipeline project.

Lindsey Graham and Elon Musk feud over Ukraine and electric car subsidies,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk engaged in a Twitter feud over the war in Ukraine and electric car subsidies.

Graham lashed out at Musk over his suggestion to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine, currently in its seventh month, in a tweet posted on Tuesday.

Musk suggested that the region of Crimea be given to Russia while other annexed regions undergo another election under the supervision of the United Nations. He put it to a non-scientific vote on Twitter, where it lost 59.1% to 40.9% with more than 2.7 million votes.

""This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,"" he said in a second tweet. ""Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.""

Many criticized Musk's suggestion as far too deferential to Russia, with Graham repudiating it forcefully.

""My concern with his Russian 'peace' proposal is he is legitimizing one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century by Putin,"" tweeted Graham after first praising Musk.

""Russia must adhere to the boundaries they agreed to in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum where Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons force — the third largest in the world — in return for assurances their territorial integrity would be protected,"" he continued.

""To do otherwise is an insult to Ukraine and will set in motion even more chaos throughout the world,"" he concluded.

In a second Twitter thread about Ukraine and Musk, Graham added a threat to review electric car subsidies that benefited Tesla.

""While we’re at it, maybe the Congress should revisit the electric vehicle tax credit boondoggle. It is where the credit is now solely benefiting electric vehicle manufacturers who have increased prices equal to the tax credit!"" he tweeted. ""It could be a good way to help save money by applying those funds to assisting Ukrainians in defending their homeland!""

That apparently caught Musk's attention because he responded to the threat.

""First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years & we didn’t ask for this one – GM & Ford did,"" he replied.

Ukrainian president Zelenskyy replied to Musk with his own Twitter poll implying that the plan was abandoning the cause of Ukraine.

Musk is in a legal battle with Twitter over his bid to purchase the popular social media platform.

"The world's first living robots — developed with AI and stem cells — are now able to reproduce, scientists say","Scientists say that the world's first living, self-healing robots — known as xenobots — can now reproduce in a way that's not been observed in plants or animals.



Researchers at the University of Vermont, Tufts University, and Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering debuted the xenobots — formed from the stem cells of African clawed frogs — in 2020, CNN reported.

That year, scientists insisted that the xenobots could not reproduce.

What are the details?

One year after the xenobots' unveiling, Michael Levin — co-lead author of the new research as well as professor of biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University — said that he was ""astounded"" by the knowledge that the xenobots can reproduce.

""Frogs have a way of reproducing that they normally use but when you ... liberate (the cells) from the rest of the embryo and you give them a chance to figure out how to be in a new environment, not only do they figure out a new way to move, but they also figure out apparently a new way to reproduce,"" he said in reference to the new study, which was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PNAS on Monday.

According to a Monday CNN report, ""C-shaped parent xenobots collect and compress loose stem cells together into piles which can mature into offspring.""

The study showed that xenobos organisms can locate nearby other single cells and assemble new xenobots, which will then in turn mature and begin the process of reproduction with other single cells once more.

The organisms — which are said to be less than a millimeter wide — are designed on an AI mainframe and assembled by hand.

Study researcher Douglas Blackiston added, “People have thought for quite a long time that we’ve worked out all the ways that life can reproduce or replicate. But this is something that’s never been observed before.""

What else?

Josh Bongard, a computer science professor and robotics expert at the University of Vermont as well as lead author of the study, added that robots aren't simply metal and wires — and that an engineered combination of molecular biology and artificial intelligence meets the definition of what a robot is.

""Most people think of robots as made of metals and ceramics but it's not so much what a robot is made from but what it does, which is act on its own on behalf of people,"" Bongard explained. ""In that way it's a robot but it's also clearly an organism made from genetically unmodified frog cell.""

Bongard in 2020 added, ""These are novel living machines. They're neither a traditional robot nor a known species of animal. It's a new class of artifact: a living, programmable organism.""

According to the researchers' website, such engineering could ""repair birth defects, reprogram tumors into normal tissue, regenerate after traumatic injury or degenerative disease, and defeat aging.""

The 2020 study, which was partially funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a federal group that oversees the development of technology for military use, also determined that xenobots could be used to remove microplastics from the world's oceans, clean up radioactive waste, and even work in a medically invasive capacity, scraping plaque from human arteries.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/living-robots-able-to-reproduce,2021-11-30
Long Island mom raped in front of her daughter during brutal home invasion. Police have arrested a 14-year-old suspect.,"Police arrested a 14-year-old boy as a suspect in the brutal rape and stabbing of a mom in Long Island, New York.

The harrowing incident unfolded on April 19 at about 3:15 p.m. when the 23-year-old mother heard noises downstairs at her home and assumed her husband had arrived home.

Instead, police said two males had broken into the Mastic Beach home through a kitchen window. The mother hid upstairs with her 4-year-old daughter.

When the two made their way upstairs looking for items to steal, they broke through the locked door and found the mother and her child hiding.

The younger male then brutally raped the woman in front of her daughter. He was armed with a knife at the time and also strangled her, stabbed her in the chest, and slashed across her head.

She ran outside for help, and they fled on foot.

Neighbors said that they saw the victim after the assault.

""She was bleeding from her head and her chest,"" said neighbor Dennis Naughton. ""So I brought her on the deck and got some towels and called 911.""

She was taken to a hospital but her injuries were non-life threatening.

Police later announced the shocking arrest of a 14-year-old male. He was arrested two days later for a separate crime and confessed to the home invasion crimes, according to police. A DNA sample from the suspect matched that which was found on the victim, police said.

An accomplice is still at large and being sought by the police. His identity is known to them.

People in the neighborhood said the incident has shocked and frightened them.

""Of course, we are on edge. We want to make sure no one is following us, that we are keeping our doors locked,"" said Jeanne Romaine, a neighbor of the victim.

Because of the suspect's age, he faces a sentence of only 10 years for the crimes.

Couple moves from Los Angeles after woman suffered third-degree burns in boiling water attack by knife-wielding intruder,"A bizarre intruder attack left a woman with second and third-degree burns and prompted her and her boyfriend to move from Los Angeles, California.

Nicole Lucas and Davis Sarvey told KABC-TV that they were returning home from celebrating her birthday on Thursday when they encountered a strange man in their apartment in Koreatown.

The intruder splashed a pot of boiling water on Lucas, which burned her on her face, neck, and chest. She screamed for help and grabbed their two dogs to protect them from the man.

When Davis tried to get inside the apartment, the man slashed at him with a knife from their kitchen.

""He swung the knife at me from two or three feet away,"" Sarvey said.

They discovered that the intruder had destroyed many of their possessions and even defecated on their floor.

""He ransacked our whole house, destroyed a bunch of plants,"" Sarvey said.

They were able to get a photograph of the intruder as he fled. He was later arrested with the help of neighbors who had called the police. Police identified the suspect as Gonzalo Martinez, who was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and burglary. His bail was set at $130,000.

In a GoFundMe campaign, a friend of the couple says that Lucas had to wait several hours to be treated at a local hospital.

Lucas and Sarvey said they decided to leave Los Angeles after the attack and move back to San Diego with their dogs Rufus and Ophelia.

""It was definitely, I think a hard choice for us to decide to leave L.A. because it was somewhere we really loved living,"" said Lucas.

""I feel very lucky that all that happened, that I got burned,"" she added, ""like we could have been stabbed or he could have had a worse weapon, and could have killed our dogs.""

Louisville police declare state of emergency due to fear of riots that could follow Breonna Taylor decision,"The Louisville Metropolitan Police Department declared a state of emergency for the city Monday in anticipation of the unrest that could follow a grand jury decision on whether or not to charge the three officers involved in the raid that killed Breonna Taylor in March, NBC News reported.

""In anticipation of Attorney General Daniel Cameron's announcement in the Breonna Taylor case, I am declaring a state of emergency for the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD),"" a memo from Chief Robert J. Schroeder to officers read.

What do we know?

The emergency declaration went into effect immediately Monday, and all officer time-off requests that had not already been approved were canceled. Under the emergency guidelines, officers will work 12-hour shifts.

Windows of federal buildings in the city, including the courthouse, have been boarded up. Hearings scheduled for this week have been changed to video conferences.

Attorney General Cameron is expected to announce this week whether charges will be filed against Sgt. Brett Hankison, Officer Myles Cosgrove, and Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in Taylor's death. Hankison was fired from the department for ""an extreme indifference to the value of human life,"" while the other two have been placed on administrative leave.

The city of Louisville paid Taylor's family $12 million last week to settle a civil lawsuit.

What do we not know?

It is currently unknown whether grand jury deliberations have begun or not, so it is also unknown exactly when an announcement will be made on the fate of the three LMPD officers.

Background

Taylor was a 26-year-old emergency medical technician. She was in her apartment with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when police officers in plain clothes burst in after midnight March 13. Officers had a warrant due to her connection with her ex-boyfriend, who is a convicted drug dealer.

Walker, allegedly believing a home invasion was taking place, shot one of the officers in the leg. The officers returned fire, shooting more than 20 bullets into the home, hitting Taylor five times. She died at the scene.

The incident was not widely publicized until about two months after it occurred, after which it gained national media attention. Along with the death of Ahmaud Arbery, which also made national news in May, and later the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the killings of black individuals sparked nationwide protests and riots that have persisted in the four months since.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/louisville-police-declare-state-of-emergency-due-to-fear-of-riots-that-could-follow-pending-breonna-taylor-decision,2020-09-22
"Russia's second-largest oil company breaks with Putin, calls for end to war as stock price craters. Now, its website is down.","Russian oil giant Lukoil, the country's second-largest oil producer, shocked onlookers by publicly breaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, calling for an end to the ongoing invasion in Ukraine.

What are the details?

In a statement to shareholders Thursday, the massive company — which produces more than 2% of the world's oil and employs more than 100,000 workers — called for a ""fast resolution"" to the war.

""We stand for the immediate cessation of the armed conflict and duly support its resolution through the negotiation process and through diplomatic means,"" Lukoil's board of directors said in the statement posted on its website, the New York Times reported.

""We express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy. We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,"" the board added, according to CNN.

As of Friday afternoon, the statement could not be viewed because Lukoil's website was down.

Why does it matter?

The Times noted that Lukoil likely issued the statement to protect its extensive operations abroad, which include some 200 gas stations in the U.S., predominantly in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Lukoil's market value collapsed by 99% on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday as Moscow's market remained closed for a third straight day. The firm was reportedly selling as a penny stock.

MarketWatch reported that the collapse of Moscow-based energy giants such as Lukoil and natural-gas giant Gazprom came even as U.S. and European sanctions specifically exempted the Russian energy sector.

""But traders have taken matters into their own hands, with very little demand for Russian-sourced oil,"" the outlet said.

Consumers reportedly boycotted the company's gas stations in the northeastern U.S. this week. Lawmakers in Newark went further by voting to suspend Lukoil licenses in the city.

What else?

However, even if the oil producer's motivations were to protect its assets, its statement reflects a wider movement as a growing number of Russia's business class members continue to distance themselves from the country's warmongering president.

At the very least, ""It says they realize it’s going to be difficult for them to engage in international commerce, let alone retail sales in the U.S.,"" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told the Times.

""I’d call a Russian brand for gasoline the 21st-century equivalent of the scarlet letter,"" he added.

According to Reuters, Lukoil's chairman and CEO, Vagit Alekperov, is one of Russia's richest men. Alekperov, a former Caspian Sea oil rig worker, and his deputy, Leonid Fedun, reportedly own a majority of the firm's shares.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lukoil-calls-for-end-to-ukraine-war,2022-03-04
Macron and Putin agree that a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis is needed after a weekend phone call,"During a Sunday phone call, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed for the need to find a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis on Ukraine’s border.

Reuters reported that the French and Russian foreign ministers will meet in the coming days to hold diplomatic talks and seek to hold a summit where Russia, Ukraine, and NATO allies establish a new European security order.

A statement from Macron’s office said that the two presidents discussed “the need to prioritize a diplomatic solution to the current crisis” and that “if conditions are met,” a diplomatic path will allow for the establishment of this new security order the New York Times reported.

The Kremlin, however, appears not to believe that Western leaders are seeking a diplomatic resolution. Shortly after Putin’s conversation with Macron, the Kremlin said that leaders of Western nations were pushing the Ukrainian government to pursue a “military solution” to the ongoing conflict.

Earlier this month, ABC News reported that the Kremlin wants guarantees from Western nations and NATO allies that Ukraine and other formerly Soviet nations will not join defense alliances that purposefully exclude Russia.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government insisted that it does not plan to launch an offensive against the Russian-backed separatists in its eastern region despite Russian insistence to the contrary.

The French and Russian presidents agreed to resume diplomatic talks within the Normandy Format. The Normandy Format is a negotiating channel created a little less than a decade ago by France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia to resolve a similar conflict when Russia attempted to annex Crimea in 2014.

The defense minister of the Russian-allied and Ukraine-bordering nation of Belarus announced that Russia’s military deployment in Belarus would be extended as the two nations continue their joint military exercises along the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

Despite Russia’s insistence that it has no intention of pursuing an armed conflict, American leadership remains unconvinced. The United States continues to insist that it has intelligence indicating an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And, despite the increasingly menacing presence of Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders, Ukrainian national security officials believe that Russia is unlikely to pursue conventional means of warfare.

Oleksiy Danilov, President Zelenskyy’s top national security adviser, believes that Russia is most likely to pursue a series of intense cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns while increasing economic pressure to foster social discontent within Ukraine.

Amidst the chaos, Zelenskyy seeks to meet with Putin so that the two might reach a diplomatic solution between themselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/macron-and-putin-agree-that-a-diplomatic-solution-to-the-ukraine-crisis-is-needed-after-a-weekend-phonecall,2022-02-20
'Rachel Maddow Show' and former US ambassador to Russia backpedaling after being blasted for favorably comparing Hitler to Putin: 'Vile and wrong!',"During a Friday night appearance on ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" a former U.S. ambassador to Russia was clobbered online for claiming that in certain aspects, Adolf Hitler wasn't as evil as Vladimir Putin. The comments were regarded as insensitive and blatantly false. The backlash forced both the ambassador and MSNBC to issue apologies in less than 24 hours.

Michael McFaul was appointed as the U.S. ambassador to Russia by former President Barack Obama, and served in the position from 2012 until 2014. McFaul found himself in hot water for comparing Putin to Hitler.

McFaul appeared on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" to give his opinion on ""how horrific"" the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has been. During his appearance, McFaul said he gave an interview to a Ukrainian TV news program 30 minutes prior to going on MSNBC.

""One of the Russian journalists said, 'You know, there's one difference between Hitler when he was coming in and Putin. Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans. He didn't kill German-speaking people,'"" McFaul told host Ali Velshi – who was filling in for Rachel Maddow.

""I think people need to remember that we're talking about cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol and Kyiv, there are large populations there, you know, up to a third and sometimes as much to a half that are Russian speakers and are ethnic Russians,"" said McFaul – who is a Stanford University professor of international studies. ""And yet Putin doesn't seem to care about that. He slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate.""

The Maddow Blog – which is a Twitter account run by ""Rachel Maddow and her staff"" – shared the sentiment, ""One difference between Putin and Hitler is that Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans, German-speaking people. Putin slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate.""

In reactions to the comments on Twitter, commentators were outraged by the simplistic and incorrect comparison, including by the official Twitter account for the Auschwitz Memorial.

Auschwitz Memorial: ""On a factual note: Hitler did kill ethnic Germans & German-speaking people: those who opposed the Nazi regime, those who resisted, those who did not fit into the 'Weltanschauung'. He ordered the murder of people with different disabilities & finally the murder of German Jewry.""

Investigative journalist Jerry Dunleavy: ""Hitler 'didn’t kill German-speaking people' is an insanely false claim since many of the Jews murdered in the Holocaust spoke German. Pro-Tip: You don’t have to try to play weird word games to try to make Putin seem worse than Hitler — Putin is plenty bad on the objective facts.""

Editor Noam Blum: ""'Ethnic Germans' is a really weird way to get around the wholesale murder of German Jews.""

Political commentator Drew Holden: ""I promise you, no matter what, you don’t have to favorably compare Hitler to current foreign leaders.""

Former CIA ops officer Bryan Dean Wright: ""VILE & WRONG: Obama’s Ambassador to Russia — Michael @McFaul — claimed last night that Hitler didn’t kill German speaking people. Putin, on the other hand, is killing Russian speaking people and thus is worse, he declared.""

Researcher and Middle East analyst Kyle Orton: ""The first systematic victims of the Nazi regime were disabled non-Jewish Germans, for one thing. And, of course, what makes the Shoah so shocking is that German Jews were so integrated - 'German-speaking' was the least of it - and were targeted simply because of their identity.""

Political commentator Pradheep J. Shanker: ""MSNBC arguing the relative moral superiority of... Hitler. STOP IT.""

Editor Max Blumenthal: ""McFail’s rant absolving Hitler to own Putin is not just a window into the mentality of the ex-US ambassador to Moscow who helped instigate the new Cold War, but of the Blinken/Nuland State Department that is driving the desperate campaign to extend and escalate the war.""



Journalist Jeff Carlson: ""Obama's ambassador to Russia – who helped promote the Russian-Collusion narrative: 'One difference between Hitler, when he was coming in, and Putin. Hitler didn't kill ethnic Germans. He didn't kill German-speaking people.' These people are idiots.""

Following the severe backlash, the Maddow Blog and McFaul issued apologies for making the comparison.

The Maddow Blog wrote on Twitter: ""The historical record is clear. Hitler killed millions of Germans. We tweeted out part of an inaccurate statement made last night by former Ambassador Michael McFaul without attribution, and we regret doing so. We have since removed the tweet.""

McFaul also walked back his comparison of Putin to Hitler.

""After a long of commentary that started with Morning Joe and end with Maddow, I slipped late last night and violated an unwritten taboo – never compare Hitler with anyone. I agree. He was incomparably evil. I won't do it again,"" McFaul tweeted.



""To those who wrote to me to explain that Hitler committed the same atrocities against ethnic Germans that Putin is committing against ethnic Russians today in Mariupol and Kharkiv, please suggest to me the best scholarly readings on this history,"" he added. ""I'm eager to learn. END And please, to clarify the obvious, last night and today, we were NOT discussing Hitler's horrific killing of German citizens. Please have some decency to know that I would never compare Mariupol to the Holocaust.""

Despite blaming fatigue for his comparison between Putin and Hitler, it was only a little more than two weeks ago when McFaul said, ""I know it's taboo to compare anyone to Hitler. But the similarities between Hitler and Putin are just too many to ignore anymore. On some dimensions, they are very different. On others, they are not.""

Also on Feb. 24, the former ambassador wrote on Twitter, ""There are many parallels between Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 and Putin's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""

McFaul likened Putin to Hitler on March 1, ""Two dictators in last hundred years have attacked Kyiv— Hitler and Putin.""

On Jan. 21, McFaul said, ""Ukraine has done nothing – absolutely nothing – to threaten Russia. But Putin is threatening to invade Ukraine. Feels like Saddam invading Kuwait or Hitler invading Poland. Wrong historical analogies? Which ones are better?""

McFaul once again suggested similarities of Putin and Hitler on Feb. 22, ""Dictators (& sometimes democrats) who use war to achieve their aims sometimes succeed. And sometimes for a while. And then, they overreach. For Hitler that was the day he invaded the Soviet Union, For Brezhnev that was the day he invaded Afghanistan. For Putin, Ukraine 2022?""

He also asked, ""Is Putin today acting more like Hitler or Milosevic? Discuss.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maddow-russia-ambassador-putin-hitler,2022-03-12
Malcolm Nance says he's fighting for Ukraine against Russia: 'I'm done talking ... It's time to take action',"Former MSNBC foreign policy analyst Malcom Nance revealed on Monday that he had joined the fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Nance, who heads a think tank called the Terror Asymmetrics Project, appeared on Joy Reid's show on MSNBC to explain why he joined the fight against the Russians.

“The more I saw of the war going on, the more I thought, ‘I’m done talking, all right? It’s time to take action here.' So about a month ago I joined the international legion here in Ukraine, and I am here to help this country fight, you know, what essentially is a war of extermination,"" said Nance.

""This is an existential war and Russia has brought it to these people and they are mass murdering civilians, and there are people here like me who are here to do something about it,"" he added.

Reid asked Nance if being an international troop put him in danger's way more than the Ukrainians.

“No, it doesn’t, because the war that’s being waged here is being waged against everybody,” Nance responded. ""Look, they're not going around hunting for American flag patches or to see who’s Black, who’s Asian, who’s Latino. We are a part of the Ukrainian armed forces, we are brothers and sisters with the Ukrainian army.""

Nance went on to say that the U.S. needs to provide heavy weaponry to the Ukrainians in order to take away that advantage for the Russians.

“Let me say something to the president of the United States: give them counter battery long range artillery – multiple rocket launch systems,"" Nance said. ""Something that can out-range the artillery. If you do that, you stop the attacks on civilians, because that's what they are doing with the artillery - they are mass murdering civilians.""

Nance concluded the interview by saying the Russians are trying to wipe out Democracy in Ukraine and hope it ""cascades"" into other countries.

""This battle is here. It's gonna be fought now, and we're gonna win it!"" Nance said. ""You fight, you win, and this country is already winning and that's why Russia is already shifting its strategy.""

After his appearance, MSNBC confirmed that Nance was no longer an analyst at the network.

"Male suspect posing as female allegedly murdered father, stabbed sister: 'She has problems'","A man who identifies as a woman has been accused of murdering his father and leaving his younger sister critically injured in a vicious stabbing inside the Brooklyn apartment the family shared.

Around 6 a.m. on Thursday morning, NYPD dispatchers received a call about a violent home invasion at an apartment building on 17th Avenue in Bensonhurst. When police arrived at the scene, they found 61-year-old Carlo Secondino and 19-year-old Liana in severe medical distress from stab wounds they had sustained. Carlo was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene, but Liana, just days shy of her 20th birthday, was raced to Maimonides Hospital, where she remains in critical condition.

A third person, Nikki Secondino, was also injured in the attack. Nikki is Carlo's 22-year-old son who identifies as a transgender female. He had cuts on his hands and was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Nikki was the one who allegedly made the initial police report about the home invasion. A neighbor, who preferred not to be identified, told reporters that Nikki had banged on her door that morning, begging for help. ""'Oh my God! Oh my God! Open up the door!'' she recalled Nikki screaming. ""I saw the blood in the hallway, so I immediately closed my door, and I didn't want to get involved.""

At first, Nikki told police that two men — one black, one white — had broken into their home and committed the stabbings in the chaos of a robbery gone wrong. However, police claim that the evidence did not match his story.

For one thing, there were no signs of forced entry, except for a broken window, which police claimed had been broken from inside the apartment. There were also no signs of a robbery, as neither cash nor drugs had been taken from the apartment. In addition, the cuts on Nikki's hands were consistent with cuts that a person might sustain when blood on a knife used in a stabbing causes the perpetrator's hand to slip.



Others who knew the family also reported that they had a tumultuous relationship, even though Carlo ""supported"" Nikki ""100 percent"" when he decided to undergo so-called gender transition surgery.

""He was there to take care of her after the surgery,"" claimed Carlo's employer, Yadira Gomez. ""He supported her 100 percent. That's his daughter: 'Whatever you want to do, I'll support you.'""

Despite Carlo's love and support, Nikki allegedly often lashed out violently. ""He will just tell you, 'She's crazy, she's fighting all the time,'"" Gomez claimed.

""He would just say, 'She has problems,'"" she added.

Nikki Secondino, described as an aspiring female model, was arrested and charged with murder, attempted murder, and criminal possession of a weapon. It is unclear whether he has identified an attorney to represent him.

In the following video from two years ago, Nikki explains in great detail his journey with transgenderism, which he claims began at an early age:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/male-suspect-posing-as-female-allegedly-murdered-father-stabbed-sister-she-has-problems,2022-12-30
"Man allegedly assaults 69-year-old homeowner, exits residence, then tries going back inside, but victim gets his gun — and shoots attacker dead","The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation reported that a 49-year-old man late Sunday night entered a home in Bokoshe — which is near the Arkansas border — physically assaulted the 69-year-old homeowner, and left the residence.

However, the agency said the man soon turned around and tried to get back inside.

What happened next?

The homeowner — identified by an investigator as a male in a Poteau Daily News story — decided to act on his Second Amendment rights and grab a gun.

With that, the homeowner shot his younger adversary, identified as Ken Cosgrove, who died at the scene, the OSBI said.

Bokoshe police and deputies from the LeFlore County Sheriff’s Office responded to the incident, the OSBI reported, adding that the homeowner was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries he sustained in the assault and was later released.

The OSBI said the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made.

'Self-defense'

Lt. Paul Moss, a LeFlore County Sheriff’s Department investigator, told the Daily News that the homeowner ""has made the claim of self defense.""

Moss added to the paper that his deputies responded to ""a potential burglary or home invasion"" on South Missouri Street, but that it turned into a shooting around 11 p.m.

He noted to the Daily News that the homeowner shot at the individual who was trying to get into his house — and who had assaulted him — as well as at people who were in a truck.

Moss added to the paper that when he and his deputies arrived on the scene, a man was ""slumped over at the bottom of the steps in the front yard.""

He also told the Daily News that while the driver of the vehicle fled the scene, officials ""have a possible ID on the two occupants who were in the vehicle, which we’re not releasing at this time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-allegedly-assaults-69-year-old-homeowner-exits-residence-then-tries-going-back-inside-but-victim-gets-his-gun-and-shoots-attacker-dead,2022-01-04

Unfortunately for the alleged burglar, the apartment resident had a gun — and the station said he fired at least one round and hit the alleged intruder.

What happened next?

The injured suspect left the scene and soon entered a convenience store, KSNV said.

""He went and got a beer and came up to me and said, 'I need a beer,'"" the store clerk told the station in the aftermath, adding that she noticed the man's bullet wound.

The clerk also noted to KSNV that a female ""was behind him and calling for an ambulance for him, and she told me that he was the one who got shot, and I could see a hole.""

When the shot man departed the store, the clerk told the station she saw him with police: ""He was right out front, and they put his hands behind his back and had him on the ground.""

The suspect was taken to a hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, KSNV said.

'Thank God the homeowner had a gun and protected himself'

Others were surprised by the shooting.

""It's shocking, and the neighborhood needs to step up,"" nearby neighbor Bruce Schilke told the station.



Harley Gill lives nearby, too, and told KSNV the area ""is pretty calm. It's just mostly like drugs and stuff. People get into fights but not breaking into houses.""

""I get up, I go to the door, and there's a guy standing on my stoop,"" Oliver recounted to the station.

With that, Oliver asked in no uncertain terms what the man was doing there — and the suspect wisely bolted from the residence, WJBK said.

But was Oliver satisfied?

Not on your life.

He went after the man — who police identified as 27-year-old David Roberts of Livonia, the station said — and wrestled with him on the front lawn.

""Grabbed him by his hair,"" Oliver told WJBK. ""He was like an alligator just twisting, and he got away. He ran around the corner.""

Undaunted, Oliver got into his truck, followed the man through the neighborhood, and soon called 911, the station said.

Within minutes, officers showed up and took Roberts into custody, WJBK said.



How is the daughter doing?

"Man arrested after fatally shooting intruder who entered his home, tried to assault him. But prosecutors refuse to file murder charges, declare self-defense.","St. Louis police were called to the scene of a shooting around 11:30 p.m. Monday, and when they arrived at a residence in the 4500 block of Alcott Avenue, they found a man suffering from gunshot wounds near the home's entrance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

The wounded man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, the paper said.

Soon after police found a 40-year-old man they believed was the shooter, and he had a gunshot wound to his hand courtesy of his own gun, the Post-Dispatch added.

What happened next?

Police told the paper the shooter was in stable condition, and that he said the now-deceased man entered his home and attempted to assault him.

But it turns out this guy also had a gun to help him out of this jam — and he put it to use in his time of need. The Post-Dispatch said the man opened fire.

With that, police arrested the shooter Tuesday and sought charges from the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office, the paper added.

A subsequent Post-Dispatch story identified the fatally shot man as 58-year-old Michael Norman who lived in the 1100 block of Belrue Avenue in University City.

The paper said in the follow-up story that the 40-year-old shooter was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and armed criminal action.

Here's video showing the aftermath of the shooting:

But prosectors won't file charges



However, St. Louis prosecutors declined to file murder charges against the shooter, citing self-defense, the Post-Dispatch said.

The paper said a spokeswoman for the circuit attorney could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

"Intruder breaks glass on home's back door after midnight, walks up stairs, opens bedroom door. But homeowner is waiting with a gun and shoots him dead.","It's after midnight, and you're alone in your home and fast asleep when suddenly you're awakened by glass breaking downstairs.

You recognize it's the sound of someone breaking through the glass on your back door.

Then you hear footsteps climbing the stairs — and they head to your bedroom door.

In a terrifying turn, the intruder opens your bedroom door.

It's a scenario straight out of a slasher movie, but it happened to a Houston homeowner early Thursday morning.

But fortunately for the homeowner, he had a gun and used it to protect himself.

What went down?

Houston police told KTRK-TV the homeowner — who lives in the 2200 block of Naomi near Cambridge Street, not far from NRG Park — was asleep on the second floor but woke up just after 1 a.m. when he heard the back door glass break, which is when the intruder entered the house.

The homeowner was alone at the time, KTRK added.

Cops said the intruder went upstairs and opened the bedroom door, which is when the armed homeowner shot the intruder in the neck, the station said.

Officials said the intruder ran off and started knocking on neighbors' doors for help, saying he had been shot, KTRK reported, but he soon died at the scene.

'Justice was served'

A family who lives next door to the homeowner told the station the intruder was in their back yard around midnight, breaking items and turning on the hose.

The family also told KTRK the intruder keyed their car before going next door.

""This is very scary in the sense of, like, that this thing could happen over here,"" one neighbor told the station on camera, ""but at the same time, you could actually say justice was served.""

Man breaks into hearing-impaired woman's home; 62-year-old tells him to leave. But instead he moves toward her — so she takes aim with shotgun.,"Authorities in eastern Oklahoma said a man broke into a hearing-impaired woman's home in Rock Island about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, the Associated Press reported.

Le Flore County Sheriff Rob Seale told the AP the woman yelled at the intruder to get out of the house.

If at first you don't succeed



But when he moved toward her, the 62-year-old woman grabbed a shotgun and shot him once in the chest, the outlet said in a follow-up story.



Deputies discovered the suspect's body in the kitchen area of the house, the AP said, adding that he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The woman was uninjured, the outlet noted, adding that Seale said she didn't know the man and had never seen him before.

Lengthy criminal record

Man breaks into home in middle of night. But homeowner is a Vietnam vet with a gun — and he uses it with deadly accuracy.,"A Missouri homeowner fatally shot a man in a suspected burglary of his home near Willard in the middle of the night last week, Greene County investigators told KYTV-TV.

What are the details?

Deputies were called to a home in the 6000 block of West Hawthorn Court in the Meadows Subdivision for a burglary in progress around 4 a.m. Thursday, the station noted in a previous story.

Deputies found the suspect dead inside the residence, KYTV reported, adding that a front window was shattered.

""The suspect attacked the homeowner, and the homeowner was able to defend himself, and as a result the suspect is deceased,"" Deputy Jason Winston with the Greene County Sheriff's Office told the station.

""I'm a little shocked this is all going down next door,"" neighbor Jay Davis noted to KYTV.

Investigators did not identify the two other people who were in the house when the break-in occurred, the station said, adding that those two people weren't hurt. The homeowner, however, was taken to a hospital where he was being treated for injuries that were not life threatening, KYTV said.

""He probably saved them,"" Davis told the station regarding his neighbor. ""He's already a hero because he's a Vietnam veteran. Now he's even a bigger hero because he saved his family.""

Winston added to KYTV, ""We're just glad the homeowner was able to confront this suspect and defend himself and his family against this attack.""

What do we know about the suspect?

Investigators identified the deceased burglary suspect as Ryan Altman, 37, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the station said.

The sheriff's office is working to figure out why the suspect chose to break into the house, KYTV noted.

Winston also noted to KYTV that the residents of the home ""have no idea who the suspect is; there's no connection there.""

Man allegedly forces his way into home in middle of the night — but resident has a gun and shoots him dead,"Police in Newport Beach, California, said they were called just before 4:15 a.m. Thursday about a man with ""mental health issues"" or under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the Orange County Register reported.

The man then forced his way into a residence, Heather Rangel, a police spokeswoman, told the Register.

""He'd been around the house for like 20 minutes then came around to the front and broke the front door down, that's when he entered the house,"" neighbor Bill Finster told KNBC-TV.

What happened next?

Police told the Register that someone inside the home shot the intruder dead. Neighbors told KNBC the man was shot once and that his body was found inside the Indus Street home.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, the paper said. There have been no arrests, the station added.

Police told KNBC the man who forced his way inside the home either was mentally ill or under the influence.

Who was the alleged intruder?

The fatally shot man was identified as 23-year-old Henry Lehr of Tucson, Arizona, the Register said, citing the Orange County Sheriff's Department.

Anything else?

Sounds of the incident were caught on a home security camera, KNBC said.

""We've had a series of break-ins in cars right in their driveways,"" another neighbor, Chet Groskreutz, told the station.

Image source: KNBC-TV video screenshot

Neighbors added to KNBC that the intruder lived at a house just a few doors away — one of several sober-living homes in the area.

""These halfway houses scare us,"" Finster also told the station.

More from KNBC:

City officials say their hands are tied, that any sober living home of six or fewer people is regulated by the state.



City officials say the only way they can get involved is if there is a code enforcement issue or seven or more people in one home.

The station said neighborhood residents have complained about security issues for years.

Finster told KNBC of a previous scary incident: ""Broad daylight, guy was on something, stark-ass naked, and a cop nailed him in front the house — but whatever he was on, he was overpowering the officer.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-breaks-into-home-armed-resident-shoots-dead,2021-08-30
"Man who broke into family's home after midnight charges at homeowner outside, cops say. But homeowner has a gun — and it doesn't end well for suspect.","A man broke into a Florida home around 1 a.m. Sunday while a husband, wife, and their three children were asleep — and he paid a huge price.

What happened?

Polk County Sheriff's deputies said the homeowner's wife heard banging on the front door of their Frostproof residence and woke him up, WTSP-TV reported. When he investigated, he noticed the front door had been forced open — so he grabbed a handgun, the station said.

With that, investigators said the husband found Jory Plummer outside in front of the home ""yelling obscenities at him,"" WPST reported.

The man told Plummer ""numerous times"" to leave, the station noted, but investigators said Plummer refused.

""The husband described Plummer as 'out of control,'"" the sheriff's office wrote in a news release, according to WPST.

But it got worse. Deputies told the station that Plummer charged at the homeowner, who – ""in fear for his life"" – fired one round and hit the suspect.

Things weren't over yet. The sheriff's office said Plummer walked a few feet, turned around, and charged again — and the homeowner shot the suspect a second time, WPST reported.

Deputies responded to the scene and tried lifesaving efforts, but Plummer died at a hospital, the station said.



What did the sheriff have to say?

""People have a right to be safe in their home, and when necessary, defend that safety,"" Sheriff Grady Judd wrote in a statement, WPST said. ""At this point in the investigation, the evidence indicates that the resident acted in self-defense.""

Judd added on a WVTV-TV clip that ""our victim and his wife have zero criminal history. Just good, hard-working Americans in their bed at night, with their infant children, when [the suspect] kicks the door in.""

The station said Plummer's criminal history includes nine felonies and nine misdemeanors, including:

Sexual assault

Domestic violence — battery

Tampering with evidence

Forgery

Resisting a law enforcement officer

Possession of marijuana

Driving on a suspended driver's license

Violation of probation

Failure to appear

Man breaks into home of mother of three. Problem for intruder? Mom is a sheriff's deputy — and she doesn't hesitate to use her gun.,"One guy sure picked the wrong house to break into last week — and he didn't stop at just one.

What are the details?

Bart Anthony Coniglio forcibly entered a family member's home in Wilmington just before 1 p.m. last Wednesday, WECT-TV reported, citing the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. A female who made a 911 call said it was her son, the station added.

After she escaped out the front door with a friend, the pair ran to a neighbor's home — which happened to be the residence of New Hanover County sheriff's deputy Leyla M. Davis-Woodhouse, a mother of three who was off duty with her kids, the station said.

Authorities said Coniglio then forcibly entered the deputy's home, where a physical altercation took place, WECT said.

Turns out the woman who ran from the first house was still on her call to 911 — and was now describing events while hiding in a bedroom in the deputy's home, the station reported.

""He's trying to get in her house,"" she said, according to WECT. ""She's fighting with him outside."" The station added that moments later, the caller said, ""She's trying to get him out of the house ... he won't get out.""

What happened next?

Other neighbors told WECT that Davis-Woodhouse warned Coniglio to not come any closer or she'd have to draw her gun — and then moments later, they heard two shots.

""She shot him or something,"" the caller said, according to the station.

Minutes later Davis-Woodhouse called 911 and said, ""This man has pushed his way into my house, and I shot him twice. They need to get here now,"" WECT reported.

Then Davis-Woodhouse shouted, ""Stay down, you hear me?"" after which she told the dispatcher, ""He fought me on the porch and pushed his way inside my house,"" the station said.

More from WECT:

Conigilio is no stranger to law enforcement. According to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, the 40-year-old is a convicted felon who has a criminal record dating back to 2002 for offenses ranging from resisting an officer, to possession of controlled substances, to multiple DWI arrests, and embezzlement. He has not done any prison time in North Carolina.



Coniglio also has pending court dates on more than a dozen criminal charges in New Hanover County, including Assault on a Female, Domestic Violence Protective Order Violation, Habitual Assault, Probation Violation, and giving Fictitious Information to an Officer.

What else do we know the suspect?

Coniglio was hospitalized and was being treated as of Wednesday, WLOS-TV reported.

A family member filed a Jan. 8 domestic violence protective order against Coniglio that said he has ""ongoing mental health issues,"" the StarNews reported. The family member wrote that she feared her safety, and Coniglio ""believes he is possessed by demons and that people are going to shoot him.""

What else do we know about the deputy?

The New Hanover County Sheriff's Office said it hired Davis-Woodhouse in August 2014 as a detention officer and promoted her to deputy in May 2018, the paper said. She moved to the patrol division in July 2018 and was promoted to detective on Feb. 9, 2021, the StarNews said.

"Man breaks into home, stabs homeowner who tries to fight back. Then homeowner's son grabs a gun — and it's all over for intruder.","After a 38-year-old man broke into a San Diego home early Tuesday morning, the 54-year-old homeowner confronted and began fighting him, police told KFMB-TV.

But the homeowner was at a disadvantage — the intruder began stabbing him, the station said.

To the rescue, however, was the homeowner's 20-year-old son who grabbed a gun and shot the intruder, KFMB said.

What happened to the homeowner?



Police found the homeowner on the floor with stab wounds to his upper body, KFMB said. He was taken to the hospital and listed in stable condition, the station said. The homeowner was still in hospital Tuesday night, the station added.

Neither the name of the homeowner nor the name of the suspect were released, KFMB reported, adding that the street was closed while homicide detectives investigated the shooting.

Gun lock-up law



The incident occurred just a day after the San Diego City Council voted to pass a law requiring homeowners to lock up their firearms at home, the station said.

Those backing the measure believed it would save lives, KFMB noted, while critics argued for the need to quickly access guns for self-defense.

Police declined to comment regarding if the gun used in the reported home invasion was locked up, the station said.

What happened next?

As the intruder entered the residence — which was occupied by three people — the homeowner confronted him, after which a struggle ensued, the outlet said.

But the homeowner had a distinct advantage over the intruder.

The homeowner, you see, exercised his Second Amendment rights and was armed with a handgun — and wasted no time using it, either. During the struggle, the homeowner fired the gun at the intruder and struck him in the upper body, TheBay.net reported.

Preliminary reports indicated that intruder was shot in the left side of his chest and in his arm, the outlet added.

Soon deputies from the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office arrived at the scene in the 23200 block of Woodland Acres Road for the reported burglary and person shot, TheBay.net said.

Troopers from the Maryland State Police also responded to the scene and found the suspect inside the residence and confirmed he sustained multiple gunshot wounds, Southern Maryland News Net reported, adding that the homeowner reportedly used a .40 caliber handgun.

News Net added that one occupant of the home reportedly gave medical aid to the suspect while officers applied a tourniquet prior to the arrival of fire and rescue personnel.

The shot man was identified as Tavein Malik Dickens, 23, of Lexington Park, TheBay.net reported.

It was determined that Dickens was in critical condition and needed immediate transportation to a trauma center — but TheBay.net reported that dangerous weather conditions grounded all helicopter transports.

Soon Dickens was taken to MedStar St. Mary's Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, TheBay.net said.

Responding deputies found an adult man dead in the home, the station said.

History of domestic violence



The homeowner is related to the suspect, and there was a history of domestic violence between the suspect and those living in the home, authorities told WFTS.

There were four adults in the home at the time of the shooting: the homeowner, an elderly female family member, and two friends of the homeowner, the sheriff's office told the station.

The homeowner is cooperating with detectives, there have been no arrests, and the identities of the homeowner and suspect aren't being released yet, WFTS said.

Will the state's Stand Your Ground law apply?



The sheriff's office will consult with the State Attorney's Office to see if Florida's Stand Your Ground law applies in this case, the station said.

The law states that people can use deadly force if they fear their lives are in danger, or if they believe they will suffer great bodily harm — and that they don't have to retreat in such instances.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-breaks-window-after-midnight-to-enter-home-but-homeowner-has-a-gun,2019-07-05
"Man enters house, tells wheelchair-bound homeowner, 'Give me that gun before you hurt yourself, old man.' Intruder definitely got it.","An elderly, wheelchair-bound Arkansas homeowner was more than a match for an intruder — particularly with his Remington Speedmaster .22-caliber long rifle at the ready, investigators from the Mississippi County Sheriff's Department told TheBlaze Tuesday.

What happened?

The homeowner told authorities he was awakened around 3 a.m. Sept. 17 by a loud noise at his Manila residence. With that, he went into his living room where he encountered a white male he didn't know.

The homeowner asked the suspect to leave — but instead the intruder made himself something to eat and drink, the sheriff's department said.

The homeowner again asked the man to leave — but instead the intruder began unplugging a living room television, authorities said.

At some point, the homeowner produced his rifle — because the sheriff's office said after the homeowner asked the suspect one more time to leave, the intruder replied, ""Give me that gun before you hurt yourself, old man.""



Ask and you shall receive



You might say the suspect most definitely got the gun.

The sheriff's office said the homeowner shot the suspect once in the leg, upon which the intruder headed out of the residence.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found the suspect — identified as Charles Lancaster, 47, of Keiser — across the street, authorities said.

After Lancaster was treated for his injury at a hospital, the sheriff's office said he was arrested and charged with residential burglary. He was in jail in lieu of a $75,000 bond, authorities said.

Lancaster was still in jail Tuesday, a detention center official told TheBlaze.

The homeowner who pulled the trigger is not being charged, the sheriff's office added to TheBlaze.

Carrera told WALA he ""ran around the left side of [my neighbor’s] house, and when I got to the corner of the house, they were coming out the front door at the same time, and [one of the burglars] was shooting backward. When he shot his first one, it [whizzed] right past my damn ear.”

He added to the station that “when it all went down — when the gunfire and all that started, I just said, ‘God, watch over us.’ ...""

Mobile Police told WALA they received a 911 call and responded to the 1000 block of McGough Court for a burglary in progress.

“About 10 minutes later, a call came through the radio that someone's just been rushed to the hospital with multiple gunshot wounds — and was matching the exact description that I had gave them,” Carrera told the station.

Investigators told WALA that officers went to a hospital in reference to a 20-year-old man with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, but police didn't confirm the wounded man was part of the burglary and didn't make any arrests.

'It felt like four or five hours'

There's also surveillance video from Carrera’s home showing him and his stepfather coming outside to see what was going on across the street.

In the upper right corner of the video, Carrera is huddled behind a vehicle in the driveway for protection, the station said.

“Forty-five seconds tops, the whole thing,” Carrera told WALA, estimating how long the ordeal lasted. “It felt like four or five hours.""

"Man kicks in back door of house, charges at homeowner — who has a gun and fires. It proves to be suspect's final home invasion.","The homeowner told KATU-TV that after his Vancouver, Washington, residence was broken into two years ago, he had security cameras and an alarm installed.

And it was that alarm that gave him the head's up that his home was being broken into again Thursday night, the station said.

What are the details?

Police told KATU that the suspect kicked open a back door of the home after 10 p.m. and was inside when the homeowner confronted him.

Then the burglary suspect charged the homeowner, investigators told the station.

But in addition to security cameras and an alarm, the homeowner also had a gun. Police said the homeowner fired it and hit the suspect, who fled out the door, KATU reported.

The suspect, who has not been identified, was found dead where he collapsed outside in the back of the property, police told the station.

Police said the homeowner and his family were not injured, KATU noted.

Criminal defense attorney weighs in

The station spoke with criminal defense attorney Kris Carrasco, who said homeowners have a right to protect themselves. Washington is a Stand Your Ground state, KATU said.

""In a self-defense situation you do not have a duty to retreat,"" Carrasco told the station. ""You don't have to run away before asserting your right to self-defense.""

Image source: KATU-TV video screenshot

But he also warned homeowners that there is such a thing as using too much force when defending themselves, KATU noted.



""You can't bring a gun to a fist fight,"" Carrasco told the station, adding that ""for a mere trespass to property, you can't use a gun and shoot to kill if someone is just doing a crime against your property. There has to be actual threat to your life.""

The attorney also noted to KATU, ""The question is, 'What's the severity of the assault?' Is there a reasonable belief of serious injury or just a normal assault?""

'Homeowners have a right to protect themselves'

Mike Murphy lives nearby and told KOIN-TV that ""homeowners have a right to protect themselves. You can't just expect to break into somebody's home and there's not going to be repercussions to their actions.""

A woman who lives in the neighborhood agreed, telling KOIN she's sorry someone died ""for trinkets or whatever. It wasn't worth it.

Man opens fire after discovering suspected burglars inside his home — hitting one of them — and they all flee,"A homeowner in Wichita, Kansas, arrived at his residence around 4 p.m. Tuesday when he discovered four or five suspected burglars inside, police told the Wichita Eagle.

With that, the homeowner fired one shot — hitting one of the suspected burglars — and all of them fled the house, police told the paper.

The shot suspect — a 50-year-old woman — was found at the Lost Sock Laundromat almost five miles from the home, the Eagle reported, adding that paramedics took her to a hospital for what cops called non-life-threatening injuries.



Wichita Police Lt. Joe Kennedy said the homeowner is cooperating with the investigation, and detectives have yet to determine whether there was any property loss, the paper said. The robbery appears to be random with no known connection between the homeowner and burglars, the Eagle said.

The district attorney's office will determine if the shooting was justified, Kennedy added the paper.

"Man shoots burglar who broke into his home, and fleeing crook abandons car at scene. That dumb move leads to his arrest — and a big break in crime spree.","Thanks to a gun-toting homeowner with a good-enough aim — along with a repeat offender who made a critical error leading to his arrest — it appears Las Vegas-area authorities have been handed a break in a crime spree that's been going on for months.

What are the details?

A Las Vegas homeowner in a gated community told police he was in an upstairs bedroom around 7:30 p.m. Feb. 7 when his dogs started to growl, KLAS-TV reported, citing an arrest report.

So the homeowner checked home security cameras on his phone and saw four hooded and masked individuals attempting to break in to his residence, the station said.

With that, the man went into his closet, got dressed, and grabbed his gun, KLAS reported.

After the burglars got inside, the homeowner walked to a balcony that opens to the floor below and shot five times at three of the suspects, the station said, citing the report.

All four suspects ran from the home, police told KLAS, adding that a bullet hit one of them.

Oops

Afterward police took note of an unregistered Audi parked in front of the victim’s home near Cimarron Road and Oakey Boulevard, the station said, adding that the VIN number is connected to a Texas woman with the last name Freeman.

And wouldn't you know that about an hour after the shooting, a 28-year-old man — later identified as Leroy Freeman — arrived at Spring Valley Hospital with a gunshot wound, police told KLAS.

Cops checked out more surveillance videos showing the Audi entering the gated community minutes before the shooting, the station said, adding that police said the suspects are seen on camera breaking a back patio door to enter the home.

Police matched clothing seen on video to two suspects — one of whom was Freeman — and cops arrested him on charges of home invasion, burglary, and conspiracy to commit burglary, KLAS reported.

A second individual also was charged with the same three charges, but the name was redacted due to that person's age, the station said, adding that information on the other two suspects was not provided in the report.

But wait, there's more

Turns out Freeman was wanted in connection with nearly a dozen burglaries, was under police surveillance days before the homeowner shot him, and had served prison time, KLAS reported in a separate story.

Freeman now faces 11 counts of home invasion and 9 counts of residential burglary in a suspected regional crime spree that began last November, the station said, citing court documents and police records.

Police in Henderson, Nevada — which is about 15 miles southeast of Las Vegas — wrote in court documents that in all the recent incidents, a group of two to four men wearing masks and dark clothing have broken into homes through back doors or windows, KLAS reported. Cops added that victims in several of the incidents hid in their homes as the group was inside, the station said.

On Nov. 25, Las Vegas Metro police stopped Freeman while he was driving a car rented in his father's name, KLAS reported.

On Jan. 6, that car was reported stolen as it hadn't been returned to the car rental agency, police told the station.

On Jan. 10, police arrested Freeman for possession of a stolen vehicle after that same car was stopped on Interstate 15 in California, police added to KLAS.

Police later learned through tracking mechanisms that Freeman was “at or in the area” of 10 burglaries in Henderson, the station said.

And while Henderson police had Freeman under surveillance for several days before the homeowner shot him during the Feb. 7 burglary, cops weren't watching him that day, KLAS said.

Imagine that

What's more, cops learned after Freeman's arrest that he'd been renting a Henderson apartment under a woman’s name — except that she has no ties to the Las Vegas area, and police said Freeman stole her identity, the station said.

Cops told KLAS they searched the apartment Feb. 9 and found several stolen items and a firearm.

Freeman was being held Thursday on $250,000 bail and is due in court next week, the station said.

Anything else? Why, yes there is

In addition, police added that Freeman served prison time for a series of 2017 home invasions, KLAS reported, adding that he took a plea deal culminating with a judge sentencing him to two years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-shoots-burglar-who-broke-into-his-home-and-fleeing-crook-abandons-car-at-scene,2022-02-18
"Man shoots intruders, one of them fatally, after they shatter home's window in middle of night","As gun sales spike amid a growing wave of violence in America's streets over the past several months, one would assume that thoughtful, reflective criminals would be aware that the odds of targeting gun owners likely increase by the day.

And it would seem that a pair of southern California crooks simply hadn't been reading the writing on the wall.

What went down?

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said two suspects were trying to get into a home in Pico Rivera — about 20 minutes southeast of Los Angeles — around 1:20 a.m. Friday, KTTV-TV reported.

The resident woke up to the sound of shattering glass and saw one man inside the home, the station said, and the resident reportedly grabbed his handgun and shot the suspect.



Lt. Brad Hall told KCBS-TV that the resident shot the suspect in the chest.

The resident then went to the back patio, where he encountered the second suspect, KCBS reported, adding that the resident thought he saw the suspect make a move toward his waist.

Afraid the second suspect was grabbing for a gun, the resident fired again, striking the suspect, who died at the scene, Hall told KCBS.

Deputies who responded to the incident in the 8400 block of Serapis Avenue, east of Rosemead Boulevard, found the suspect lying dead in the home's back yard, KTTV reported.

Image source: KTTV-TV video screenshot

The deceased suspect's name was not released, KCBS said, adding that it's unclear whether he was armed.



The first suspect fled the home, after which a woman getaway driver transported him to a hospital, where he was undergoing surgery, the station said. His condition is unknown, KCBS reported. KTTV said sheriff's deputies arrested him at the the hospital.

Hall said sheriff's deputies took the woman getaway driver into custody, KCBS reported. Other people were in a different part of the home when the shooting occurred, but Hall told the station they weren't hurt.

What happened to the resident?



The resident wasn't arrested, but KTTV said he was taken to the sheriff's office for questioning. It's unclear whether he will face any charges, KCBS reported.

KTTV said the incident is being investigated as a burglary or home invasion robbery.

The two suspects may be linked to a gang, Hall told KCBS. There was no word on whether the home was specifically targeted or if the break-in was random, the station added.

What happened next?

Then around 7 p.m. Harkless broke into the female's Columbia home by shooting out a back glass patio door, deputies told the station.

But the homeowner had a gun, too. And when he retrieved it, he shot Harkless once in the upper body after Harkless' entrance into the home, officials told WLTX.

With that, Harkless ran off and stole a vehicle from the driveway next door — the vehicle was running and unattended — and drove to a nearby hotel where he asked staff to call 911, the station said.

With that, the homeowner told the man to stop what he was doing, the station said.

But instead of stopping, the man turned his attention to the homeowner who told him to stop — and began attacking his residence, KWCH said.

What went down next?

The man came over and tried ramming the homeowner's door with a post, the station said — and it just got worse from there.

""Threw two bricks through my window and tried to crawl through ... my window and told me he was going to kill me and kinds of other things,"" the homeowner, who didn't want to be identified, recalled to KWCH.

The homeowner was hoping that authorities would arrive before he was forced to defend himself, the station said.

And the homeowner chose to exercise his Second Amendment rights as a way of defending himself should the need arise — and said as much after he dialed 911.

""I was on the phone and I was telling the cops, 'Get here. Please get here. I don't want to shoot this man. Please get here,'"" the homeowner noted to KWCH.

Soon the homeowner had no other choice: ""Unfortunately, I had to shoot him,"" he told the station.

What happened to the suspect?

After arriving at the home in the 2500 block of East Wilma, officers found the suspect with a gunshot wound and rushed him to a hospital in critical condition, KWCH reported.

The homeowner told the station he hopes the man doesn't die. But he also indicated he wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger if a similar scenario occurred again.

""I pray to God he survives and makes it through and gets the help he needs and doesn't try to come back over here,"" the homeowner told KWCH, ""or the same result will happen.""

Man with a gun arrested near protesters outside Trump's Dallas rally,"A man with a gun was arrested near anti-Trump protesters at the president's rally Thursday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.

Reporter Meredith Yeomans of NBC KXAS-TV posted videos of the man being arrested on her social media account.

She indicated that he also carried a gas mask, an aerosol can, a vest, mace, and a backpack. The man was encountered by Dallas police near a protest from those objecting to the decision by President Donald Trump to pull back troops from northern Syria ahead of a Turkish invasion force.

Yeomans said the man was wearing an ""InfoWars"" T-shirt at the time.

Dallas police said that he did have a license for the weapon, but he was sent to a hospital for an evaluation.

"'He's a monster': Man with sharpened teeth accused of imprisoning and violating pregnant woman for weeks, threatening to 'rip out her throat'","A 20-year-old pregnant woman was kicked out of her house around Thanksgiving. Her luck appeared to be make a holiday rebound when a stranger offered her a warm meal and a place to stay. However, this was anything but charity.



Michael Barajas, 36, is accused of subjecting the young woman to unimaginable depravities over the course of three weeks.

The sheriff whose team captured the suspect called the story ""horrifying"" and deemed Barajas ""a monster.""

What are the details?

Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson claimed that this nightmarish ordeal began when Barajas spotted the pregnant victim, unkempt and walking alone. Seizing upon her vulnerability, he began the process of grooming her.

""Grooming is part of this whole process. It started [with] identifying someone who is vulnerable. It started by identifying what the need was. They filled the need and that's when they trap them in,"" said Swanson.

Barajas, charged in 2018 with first-degree home invasion, lured the victim back to his ramshackle residence with the promise of warmth, food, and a clean place to spend the night. Instead of hospitality, the victim found herself tied to a bed in a barricaded room.

In a disturbing video posted to Facebook on Wednesday, Sheriff Swanson walked through the suspect's house, noting how the windows in the room where the victim was kept were screwed shut. The door to the room was deadbolted.

According Swanson, extra to these imprisonment measures, Barajas also told the victim ""that if she didn't do everything that he told her to do, that he would bite her neck and rip out her throat.""

Barajas allegedly raped and assaulted the victim over the course of three weeks, but he was not alone in this depravity.

“This guy used the opportunity to not only sexually assault but have people come over and traffic her as she was tied forcibly to the bed while they assaulted her,” Swanson explained.

The victim made repeated escape attempts.

The first two times, the victim was shot at and dragged back by her captors.



On the third occasion, the woman reportedly suffered a ""medical emergency"" related to her pregnancy, which landed her in a hospital.

Nurses at Hurley Medical Center recognized that the victim had been abused and contacted the Genesee Human Oppression Strike Team on Dec. 8.

GHOST raided Barajas' residence and arrested him later that day.

According to the Tri-County Times, Barajas has been charged with human trafficking, kidnapping, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, possession of methamphetamine, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, and felony possession of a firearm.

""This guy is a monster,"" said Swanson. ""If you look at the teeth that are filed down and the threats of ripping out a throat, I will say no more.""

"Sen. Joe Manchin knocks 'hypocritical,' 'senseless' Biden for continuing to buy up Russian oil while they invade Ukraine","President Joe Biden is expected to tout his administration's sanctions campaign against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine during his State of the Union address Tuesday night — but at least one Democratic lawmaker thinks the president's response is mightily lacking one key area.

What are the details?

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) rebuked the president on Monday over his refusal to cut off Russian energy imports, calling the White House's response ""hypocritical"" and ""senseless.""

Instead of continuing to buy up Russian energy, the moderate Democrat said the U.S. should be hitting the Kremlin where it hurts by curtailing purchases of Russian crude oil and energy while building up American energy independence.

""We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,"" Manchin told Bloomberg. ""We’re buying 650,000 barrels a day from Russia. It’s ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.""

The senator, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, later said in a statement: ""The entire world is watching as [Russian President] Vladimir Putin uses energy as a weapon in an attempt to extort and coerce our European allies. While Americans decry what is happening in Ukraine, the United States continues to allow the import of more than half a million barrels per day of crude oil and other petroleum products from Russia during this time of war.""

Continued reliance on Russian oil poses a ""clear and present danger to our nation’s energy security,"" he added before calling on the Biden administration to ""ramp up domestic energy production"" right away.

""To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical,"" Manchin charged. ""To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.""

Oil sales are a major income stream for Moscow and so remain a key funding source for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Given that fact, curbing energy imports seems like an obvious strategic maneuver, especially for a country as resource-rich as the U.S.

It's something even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau figured out — though Trudeau's declaratory ban on Russian crude oil imports was quickly called out as nothing but a public relations move. Canada hasn't imported Russian crude for years.

What else?

Nevertheless, Biden continues to allow Putin and his warring administration to benefit from foreign oil purchases, even while other sanctions levied by the U.S. and Western allies wreak havoc on the Russian economy.

A ban on crude oil imports from Russia could be the death knell for Moscow's war machine.

But just as he initially balked at imposing some of the most severe sanctions — such as removing Russia from SWIFT, a vital international banking system, and personally sanctioning Putin — Biden here again seems content to wait and see if such steps are necessary.

"Marco Rubio, something off, Vladimir Putin, Russia, Ukraine","As the people of Ukraine continue to come under assault by invading Russian forces, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that ""something is off with"" Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,"" Rubio wrote. ""He has always been a killer,but his problem now is different & significant,"" the lawmaker continued. ""It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago.""

The Florida Republican, who has served in the U.S. Senate for more than a decade, is currently the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.



""I am requesting that the Biden Admin preemptively announce that anyone who joins a puppet Russian installed govt in #Ukraine be automatically sanctioned,receive a visa ban & will be the subject of an Interpol Red Notice,"" Rubio also tweeted. ""I ask other nations to do the same.""

His comments come as Ukrainians bravely fight back against a Russian invasion.

Couple returns from vacation to find all of their belongings gone and two people sleeping on their bed,"A Maryland couple says they went on vacation and returned to find all of their belongings gone and another couple sleeping in their bed, the only item left in their home.

The bizarre incident unfolded on April 5 when the couple came back to their apartment in the city of Greenbelt. They had been on vacation since March 28.

The first thing they noticed was that their front door was damaged. When they went inside, all of their property was missing, the apartment was completely empty. At that point they began to record video with their cellphones.

The only piece of furniture still in the apartment was a bed. And they found a man and a woman sleeping on it.

The couple says that the two people told them they had taken all their belongings and then got aggressive with them. They fled the apartment on foot.

Missing from the apartment was furniture, food, clothing, even the doors on the kitchen cabinets. They said there were plastic bags filled with items and there was trash on the walls.

The couple believes they lost more than $49k worth of belongings.

“It’s just so devastating to come home from what was probably a really nice vacation and be excited to sleep in your own bed, and then just be totally rocked not only with the fact that someone’s been in your space, but they’ve taken everything,” said Greenbelt City Police Officer Hannah Glasgow to WTOP-TV.

The Greenbelt Police Department is asking for the public's help in identifying the two suspects that were found in the apartment. One was a black male adult and the other was a white female adult. The police released screenshots from videos that the couple recorded of the suspects before they fled.

Masked home intruders pistol-whip sleeping couple. Then homeowner grabs his own gun — and dismisses one assailant permanently.,"An Ohio couple told police they were awakened about 2 a.m. Monday to a pair of masked men pistol-whipping them during a robbery attempt, CantonRep.com reported.

At some point during the attack, the assailants left the bedroom of the northwest Canton home and went downstairs in search of money, detectives told the outlet.

But when the pair headed back up the stairs, the homeowner got his own gun, CantonRep reported.

Police Capt. Dave Davis told the outlet the homeowner opened fire and hit one of the intruders several times.

What happened to the intruder who was shot?

The intruder who was shot — Nicholas A. Hug, 24 — ran from the home along with a second intruder who has yet to be identified, CantonRep said.

Hug was driven to a hospital where was pronounced dead, police told the outlet.

Hug fired ""three rounds from his rifle before being shot and killed by the homeowner,"" the outlet added, citing court records filed by police.

What else do we know?



Joi T. Griffith, 28, was accused of driving Hug and the other intruder to the house, police added to CantonRep. Then after Hug was shot, Griffith returned to the scene, picked up Hug, and drove him to the hospital, the outlet said, citing court records.

Davis said officers detained Griffith at the hospital and took her to police headquarters for questioning as other officers tried to locate the second intruder, CantonRep reported.

Griffith was booked into jail Monday afternoon on charges of murder, complicity to aggravated burglary, and obstructing justice, the outlet said.

Police said Griffith repeatedly lied about her involvement as the driver, which resulted in the obstructing justice and complicity to aggravated burglary charges, CantonRep reported. And even though Griffith didn't pull the trigger, Canton City Prosecutor Jason Reese told the outlet state law allows the murder charge against her since someone died during the commission of another felony crime — the burglary.

More from CantonRep:

Stark County court records show Hug went to prison last year for improperly handling weapons in a motor vehicle, having weapons under disability and obstructing official business. The court records also show he went to prison in 2015 for carrying a concealed weapon, driving under suspension, failure to comply with police, two counts of felony obstructing official business and three counts of receiving stolen property.

Davis said the victims of the Canton home invasion didn't know their assailants, the outlet said.

But the homeowner did tell police that his residence was broken into a week before, CantonRep noted. Details of that break in weren't available, the outlet said, and Davis noted that detectives didn't yet know if the incidents are related.

Maxine Waters said Trump charged with premeditated murder,"Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said that former President Donald Trump should ""absolutely"" be charged with premeditated murder for the Capitol riots on Jan. 6.

During a Tuesday interview with MSNBC host Joy Reid, Waters claimed without evidence that Trump ""had advance planning about the invasion that took place in our Capitol.""

Waters also made another accusation, ""There's information that some of the planning came out of individuals working in this campaign.""

""As a matter of fact, he absolutely should be charged with premeditated murder because of the lives that were lost with this invasion with his insurrection,"" Waters said of Trump. ""We have to fight as hard as we can to see to it that there's some justice.""



Waters continued, ""For the president of the United States to sit and watch the invasion and the insurrection and not say a word because he knew he had absolutely initiated it – and as some of them said, 'He invited us to come. We're here at the invitation of the president of the United States.'""

In January, Waters called for Trump to be impeached for a second time because he is ""capable of starting a civil war.""

""This president has spent four years abusing his power, lying, embracing authoritarianism [and] radicalizing his supporters against democracy,"" Waters said last month on the House floor. ""This corruption poisoned the minds of his supporters, inciting them to willingly join white supremacists, neo-Nazis and paramilitary extremists in a siege of the United States Capitol building, the very seat of American democracy.""

Waters called Trump ""the worst president in the history of the United States.""

""This president intends to exercise power long after he is out of office …,"" she said, ""we should be concerned that the Republicans will not defend him and he is capable of starting a civil war. He must be impeached. He must be stopped now.""

Waters has her own history of spouting political rhetoric that could be considered inciting dangerous confrontations.

In June 2018, Waters delivered a fiery speech where she called on her followers to harass staffers of the Trump administration.

""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere,"" Waters commanded.

In September 2018, Waters talked about her controversial command to harass Trump Cabinet members, and said, ""I did not threaten [Trump] constituents and supporters. I do that all the time, but I didn't do that that time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maxine-waters-trump-impeachment-murder-capitol,2021-02-04
"Megachurch pastor hawks loogie, rubs it on man's face in sermon illustration as church-goers gasp in horror: 'Cult energy'","Michael Todd, the leader of a Tulsa megachurch, sparked intense backlash after a viral clip showed him smearing spit on a person's face during a sermon illustration on Sunday.

Todd, who leads Transformation Church, literally hawked a loogie into his hand and rubbed it on a man's face. The point of the illustration, Todd claimed, was that ""receiving a vision from God might get nasty.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

When Todd hawked the loogie into his hand — twice — the audience gasped and jeered. However, the reaction failed to deter Todd. In fact, he seemingly mocked the disgusting act.

""Many of you are so bothered, like literally some of y'all can't even look ... but this is what it will feel like,"" Todd said, later adding, ""The thing about the blind man, the thing about us, if we want to see clearly, we have to allow Jesus to do it.""

Todd was allegedly demonstrating his understanding of Mark 8:22-26, a story in which Jesus spit toward the eyes of a blind man, who later gained his sight.

However, the point of that story in the Gospel of Mark is not receiving nasty visions or getting outside your comfort zone, the preceding point of Todd's sermon.

In actuality, Mark 8:22-10:52 is framed by two stories of Jesus healing blind men to further emphasize a key motif in Mark's gospel: the marginalized (such as blind people) and outsiders are those who ""see"" and ""hear,"" whereas those who should see and hear the truth about Jesus, like his disciples, increasingly misunderstand Jesus and become confused about the implications of his identity.

What was the reaction?

Christians spoke out in force against the disgusting act. Not only was the act itself condemned, but critics observed that Todd's combination of spirituality and the demeaning act was particularly problematic.

""That Mike Todd video has so many layers of terribleness wrapped up in it, I don't know even where to start. The audacity. The cult energy. The spiritual and theological abusiveness. The hocking and rubbing and spitting and deflecting. I couldn't believe my eyes. Ain't no way,"" Christian author Danté Stewart said.

""I don’t know who needs to hear this, but this is demonic and manipulative. Mike Todd even tried to manipulate the crowd into feeling bad over reacting to him dehumanizing a man live on stage. We’re watching abuse and humiliation to boost another’s ego and profile. Disgusting. This is big cult energy right here. I still honestly can’t believe this man had the audacity to do this. This is not of God at all. It’s hard to even try to describe how terrible this is but to say that this is really, just….satanic,"" Christian podcaster Ameen Hudson said.

""If your pastor rubs spit on your face (looking at you, Mike Todd), find a new pastor,"" Rev. Dr. Chuck Currie said.

""[T]hat mike todd video has been bothering me all day. it so disturbing, I can’t believe he did that. i’ve seen some things but that was so flagrant. cancel clout chasing corporate christianity cult charlatan’s charades,"" Alex Medina said.

""I ain’t never seen all sides of Christian Twitter unified on an issue like this. Not Mike Todd being so unhinged it’s bringing unity to the body,"" one Christian noted.

""The Mike Todd situation is exactly why we need more faithful Bible teaching churches, not entertainers who seek to go viral every Sunday. I’m all for the practicality of sermons being explained, but when is enough enough?"" another person said.

Perhaps the only positive aspect of this story is that the person on the receiving end of Todd's spit was his younger brother — though that does not make the demonstration any better.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/megachurch-pastor-hawks-loogie-rubs-it-on-mans-face-in-sermon-illustration,2022-01-17
Mexican president thanks Biden for not securing American border with 'even one meter of wall',"The president of Mexico thanked President Joe Biden for failing to secure America's southern border and insisted that he grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who have stolen into the United States.

Biden met with the leftist Mexican leader Andres Manuel López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Mexico City on Tuesday for the North American Leaders' Summit. The topic that dominated the summit was what Biden called ""the greatest migration in human history.""

Standing alongside Biden and Trudeau, Obrador remarked, ""President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall and ... we thank you for that, sir.""

The Mexican president noted that ""some may not like"" Biden's refusal to secure the border, particularly ""the conservatives.""

465,034 illegal aliens were encountered at the border in the first two months of this fiscal year; 2.37 million criminal noncitizens poured over the southern border last year, and millions more stole over in 2021.



During former President Donald Trump's last term in office, only 458,088 illegal aliens were encountered at the southern border, and his administration raised roughly 737,079 meters of wall.

Biden said, ""There can no longer be any question, none, in today’s interconnected world. We cannot wall ourselves off from shared problems,"" adding, ""We’re trying to make it easier for people to get here.""

That wasn't enough for the Mexican president.

Obrador insisted ""in a very respectful manner"" that Biden pressure the ""U.S. Congress to regularize the migration situations of millions of Mexicans who have been in the States working, living in the United States, and contributing to the development of that great nation.""

On his way to the summit, Biden met with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in the beleaguered border city of El Paso. Abbott communicated to Biden: ""Under your watch ... America is suffering the worst illegal immigration in the history of our country. Your open-border policies have emboldened the cartels, who grow wealthy by trafficking deadly fentanyl and even human beings.""

Abbott indicated that what Biden later characterized as making it ""easier for people to get here"" was tantamount to a failure to ""defend the States against invasion.""

The New York Times reported that during the summit, the Mexican president — whose crime-ridden country is presently a war zone — took a not-so-subtle jab at Abbott for ejecting criminal noncitizens from Texas and sending them to so-called sanctuary cities, calling the governor's efforts ""completely inhuman.""

According to the White House, the North American leaders ultimately ""reaffirmed their commitment to work together to achieve safe, orderly, and humane migration in region.""



These commitments apparently included giving ""migrants streamlined access to legal pathways""; ""countering xenophobia and discrimination against migrants and refugees by promoting balanced public narratives on migrants and refugees to support their meaningful inclusion in the region""; and, per Biden's announcement last week, allowing 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, or Haiti to enter the U.S. every month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexican-president-thanks-biden-for-not-securing-american-border-with-even-one-meter-of-wall,2023-01-11
Rob Astorino leaks video of federal contractors flying illegal immigrants to Westchester,"Leaked video reportedly exposes illegal immigrants from southern border states disembarking from a charter plane at Westchester County Airport in New York. The video of alleged undocumented migrants was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino – a Republican candidate for New York governor in 2022.

In the 51-minute video, there is bodycam footage from Westchester Police Sgt. Michael Hamborsky – who is seen on the tarmac of Westchester County Airport on Aug. 13, 2021.

There are reportedly about a dozen federal contractors assisting the migrants from the plane to buses.

At 6:09 a.m., Hamborsky purportedly begins asking questions to federal contractors about the charter flight arriving after the airport's curfew.

""You’re on a secure facility here; we really don’t know anything and we're in charge of security,"" Hamborsky tells a federal contractor, according to the New York Post. ""This is anti all our security stuff.""

""I’m just trying to figure out what’s what, who’s who and how I’m supposed to keep this secure,"" Hamborsky continues.

An alleged federal contractor tells the police officer, ""We’re not allowed to have our picture taken when we get on base.""

Hamborsky reacts by saying, ""Un-f***ing-believable. And who’s that by? DHS [Department of Homeland Security]?""

The said contractor replies, ""Yes, and the United States Army. You’re on a federal installation but DHS wants everything on the down low.""

Another alleged contractor informs Hamborsky, ""Listen, my thing is I like to comply but technically we’re not supposed to show IDs or anything. Like I said, everything is supposed to be hush-hush.""

Hamborsky asks the men why the charter plane is dropping off purported illegal immigrants at the airport in White Plains – approximately 35 miles northeast of New York City.

""You don’t want to be in somewhere the spotlight is,"" the man responds. ""You want to try and be as down low as possible. A lot of this is just down-low stuff that we don’t tell people because what we don’t want to do is attract attention. We don’t want the media. Like we don’t even know where we’re going when they tell us.""



Fox News reported, ""One of the contractors told the officer later in the video: 'I get the whole secrecy and all that s***t but this is even above my f***ing pay grade . . . the f***, you know what I mean?""

When Hambrosky presses as to why there were secret flights with illegal immigrants flying into the New York City suburb, the purported federal contractor says, ""You know why, look who’s in office. That’s why, come on.""

The alleged federal contractor states, ""You know why. Because if this gets out, the government is betraying the American people.""

The New York Post reported, ""Hamborsky ascertains that the plane arrived at 11:48 p.m. the previous night with 142 migrants on board. Also on board were 12 'chaperones' — employees of MVM Inc., a controversial private security firm that was a major contractor for the CIA and the NSA in Iraq, and which last year signed a $136 million contract with the federal government to transport illegal migrants and unaccompanied children around the country.""

Between about 6:15 and 7 a.m., the purported undocumented migrants board American Dream charter buses that are parked on the tarmac.

Hamborsky questions a bus driver where he is taking the migrants, but he tells the cop that ""they never"" provide a destination.

Hamborsky was later told by one of the alleged contractors that the illegal immigrants are being bused to Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.

A bus driver tells Hamborsky, ""You’re trying to figure out what this is? Good luck with that.""

Previously, the New York Post reported, ""More than a dozen charter flights carrying underage immigrants landed in Westchester in August alone.""

On Oct. 18, 2021, the New York Post reported, ""The charter flights originate in Texas, where the ongoing border crisis has overwhelmed local immigration officials, and have been underway since at least August, according to sources familiar with the matter. Last week, The Post saw two planes land at the Westchester County Airport, where most of the passengers who got off appeared to be children and teens, with a small portion appearing to be men in their 20s.""

Astorino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Wednesday to discuss the footage he obtained through a FOIA request.

""Our government is completely out of control right now. They have lied to us. They've lied to the American people,"" Astorino tells host Tucker Carlson.

""Now they keep saying 'it’s just unaccompanied kids.' Completely a lie,"" Astorino asserts. ""And that these kids were not going to go into our own area. Completely a lie. [They’re being put] into schools in Westchester, Long Island, the surrounding suburbs.""

""So it is a complete breakdown of our system,"" he adds.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/migrants-flight-westchester-video-astorino,2022-01-27
Mike Pompeo receives millions of dollars in security each month due to 'serious and credible' threats from Iran,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his top aide while out of office are receiving millions of dollars worth of security from the State Department due to “serious and credible” threats from Iran.

The Associated Press reported that the U.S. State Department is paying more than $2 million per month to provide Pompeo and his former aide, Brian Hook, with 24-hour security.

The State Department told Congress that it cost $13.1 million to protect both men from August 2021 to February 2022.

The State Department’s recently published 2022 Annual Threat Assessment detail these expenses, according to CBS News.

Pompeo and Hook were key actors in the Trump administration’s campaign of “maximum pressure” against Iran and, as such, have received intense death threats on a regular basis.

American intelligence assesses that the threats to their lives have remained constant since they left government and could intensify. Despite the Biden administration renewing negotiations with Iranian officials over the previously scrapped 2015 nuclear agreement, the threats against Pompeo and Hook have persisted.

As a former secretary of state, Pompeo was given 180 days of round-the-clock protection by the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security after leaving office. But according to a recent report, the current Secretary of State Antony Blinken opted to extend the security detail in 60-day increments due to “a serious and credible threat from a foreign power or agent of a foreign power arising from duties performed by former Secretary Pompeo while employed by the department.”

Hook — who worked closely with Pompeo to impose crippling sanctions upon Iran — was also granted this special protection by Blinken upon leaving government service.

Hook has been receiving 60-day security extensions similar to Pompeo.

The latest 60-day extension will soon expire and the State Department, along with the Director of National Intelligence, must determine by March 16 if the federal government should extend protections once more.

Current U.S. officials have said that the threats against Pompeo and Hook have been discussed in the renewed nuclear discussions.

In these discussions, Iranian diplomats are demanding the removal of all sanctions placed upon Iran by the Trump administration. This includes removing the label of “foreign terrorist organization” from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

These discussions have been paused in recent weeks as the Russian diplomatic envoy mediating the discussions raised concerns over Western sanctions on Russia in response to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

YouTube star accused of mocking 'African American Vernacular English' in tweet aimed at TikTok moms,"A popular comedian who got her start on YouTube apologized after being accused of mocking ""African American Vernacular English"" in a tweet intended to poke fun at TikTok moms.

Colleen Ballinger produces comedic videos under the persona ""Miranda Sings,"" but she was forced to sing an apologetic tune after trying to make an innocuous joke.

""Yo BRUH tiktok so lit no cap i'm gonna yeet over there so fast low key. if i don't get on fyp i'll be big mad and big yikes like that's high key not straight fire and so sus. bet. but low key fr tiktok is so lit and GOAT,"" she tweeted from her Miranda Sings account.

What might read as a bizarre string of nonsensical words and phrases to many was excoriated on social media as racially insensitive.

""I know you thought you were just mocking tiktok kids, but you're actually mocking AAVE. Please delete this,"" responded one offended critic.

Ballinger deleted the tweet and responded to the criticism.

""I feel so stupid. I was trying to sound like an awkward mom who uses gen z slang so I googled 'gen z slang' & used all the words that popped up,"" Ballinger tweeted to the critic.

I feel so stupid. I was trying to sound like an awkward mom who uses gen z slang so I googled “gen z slang"" & used all the words that popped up. I should have done more research & realized that the words I used were actually AAVE. I deleted it & I am so sorry.

— Colleen Ballinger🎗 (@ColleenB123) April 14, 2021

""I should have done more research & realized that the words I used were actually AAVE. I deleted it & I am so sorry,"" she added.



Another critic offered a lengthy explanation of what AAVE is and why non-black people should not use it on social media or anywhere else.

""African American Vernacular English is a linguistic code, an important aspect of Black culture, and a way of speaking that has its own grammatical structure, rules, and words. When non-Black people use AAVE, it is (more than often) invasive, disrespectful, inappropriate, and uncomfortable,"" the lengthy polemic read in part.

""Ultimately, the way Black people speak is not a punchline. It is not a meme. It is not a way to appear cooler. It is not a way to be more aggressive. African American Vernacular English has cultural significance to the Black community, and it should be respected,"" the post continued. ""Until the system that exploits Black culture is dismantled, Black people reserve every right to be upset about the blatant disrespect, misuse, and abuse of AAVE.""

Ballinger responded, ""thank you for this.""

This is not the first time Ballinger apologized to critics who called her racially insensitive. In a previous incident she apologized for a video that made fun of Hispanics by employing racial stereotypes.

Mitch McConnell and other congressional Republicans visit Zelenskyy in Kyiv as $40 billion aid package stalls in the Senate,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led a delegation of Congressional Republicans to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this weekend in Kyiv.

McConnell was joined by Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, John Cornyn of Texas, and John Barrasso of Wyoming among others, NBC News reported.

After leaving Ukraine, the Kentucky senator issued a statement that the Republican delegation witnessed firsthand the “courage, unity, and resolve of the Ukrainian people” and that they, the Ukrainian government, “only ask for the tools they need for self-defense.”

McConnell said that the Republican delegation “reaffirmed to President Zelenskyy that the United States stands squarely behind Ukraine and will sustain our support until Ukraine wins this war.”

Adding that the defense of Ukraine and defending principles of sovereignty directly impact U.S. national security, McConnell said, “It is also essential that America not stand alone. Our allies and partners must continue to step up and do their part.”

After meeting with the Republican delegation, Zelenskyy said that the group's visit shows the strength of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship.

Zelenskyy said, “We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state.”

The Republican delegation’s visit comes just days after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $40 billion spending package that included military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Rand Paul, the junior Republican senator from Kentucky, recently held up the package’s passage in the Senate.

The Republican delegation is only the latest group of American political figures to visit Ukraine amidst Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion.

In late April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to assure him that the federal government would soon be providing him with more than $300 million in military financing.

In early May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation of Congressional Democrats consisting of Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks from New York, and Adam Schiff from California to express political support for Ukraine amidst the Russian military’s renewed attacks in Ukraine’s eastern regions.

First Lady Jill Biden also paid a visit to Ukraine, about a week after Pelosi’s delegation met with Zelenskyy.

Mitt Romney takes shot at Obama after Russia launches invasion of Ukraine: 'The '80s called',"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) released a blistering statement late Wednesday after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What did Romney say?

Noting that Russia's invasion is the ""first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation,"" Romney said in a statement that Russia was emboldened by ""tepid"" responses by the U.S. in response to previous Russian aggression.

""Putin’s impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided ‘reset,’ and the shortsightedness of ‘America First,'"" Romney said, referring to foreign policy initiatives of the Obama and Trump administrations.

“The ’80s called’ and we didn’t answer,"" he added, taking a direct shot at former President Barack Obama.

By invoking an unanswered call from the 1980s, Romney was referring to a pivotal moment in the 2012 presidential election. In March 2012, Romney described Russia as America's ""number one geopolitical foe."" Democrats seized on the remark as evidence that Romney was unprepared for the presidency because he lacked the foreign policy experience necessary for the job.

Obama then pounced during the final presidential debate. After Romney acknowledged the threat of al Qaeda, Obama delivered what may have been one of the most memorable and effective one-liner — ever — in a presidential debate.

""I’m glad that you recognize that al-Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years,"" Obama told Romney at the time.

Election 2012 | Obama to Romney: Cold War Is Over - Third Presidential Debate | The New York Times www.youtube.com

Romney's remarks — and the critical debate moment that helped cement Obama's re-election — have been revisited several times over the last decade, especially when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and after Russia engaged in cyber-manipulation of the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

Although Democratic strategists have since admitted that Romney was correct or ""had a point,"" the biggest mea culpa came from CNN analyst Chris Cillizza on Tuesday. Cillizza called the 2012 debate moment a ""mic drop"" — but now he admits Romney was right.

In an essay published on Tuesday with the headline ""It's time to admit it: Mitt Romney was right about Russia,"" Cillizza wrote, ""What looked like a major flub during the 2012 campaign — and was used as a political cudgel by Obama — now looks very, very different."" Earlier in the essay, Cillizza defined ""different"" by saying, ""And by 'different,' I mean 'right.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitt-romney-takes-shot-at-obama-after-russia-launches-invasion-of-ukraine-the-80s-called,2022-02-24
"Mom in shower when her kids start screaming about intruder. She grabs her gun, faces him down, and fatally shoots him when he won't stop advancing.","A Milwaukee mother said she fatally shot a man who broke into her home Monday morning and that she did so in order to defend herself and her two children, WTMJ-TV reported.

Image source: WTMJ-TV video screenshot

What are the details?

The mother, who asked not to be identified, told WTMJ she was in the shower when she heard her 12- and 14-year-old children screaming from the living room.

She told the station she then raced to her bedroom, grabbed her gun, and ran into the hallway to face down the intruder.

""It all happened so fast — an adrenaline rush,"" the mother told WTMJ.

She said her two pit bull dogs were attacking the man, and she shot him multiple times because ""he wouldn't stop coming,"" the station reported.

The mother added to WTMJ that the intruder was acting erratically and appeared to be in his late 30s.

Milwaukee police have not identified the man, and they arrested the mother but released her several hours later after questioning, the station said.

Police added to WTMJ that they won't be releasing any more information, and the incident will be referred to the District Attorney's Office.

'She did what any mother would do'

Community activist Bushraa Rahman helped clean up the home after authorities removed the body, the station said, and Rahman backed the mother's actions.

“She was scared because her children were there with her,"" Rahman told WTMJ. ""So, she did what any mother would do. She defended her children.""

Bushraa Rahman Image source: WTMJ-TV video screenshot

Rahman added to the station that the shooting ""was an act of self-defense. Somebody comes in your house, what do you call it?""

“In today’s ... day and age, with mental health and everything else that’s taking place in the world, I mean, you better protect yourself. To be honest, you have to,” Rahman also told WTMJ.

Anything else?

The mother added to the station that her children have been traumatized by the incident, and that they intend to move out once they find a new place to live.

She also told WTMJ she bought the gun 10 years ago after finding a man sleeping under her son’s bed — and hoped she'd never have to use it.

But she told the station making sure her children are protected takes precedence over everything else: ""I knew I'd be able to [shoot the intruder] to protect my kids.""

"Russian mom in Wisconsin paranoid over Ukraine war strangled 8-year-old son to death, tried to drown 11-year-old son, prosecutors say","A Wisconsin mother with Russian heritage ""amped up"" over Russia's war in Ukraine strangled her 8-year-old son to death one day after trying to drown her 11-year-old son, prosecutors said this week.

Natalia Hitchcock, 41, of Sheboygan Falls, has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide for the heinous crimes, WTMJ-TV reported.

In a media release last week, the Sheboygan Falls Police Department confirmed that the victim, 8-year-old Oliver Hitchcock, had passed away from his injuries after being choked unconscious a few days before.

Police responded to Hitchcock's apartment home on March 30 after the suspect's husband and the victims' father called 911 to report the possible stabbing of an 8-year-old and a woman who wanted to kill herself.

When officers arrived, the father, who was noticeably upset and emotional, directed them to the living room, where the boy was lying on the ground unconscious with bruising around his neck. The child reportedly later gained a pulse and was taken to a hospital for treatment, but ultimately did not survive his injuries.

According to a complaint, the father said he was awakened from a nap by his eldest son, who then told him that his brother was lying lifeless in his bedroom. The father claims he carried his son's body to the living room, where he began performing CPR while his wife walked around the house in a daze, knife in hand.

The father said his wife had become ""amped up"" and delirious while watching coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and threatened violence against the entire family. He added that his wife of 15 years began taking Tylenol and drinking vodka, both uncharacteristic of her, but told police that she had never exhibited signs of mental illness prior to the incident.

NBC News reported that Hitchcock waived her Miranda rights and admitted to violently attacking her children and stabbing herself repeatedly with a knife.

According to charging documents, Hitchcock told police that she had been unable to concentrate for the past five days and was in fear that her children would be taken away from her. At the time of her arrest, a ""critical"" amount of Tylenol was detected in her system.

""She also said that people had been looking at her strange and felt that people looked at her as a Russian spy,"" the complaint read, adding that she was worried ""people from the dark web were going to take her kids away and do bad things to them.""

""She advised that she believed it best to take [her youngest son's] life because he was the youngest and most vulnerable,"" the charging document read, according to Law & Crime. ""She said that she believed [he] would not have been able to defend himself if he had gotten abused and she thought it better to kill him rather than watch him be abused.""

As for her eldest son, Hitchcock said she dunked his head under water in a bathtub ""to scare him so that he would understand his life was in danger.""

Hitchcock is currently in custody on a $1 million bond.

During her first court appearance, she turned to her husband with tears in her eyes and said, ""I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-paranoid-over-ukraine-war-strangles-son,2022-04-08
"Mondaire Jones, Republicans, emboldened Russia","Progressive Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) said that Russia ""has been emboldened by"" GOP assaults against American democracy. The freshman lawmaker also described President Joe Biden as ""a very strong president.""

""I think the Russian Federation has been emboldened by Republican attacks on our own democracy here domestically,"" Jones told reporter Kevin Frey.



The congressman said that ""despite Donald Trump, when he was president, having a very cozy, encouraging relationship"" as it pertains ""to Vladimir Putin and his antics, we've got a very strong president in Joe Biden today.""



A Washington Post-ABC News poll of adults in the U.S. found that 48% believe that American leadership on the world stage has become weaker during Biden's tenure, while just 23% believe it has grown stronger, and 26% think it has stayed around the same. The poll was carried out Feb. 20 to 24.



The eyes of the world are on Ukraine, where Russia has mounted an invasion against the sovereign nation, wreaking death and destruction as Ukrainians bravely risk their lives to fight back against the Russian onslaught.

The U.S. has condemned Russia and levied sanctions. President Biden has said that U.S. troops will not intervene in Ukraine, though he has declared that America will defend NATO allies.

Rep. Jones is an advocate for adding seats to the U.S. Supreme Court, a move critics commonly describe as court packing.



""The only way to restore integrity to the Supreme Court is to expand it. Congress must do exactly that, before it's too late,"" the congressman said in a statement while applauding President Biden's decision to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill the high court vacancy that will be created by Justice Stephen Breyer's upcoming retirement.

Jones said that he is ""clear-eyed about the continuing threat the far-right, 6-3 majority on the Court poses to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.

If the threats to our health had stopped with just the coronavirus that came from bats (either in a lab or at a wet market), that would have been bad enough.

Add to it murder hornets, gypsy moths, and invasive giant lizards, and a person could be excused for thinking the animal kingdom is strategizing to wipe us out — or at least scare us enough to keep us indoors. (Don't forget, in March, a man broke his community's coronavirus lockdown orders and got eaten by a crocodile.)

Did you say monkeys?

Sky News reported Friday that a gang of primates attacked a laboratory assistant at Meerut Medical College in Delhi, India, and ran off with a stash of COVID-19 blood test samples that had been taken from three patients.

One of the perpetrators was later found in a tree chewing on one of the collection kits, the Times of India said, according to Sky News. However, apparently none of the samples were damaged, though the patients' tests had to be taken again.

The college's superintendent said the samples were still intact and that he didn't think there was a risk of spread.

But the country has been cautious about the possibility that the coronavirus could mutate and infect primates, and citizens have been warned to stay away from the creatures and not feed them.

The actions of the band of rhesus macaques fits a pattern of behavior by the monkeys as they've become more emboldened during India's pandemic lockdown and have taken over parts of the city. Sky News said there have been reports of the animals congregating in sections of Delhi that are normally full of humans.

More from Sky News:

Reports have previously emerged of the primates causing chaos in Delhi, snatching food and mobile telephones, breaking into homes and terrorising people in and around the Indian capital.



They have colonised areas around the city's parliament and the sites of key ministries, from the prime minister's office to the finance and defence ministries, scaring both civil servants and the public.

Morgan Stanley analyst directly blames Biden's 'excessive' fiscal stimulus for surge of inflation,"An analysis of the economy by Morgan Stanley put the blame directly on the ""excessive"" fiscal stimulus spending by the Biden administration for the surge of inflation that is hurting so many Americans.

Michael Wilson led a team of analysts in the assessment released on Monday.

""In summary, the slack created by the covid recession is being absorbed much faster than usual. While some of this absorption is due to the supply disruptions created by the lockdowns, we think it was more so due to excessive fiscal stimulus provided during the pandemic, particularly the last $1.9T package at the end of March 2021 just as the economy was already emerging from the lockdowns,"" the analysis read.

""In our view, this was what turbocharged consumption and drove inflation to 40-year-highs,"" it continued.

""In other words, we created too much demand for the supply chains to handle. The fact that the supply chains had been impaired to some degree only exacerbated the shortages and inflation, especially for consumer goods,"" they concluded.

The stock market has been plummeting in the last month as inflation worries crush investors' hopes of companies' earnings justifying their valuations.

The analysis from Wilson predicted that the market will continue to plummet before hitting a floor.

Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson responded to the assessment by pointing to a poll from March 2021 that showed voters were very concerned about the massive spending leading to inflation.

""Voters at the time were more worried about this possibility than many of our elected officials were,"" tweeted Anderson.

More recently, voters have indicated in polling that they blame Biden's spending policies for inflation more than the pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine, or supposed corporate greed. Biden has responded to the crisis by claiming that fighting inflation is his first priority.

Officials say Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank Russia's Moskva – largest warship lost in combat since WWII. Russian state TV host warns conflict has 'escalated into World War III.',"Russia suffered a major loss on Thursday after Ukrainian Neptune missiles reportedly destroyed the Moskva warship.

Russia denies the warship was destroyed by a missile

A senior U.S. defense official confirmed on Friday that Russia's Moskva warship was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles in the Black Sea approximately 60 miles off the coast of Odesa. The missile strike allegedly caused a ""significant explosion"" that ultimately sank the large cruiser. The official said there are likely casualties.

The Russian defense ministry claimed an unexplained fire broke out on the ship and an explosion was triggered from ammunition onboard. Russia's defense ministry said ""the vessel is seriously damaged"" and ""the entire crew have been evacuated,"" the BBC reported.

The Kremlin asserted that while the damaged warship was being towed to a port that Moskva ""lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull."" The Russian defense ministry stated, ""Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank.""

Moskva is believed to be the largest warship to be lost in combat since World War II.

The Moskva is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet

The Moskva is a 611-foot-long, 12,500-ton missile cruiser with a crew of almost 500. Coincidentally, the Moskva was built in the 1970s at the Mykolayiv Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. Originally, the ship was named ""Slava,"" which means ""glory."" The ship was renamed ""Moskva"" after the fall of the Soviet Union. The warship was the third largest vessel in Russia's active fleet.

Popular Mechanics reports, ""The Slava-class cruisers were built to hunt down aircraft carriers in the event of a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which was headquartered in the Soviet Union.""

The Slava-class cruiser is equipped with Vulkan anti-ship missiles, 16 long-range cruise missiles, anti-submarine, mine-torpedo weapons, and triple-tiered, 360-degree anti-air defense coverage.



""In addition to medium- and short-range defenses, it could engage six short-range close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last resort,"" the BBC reported.

""The CIWS system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser, its last line of defense,"" naval expert Jonathan Bentham from the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the outlet.

The Moskva – which had undergone two modernizations during its time in service – has been involved in several Russian military campaigns, including being deployed in the Syrian conflict in 2015.

The Moskva was a floating command center that provided long-range and mobile air defense protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet during the invasion of Ukraine.

""The ship’s primary mission was air defense, according to the Pentagon, though the Moskva was also equipped with anti-ship missiles and had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, like those that have battered Ukrainian targets for weeks,"" the New York Post reported.

Losing the Moskva is a 'massive blow' to Russia

Alessio Patalano – professor of war and strategy at King's College in London – told CNN that losing the Moskva would be a ""massive blow"" to Russia.

""Ships operate away from public attention and their activities are rarely the subject of news,"" Patalano said. ""But they are large floating pieces of national territory, and when you lose one, a flagship no less, the political and symbolic message – in addition to the military loss – stands out precisely because of it.""

Retired Adm. James Foggo – who commanded U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa – told Morning Edition, ""This is a terribly humiliating blow to the Russian navy, and it's rather astonishing that they could allow this to happen to themselves.""

Ukraine uses a new kind of missile to defend its country

Odesa state regional administrator Maxim Marchenko claimed in a post on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had attacked the Moskva with Neptune cruises missiles.

Popular Mechanics details the Neptune missile:



The Neptune missile is a Ukrainian subsonic, low-altitude anti-ship cruise missile. The missiles are based on the Cold War-era SS-N-25 ""Switchblade,"" which was so closely modeled on the American AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, it was derisively nicknamed “Harpoonski.” After the Cold War, Russia fielded newer versions of the missile as the Kh-35, while Ukraine went on to develop the Neptune , which has a range of 190 miles and packs a 330-pound, high-explosive warhead.

The Guardian reported, ""The whole system comprises a truck-based mobile launcher, four missiles, a reload vehicle, and a command and control vehicle. It is designed to fly close to the surface of the sea to avoid detection.""



The Neptune missile has a range of nearly 200 miles and became operational just last year.

Russian state TV host warns of World War III

Russian state TV host Olga Skabeyeva recently said that Russia is now ""fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself,"" according to The Independent.

""Many are saying, 'Could it not be done more quickly?' Everyone wants it to happen more quickly,"" Skabeyeva said on the Rossiya 1 television channel. ""Everyone would like a conclusive victory. Everyone would like all the objectives set to be implemented.""



“Otherwise, on the whole, it's impossible to accept the special operation which we started – Russia’s special operation in Ukraine,"" she continued.

""One can safely call what it has escalated into World War III,"" she said on Russian state-owned TV. ""That's absolutely for sure.""

"Mother fatally shot in home while daughter, 10, takes online Zoom elementary school class — and teacher sees the girl's reaction","A Florida mother was fatally shot Tuesday morning while her 10-year-old daughter took an online Zoom elementary school class — and the girl's teacher could hear the incident unfolding and see the girl reacting to it.

What are the details?

Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said Donald L. Williams, 27, shot ex-girlfriend Maribel Morales-Rosado, 32, multiple times in front of several children in an Indiantown home, Treasure Coast Palm reported.

Snyder said investigators believe there was an argument between Williams and Morales-Rosado, the mother of the 10-year-old girl, NBC News reported, adding that Williams and Rosado-Morales previously dated.

""He went in and confronted her with something to do with a video,"" the sheriff said, according the network. ""And then later we learned there was a conversation about Facebook. He said she actually started to smile at him, and he became enraged and shot her.""

Snyder believes most of the children in the home witnessed the shooting, NBC News said. Four of them are Rosado-Morales' children, and two cousins were there, too, the network said. None of the children — who range in age from 10 to 17 — were injured, and none are related to Williams, the outlet added.

What about the Zoom classroom session?

The 10-year-old girl was taking an online Zoom class at the time of the shooting, Snyder said during his news conference. It was the first day of class for Warfield Elementary School, TC Palm reported.

""The teacher's online — I've never done a Zoom with children, so I'm picturing there's other children on — and the teacher can see the children,"" Snyder said, according to NBC News. ""The teacher said she heard a commotion, heard profanity, realized there was some type of domestic altercation [and] could see the child that's online. The teacher said she mutes her button so nobody has to hear it, and then she sees the 10-year-old put her hands up to her ears.""

The sheriff added that ""almost immediately after the child put her hands up to her ears, the computer screen went blank. We know the computer was hit with a projectile,"" NBC News said.

What happened next?

Morales-Rosado was taken to a Fort Pierce hospital but died, TC Palm reported.

Snyder said investigators believe that after the shooting Williams got on a bicycle, went to a nearby laundromat, and then boarded a community bus and asked if the driver would take him to Stuart, the paper added.

""She said this is a local bus, and he said, 'Well, no, I need to go to Stuart,'"" the sheriff continued, according to TC Palm. ""He had a bag in his hand. She got suspicious, did the right thing, exited the bus, called 911.""

Snyder said the sheriff's department SWAT team was in western Martin County for training and took Williams into custody, the paper reported.

The sheriff said a gun was found in a bag on the bus, and Williams ""made a full confession,"" NBC News reported. Williams is suspected to have used a handgun stolen in a 2015 Sewall's Point vehicle burglary, TC Palm said.

Snyder said Williams will be arrested on charges including first-degree murder, armed burglary, and armed home invasion, the paper reported.

The sheriff said Williams and Morales-Rosado had been separated for more than a year, TC Palm reported, and that Williams lives a couple of streets away from Morales-Rosado.

Snyder also said Morales-Rosado recently was released from jail in connection with a domestic battery case in which Williams was the victim, the paper said.

What did the school district have to say?

A Martin County School District spokesperson told NBC News that ""our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to the family and children who were witnesses to this heartbreaking and senseless tragedy.""



Grief counselors will be available for students and staff who need them, the network added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-fatally-shot-in-home-zoom,2020-08-12
"Mother fights armed intruder who pointed gun at her children, takes gun away from him","One hapless gunman's bad day kept getting worse after he came face to face Saturday evening with a Texas mother whose will to protect her kids was too much for him.

What are the details?

A male knocked on the door of a residence in the Bowers Mobile Home Park in Hudson around 6 p.m. and asked a woman if someone was home who didn't live there, police said.

Cops said the male knocked again, asking for a cigarette and whether her husband was home, after which he forced his way into the home and pointed a gun at children who were inside.

With that, the woman began fighting with the male to get him away from her children, police said — and lo and behold, she was able to force the gun away from him.

Presumably realizing his odds of getting whatever he was after had been drastically reduced, the intruder quickly headed for the door, police said.

But just before he departed, police said he stopped and asked the woman who bested him an important question: Would she please give him his gun back?

Police didn't reveal the woman's answer, but one can only guess given the crook's level of success to that point. Cops said the intruder then fled into the wooded area around the park.

Neither the woman nor the children were injured, police reported.

Despite a search of the area, police said the intruder wasn't located. He's described as white, in his 20s, with dirty scraggly blonde hair, skinny, and between 5 feet and 5 feet, 6 inches tall, authorities noted. He also was wearing a bright orange shirt and checkered shorts that went just below his knees, police added. Those who may have seen a person matching such a description are asked to contact Deep East Texas Crime Stoppers at (936) 639-TIPS or the Hudson Police Department at (936) 875-2358, KTRE-TV reported.

"Mother livid after school gave daughter birth control implant without her permission, inserted it incorrectly, and allegedly kicked her out for complaining","Nicole Lambert's daughter was complaining about headaches and a pain in her arm, WMAR-TV reported, so Lambert had her 16-year-old checked out by a pediatrician.

Uh oh

Well, the doctor told Lambert that her daughter received Nexplanon — a three-year contraceptive — that had been improperly implanted in her daughter's arm and that it needed to be removed to avoid possible complications, including blood clots, the station said.

And it turns out, WMAR said, her daughter got the implant at Digital Harbor High School in Baltimore.

Image source: WMAR-TV video screenshot

""I instantly started crying,"" Lambert told the station, adding that ""anything could happen to your child, and you didn't even know what's going on, it's a scary feeling.""

She added to WMAR that she was ""furious"" and paid a visit to the school.

""And the nurse told me, 'I don't have to talk to you about absolutely nothing.' I'm like, 'That is my child, I take care of this child, you can talk to me about my child,' and they put me out of the school,"" Lambert added to the station.

Implant removed

WMAR said the Nexplanon tube — which was placed near the back of her daughter's arm instead of the inside of the upper arm, as paperwork directs — was removed a few days later.

Image source: WMAR-TV video screenshot

The station said state law has let minors confidentially receive contraceptives for about the last 50 years, and several of the city's 17 School-Based Health Centers offer reproductive health care services.



'They call me for Tylenol, but they don't call me about birth control'

Lambert also noted with amazement that the school needs her permission for other things — but not for her daughter to receive birth control.

""They call me for Tylenol, but they don't call me about birth control,"" she told the station. ""You gave my daughter this insertion so she might be suffering from that, but do they even look at that?""

Mum seems to be the word

WMAR said it asked the school system for information on the nurse's training and qualifications, as well as its birth control policies, and to comment on the incident — but the station said it was told to speak to the Baltimore City Health Department, which oversees the school-based health centers.

And the health department? Well, WMAR said the city's law department advised the health department to not respond to questions due to a pending case against the city.

An official with the union representing registered nurses and nurse practitioners with the health department told the station it has ""chosen not to comment on this case directly due to pending litigation, but we do stand behind our members, and I hope the student receives the care she needs.""

The union's statement added that ""there is a critical shortage of registered nurses and nurse practitioners within Baltimore City Public Schools. We're asking that the public support our efforts in demanding that all schools have safe staffing, and this must include a licensed individual in every school building immediately.""

WMAR asked the health department to respond to the union's statement, and a spokesperson said, ""Given the sensitive nature of this matter, we have no comment at this time.""

Mom hires a lawyer

Lambert told the station she's uncomfortable with school nurses doing invasive procedures they're unfamiliar with and hired a lawyer to look into the matter.

""Ms. Lambert wasn't given the choice to pick the medical provider where her daughter would feel comfortable going and receiving these services, who she knew did a comprehensive medical exam, who she knew knew her medical history,"" David Ledyard, the attorney representing Lambert, told WMAR.

"Mother protecting her young children fights, fatally shoots crook who forced his way into their home; he was on parole after 20 years in prison for armed robbery","A mother protecting her two young children fought and then fatally shot a man who forced his way into their Louisiana home early Sunday morning, the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office said.

What are the details?

The suspect — identified as Robert Rheams, 51 — was armed with a shovel and lug wrench when he forced his way into the Hammond home of the victim and her two young children, authorities said. The city of Hammond is about an hour north of New Orleans.

The homeowner and Rheams engaged in a physical altercation that culminated with the homeowner shooting Rheams, authorities said.

Chief Jimmy Travis of the sheriff's office said deputies responded to reports of shots fired at the residence on Klein Road shortly after 5 a.m. The Tangipahoa Parish Coroner's Office pronounced Rheams dead at the scene, authorities said.

Rheams was out on parole after serving about 20 years in prison for armed robbery, authorities said, adding that detectives tied Rheams to a carjacking that took place hours before the home invasion.

Travis said the home invasion and fatal shooting appear to be a case of a homeowner exercising her Second Amendment rights to protect herself and her children, authorities said.

Travis added that no arrests have been made so far amid the investigation, but once it's completed, the case will be forwarded to the district attorney's office for further review, authorities said.

"MS-13 member murdered a man for wearing a Peyton Manning jersey, prosecutors say","Federal prosecutors said MS-13 gang members murdered a man in Long Island simply because he was wearing a Peyton Manning football jersey, according to the New York Post.

The revelation is related to the January 2017 murder of Esteban Alvarado-Bonilla at a deli. MS-13 member Mario Aguilar-Lopez pleaded guilty to the murder in November 2018.

U.S. Assistant Attorney Raymond Tierney discussed the details of the motivation behind the murder during court proceedings Tuesday for Jose Suarez, who is accused of being the getaway driver in the murder in order to earn respect of the gang.

What did the jersey have to do with it?

Alvarado-Bonilla was suspected of being a member of the rival 18th Street gang. Manning's jersey number was 18. As a result, Alvarado-Bonilla was ""marked for death,"" prosecutors said.

Aguilar-Lopez fired five shots at Alvarado-Bonilla's head at point-blank range, and one bullet also struck a nearby employee, who survived.

Suarez was waiting in the vehicle outside to help Aguilar-Lopez escape.

""The only way he could rise up the ranks...was to commit outrageous acts of violence, including murder,"" Tierney said.

""It's about the role this defendant played in helping to hurt people...helping to kill people.""

MS-13 in the US

The dangers of gang violence are a significant justification for supporters of a border wall and stricter immigration laws and policies.

According to the Boston Herald, there are about 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States, and 377 MS-13 gang members were arrested in the country during the 2018 fiscal year.

"MSNBC anchor says world cares about Ukraine because it is white, Christian: 'A lot of soul searching that we need to do'","MSNBC host Joy Reid claimed Monday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is receiving worldwide attention because Ukraine is largely white and Christian.

What did Reid say?

During a monologue on her show ""The ReidOut,"" Reid highlighted the Yemen Civil War, which is widely viewed as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

As Reid explained, the Yemen war, which the U.S. has been involved in by supporting Saudi efforts, has resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis, resulting in millions of displaced people and hundreds of thousands of deaths, according to the United Nations.

But, Reid observed, ""we haven't witnessed the same type of solidarity for the Yeminis as we do for the Ukrainians,"" citing sanctions and global companies taking a stand.

""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" Reid continued, before playing clips of reporters making comments about the Ukraine war that she found objectionable.

""OK, let's face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe,"" Reid claimed. ""If this was happening anywhere else would we see the same outpouring of support and compassion?""

""Well, we don't need to ask ourselves if the international response will be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn’t white and largely Christian — because Russia has already done it in Syria,"" she claimed.

""This is a teachable moment for us in the media. We're not afraid to call out our industry,"" Reid continued. ""There is a lot of soul searching that we need to do in western media about why some wars and lives seem to matter more than others. And why some refugees get the welcome mat while others get the wall.""

Anything else?

CNN host Fareed Zakaria disagrees with Reid's assessment, and explained over the weekend precisely why claims like Reid's are wrong.

According to Zakaria, Russia's full-scale war is not the same as other wars in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East because Russia is a the largest nuclear power in the world, and its war may not stop with Ukraine.

""It's not — to put it directly to people who think about this and they say, 'Why are Ukrainians, why do we pay so much attention, is it just because they are white?' — no, it is not because Ukrainians are white or European, it's because their aggressor, their invader, is a nuclear armed superpower,"" Zakaria said. ""That if Russia can get away with this, it can get away with invading Poland. It can get away with invading the Baltic states. China can get away with invading Taiwan.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-anchor-says-world-cares-about-ukraine-because-it-is-white-and-largely-christian,2022-03-08
"Joy Reid's MSNBC show garners worst ratings ever, nearly half of audience has fled since its premiere","The ratings are in, and Joy Reid's MSNBC show is not exactly winning.

The ""ReidOut"" garnered its smallest audience in April after nearly two years in existence, according to Fox News.

Reid's show managed to only entertain 1.1 million viewers on average in April, a measure 31% lower from the same month last year. That figure is also 51% of the viewers the show garnered in its premiere month on July 2020.

The ""ReidOut"" did poorly when measured among the demographic of adults ages 25-54, where the show earned an average of only 124,000 viewers in April. That figure represents the lowest for MSNBC in the coveted demographic during the weeknight 7 p.m. slot since July 2015.

Reid has apparently and unsuccessfully tried to earn greater ratings with more and more outrageous statements calling various Republicans and others on the right racist, sexist, and other unsubstantiated accusations.

In March, the MSNBC host said that the world only cares about the invasion of Ukraine by Russia because the country is white and Christian.

""OK, let's face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe,"" Reid said at the time. ""If this was happening anywhere else would we see the same outpouring of support and compassion?""

Earlier in April, Reid said she was sick and tired of ""right-wing, Christian nationalist, abortion-obsessed trolls"" asking her to give a definition of the word ""woman"" after Supreme Court justice Ketanji Jackson Brown was unable to do so during her Senate hearings.

Later in April, she accused Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of ""child abuse"" over black children holding political signs against Critical Race Theory at a bill signing.

"MSNBC's Chris Matthews missing from SC primary coverage after sexism allegations, recent on-air controversies","MSNBC host Chris Matthews was not involved with his network's South Carolina Democratic primary coverage over the weekend, indicating that he may have been sidelined after a recent allegation of sexism from a former guest in addition to other on-air controversies.

Laura Bassett, a journalist who has been an MSNBC guest in the past, wrote an op-ed for GQ that was published Friday accusing Matthews, 74, of using sexist and inappropriate language toward her while she was in studio. Fox News reported:

She recalled Matthews looking at her in an adjacent makeup chair before an appearance in 2016 and asking: 'Why haven't I fallen in love with you yet?'"" Bassett said she laughed nervously but Matthews kept making comments to the makeup artist. ""Keep putting makeup on her, I'll fall in love with her,"" Matthews allegedly said.



She said he made another comment about her makeup during a separate appearance. ""Make sure you wipe this off her face after the show,"" she wrote he said to the makeup artist. ""We don't make her up so some guy at a bar can look at her like this.""

Bassett wrote an op-ed about these allegations in 2017, but didn't name Matthews. It's also not the first time Matthews has faced misconduct allegations in the workplace. MSNBC reportedly paid $40,000 in 2017 to a producer who claimed Matthews sexually harassed her.

The sexual harassment issue follows an apology Matthews had to issue last week after comparing Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) Nevada caucuses victory to the Nazi invasion of France.

Matthews also mistook Jaime Harrison, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in South Carolina, for Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott during an interview with Harrison. Both men are black.

Matthews played a clip showing Scott standing next to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who Harrison is running to unseat. Matthews asked Harrison on air, ""Jaime, I see you standing next to the guy you're going to beat right there, maybe? Maybe? Maybe, maybe? Lindsey Graham?""

Murray accuses Petty of supporting massacre of children,"Gun control activist Po Murray has accused Ryan Petty — a man whose daughter Alaina was among the 17 people killed after a shooter opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 — of supporting the massacre of children.

Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, issued a tweet last week in which she claimed that people who do not back an assault weapons ban support kids being killed by a school shooter. ""If you don't support the assault weapons ban then you support one of the worst crimes in America --- children being massacred by a shooter with an AR15 in an elementary school,"" she tweeted.

Petty noted that he is not in favor of such a ban, and asked Murray whether she thought that he supported the massacre of kids.

Murray answered with an emphatic, ""YES!""

""You are a hack and a grifter. Your moronic gun free zones are why my daughter is dead. You shall not infringe on our right to protect ourselves & our loved ones. Go crawl back under a rock,"" Petty tweeted.

Murray, who has claimed that President Joe Biden's ""approval rating should be much higher,"" noted last week that she voted in Florida's 2022 gubernatorial election contest for Democratic candidate Charlie Crist.

She has accused ""MAGA Republicans"" of not caring whether children are killed by school shooters bearing AR-15s. ""MAGA Republicans don’t care if your kids are hunted & massacred by criminals with AR15s in schools,"" Murray tweeted.

She has also claimed that GOP figures who oppose gun control bear responsibility for violent crime in the U.S. and that ""MAGA Republicans"" are supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the nation of Ukraine.

""Republicans who block gun control measures are responsible for violent crime in our nation,"" a tweet declares. ""Don't be bamboozled. Gas prices are up due to the pandemic & the Russian invasion of Ukraine. MAGA Republicans politicized & prolonged the pandemic & they support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It’s their fault,"" another tweet reads.

The man who perpetrated the Parkland shooting will get life in prison without the potential for parole, though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who is currently seeking reelection, said last week that he thought the shooter deserved the death penalty.

On Wednesday, Elon Musk held a ""Show and Tell"" event at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, revealing the latest advancements in Neuralink's brain-computer interface technology.



Musk announced at the event and on Twitter that Neuralink plans to begin implanting devices into human patients within six months. A Neuralink brain implant requires that a patient have a portion of the skull removed and wires threaded into the brain tissue. The likely candidates for implantation are those with severe spinal cord injuries.

This announcement comes two years after Neuralink received an FDA Breakthrough Device designation, after years of tests on primates, and amid discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which Bloomberg reported have been going well.

'Miraculous' advances



Musk noted that the company is also developing implants for other parts of the body.

One application will aim to restore vision, not only to those who have lost their sight, but to those who were born without it. Another application will restore ""full body functionality"" to persons with severed spinal cords.

CNET reported that the ocular application involves repackaging camera data into a brain-compatible format and driving it straight to the patient's visual cortex,.

Dan Adams, a Neuralink researcher, said the goal behind this particular application is to ""turn the lights on for someone who's spent decades living in the dark.""

The other application dealing with the motor cortex could, according to Musk, potentially ""enable someone who has ... almost no ability to operate their muscles, sort of like a Stephen Hawking-type situation ... to operate their phone faster than someone who has working hands.""

""We are confident that there are no physical limitations to enabling full-body functionality ... to someone who has a severed spinal cord,"" added Musk.



Monkey text, monkey pong

During the Nov. 30 event, Neuralink showcased a video of an implanted monkey controlling a computer cursor and typing with its mind.

Although the ""telepathically typing"" monkey had no idea what words it was forming or the communicative purpose of the words' constituent glyphs, it was nevertheless able to focus on and choose highlighted letters to write, ""can i please have snacks"" and other phrases.

The implants in the monkey's brain recharge wirelessly and did so as it typed.

Last year, Neuralink released a video of a different macaque monkey fitted with a Neuralink device implanted in both sides of its brain. The video's narrator states, ""He’s learned to interact with a computer for a tasty banana smoothie delivered through a straw.""

The devices in the monkey's brain recorded brain activity via thousands of miniscule electrodes jammed into the creature's motor cortex. The monkey first performed the exercise using a joystick. The information captured from the monkey's neurons were fed to a decoder, which then could be used to predict and map out the monkey's intended hand movements. Ultimately, with these brain responses mapped out and decoded, the monkey could move the cursor without the mediation of the joystick.

Recruitment

While much of the event was devoted to discussions of the company's progress on its various technologies, Musk underscored that his primary goal was attracting talent.

Musk attempted to encourage people without biology or neuroscience backgrounds to apply, saying, ""If there is one message I want to convey it is that if you have expertise in creating advanced devices like watches and phones, computers, then your capabilities would be of great use in solving these important problems.""

Symbiosis

The Twitter and Tesla CEO founded the Neuralink Corporation with Max Hodak and Paul Merolla in July 2016. The company's initial goal was, as reported by the Los Angeles Times in 2017, to develop an implantable brain device that would help people with brain injuries.



The ""ultimate goal"" of the organization was reportedly the mass adoption of the implant to achieve widespread human-AI integration. The point of this integration is to allegedly reduce the existential threat allegedly posed to humanity by AI, which, according to Musk, is a ""demon"" we otherwise summon at our peril.

This Musk initiative received a great deal of attention back in 2020 when a pig named Gertrude, along with two others, had a coin-shaped computer device stuck in her head. The implant recorded signals running to and from her snout and brain. This porcine proof of concept demonstrated an interface that could one day “allow people with neurological conditions to control phones or computers with their mind.”

In February, the company indicated it wasn't just trying to interface lunch meats with machines, but that it was implanting numerous monkeys, eight of which had to be euthanized.



Although there are other companies in the brain implant game, Bloomberg indicated that Neuralink, the only general-purpose brain-computer interface company, is at an advantage with superior processing power. Despite its more invasive implantation, Neuralink's optimal computing capability and hardware may prove to restore functions in humans better than its competitors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/musk-says-brain-implants-ready-for-humans,2022-12-01
Muslim student who put 9/11 memorial flags into trash bags rails against 'Islamophobia' while defending his 'Flag Relocation',"A Muslim student who removed nearly 3,000 miniature U.S. flags from a 9/11 memorial at Washington University in St. Louis — and was caught on video carrying them away in trash bags — railed against ""Islamophobia"" as he defended his ""Flag Relocation.""

What are the details?

Fadel Alkilani, who's vice president of finance for the Student Union, was seen by another student, Nathaniel Hope, removing the flags Saturday morning — the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks — and Hope began recording video showing Alkilani holding multiple plastic bags containing the flags, the college's newspaper reported.

Alkilani defended his actions in a formal statement Saturday night, which called it a ""Flag Relocation Incident"" in the title.

""Muslims such as I have faced fear, harassment, and Islamophobia from those who unjustly use the victims of 9/11 as a political cudgel,"" he wrote. ""Those who died during 9/11 deserve better than to be used as a political tool by those who seek to excuse American imperialism and Islamophobia.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @yaf

He added:

Since 9/11, Islamophobic hate crimes have been higher than they ever were before. The United States invaded countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, and over 900,000 people have been killed because of the wars the United States has propagated. 37 million people have been displaced, with some reports stating that number reaches up to 59 million. Any memorial of 9/11 that does not contend with these facts is not only incomplete, but it also amplifies pro-imperialist sentiment and actively disrespects those who have died because of American Invasion. A memorial which uses U.S. flags is especially insidious, as it does not recognize those who have fallen, but uses a symbol that was on the shoulders of those who are responsible for the deaths of 900,000 people, and uses the innocent lives lost during 9/11 as a political prop upholding American hegemony.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @yaf

Alkilani also claimed he did nothing wrong — and was ""verbally and physically harassed"":

The misinformation that is currently circulating on YAF's page states that I was ""stealing"" the flags. This is due to a WashU College Republicans member, taking a video of me collecting flags in plastic bags. However, I had no intention of removing the flags from the Mudd Field area, and my full protest did not have the chance to be actualized. My planned protest was to place the bags of flags on Mudd field, along with various statistics (including those below) explaining the human cost of 9/11 in the past 20 years. On the sides of the bags, some writing may be visible, but the full statement was not outlined at the time of the video. I did not deface, destroy, damage, nor steal any flags, nor did I interfere with any registered event time. I assert that I did not violate any University Code of Conduct policy, though the conduct process is undergoing. Additionally, I was verbally and physically harassed by numerous WashU students and WUPD officers, whom I plan to report through official channels.

Anything else?

Students said Alkilani tried to destroy the memorial Friday night, but campus police ordered him to stop, Fox News reported.

The school condemned Alkilani's actions in a statement to the paper: ""We were disappointed to learn about the disruption to the 9/11 display on Mudd Field. We condemn the interference with the expression of support by the College Republicans for the victims of the national tragedy that took place 20 years ago today.""

Chancellor Andrew Martin said much the same, the school paper reported Sunday: ""I want to make it very clear that, as an institution, we find the actions of this student to be reprehensible. The removal of the flags impeded the ability of individuals to commemorate the lives lost on 9/11 and to process the trauma of that day.""

While Martin didn't mention Alkilani by name, he did say the school would investigate the incident.

College Republicans president Nick Rodriguez said Alkilani ""made a mockery of one of the most somber days in American history"" and should be disciplined.

""At minimum, I believe he should be removed from both SU and his [resident advisor] position, as what does it say to be a top American institution, and have yourself represented by a student leader who has no respect for property, campus traditions or the remembrance of thousands of lost lives,"" Rodriguez said in a statement. ""Today is about remembering the tragedy, 20 years ago to the day, not to make a political statement. Any reason he can conjure to remove the flags I find ludicrous.""



Junior Reagan Steirn was among those who gathered with a large American flag on Mudd Field Saturday evening, the paper reported — and she was not happy about Alkilani's actions: ""I'm livid. With a leadership role, someone doing those actions and showing his disrespect will just allow other students on campus to do the same thing, when in this situation it's just not okay to do that.""

The paper also reported that Muslim students are saying they fear for their safety and are concerned about the rise of Islamophobic rhetoric from fellow students and from strangers on social media in the wake of the incident.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/muslim-student-911-memorial-flags-trash-islamophobia-flag-relocation,2021-09-13
"Muslim student who pulled US flags from 9/11 memorial, tossed them into trash bags exercised freedom of speech: First Amendment law prof","In the wake of a growing controversy at Washington University in St. Louis where a Muslim student removed nearly 3,000 miniature U.S. flags from a 9/11 memorial and was caught on video carrying them away in trash bags — after which he railed against ""Islamophobia"" as he defended his ""Flag Relocation"" — a First Amendment law professor at the school is saying the student exercised his freedom of speech and had as much right to remove the flags as those put them there while creating the display.

Professor stands up for Alkilani

However, one of the college's most prominent First Amendment law professors, Gregory Magarian, argued that the administration's silence on Islamophobia and racism after the incident caused ""far greater harm"" than Alkilani's actions, the campus newspaper reported in a follow-up story.

""Putting up these flags as a way of commemorating 9/11 and making a political statement about 9/11 — there's no question that that is an act of speech, that that is expressive, that it carries a message,"" Magarian told the paper earlier this week. ""And I think there's no also no question that as a category, as a phenomenon, taking down the flags in opposition to the display is also expressive.""

The professor also said widespread hate speech following Alkilani's counterprotest, and the way in which it was allowed to go on for days without rebuke from administrators, likely would have a chilling effect on the future atmosphere of free speech on campus, the paper added.

""The point of what Alkilani did, whether or not we agree with his methods, should not be lost: a lot of people feel differently about this,"" Magarian added to the paper. ""This is a very contentious, very contestable political message — the idea that 9/11 is all about national unity and the national interest, the idea that we should focus only on the deaths that occurred on 9/11 and not in commemorating this event talk about things that happened subsequently, that Islamophobia need be no part of the discussion and for that matter, the symbolic rendering of each of these lost lives in the form of an American flag.""

Anything else?

The paper reported that in the wake of the incident Muslim students have said they fear for their safety and are concerned about the rise of Islamophobic rhetoric from fellow students and from strangers on social media. In light of that, student groups have urged the university to address online hate and threats while other students went on an academic strike Wednesday, the paper added in separate stories.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/muslim-student-who-pulled-us-flags-from-9-11-memorial-tossed-them-into-trash-bags-exercised-freedom-of-speech-first-amendment-law-prof,2021-09-17
"Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Zelenskyy in Ukraine, vows 'to be there for you until the fight is done'","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this weekend.

This trip makes Pelosi the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the ongoing Russian invasion. NBC News reported that to many, this trip came as a surprise and that it provided further evidence of the West’s growing support for Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

The trip comes as Russian forces continue to refocus their military campaign in the eastern regions of Ukraine and struggle to make any significant territorial gains, while Ukraine’s allies increase their material support of the invaded nation by sending increasing quantities of military supplies.

Despite the influx of material aid, the Ukrainian military is receiving, the Russians are not backing down as it appears that both sides of the conflict are preparing for the conflict to go on for longer.

During a meeting with Ukrainian officials, Pelosi said, “We are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom. Your fight is a fight for everyone, and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.”

Zelenskyy said he was “very grateful for this powerful signal of support.”

The Ukrainian president also said, “This shows that the United States today is a leader in strong support for Ukraine during the war against the aggression of the Russian Federation.”

Pelosi’s delegation consisted entirely of Congressional Democrats. It consisted of Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks from New York, and Adam Schiff from California.

The delegation’s trip marks the second major visit made by American officials to Ukraine in the month of April.

Earlier this month U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to discuss U.S. aid to Ukraine. In their meeting, the diplomats told Zelenskyy that the U.S. was prepared to provide Ukraine with $300 million in military financing and had also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition, that was not made in the U.S., that would be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weaponry.

The U.S. and many of its European allies pledge to send shipments of defensive munitions to Ukraine to aid the country in warding off future Russian advances into the country.

Much like the surprise visits by the American delegations, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a meeting with Zelenskyy earlier this month where the two men discussed European sanctions on Russia and Great Britain’s commitment to supplying Ukraine with materials needed for defense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-ukraine-russia,2022-05-01
"Nancy Pelosi's husband severely beaten with hammer after break-in at couple's San Francisco home; source says suspect shouted, 'Where is Nancy?'","Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, was severely beaten with a hammer after an early Friday break-in at the couple's San Francisco home, the Associated Press reported, adding that the suspect shouted, ""Where is Nancy, where is Nancy?"" before the attack.

What are the details?

Paul Pelosi, 82, suffered blunt-force trauma to his head and body, the AP said, citing two people with knowledge of the investigation into who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Doctors were treating Pelosi for bruising, severe swelling, and other injuries, the outlet said, adding that Nancy Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said he was expected to make a full recovery.

The suspect is in the custody of San Francisco police, the AP said. Capitol Police, who protect congressional leaders, said Nancy Pelosi was with her protective detail in Washington at the time of the attack, the outlet added.

The suspect was identified as David Depape, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.

Hammill said the motivation for the attack is under investigation, the AP reported. Capitol Police said the FBI and San Francisco police were also investigating, the outlet noted.

The attack comes 11 days ahead of November's midterm elections, the AP said, adding that crime and public safety are top concerns for Americans.

Update: KPIX's Jocelyn Moran with the latest on home invasion assault of Paul Pelosi youtu.be

Leftists have previously targeted the Pelosi home

In May, pro-abortion activists demonstrated outside the Pelosi home and blamed the House speaker for the then-expected overturn of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

""We're here because Nancy Pelosi and the whole leadership of the Democratic party has been complicit, complicit with the fascist Republican party that wants to not only only eliminate abortion rights, but gay marriage, trans rights, and a whole slew, a whole slew of rights!"" one protest leader bellowed on her bullhorn.

On July 31, 2021, progressive activists — furious that Pelosi was unable to extend a nationwide eviction moratorium before the long congressional recess — protested at the home and served an ""eviction notice"" to the House speaker.

""The reason that we're at her house is that she has a beautiful mansion in Pacific Heights in San Francisco, and it shows how out of touch she is with the people that are facing a situation [of eviction],"" Christin Evans, one of the activists outside the home, told Fox News. ""We wanted to essentially send her a message that we want her to reconvene Congress to take a vote [to extend] the eviction moratorium.""

In addition, the Pelosi residence was vandalized on New Year's Day 2021 with leftist messages demanding universal basic income and rent cancellation. The San Francisco home also was splattered with fake blood, and a severed pig's head was placed on the driveway. The white garage door was spray-painted with graffiti that read ""Cancel Rent!,"" ""UBI!,"" and ""We Want Everything!""

Paul Pelosi's drunk driving arrest

Paul Pelosi was arrested for drunk driving and charged with DUI after his vehicle collided with another in Napa wine country in May; Pelosi reportedly had a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or higher.

Following the crash, authorities booked Pelosi into the Napa County Detention Center on misdemeanor charges; he was released the next morning on $5,000 bail. Pelosi on Aug. 3 pleaded not guilty — then on Aug. 23 pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five days in jail.

However, a judge subtracted four days from the sentence — two of which Pelosi had already spent in jail and two days of good conduct; the judge then ordered Pelosi to participate in an eight-hour work program in lieu of one more day in jail, Fox News Digital reported.

Paul Pelosi's eyebrow-raising stock purchase

Paul Pelosi in June purchased millions of dollars of stock in a semiconductor company weeks before an expected Senate vote on a bill to subsidize computer chip manufacturing and semiconductor companies with billions.

Days later, when a reporter asked Nancy Pelosi if her husband ever made a stock transaction based on information she provided him, the House speaker said no and then abruptly left her weekly news conference.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosis-husband-severely-beaten-with-hammer-after-break-in-at-couples-san-francisco-home-source-says-suspect-shouted-where-is-nancy,2022-10-28
NASCAR superstar offers donation of 1 million ammo rounds for Ukraine's fight against Russia — a 'wake-up call for America',"NASCAR legend Richard Childress has offered to donate at least 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine amid its fight for freedom against Russian forces, Fox News reported Wednesday.

What are the details?

The former race car driver and team owner told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade on ""Fox & Friends"" that he will donate 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukrainian forces after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for help from around the globe.

""I was listening the other day and heard President Zelenskyy say he didn't want out, he wanted ammunition,"" Childress recalled. ""I called my good friend Fred Wagenhals, who is the Chairman of AMMO, Inc., which is a publicly traded company, POWW, and I said, 'Fred, we gotta help these people. They need ammunition.' And he stepped right up, he said, ‘We’ll do it,’ and now we’re turning our production to this as our number one priority.""

Childress, who serves on AMMO's board of directors, is reportedly worth $250 million.

""This is a wake-up call for America, and why we have to have our Second Amendment,"" he added. ""We have ... 82 million gun owners in America, and to see the people in Ukraine fighting — it's terrible to see the lives that are being lost over there. We have to do all we can, and I felt with Ammo Inc. and myself, we were doing the right thing.""

Childress said that he and Wagenhals are working with the public and private sector in order to figure out the logistics of transporting the ammunition to the needy country.

""We're working with some government agencies, but to get it there quickly, we're going to work through a private company that will be working to get it in there,"" Childress explained. ""The number one ammo they're needing right now over there is the 7.62s, and that's what we're going to be producing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nascar-superstar-1-million-ammo-rounds-for-ukraine,2022-03-03
"National Guard and state troopers swap out red carpet for razor wire, stand ready at Texas border","Amid a surge of illegal border crossings and ahead of a polar vortex, over 400 Texas National Guard troops were dispatched to El Paso on Monday to curb the flow of criminal noncitizens into the U.S. as part of the state's broader ""enhanced border security effort.""

Armed guardsmen and troopers have since formed a line along the banks of the Rio Grande, preventing river crossers from surrendering to Border Patrol agents.



Border Patrol agents behind the line would not process the illegal aliens, keen instead to let the guardsmen repel them, reported the Texas Tribune.

Guardsmen employed Spanish when informing prospective border crossers that they didn't stand a chance of making it across and advised them to attempt to enter the country through a legal port of entry.

The Texas Military Department posted images of 36th Infantry Division troops constructing a concertina-wire barrier to discourage illegal crossings.

According to the Texas Tribune, over 1,000 yards of razor wire have been placed this week.

Fox News' Bill Melugin posted a video showing members of the TNG preparing for an onslaught of illegal aliens, with Humvees strategically positioned.

El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser announced a state of emergency over the weekend, indicating that neither citizens nor illegal aliens were safe.

The Texas Military Department announced Monday that the TNG activated and deployed airlift assets from the 136th Airlift Wing in Fort Worth, which had been on alert status since last week.



Accordingly, four C-130J cargo aircraft expedited the ""movement of Soldiers and equipment to El Paso"" as part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's security initiative.

""The deployment includes a Security Response Force composed of elements of the 606th Military Police Battalion mobilizing to El Paso, Texas,"" stated the Texas Military Department. ""A second Security Response Force from the 236th MP Company remains on high alert, prepared to deploy if needed, to other areas of the border.""

A Tuesday statement from the governor's office indicated that extra to the Texas Military Department, Abbott is working with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Division of Emergency Management to stymie the influx of criminal noncitizens.



These efforts come over a month after Abbott declared an ""invasion"" at the southern border and indicated that he would be taking a series of ""unprecedented measures ... to keep our state & country safe.""

While the TNG and other state forces hold the line, Texas expects the federal government to step up to help at the border, which the president has yet to visit.

Abbott wrote to President Joe Biden Tuesday, saying, ""This terrible crisis for border communities in Texas is a catastrophe of your own making.""

""Texas has borne a lopsided burden caused by your open border policies. The need to address this crisis is not the job of border states like Texas,"" Abbott wrote. ""Instead, the U.S. Constitution dictates that it is your job, Mr. President, to defend the borders of our country, regulate our nation’s immigration, and manage those who seek refuge here.""

The governor called on Biden to deploy federal assets to ""address the dire problems you have caused"" and to ""execute the duties that the U.S. Constitution mandates you perform.""

While the TNG has been beefing up its presence in anticipation of the end of Title 42, which many anticipate would open the floodgates to an alarming number of attempts by criminal noncitizens to steal into the U.S., the Trump-era policy temporarily remains in place per the order of Chief Justice John Roberts.

Despite the Department of Homeland Security's recent admission that thousands of recent deportations have been Title 42 expulsions, the Biden administration nevertheless renewed its request for the Supreme Court to lift the policy.

Leeser, El Paso's mayor, suggested that 20,000 illegal aliens are ""ready to come into El Paso"" — many more of whom will get to stay in the U.S. upon Title 42's elimination.

According to the New York Post, El Paso's shelter beds are all taken up, its illegal alien detention facility is 1,500 capacity, and around 800 people have been released onto the streets.

NATO Response Force deployed for first time in response to Russian invasion of Ukraine,"For the first time in the history of the alliance, NATO has activated part of its 40,000-troop strong response force to secure member nations near the borders of the Russian-Ukraine war.

At a press conference announcing the unprecedented deployment of troops, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Friday that ""the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine.""



""We are deploying [the NRF] to ... prevent any miscalculations, any misunderstandings that we are not ready to protect and defend all our allies,"" Stoltenberg said. ""This is something that all allies have agreed to do.""

NATO Response Force troops will deploy ""on land, at sea, and in the air"" in eastern Europe for the purpose of collected defense, Axios reports.

The secretary general explained that while the size of the NRF has tripled since 2014, not all of its forces would be deployed. He also said that NATO countries would be providing Ukraine with arms and air-defense systems at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government.

Stoltenberg told reporters that the eastern flank allies ""are extremely concerned"" with the events unfolding in Ukraine.

""They are close to the fighting in Ukraine, and they also border Russia, and they've seen not only the military buildup and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric because this goes far beyond Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine, but it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously,"" he added.

U.S. President Joe Biden has also deployed troops to eastern Europe to secure NATO countries bordering the conflict. The president has made clear that these troops are being deployed as a defensive measure, and they will not be sent into Ukraine to engage with Russian forces.

NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said the activation of response forces was ""historic"" in a statement.



""This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,"" Wolters said. ""These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.""

In a statement released Friday morning, Zelenskyy thanked NATO for its support but requested more from the alliance to defend against the Russian invaders.

""We are alone in defending our country. Who is ready to defend us together with us? Honestly, I don't see any,"" Zelensky said. ""Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of joining NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nato-response-force-deployed-for-first-time-in-response-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine,2022-02-25

""It doesn't surprise me one bit,"" Counts told the station. ""It's just gotten more and more violent.""

'You're darn right I would shoot'

He added to KOAT that the crime rate in Albuquerque makes him want to get a gun — and if he was faced with similar threats, Counts said he'd have no problem pulling the trigger just like his neighbor did.

""If they come on my property and act like they're going to harm me, you're darn right I would shoot,"" he said to the station.

Counts told KOAT he's already been taking precautions: ""Whenever I leave I lock up. Before I go to bed I walk through every door.""



He added to the station that ""Albuquerque as a whole is getting worse and worse, and the police don't have any jurisdiction. That's the problem.""

Earlier this month, another Albuquerque homeowner shot and killed an intruder who entered his residence after midnight.

Anything else?

Police would not say how many shots were fired or if the homeowner will face any charges, KOAT reported.

EMTs treated the homeowner for minor injuries, the station said, adding that the intruder was taken to a hospital, and his medical condition is unknown.

The shooting is under investigation, KOAT reported.

""This is the first time in the world that you can treat solid tumors with alpha radiation,"" Alpha Tau Medical's CEO Uzi Sofer told the Times of Israel.

The technology called Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy, or DaRT, uses a needle to inject tumors with a radioactive seed that releases a high-energy dose of alpha radiation that destroys the tumor. The healthy tissue surrounding the tumors is left unharmed.

The procedure is minimally invasive and can be performed using local anesthesia in two hours or less, the company said. Sofer told the Times that for superficial tumors it's much ""like going to a dentist.""

How does it work?

The Alpha DaRT radioactive seeds are inserted into the tumor where they must stay for at least two weeks.

""In the process of decay, Radium-224 releases its short-lived Alpha-emitting atoms into the tumor,"" according to the company's website. ""By diffusion and convection, these atoms disperse to a therapeutically significant range of several millimeters, delivering a high dose of radiation inside the tumor.""

Sofer told the Times that the seeds are biocompatible and can remain inside an internal organ forever.

He said it could be used ""to treat any kind of solid tumor,"" adding that it could be used concurrently with other cancer treatments.

""Right now, we have evidence for squamous cell carcinoma and we have 12 protocols that we are developing all around the world to treat patients with different solid tumors,"" Sofer told the Israeli news outlet.

Are there side effects?



No serious side effects were observed during clinical trials, according to company spokesperson Sara Jaehnert, adding that any ""non-severe"" side effects ""were resolved within one to two months.""

Why hasn't this type of radioactive material been used before?

Alpha particles are lethal to cancerous cells but they have an impractically short range in tissue, which means the particles had been unsuitable for cancer treatment, according to the company's website.

Trials have shown that DaRT can induce anti-tumor immunity. After the system is used, the body learns ""what to find and what to destroy,"" Sofer said.

Have clinical trials started?

Clinical trials in humans started in early 2017. It was first tested on more than 6,000 animals.

There are currently two clinical trials for squamous cell carcinoma of the head, neck, and skin, which are taking place in Israel and Italy.

Sofer told the Times that preliminary results of the trials were ""sensational.""

All of the trials' patients responded to the treatment and the tumors disappeared in more than 70 percent of them.

What else?

The company said the treatment can teach a person's immune system recognize and destroy unhealthy cells.

""Cancer cells know how to 'hide' from the immune system,"" but ""tumor ablation,"" which is what the company's therapy does, ""can cause the formation of tumor-specific antigens that can then be recognized by the immune system,"" Jaehnert said.

Alpha Tau Medical is also working with cancer centers across the globe, including at least two locations in the U.S. — the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.

""We pray and believe that by next year we will have the first approval in Europe and then we'll have approval in the US and Japan, with a very clear road map for each country,"" Sofer told the Times.

New report sounds massive privacy invasion alarm for mobile phone users: 'Delete Google Chrome on your phone',"A new report from Forbes suggests that mobile phone users who have Chrome installed on their phone are subject to massive invasion of privacy risks, and encourages users to delete the mobile browser from their phone. According to the report, Google's data harvesting practices are far more intrusive and pervasive even than Facebook's, and the data that Google harvests is more widely and freely shared with third parties without your active consent.

Last month, it was revealed that the Facebook app on your iPhone continues to track your location data on your phone even if you have specifically set your iPhone to ""never"" allow location tracking data, and that there is no way to avoid this other than deleting the Facebook app from your phone. Now, according to Forbes' cybersecurity reporter Zak Doffman, it has been revealed that what Google is doing is actually even worse.

Reportedly, while Apple has changed their privacy practices to require you to grant permission to third party apps to track your location data, Android users and users who have Chrome installed on their phone are having their location data gathered by default - even when browsing is set to private or incognito mode. Even worse, while Facebook was collecting this data for its own uses, Google makes this highly sensitive location data ""available to any site that asks—by default.""

Your phone collects this data by using what is known as the accelerometer on your phone — a component that allows navigation apps like maps and Waze to function and provides a valuable service to drivers who increasingly use their phones as navigation devices, particularly in large cities. The accelerometer measures the orientation and linear distance traveled by your phone. While many users depend on these services, it was revealed that mobile browsers were allowing sites to access your phone's accelerometer data without permission, which led iPhone to implement security measures in 2019 that would prevent third-party sites from accessing this data without the user's permission, which would have to be granted by an affirmative choice.

According to the Forbes report, Chrome on Android still does not have such protection for users. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Google noted that Google now allows users to opt out of sharing this location data, by default this location sharing remains on, and further, even if you go into your phone and attempt to turn it off, your phone will provide you with a warning that will attempt to change your mind.

According to the report: ""Chrome is isolated as the only major browser that has not yet acted to stop cross-site tracking, the only browser (illustrated by Apple's privacy labels when used on iOS) that collects vast amounts of data, all of which link back to user identities, the only major browser that pushed out FLoC, despite numerous privacy warnings. On Android, you can delete Chrome from by disabling the stock browser in your settings.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-report-sounds-massive-privacy-invasion-alarm-for-mobile-phone-users-delete-google-chrome-on-your-phone,2021-11-06
Parents claim New York middle school strip-searched four 12-year-old girls. District denies.,"A New York school district has denied that it recently subjected four 12-year-old girls to strip searches in a middle school nurse's office, The Associated Press reported.

""There has been a lot of misinformation being spread through social media from third parties,"" the Binghamton School District wrote in a statement released Thursday. ""No students were strip-searched, nor were they punished as a result of the incident in question, and they were allowed to return to class after being evaluated.""

In its statement, the district did not clarify what happened to the girls. But it did write that district officials have the right to conduct medical and physical evaluations if a student's behavior appears to be out of character.

None of the administrators reportedly involved have suspended or placed on leave.

What's the backstory?

The district came under fire after the girls were allegedly questioned and strip-searched on Jan. 15 by the school nurse and assistant principal at Binghamton's East Middle School.

Progressive Leaders of Tomorrow, a local organization, claimed that the girls were subjected to the search under the suspicion of possessing drugs after ""appearing hyper and giddy during their lunch hour.""

""The children were instructed to remove their clothing, and felt ashamed, humiliated and traumatized by the experience,"" the group wrote in a statement, according to Press Connects.

What did community members say?

About 200 community members packed Tuesday's school board meeting where they questioned the accountability of those who work for the district.

""If we don't have teachers who want to be held accountable, they should leave,"" parent Kymel Yard said, according to Press Connects.

Broome-Tioga NAACP President Mica Barreiro introduced a list of demands from some of the community members, according to the newspaper.

Stop the practice of strip-searching children for any reason, and especially in response to giddiness or behavioral concerns.



Removal of the assistant principal and principal at East Middle School for poor judgment, which allegedly resulted in child trauma.



Remove the nurse who administered the strip searches.



Publicly apologize to the students, their families and the community at large for violating the trust of all parties harmed by their actions.



Provide alternate instruction for the girls, at either West Middle School or home instruction, until the situation has been rectified to the satisfaction of the families.

""This is outrageous that these girls got strip-searched and nobody got suspended,"" Barreiro said, according to the AP. ""School rules say parents have to be informed before anything like this happens.""

A middle school student who said her best friend was involved also addressed the board.

""How am I supposed to tell her everything is going to be OK if nothing is being taken care of?"" Alicia Richard asked.

What was the district's response after the school board meeting?

On Wednesday, the district issued a statement that appears to contradict its most recent statement.

It apologized for the ""unintended consequences"" caused to the students involved, adding that the law allows administrators to search students whose ""health is in danger.""

""Unfortunately, our students shared that these actions have had the unintended consequences of making the students feel traumatized. We sincerely apologize for the impact this has had and are working with these families to support their children's success,"" the district wrote.

""A student may, under current law and policy, be searched in a school building by an administrator when the administrator reasonably suspects that a student's health is in danger or is in possession of a substance that may harm themselves or others,"" the statement continued. ""School administrators will be gathering to review existing procedures. The resulting regulations, which will ensure safety and personal integrity of all of our students, will be communicated to our families. Additionally, the district's current Board Policy will move forward for review.""

Progressive Leaders has planned a rally for Tuesday at the middle school to inform parents and students of their ""right to refuse invasive and discriminatory searches being conducted by school faculty and staff.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-school-strip-search-claims,2019-01-25
New York Times praises terrorist group Hezbollah for bringing Santa to Beirut,"The New York Times has faced backlash online for running a Christmas Eve piece that many called pro-Hezbollah propaganda.

The piece, which ran in the New York Times' World News section, was widely criticized as a puff piece that made the Islamist terrorist organization appear sympathetic.





Even Hezbollah, the Shiite political movement and militia that the United States has branded a terrorist organization, has helped ring in the season in previous years, importing a Santa to Beirut's southern suburbs to distribute gifts. https://t.co/JTbtAgghQ3

— New York Times World (@nytimesworld) December 25, 2018

The article highlighted efforts by the Iranian-backed organization to bring a Christmas Santa to a shopping mall in Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon. According to the Times, the Iranian cultural attache kicked off the event by saying, ""Today, we're celebrating the birth of Christ... and also the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.""

The Times went on to say that one of the speakers at the event proposed that Christians and Muslims ""are one family, against corruption, with social justice, against authority, against Israel, with the Lebanese Army and with the resistance."" The article went on to describe the other Christmastime celebrations attendant to the event, and claimed that ""few seasons frame the everyday give-and-take of religious coexistence quite like Christmastime in Lebanon.""

Many were quick to criticize the Times' article as a whitewashing of Hezbollah's violent extremist past and present. Hezbollah has been listed as a terrorist organization by the United States Department of State since 1997.

Hezbollah has been widely suspected of having provided material support to the Islamic Jihad Organization during the deadly 1983 bombings of the United States Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed a total of 368 people. They have also been implicated in numerous deadly terror attacks against the United States and other Western countries since that time.





This is a new low. Hezbollah was Al Qaeda before there was AQ. They were ISIS before there was ISIS. They kidnapped and murdered the CIA station chief in Beirut. Killed over 200 Marines that same year. And kidnapped journalists and pastors. https://t.co/LAUuVcv9lX

NY state lawmakers propose ban on 'virginity testing' after rapper T.I. makes controversial remarks about his daughter,"New York state lawmakers are considering banning ""virginity testing"" from taking place, according to a report in the New York Times.

The move comes after rapper T.I. disclosed that he makes his 18-year-old daughter take such a test on an annual basis to ensure that her hymen remains intact.

Uh, what did he say?

T.I. made the remarks during an interview on the ""Ladies Like Us"" podcast in November, saying that a doctor once told him that the hymen can be ruptured by means other than having sex, including ""bike riding, athletics, horseback riding, [and] physical activity."" The rapper said he told the doctor, ""Look, doc, she don't ride no horses. She don't ride no bike. She don't play no sports. Just check the hymen please and give me back my results — expeditiously.""

The remarks garnered heavy backlash on the internet, and the rapper's daughter subsequently deleted her social media accounts.

What are the details of the legislation?

Democratic Assemblywoman Michaelle C. Solages introduced a bill last week to ban the practice.

""It made me angry, and I was just very upset,"" Solages said. ""To use your platform to say that you did this is just misogynistic and it sets the women's movement back.""

If enacted, the legislation would prevent physicians from performing such examinations and expose them to penalties if they violated the law.

Sen. Roxanne J. Persaud (D-N.Y.) introduced a companion bill in the state Senate.

""The invasive procedure of a virginity examination violates the sanctity and purity of a female,"" Persaud said. ""Whether a child or adult, this breaches not only moral grounds, but also the privacy entitled to a female and their doctor.""

In 2018, the World Health Organization decried virginity testing and recommended the practice be condemned.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-virginity-testing-ban,2019-12-03
MSNBC host says Trump is talking about 'exterminating Latinos' — and faces brutal social media backlash,"MSNBC host Nicholle Wallace faced brutal online backlash after she nonchalantly claimed that President Donald Trump was talking about ""exterminating Latinos.""

The contentious comment circulated Tuesday on social media.

Wallace was attempting to draw the sharp distinction between past Republican and Democratic presidential administration in relation to the Latino community, and the Trump administration.

""President Obama used the power of the presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform for Latino community, Latino leaders at the table,"" she said.

""You now have a president who is, like you said, talking about exterminating Latinos,"" Wallace continued.

Among those who criticized the comment was Greg Gutfeld of Fox News who responded, ""MSNBC might want to walk this back. holy s**t.""

Others excoriated the former Republican who has become a vehement critic of Trump.

""I misspoke...""

Wallace apologized for the comment after the backlash of outrage on social media.

""I misspoke about Trump calling for an extermination of Latinos. My mistake was unintentional and I'm sorry,"" Wallace offered.

Then she followed up with more criticism of the president.

""Trump's constant assault on people of color and his use of the word 'invasion' to describe the flow of immigrants is intentional and constant,"" she concluded.

Many on the left and other critics of Trump tried to connect his numerous uses of the word ""invasion"" to describe illegal immigrants to the same language used in a manifesto written by the mass murderer in an attack at El Paso, Texas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nicholle-wallace-apologizes-for-extermination-comment,2019-08-07
MSNBC anchor says the 'dehumanization' of GOP parental rights bills is comparable to Russian soldiers raping children in Ukraine,"MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace said that the ""dehumanization"" of of LGBT children by parental rights bills put forth by some Republican governors is comparable to the war atrocities where Russian soldiers reportedly raped Ukrainian children.

Wallace made the comments on Wednesday while speaking to Bulwark writer Tim Miller about parental rights bills passed by some Republican governors to ban teachers from talking about transgender and other sexual topics in early public school education.

""And I worry that in covering [Virginia Gov.] Glen Youngkin (R) and his politics of parental choice, all the focus was on how well it worked, and even in our conversations about [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis (R), it's about how well they're serving him,"" Wallace said.

""The truth is dehumanization is a tactic for politics is from war, dehumanization is a tactic, that's being used right now, the Russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them,"" she continued emphatically.

""Dehumanization as a practice, is a tactic of war, it's being deployed in politics, and people like you and I sometimes lose the plot, and admits its effectiveness, its, not its substance, but even the analysis of these tactics loses sight of what, of what, this speech bring us back to, which is, dehumanization has a cost right now, right now, as its deployed,"" Wallace added.

""And, and, Chasten Buttigieg made this point when 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was introduced, kids will die!"" she concluded.

Miller agreed with Wallace and registered no opposition to her overheated rhetoric.

""Yeah, I think that’s right,"" Miller responded. ""Their cruelty and inhuman behavior is inexcusable.""

Among the many reports of war crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there have been some unconfirmed claims that Russian soldiers are sexually assaulting children.

NIH argues in court it cannot release information about COVID-19 origins because there's too much misinformation out there,"A whistleblower support group that is suing the National Institutes of Health has filed a motion objecting to a federal judge's order in favor of the government agency, which asked for the name of a Chinese scientist to be sealed. But the name of this scientist was already made public by the NIH in 2020, and critics say the agency's request is part of a haphazard and aggressive attempt to redact documents and hide information related to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Empower Oversight on Thursday filed a motion in federal district court objecting to an order issued by Magistrate Judge John Anderson granting the NIH's request to have South China Agricultural University scientist Kangpeng Xiao's name sealed, even though the agency previously disclosed Xiao's name in a public records requests made by U.S. Right to Know in 2020 and in a records requests made by Empower Oversight later.

The records concerned Xiao's June 2020 request to the NIH to have certain pangolin coronavirus sequences he submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's sequence read archive deleted.



As TheBlaze previously reported, the NIH was found to have deleted certain sequences of coronavirus data from the agency's Sequence Read Archive at the requests of Chinese researchers early in the pandemic. Dr. Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, published a study in June 2021 that identified the missing sequences and recovered the files from the Google Cloud, from which he performed an analysis to learn more about the origins of the virus.

Bloom's analysis cited an example of another Chinese scientist requesting the deletion of two ""sequencing runs"" of a pangolin coronavirus from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's sequence read archive. This scientist, Kangpeng Xiao, requested numerous changes to data he submitted to the SRA, a public records request from U.S. Right to Know revealed in December 2020. “These revisions are odd because they occurred after publication, and without any rationale, explanation or validation,” USRTK observed at the time.



Responding to media inquiries on Bloom's study, the NIH explained that scientists who make submissions to the database ""hold the rights to their data and can request withdrawal of the data.""

But lawmakers and watchdog organizations have sought more information from the NIH about these data deletions, which they believe may provide answers to the still unknown origins of COVID-19.



Empower Oversight filed a lawsuit against the NIH in November 2021 seeking to force the agency to comply with various detailed Freedom of Information requests made for documents related to the Chinese researchers' requests to remove genetic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the sequence read archive. The group has since entered into a protracted legal battle with the NIH, which has fought tooth and nail to keep records redacted.

In a July 11 court filing, Empower Oversight accused the NIH of improperly redacting documents in response to its FOIA requests, independent journalist Paul Thacker reported. The group cited an email the NIH had turned over, dated October 12, 2021, in which Jesse Bloom wrote the NIH inquiring about a Chinese scientist's request to delete SRA virus sequences. The names of both the scientist and an NIH official were redacted, although it was clear based on previous records disclosures the scientist was Kangpeng Xiao.

The NIH claimed the names had been redacted for privacy concerns in a declaration to the court, according to Thacker's newsletter, the Disinformation Chronicle.

""Exemption 6 mandates the withholding of information that if disclosed 'would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.' 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). Exemption 6 was applied here due to the heightened public scrutiny with anything remotely related to COVID-19,"" NIH FOIA officer Gorka Garcia-Malene wrote.

Garcia-Malene also claimed that the information needed to be redacted ""because of the amount of misinformation surrounding the pandemic and its origins.""

""If released, this type of information could be used by the public to send threatening and harassing messages,"" he wrote.



Thacker was highly critical of the NIH's reasoning.

""Seriously, the NIH is now arguing in court that because there is so much misinformation about how the pandemic began, they can’t release facts that might clear up misinformation about how the pandemic began,"" he wrote in a scathing report.

What's more, Thacker reported, is that in a second production of records in response to Empower Oversight's FOIA request, the NIH provided the exact same email from Jesse Bloom but did not redact the names.

Empower Oversight made note of this in its court filing, arguing the NIH was abusing the fear of ""threatening and harassing messages"" to redact information that doesn't need to be sealed. ""[The] NIH used this approach in instances where there was no legitimate threat of such harassment. NIH repeatedly redacted the official NIH email address of Dr. Francis Collins, even though he had retired months before [the] NIH’s May 13th production of responsive records,"" the group told the judge.



In response on July 15, the NIH asked the court to seal Xiao's name and the name of an NIH official he communicated with from filings in the case, even though those names had been disclosed years earlier. The NIH claimed that it had ""inadvertently failed to redact the two names.""

“[T]he individuals have a substantial privacy interest in avoiding harassment or media scrutiny that would likely follow disclosure,” an NIH attorney wrote to the judge. “Sealing is therefore necessary to protect this information from any further public dissemination.”

Empower Oversight objected to the motion to seal on July 22, arguing the redactions would be absurd since Xiao's name had already been made public.

""Even if this Court were to grant NIH’s motion to seal portions of Empower Oversight’s opposition to summary judgment, 'the proverbial cat is already out of the bag,'"" Empower Oversight argued. ""NIH has not asked the Court to 'claw back' the records purportedly lacking the agency’s intended redactions that it claims to have mistakenly failed to make. And even if the Court were to construe the agency's motion as requesting that relief, NIH has not carried its 'heavy burden to obtain such an order.'""

Nevertheless, the judge sided with the NIH on July 22, ruling that the ""targeted and limited sealing"" was ""the least drastic alternative available,"" and that First Amendment concerns in favor of public access to records were outweighed by the NIH's privacy concerns, the Epoch Times reported.

Empower Oversight's response on July 28 argues that the judge ""prematurely"" granted NIH's request to seal Xiao's name without having received or considered the group's counterarguments.

""Empower Oversight opposes this request by NIH simply because NIH has not given a good enough reason to seal two names from the record, and this information has already been available to the public for years,"" the group said in a statement.

The lengths the NIH has gone to to obscure information from watchdog and oversight groups has frustrated Republican lawmakers. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) cited Thacker's reporting in a letter to the NIH demanding that the agency cease ""improperly withholding information from the public related to COVID-19 for political reasons.""

""NIH has repeatedly disregarded its responsibilities under FOIA and the American people's right to agency records. For almost two years, public interest groups and media organizations have been forced to engage in protracted litigation to obtain documents related to NIH's involvement in COVID-19. The records NIH has produced have been heavily redacted,"" Paul wrote.

He continued, ""Of particular concern is NIH's recent admission in Court that the agency is withholding portions of emails between employees because they 'could be used out of context to serve and amplify the already prevalent misinformation regarding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.' This suggests NIH is censoring the information it releases to the public about the origins of the pandemic.'""



Paul demanded that the NIH respond to several questions about how the agency processes FOIA requests no later than August 3.

Christian NIH director urges churches to close amid the COVID-19 crisis,"National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins — an outspoken Christian — is asking churches across America to do the ""altruistic, loving thing"" and close — or stay closed — amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to NPR.

What are the details?

On Thursday, Collins issued a nationwide plea to religious leaders, urging them to close their churches.

""The virus is having a wonderful time right now, taking advantage of circumstances where people have let their guard go down,"" Collins said. ""Churches gathering in person is a source of considerable concern, and has certainly been an instance where super spreading has happened and could happen again.""

He added, ""Most churches really ought to be advised to go to remote services if they're not already doing so.""

He made the remarks during a virtual conference with Russell Moore, who is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Collins pointed out that congregants initially seemed to fall in line with local public health directives, but seemed to falter when it came to longevity.

""Then you get to the end of the service,"" he said. ""You can't get a bunch of Christians not to hug each other and not want to shake hands with the pastor as they go out the door and maybe have a conversation a lot closer than six feet away. And that's where the trouble happens.""

Collins said that masks are a ""lifesaving device,"" and not an ""invasion of your political freedom"" or a ""political statement.""

""Think about it that way,"" he urged. ""And remember, when you put on that mask, you're protecting yourself from other people, but mostly you're protecting them from yourself. You're doing the altruistic, loving thing of saying, 'I'm going to protect people from me.' And that's a Christian action if ever I've heard one.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nih-director-urges-churches-close-amid-covid,2020-12-04
North Carolina couple call 911 to report an 'intruder' — suspect turns out to be their vacuum,"A North Carolina couple had a scare on Christmas Eve, when they heard a commotion in their home in the middle of the night and believed someone had broken in.

North Korea codifies right to preemptive nuclear attack,"North Korea’s leadership passed a law this week granting the country the right to launch preemptive nuclear strikes.

The law authorizes the North Korean military to use nuclear weapons “automatically and immediately” in case of an imminent attack against its leadership or “important strategic objects,” reports The Washington Post.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said this law also makes his country’s nuclear status “irreversible” and bars any talks of denuclearization. “The utmost significance of legislating nuclear weapons policy is to draw an irretrievable line so that there can be no bargaining over our nuclear weapons,” Kim told the country’s titular parliament.

Kim also shrugged off western sanctions. ""Let them sanction us for 100 days, 1,000 days, 10 years or 100 years,"" he said. ""We will never give up our rights to self-defense that preserves our country's existence and the safety of our people just to temporarily ease the difficulties we are experiencing now.""

The new legislation serves as a replacement to a 2013 law that first outlined North Korea’s nuclear status. The 2013 law stipulated that North Korea could use nuclear weapons to “repel invasion or attack from a hostile nuclear state and make retaliatory strikes,” writes The Guardian.

Prior to this new law, the United Nations was already warning about serious concerns it had with North Korea's nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, noted earlier this week that North Korea was in the process of expanding key facilities at its main nuclear site. ""The reopening of the nuclear test site is deeply troubling,"" the agency said in a summary of its findings.

This news comes in the wake of reports that Russia has been buying weapons from North Korea to help fuel its invasion of Ukraine.

North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, and now has the capability of delivering warheads to the U.S. mainland, notes The Washington Post. South Korean and U.S. officials believe that North Korea could soon resume nuclear tests for the first time since 2017.

The U.S. will continue to coordinate with allies for “the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” stated a National Security Council spokesperson.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-codifies-right-to-preemptive-nuclear-attack,2022-09-10
North Korea reportedly fires ICBM for the first time since 2017,"North Korea has test-fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time since 2017, according to South Korean and Japanese officials, in a provocative action that was condemned by President Joe Biden.

Japan's Defense Ministry tracked what is believed to be an ICBM, which flew to an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and to a distance of 1,080 kilometers (671 miles) with a flight time of 71 minutes before landing in waters near Japan's western coast, CNN reports.

Thursday's missile launch is the 11th test North Korea has conducted this year, including one test on March 16 that South Korean officials said exploded in mid-air. News of the test broke while President Biden is meeting other Western leaders in Brussels for a high-stakes summit to discuss Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The missile launch is the longest-range test conducted by North Korea since the country's dictator Kim Jong Un imposed a moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing during diplomatic talks with President Donald Trump's administration. The resumption of ICBM testing is yet another destabilizing action taken by an American adversary under Biden's watch since the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Thursday to discuss the matter.

""The two Leaders discussed DPRK’s launch of a long-range ballistic missile, which both Leaders strongly condemned, stressed the need for diplomacy, and agreed to continue working together to hold the DPRK accountable,"" a White House official said in a statement, according to The Hill.

Officials from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea have each condemned the missile test.

""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

""This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people. We urge all countries to hold the DPRK accountable for such violations and call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations,"" she continued.



""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions. The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" she said.



The missile test comes two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is widely expected to be tougher on North Korea than his predecessor, according to CNN.

In response to the suspected ICBM test, South Korea's military conducted exercises, launching several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

""Our military is monitoring North Korean military's movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,"" the JCS said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-provokes-with-suspected-icbm-test,2022-03-24
North Korea now says it won't denuclearize unless the US removes its 'nuclear threat' first,"Through a state-run newspaper, the government of North Korea has indicated that it will not denuclearize until the U.S. ""nuclear threat"" is eliminated.

What did North Korea say?

A commentary from the Korean Central News Agency laid out the government's position on denuclearization:

The proper definition of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is completely eliminating the American nuclear threat to North Korea before eliminating our nuclear capability.

It went on to say:

When talking about the Korean peninsula, it encompasses not only our republic's territory but also South Korea where the American nuclear weapons and armed forces for invasion are spread out. When talking about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, [the United States] needs to know that it means eliminating all nuclear threat factors.

While the United States has halted large-scale joint military exercises with South Korea, there is no indication that the Trump administration would agree to remove U.S. troops from South Korea.

This comes less than a week after an editorial published in the same state-run news outlet blamed U.S. sanctions on North Korea for slowing down denuclearization talks. ""[A]dded sanctions pressure will block the path to denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula forever — a result desired by no one,"" it warned.

In a state like North Korea, where the media has no freedom and everyone in the news industry must act in compliance with the state, opinions featured in state-run news outlets are often considered to be the official opinion of the government.

What does this mean for peace talks?

During their June 12 summit in Singapore, President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un signed a declaration that read:

President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

However, since that time multiple reports from news agencies and the United Nations have indicated that North Korea has been continuing to develop its nuclear program, despite promises to the United States. On Dec. 4, national security adviser John Bolton admitted that the Kim regime had ""not lived up to the commitments so far.""

On Dec. 14, Trump tweeted that negotiations with North Korea were ""doing just fine"" and that he was ""in no hurry"" because Kim saw the ""wonderful potential for great economic success"" that would come from such a deal.

If Kim continues to resist giving up his nuclear program, this would be the seventh time that the North Korean regime has agreed to denuclearize and then not followed through. The other six were in 1985, 1992, 1994, 2005, 2007, and 2012.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-says-it-wont-denuclearize-unless-us-removes-its-nuclear-threat-first,2018-12-20
Northwestern journalism school dean rips 'naive' student protesters who complained college paper committed 'sin' of 'doing journalism',"In the wake of Northwestern University's prestigious student newspaper apologizing that its reporters posted ""retraumatizing and invasive"" photos of student protesters at former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' campus speech, the dean of the college's journalism school had quite a bit to say.

Charles Whitaker — who heads the renowned Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern — posted a lengthy statement Tuesday blasting complaining student protesters and telling professional journalists who criticized the Daily Northwestern to give the student journalists ""a break.""

What did the dean say?

Whitaker noted that the paper's coverage of the protest of Sessions's speech was ""in no way beyond the bounds of fair, responsible journalism"" and said he's ""deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering that the students responsible for that coverage have endured for the 'sin' of doing journalism.""

He added that he was approached by ""several student activists who were angered by the fact that they and their peers were depicted on the various platforms of The Daily engaged in the very public act of protesting the Sessions speech"" — and then Whitaker blasted those protesters, saying it's ""naïve, not to mention wrong-headed, to declare, as many of our student activists have, that The Daily staff and other student journalists had somehow violated the personal space of the protestors by reporting on the proceedings, which were conducted in the open and were designed, ostensibly, to garner attention.""

More from Whitaker:

That Daily staffers and other students used social media to track down protestors for comment and to verify facts — another affront, according to The Daily's detractors — is, in my mind and the minds of my colleagues, the kind of industrious reporting and information-gathering that we expect from enterprising reporters. Our young reporters did not root through trash cans, trespass on private property or purloin personal documents. What they tried to do was ask questions and take pictures that they hoped would offer the most accurate account of this wrenching event — one in which the images captured by The Daily's photographers may provide the only evidence of what actually transpired in the interaction between students and campus police. [...]



But I patently reject the notion that our students have no right to report on communities other than those from which they hail, and I will never affirm that students who do not come from marginalized communities cannot understand or accurately convey the struggles of those populations. And, unlike our young charges at The Daily, who in a heartfelt, though not well-considered editorial, apologized for their work on the Sessions story, I absolutely will not apologize for encouraging our students to take on the much-needed and very difficult task of reporting on our life and times at Northwestern and beyond.

Whitaker noted that he understands ""why The Daily editors felt the need to issue their mea culpa. They were beat into submission by the vitriol and relentless public shaming they have been subjected to since the Sessions stories appeared. I think it is a testament to their sensitivity and sense of community responsibility that they convinced themselves that an apology would affect a measure of community healing.""



However, he didn't let the newspaper's staffers off the hook for their apology, either:

I might offer, however, that their well-intentioned gesture sends a chilling message about journalism and its role in society. It suggests that we are not independent authors of the community narrative, but are prone to bowing to the loudest and most influential voices in our orbit. To be sure, journalism has often bowed to the whim and will of the rich and powerful, so some might argue that it is only fair that those who feel dispossessed and disenfranchised have their turn at calling the journalistic shots. But that is not the solution. We need more diversity among our student journalists (and in journalism writ large). We need more voices from different backgrounds in our newsrooms helping to provide perspective on our coverage. But regardless of their own identities, our student journalists must be allowed — and must have the courage — to cover our community freely and unfettered by harassment each time members of the community feel they have been wronged.

He concluded by offering to ""have a dialogue"" with student activists ""about what journalism is and what you might expect when you hold a protest in a public setting."" But he also cautioned them that ""waging war on our students on social media —threatening them both physically and emotionally — is beyond the pale. Our community deserves a more civil level of discourse.""

Whitaker also told the ""swarm of alums and journalists"" who condemned the Daily's apology to ""give the young people a break.""

""I know you feel that you were made of sterner stuff and would have the fortitude and courage of your conviction to fend off the campus critics,"" the dean added to the op-ed's critics. ""But you are not living with them through this firestorm, facing the brutal onslaught of venom and hostility that has been directed their way on weaponized social media. Don't make judgments about them or their mettle until you've walked in their shoes. What they need at this moment is our support and the encouragement to stay the course.""

NPR hit with universal scorn over 'pathetic and insulting' article offering self-care tips for anxiety from war headlines,"An article from National Public Radio was hit with universal scorn because it detailed the self-care people might need in order to deal with the traumatizing headlines from the war in Ukraine.

""Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system,"" read the tweet from NPR on Friday as Ukrainian citizens were defending their country against an overwhelming Russian invasion.

The article from NPR's ""Life Kit"" offered helpful suggestions about self-care while sitting at home reading about brave Ukrainian patriots dying in the streets to protect their families.

""Maybe this is the time that you finally recreate a family recipe, or maybe you learn how to make a prettier pie, or maybe you just lose yourself to a kitsch reorganization,"" read one of their recommendations.

The article was excoriated universally by those from both sides of the political divide.

""The stupidest thing NPR has ever proposed, and that's saying a lot,"" replied Politico columnist Jack Shafer.

""These people really do not envision their audience as grown adults. And maybe there's a reason for that,"" responded Dan McLaughlin of National Review.

""This sort of discourse drives me absolutely bananas and I think it is a direct result of media being increasingly dominated by people from super-privileged backgrounds,"" opined Jesse Singal in a tweet that garnered over 2,300 likes.

""I'm all for mental health awareness and therapeutic care. This thread provides for neither. It's just a lifestyle guide for narcissists,"" tweeted Daily Beast editor Anthony Fisher.

""Ukrainians: must cope with bombs raining down on them. Americans: must cope with hearing sad news. This is really a silly thing for a news organization to do, IMHO,"" said Yale professor Nicholas Christakis.

""The Ukrainian government is handing out AK-47s and NPR is handing out listicles about holistic ways to alleviate your doomscrolling anxiety,"" mused commentator Noam Blum.

""This is pathetic and insulting. You NEED to be stressed and Distressed by atrocity, calamity and tragedy not breathe deeply and bury yourself in pasta,"" said another critic.

While NPR readers sought for self-care, the Ukrainian president warned on Friday that the fate of his country was to be decided soon as Russian forces appeared ready to pounce on Kyiv, their capital city.

Nurse fired after posting photos on social media of infant born with birth defect — and allegedly mocking baby,"A neonatal intensive care nurse who posted photos on social media of an infant born with a birth defect — and allegedly mocked the baby — has been fired, WFOR-TV reported.

What are the details?

Sierra Samuels at first was placed on administrative leave from Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami after she shared the images of the infant on her social media account, the station said.

The caption of the first image read, ""My night was going great then boom!"" WFOR said, adding that the caption of the second image read, ""Your intestines posed [sic] to be inside not outside baby"" and was followed by ""#gastroschisis."" The station showed only the photo caption text.

WFOR said gastroschisis is a birth defect of the belly in which the baby's intestines are exposed. The station's video report accompanying its initial story indicates that the survivability rate of gastroschisis is 90%.

WFOR's initial story about the incident ran in early September; the station's follow-up about the nurse's firing ran Monday. It isn't clear exactly when the nurse posted the images or when she was fired.

More from the station:

Jackson Health System said all its employees go through privacy policy training on a regular basis. It said any potential privacy breach is taken seriously.



A statement from a Jackson Health System representative read, in part, ""Employees who violate these privacy rules, despite being educated, are subject to disciplinary action including suspension or termination. As soon as we learned of this potential breach, we immediately placed this employee under administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.""



Samuels had been with Jackson since 2016.

Jackson Health added to the station that the parent was notified of the breach.

'Certain expectation of privacy'

A Miami litigation attorney told WFOR in its initial story that patient privacy is expected.

""In addition to ... the general HIPAA violation that we'd be looking at here, there's a sense of decency about the rights and expectations we all have in our likenesses and our images,"" David Weinstein explained to the station.

Weinstein added to WFOR that ""with images, you have a certain expectation of privacy, that if you're in an area ... you believe to be private and in this case a hospital, even more so.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nurse-fired-after-posting-photos-on-social-media-of-infant-born-with-birth-defect-and-allegedly-mocking-baby,2021-10-04
"NY Times declares President Trump is right that there's a crisis at the border, calls on Congress to give him 'his border money'","The New York Times editorial board published an editorial Sunday calling on Congress to ""give [President Donald] Trump his border money.""

While they may not be on board with the idea of a border wall, they did admit that the current border facilities were in danger of being overwhelmed by the massive influx of people illegally crossing into the United States.

Wait...what did they say?

The editors acknowledged that a border crisis exists, but they don't view it in the same way Trump does.

""President Trump is right: There is a crisis at the southern border. Just not the one he rants about,"" the editors said at the start of the piece, immediately setting the tone.

While the sheer number of people surging toward the border is undeniable, Trump has said that he views their entry to the U.S. as an ""invasion"" while the Times sees them as refugees in need of assistance.

The editors noted that the number of arrests by Border Patrol agents are rising, while at the same time the number of resources, including beds in detention facilities, has failed to keep up with demand.

""Most urgently,"" they wrote, ""the program that deals with unaccompanied minors is expected to run dry next month, requiring resources to be diverted from other programs and leading to a further deterioration in conditions,"" the editors said.

Specifically, the editors wrote this piece to express their support for the Trump administration's latest request for $4.5 billion in emergency border funding. This funding comes with something they believe is desperately needed: Most of it would go toward humanitarian programs, including the office in charge of handling unaccompanied children who enter the U.S. illegally.

""None of the money,"" the Times noted reassuringly, ""would go toward Mr. Trump's border wall.""

What else?

The editors worried that without this funding, the Trump administration's tough stance on detaining illegal immigrants would strain the existing detention system to a breaking point. The editors warned Democrats to keep their ""tinkering"" with the specifics of this funding request ""as narrow and targeted as possible,"" arguing that the White House would have to meet a few conditions of its own if it was ""serious about needing the money.""

""Both sides"" the paper argued, ""need to dial back the fighting words, resist the temptation to finger-point and find a creative way through this minefield.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-times-trump-right-border-crisis,2019-05-06
Obama releases statement about mass murder attacks — and takes a shot at Trump,"Former President Barack Obama is being praised by many on the left for a statement he made about the mass murder attacks over the weekend, including a veiled shot at President Donald Trump.

Obama offered condolences to the families of the murdered and injured, and then advocated for more gun control legislation.

""No other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do,"" the former president wrote.

""Every time this happens, we're told that tougher gun laws won't stop all murders,"" he continued, ""that they won't stop every deranged individual from getting a weapon and shooting innocent people in public places. But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings. They can save some families from heartbreak.

""We are not helpless here,"" Obama added. ""And until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening.""

Obama went on to state that law enforcement needs to do a better job of monitoring white supremacist hate groups.

""We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don't look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people,"" he added.

""Such language isn't new – it's been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history, here in America and around the world. It is at the root of slavery and Jim Crow, the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. It has no place in our politics and our public life,"" he said.

""And it's time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much,"" Obama concluded, ""clearly and unequivocally.""

Many saw the description of leaders who ""demonize"" immigrants to imply a criticism of Trump over his comments calling the influx of migrants an ""invasion.""

"Ocasio-Cortez says calling the migrant crisis a 'surge' is white supremacy, but she should have checked her tweets","Socialist firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) should have checked her own tweets before claiming that the use of the word ""surge"" is a white supremacist philosophy.

Ocasio-Cortez went off on the use of the term when referring to the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border during an Instagram Live ask-me-anything session on Tuesday.

The question was posted to the screen and read, ""Why are you not addressing the border crisis and the kids in cages like you used to?""

""Are you for real?!"" she replied emphatically.

Ocasio-Cortez has been criticized by many for appearing to be much more incensed about ""kids in cages"" at the border during the former Trump administration than the current administration under President Joe Biden.

""Well, first of all, just — gut check. Stop. Anyone who's using the term 'surge' around you, consciously, is trying to invoke a militaristic frame,"" she continued after blaming the migrant crisis on the prison system, trade inequalities, and global warming.

""And that's a problem, because this is not a surge, these are children,"" she added. ""And they are not insurgents and we are not being invaded! Which, by the way, is a white supremacist idea philosophy. The idea that if an other is coming in the population that this is an invasion of who we are.""

Ocasio-Cortez didn't explain why she was talking about the word ""surge"" when it wasn't in the original question, but nevertheless, she also didn't seem to think that using the same word would be problematic when she used it in reference to voters.

""The hoarding of wealth by the few is coming at the cost of peoples' lives. The only way we change is with a massive surge of *new* voters at the polls,' she tweeted in 2019 in reference to elections in the United Kingdom.

It was not immediately clear if Ocasio-Cortez was using the word in a ""militaristic frame"" when referring to new voters, or whether she was also guilty of applying ""white supremacist idea philosophy.""

"Ohio Senate candidates Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel exchange blows in GOP debate, JD Vance earns massive lead in post-debate straw poll","A Friday debate between Republican Senate candidates in Ohio intensified primary rivalries as candidates exchanged jabs and confronted each other over their political bona fides.

Prior to the event, candidate Mike Gibbons, who is currently leading in the polls, implied that he was cautiously optimistic about his current lead over other candidates. He told TheBlaze, ""You never know until Election Day, but we feel confident.""

The event, sponsored by FreedomWorks, had more than 900 RSVPs, according to event staffers, and was intense from the outset as candidate Josh Mandel used his introductory remarks to attack Mike Gibbons's alleged business dealings with China.

The evening's first question — regarding the U.S.'s relationship with Russia and China — brought tensions to a boiling point as Mandel once again used his permitted time to speak to criticize Gibbons for doing business with China.

Gibbons's responded to Mandel by criticizing him for never having worked in the private sector.

""You may not understand this,"" Gibbons said, ""Because you've never been in the private sector in your entire life.""

Mandel responded by standing up and getting in Gibbons's face to tout his time in the military, saying: ""I understand fully, I've worked. Two tours in Iraq, don't tell me I haven't worked.""

The Gibbons campaign released a statement about the confrontation that said, ""Josh Mandel is unhinged, unfit and flailing – because he's losing. He is only a professional at one thing: running for office. He is hellbent on lying because he is failing.""



It continued, ""We can't leave this race to child-like candidates. We need an adult in the room, and Josh Mandel has proven that he is not capable of being that for Ohioans.""

After the brief kerfuffle, candidate JD Vance criticized Mandel for using his military service as a political credential.

Vance said, ""I think the way you use the U.S. Marine Corps, Josh, is disgraceful.""

Whereas the other candidates worked to propose policy solutions to the questions they were posed, Mandel appeared more focused on reducing Gibbons's lead in the polls by attacking his business record.

His attacks on Gibbons continued throughout the night as he appeared to be reading off a fact sheet containing information on Gibbons's financial dealings and FEC filings.

However, Mandel's strategy and Gibbons's subsequent rebuttals favored neither candidate as FreedomWorks's official post-debate straw poll overwhelmingly favored JD Vance's performance.

Vance believes that the poll's results are due to him focusing on issues that actually affect the average Ohio voter.

He said, ""While others made a mockery of themselves with their phony tough guy antics, I focused on engaging with the voters, honing in on the real problems that Ohioans face and providing true solutions that may make life better for working- and middle-class Americans. This clearly resonated with the crowd, and I am proud to have earned this kind of support from the attendees.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ohio-senate-candidates-mike-gibbons-and-josh-mandel-exchange-blows-in-gop-debate-jd-vance-wins-straw-poll,2022-03-19
Oil prices reach highest levels in more than a decade as Russian aggression intensifies,"As markets opened Wednesday morning, U.S. oil prices reached highs not seen in more than a decade.

Futures for the international benchmark Brent crude listed prices as more than $113.58 a barrel, CNBC said.

The Washington Examiner reported that futures for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate increased by 8% trading at $112 per barrel.

This is the highest that oil has traded since 2011.

The increase in oil costs come after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its oil-producing allies agreed to hold production rates steady.

OPEC and its allies will increase output in April by 400,000 barrels per day as Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine causes supply shortage fears.

John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital and former energy executive, said, “There’s no respite. This is a dramatic moment for the market and the world and supplies. It’s clear the world is going to have to stand up to Russia by foreclosing its oil exports.”

Ed Moya, a market analyst, said, “Crude prices can’t stop going higher as a very right oil market will likely see further risk to supplies as the War in Ukraine unfold. Brent crude could surge to the $120 level if the oil market starts to think it is likely that sanctions will be placed on Russian energy.”

In a move to reduce Western dependence on Russian and OPEC oil, members of the International Energy Agency announced plans to release 60 million barrels of oil reserves in an effort to combat the soaring price of oil.

The United States, in particular, will release 30 million barrels.

Nevertheless, this announcement did little to quell anxieties about soaring energy costs.

Goldman Sachs wrote, “We do not view this as sufficient relief. Demand destruction — through still higher prices — is now likely the only sufficient rebalancing mechanism, with supply elasticity no longer relevant in the face of such a potential large and immediate supply shock.”

WTI and Brent are both up more than 40% year to date as demand for oil remains the same, or rises, while supply grows increasingly constrained.

The energy investment group RBC said, “We think [OPEC] will likely stay the course with the current easing schedule and avoid wading into the deepening security crisis involving the group co-chair Russia.”

Russia is one of the world’s largest producer and exporters of natural gas. Despite allied Western nations issuing heavy sanctions on Russia, the country’s energy sector has largely been unaffected.

In 2014, oil prices rose to just over $100 a barrel as supply fears rose following the Russian invasion of Crimea.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oil-prices-reach-highest-levels-in-more-than-a-decade-as-russian-aggression-intensifies,2022-03-02
Oil prices surge to highest level since 2014 amid war in Europe,"The price of oil jumped Thursday to its highest level since 2014 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine, with the international benchmark Brent crude surpassing $100 a barrel ahead of expected disruptions in the global energy supply.

Crude oil reached a high of $105.79 per barrel Thursday morning, rising more than 8% since the hostilities began. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures increased more than 8% to trade at $99.46 — also the highest level in eight years.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack on Ukraine by land, sea, and air early Thursday after building up more than 150,000 troops along the country's borders. The invasion began days after Putin illegally recognized two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states, claiming Ukraine's government was committing ""genocide"" against ethnic Russians there as a pretext to send Russian soldiers to war.

Ukraine is now embroiled in war, and Western governments are preparing to impose severe economic sanctions on Russia to punish Putin.

President Joe Biden met with G-7 ministers Thursday morning and will deliver remarks sometime Thursday afternoon to announce the new actions the United States will take against Russia.

Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and one of the largest exporters of oil. The impact of war, and of punitive sanctions against Russia, is expected to continue to drive energy prices up as the situation in Eastern Europe remains uncertain.

“At this stage it is anything but clear what could bring the Russian president to his senses, therefore the situation, the equity and oil markets will remain volatile,” PVM Oil Associates senior analyst Tamas Varga said Thursday, CNBC reported.

“Even if prices drop back below $100/bbl due to abating tension in Eastern Europe, the retracement might prove short-lived and product tightness could keep oil prices at elevated levels in months to come,” he added.

Increasing prices for crude oil will mean Americans are going to pay more for gas. Already the average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3.53 this week, the highest average since 2014, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

Biden warned in a speech Tuesday that energy prices will continue to rise as the U.S. levies additional sanctions on Russia.

“As I said last week, defending freedom will have costs, for us as well and here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that. But as we do this, I'm going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oil-prices-surge-to-highest-level-since-2014-amid-war-in-europe,2022-02-24
"One officer charged in Breonna Taylor's death, mayor implements 72-hour curfew to limit potential riots","One former Louisville Metropolitan Police Department officer was charged Wednesday in the death of Breonna Taylor, with the two other involved officers avoiding charges altogether, USA Today reported.

Former LMPD Sgt. Brett Hankison was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for allegedly firing his gun recklessly into Taylor's apartment on March 13 during an overnight drug raid. Hankison was fired from the department in June for his actions that night.

The charges are reportedly not directly related to Taylor's death; rather, they were tied to the fact that Hankison allegedly shot into surrounding apartments.

The other two officers, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, had been placed on administrative leave, but were still with the department.

First degree wanton endangerment is defined as follows:

A person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the first degree when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person.

The charge is a class D felony that carries a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison.

When the three officers charged into Taylor's apartment around 1 a.m. March 13, Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot at them. The officers were not in uniform, and Walker said he thought it was a home invasion. Walker shot Mattingly in the leg. The three officers returned fire with more than 20 shots. Taylor was shot five times.

Attorney General Daniel Cameron said that despite reports that it was a no-knock raid, the officers did knock and announce themselves before entering the apartment.

The city of Louisville paid a settlement of $12 million to Taylor's family as part of a civil lawsuit.

Louisville officials had been preparing for unrest after this announcement, as protesters have been calling for the firing and arrest of all three officers involved in the shooting since May. The mayor established a 72 hour curfew effective Wednesday night from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. each day. The LMPD declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, canceling officers' time off requests and extending their hours.

There is already some indication of dissatisfaction with the charge. From the Associated Press:

Immediately after the announcement, people were expressing frustration that the grand jury did not do more.



""Justice has NOT been served,"" tweeted Linda Sarsour of Until Freedom, a group that has pushed for charges in the case. ""Rise UP. All across this country. Everywhere. Rise up for #BreonnaTaylor.""



Protests began shortly after the announcement.

Pat Robertson warns that Trump might lose the 'mandate of heaven' if he abandons Kurds in Syria,"Evangelical leader Pat Robertson told his sizable audience that President Donald Trump might lose the ""mandate of heaven"" for announcing that U.S. troops would abandon northern Syria to Turkish forces.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say right now, I am absolutely appalled that the United States is going to betray those Democratic forces in northern Syria, that we possibly gonna allow the Turks to come in against the Kurds,"" Robertson said.

""Erdogan is a thug, he has taken control of his country as a dictator. He is a strong leader and you say he's an ally of America, it is nonsense, he is in for himself.""

Robertson cited the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudis as another contemptible event that the president did nothing to censure.

""And the president who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks,"" he continued.

""And I believe, and I want to say this with great solemnity,"" he added, ""the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.""

Trump has faced a great deal of criticism for the announcement that U.S. forces would leave Syria in anticipation of an invasion of the military by Turkey. Critics fear that Erdogan, the leader of Turkey, is simply targeting the Kurds, who valiantly fought against ISIS with U.S. backing.

""We want to bring our troops back from these endless wars,"" the president said Monday in defending his decision.

The latest update provides new details about the bizarre home invasion and attack have surfaced.

An intruder breaks into Nancy Pelosi's house

Early Friday morning, David DePape reportedly was able to break into the home of Nancy Pelosi – the third person in line for the presidency.

ABC News reported, ""Depape allegedly entered the house through a sliding glass door, law enforcement sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.""

However, aerial footage above the alleged crime scene shows shattered glass near the handle of a swinging door. The video shows two swinging doors open at the home in the exclusive Pacific Heights neighborhood.

The alleged intruder confronted Paul Pelosi and is said to have asked, ""Where is Nancy?""

House Speaker Pelosi was not in San Francisco at the time of the break-in, she was in Washington, D.C.

CNN reported, ""The man who assaulted Paul Pelosi tried to tie him up 'until Nancy got home,' according to two sources familiar with the situation.""

Pelosi was allegedly able to distance himself from the home invader by telling him that he needed to use the bathroom. The suspect reportedly allowed Pelosi to use the bathroom during the home invasion. Pelosi then called 911.

Politico reported, ""Paul Pelosi was able to dial 911 himself after telling the intruder he had to go use the bathroom and then calling from there, where his phone had been charging, according to a person familiar with the situation.""

The Independent reported, ""The operator heard Mr. Pelosi asking: 'What’s going on? Why are you here? What are you doing to me?'""

However, the police dispatcher reportedly informed police officers that the reporting person of the incident at the Pelosi residence told them, ""There is a male in the home and that he is going to wait for his wife. However, he stated that he doesn't know who the male is but that his name is 'David 'and that he is a friend.""

In the audio, the dispatcher noted that the reporting person – Paul Pelosi – ""sounded somewhat confused.""

Police witness hammer attack on Paul Pelosi

At 2:27 a.m., police officers arrived at the Pelosi home for ""priority well-being check,"" according to San Francisco Police Chief William Scott.

Responding officers knocked on the front door of the house, and it was ""opened by someone inside,"" according to Scott.

Officers ""observed Mr. Pelosi and Mr. Depape each with one hand on a single hammer.""

“The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it,” Scott said. “Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup and rendered medical aid.”

The 82-year-old Pelosi was taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, where he successfully underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and ""serious injuries to right arm and hands.""

Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill said on Friday evening, ""His doctors expect a full recovery.""

DePape remained in the hospital as of Friday evening, according to Scott.

Who is David DePape?

DePape is reportedly a hemp jewelry maker and a former nudist from British Columbia, Canada.

The latest voting records from years ago show DePape as a Green Party supporter.

A website alleged to have been created by DePape questioned the 2020 election results, mentioned ""global elite ruling class,"" censorship, aliens, antigovernmental sentiments, and anti-Semitism. The website features videos from YouTuber Jimmy Dore – a progressive commentator and supporter of Bernie Sanders.

DePape does not mention Nancy Pelosi at all on his alleged website.

DePape, 42, lived in a school bus in Berkeley, according to the New York Post. The bus sits in the yard of the home of his ex-lover – San Francisco pro-nudist activist Gypsy Taub. The former couple allegedly share three children.

There is an LGBTQ pride flag featuring marijuana plants in the yard and the house has a sign that reads: ""Berkeley Stands UNITED Against Hate."" The bus has a sign that reads: ""You are beautiful.""

San Francisco DA proclaims suspect will be ""held accountable""

Authorities are still determining a motive for the attack.

Scott said on Friday, ""This was not a random act. This was intentional.""

“It’s wrong. Our elected officials are here to do the business of their cities, their counties, their states and this nation,"" he added. ""Their families don’t sign up for this to be harmed and it is wrong.”

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins tweeted Friday evening, ""We are coordinating closely with federal and local law enforcement partners on this investigation. We will bring forward multiple felony charges on Monday and expect DePape to be arraigned on Tuesday. DePape will be held accountable for his heinous crimes.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/paul-pelosi-hammer-attack-david-depape-update,2022-10-29
"Paul Pelosi answered door when police arrived, then walked back toward his assailant and away from officers, didn't tell cops he was in danger: NBC News","Editors note: Hours after running the story, NBC yanked the article from the Today Show website and deleted the corresponding tweet. NBC News said: ""The piece should not have aired because it did not meet NBC News reporting standards."" TheBlaze has reached out to NBC News for comment.

NBC News reported new details about the moments when police officers arrived at the home of Paul and Nancy Pelosi. Strangely, Paul Pelosi answered the door, but did not inform officers that he was in danger, according to a new report. Instead of retreating to police officers, Pelosi reportedly walked back to the alleged home invader – who was wielding a hammer.

David DePape, 42, is accused of breaking into the San Francisco home and attacking Pelosi with a hammer.

During the home invasion, Pelosi was reportedly able to go to the bathroom – where his cell phone was charging – and call 911.

""Uh, he thinks everything's good. Uh, I've got a problem, but he thinks everything's good,"" Pelosi told the 911 dispatcher – who suggested that he call back ""if he changed his mind.""

Pelosi responded, ""No, no, no, this gentleman just, uh, came into the house, uh, and he wants to wait for my wife to come home.""

""He's telling me I'm being very lazy, so I've got to stop talking to you,"" Pelosi said to the dispatcher. ""No, he wants me to get the hell off the phone.""

Court documents said DePape ""threatened to tie up Mr. Pelosi about 10 times.""

Police responded to a ""high-priority call"" and arrived at the home at 2:27 a.m. last Friday.

NBC News reported, ""Officers were unaware that it was the home of the House speaker.""

Police purportedly performed a ""knock and announce."" Pelosi opened the door for the officers.

""The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or try to leave his home,"" according to NBC News. ""But instead, he began walking several feet back into the foyer, toward the assailant and away from police.""

The sources noted that police did not know if Pelosi was already injured or what his mental state was.

An officer asked the two men what was going on in the home.

According to court documents, DePape smiled and said, ""Everything's good.""

Seconds later, a struggle ensued, and then DePape hit Pelosi in the head with the hammer, according to police. Cops quickly tackled DePape.

Pelosi was reportedly lying in a puddle of his own blood after the hammer attack. He was unconscious for about three minutes, according to court documents.

Pelosi was rushed to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured skull. Pelosi was released from the hospital on Thursday, six days after the attack.

Authorities say Pelosi and DePape were alone inside the San Francisco home for 30 minutes before police arrived. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the attack.

Court documents stated that there were Ring security cameras ""everywhere"" at the Pelosi home in Pacific Heights.

The break-in was allegedly captured by video cameras that are usually monitored by Capitol Police, but officers were not watching the live feed at the time of the home invasion of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

The Washington Post reported, ""The officer in D.C. quickly pulled up additional camera angles from around Pelosi’s home and began to backtrack, watching recordings from the minutes before San Francisco police arrived. There, on camera, was a man with a hammer, breaking a glass panel and entering the speaker’s home, according to three people familiar with how Capitol Police learned of the break-in and who have been briefed on or viewed the video themselves.""

On Wednesday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said access to some of the evidence, like police bodycam video and Pelosi's 911 call, would not be released to the public, but instead would be ""limited"" to family members.

""That meeting is happening today, so limited members are able to view that footage so that they can have certain questions in their mind answered. But it’s a very limited number of family members, and that should be going on as we speak,"" Jenkins told CNN.

CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Jenkins if it is in the ""public's interest"" to release evidence in the case to the public.

Jenkins responded, ""For us, revealing that evidence through the media is just not what we think is appropriate. We want to make sure that this individual is held accountable for these egregious acts. For us, we’re going to make sure that we limit the evidence as much as possible in order to get that done,"" she added.

DePape was charged by the state with attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, and threats to a public official and her family.

According to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Northern District of California, DePape is also facing federal charges, with one count of assault of an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, which has a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. He is charged with one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties, which has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Nancy Pelosi calls Republican Congressmembers enemies within,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) must not have heard President Joe Biden's repeated calls for ""unity."" Pelosi blasted her colleagues, even going so far as to disparage Republican lawmakers, claiming ""the enemy is within the House of Representatives.""

During her weekly news conference, Pelosi addressed several topics, including the impeachment of former President Donald Trump, past remarks by Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and the possibility of adding more security at the U.S. Capitol to protect Democrats against GOP Congress members.

""I do believe, and I have said this all along, that we will probably need a supplemental for more security for members when the enemy is within the House of Representatives, a threat that members are concerned about in addition to what is happening outside,"" Pelosi told reporters Thursday.

When asked to clarify what she meant by ""the enemy"" within, Pelosi doubled down by saying, ""It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.""





Freshman Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert from Colorado sparked the debate on if politicians should be permitted to carry firearms at the Capitol building ever since she won her election in November and promised to bring her gun to Washington, D.C.

A 1967 regulation allows Congress to carry a firearm into their office, but, are prohibited from bringing weapons into the House chamber and other nearby areas.

The Capitol riots on Jan. 6 brought on far more stringent security in the building. Some Democrats have since claimed that they are terrified of their GOP colleagues, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who said, ""We still don't yet feel safe around other members of Congress.""

AOC mentioned Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who reportedly attempted to enter the House chamber, but was allegedly denied access after his firearm in his suit coat set off a metal detector.

Republicans Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) were thankful that they were armed during the storming of the Capitol.

""Fortunately, I was armed, so we would have been able to protect ourselves,"" Cawthorn said.



Massie explained, ""The next member who argues Congressmen shouldn't be allowed to carry firearms at work needs to be laughed out of the Capitol. Several of us were glad to be armed while barricaded for hours in our offices with our staff.""



During Thursday's news conference, Pelosi had stern words for Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) regarding her past comments questioning deadly school shootings. Pelosi blasted Republican leadership in the House of Representatives for assigning Greene to the Education Committee.

""Who was willing to overlook, ignore those statements,"" Pelosi said. ""When she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school, at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, what could they be thinking or thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling and I think that the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children.""



A spokesperson for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told The Hill, ""These comments are deeply disturbing and Leader McCarthy plans to have a conversation with the Congresswoman about them.""

Democrats have introduced a resolution to have Greene expelled from the House of Representatives.

Pelosi was also asked about the GameStop stock situation, which she deemed as ""interesting.""



""Interesting, isn't it? I understand that the administration is taking a look, the SEC is taking a look at what that is. But we'll all be reviewing it, but interesting. It's interesting, yeah.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-republicans-enemy-within-capitol,2021-01-28
Pentagon: ISIS will regain ground in Syria when US troops leave and will play troop withdrawal as a 'victory',"The Pentagon's Office of Inspector General released a report Monday that said ISIS is likely to try to leverage the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria as a ""victory,"" CNN reported. It also said that ISIS is likely to regain territory after the U.S. leaves.

What's the story?

On Monday, the Pentagon's Inspector General for the U.S. military mission in Syria, which is dubbed Operation Inherent Resolve, released a quarterly report covering the time period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31.

According to the report, U.S. Central Command said:

ISIS may conduct opportunistic attacks on U.S. personnel as they withdraw but will leverage the event as a ""victory"" in its media. ISIS remains an active insurgent group in both Iraq and Syria. If Sunni socio-economic, political, and sectarian grievances are not adequately addressed by the national and local governments of Iraq and Syria it is very likely that ISIS will have the opportunity to set conditions for future resurgence and territorial control. Currently, ISIS is regenerating key functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria, but absent sustained [counterterrorism] pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory in the [Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV)].

On Dec. 19, the Trump administration announced that it would be pulling all U.S. forces from Syria. In a tweet that same day, President Donald Trump declared, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency.""

What else did the report say?



The report also mentioned that Turkish attacks against Kurdish positions were causing U.S. Kurdish allies to pull away from fighting ISIS in order to defend its own territory. While the Kurds have proven themselves to be invaluable in the fight against ISIS in both Syria and Iraq, Turkey views all Kurds as terrorists because of the actions of an ethnically Kurdish militant group inside its own borders.

In June, the U.S. and Turkey agreed to a deal called the ""Manbij Roadmap"" in order to prevent a Turkish invasion of the strategic Kurdish city of Manbij. The report said that when U.S. troops withdraw, it is ""unclear what would occur with the Manbij agreement.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-report-isis-us-troop-withdrawal,2019-02-04
Pentagon: Reluctant Russian troops are punching holes in their vehicle gas tanks to get out of fighting,"Hampered by logistics problems, including lack of fuel and food, some Russian troops in Ukraine are reportedly surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

In some cases, entire Russian units have laid down their arms and surrendered without a fight after encountering stiff resistance from Ukrainian troops, a senior Pentagon official said, according to the New York Times. The official indicated that a significant number of Russian troops are young recruits who have been poorly trained and were not prepared for the full-scale invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. There are even reports that some Russian soldiers have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles' gas tanks, in what the U.S. official characterized as an attempt to avoid combat.

The Times reported that the Pentagon declined to say how military intelligence gathered this information, but it is presumed that statements from captured Russian soldiers or intercepted Russian communications played a role. There is no indication of how widespread these surrenders are.

But reluctant combatants may be one reason why Russia's advance into Ukraine has stalled, U.S. officials said.

Other reasons have to do with the reported shortages of fuel and food and with logistics problems that have prevented a nearly 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles from arriving at the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Pentagon officials said. Additionally, Ukraine's military is still organized and defending the country, and Ukrainian civilians have been armed and have joined the fight, engaging the Russians and attacking supply chains that are crucial to the war effort.

The U.S. officials indicated that Russian commanders leading the convoy may also be ""regrouping and rethinking"" their strategy, with a renewed push to put Kyiv under siege and capture the capital to come in the next several days.

“They have a lot of power available to them,” the Pentagon official said, noting that 80% of the more than 150,000 troops Russia had amassed along Ukraine's border over many months are now participating in the invasion.

Though Russia has vastly superior manpower and firepower, U.S. officials have been surprised by the apparent ""risk-averse behavior"" of Russia's forces, the Pentagon official said. The official noted, for example, that when the Russians launched an invasion from the Sea of Azov to capture the port city of Mariupol, they landed troops 40 miles from the city. The distance allowed the Russians more time to prepare their attack, but in turn gave the city time to mount a defense.

The Pentagon official also observed that Russia's reputably strong air force has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, as Ukrainian fighter jets, Stinger anti aircraft missiles, and other anti-air weapons are harassing the Russian warplanes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-russian-troops-punching-holes-in-gas-tanks-get-out-of-fighting,2022-03-01
Peter Doocy bluntly fact-checks Biden's claim that no one 'f***s' with him: OPEC+ has 'done just that',"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy swiftly fact-checked President Joe Biden's viral claim that no one ""f***s"" with him.

Wait, what did Biden say?

While visiting Florida on Wednesday to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Ian, Biden was caught on a hot mic telling Fort Myers Beach Mayor Ray Murphy that he is untouchable.

""No one f***s with a Biden,"" the president said.

""Yeah, you’re goddamn right,"" Murphy responded.

What did Doocy say?

Reporting on OPEC's decision to slash oil production, Doocy made it clear that Biden's declaration is flatly untrue. In fact, OPEC has ""done just that,"" Doocy explained.

OPEC+, the global oil cartel, is slashing oil production by 2 million barrels per day, a decision Doocy said ""could make inflation in America worse while giving Russia a way to minimize the impact of global sanctions.""

OPEC+ voted to cut production to better control global oil prices.

Specifically, OPEC's decision is a thorn in the Biden's side because he flew to Saudi Arabia this summer to personally petition officials there to increase oil production as the West faced record-high gas prices.

Some OPEC members agreed to increase production after Biden's trip, but Wednesday's vote obviously erases those promises.

Not only does the decision undermine Biden's foreign policy prowess and America's standing as a world leader, but gas prices could spike with less product on the global market — a possibility over which Democrats are panicking. If gas prices increase again, Democrats are likely to suffer heavy losses in the 2022 midterm elections.

The White House responded by saying Biden is ""disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.""

Now, Biden may be turning to Venezuela for help.

The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday the Biden administration is willing to ease sanctions on the Nicolás Maduro regime to allow Chevron to begin pumping oil in Venezuela.

The deal, which may ultimately fall through the cracks, is politically risky. Moreover, if it is successful, the deal ""would put only a limited amount of new oil on the world market in the short term,"" the Journal noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-biden-opec,2022-10-06
Fox News reporter catches WH press secretary in contradiction over admission by treasury secretary on the inflation crisis,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was confronted Wednesday over Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's admission that she was wrong about inflation.

What did Yellen say?

Yellen told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday what most Americans have known for months: The Biden administration's claim that inflation would be temporary was horribly wrong.

""I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" Yellen said. ""As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn't — at the time — didn't fully understand, but we recognize that now.""

What happened with Jean-Pierre?

During the press briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Jean-Pierre about inflation and Yellen's revealing admission.

""When are you guys going to admit that you were wrong about inflation?"" Doocy asked. ""The treasury secretary says that she was wrong, so why doesn't anybody here at the White House?""

Jean-Pierre responded by absolving the Biden administration of any responsibility for ongoing economic woes, like record-high gas prices and the inflation crisis.

Instead, Jean-Pierre blamed ""inflationary pressures which couldn't have been foreseen,"" Russia, and COVID-19 while simultaneously spouting talking points that would make it seem that no economic problems exist.

06/01/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

In response, Doocy highlighted the glaring contradiction in Jean-Pierre's response.

""Just that I understand: the treasury secretary says that she was wrong, but the White House was not wrong about inflation?"" Doocy followed up.

Jean-Pierre, however, was not interested in directly answering the question. ""Those are your words, not my words,"" she charged, before again absolving the Biden administration from any responsibility.



""We have achieved an historic recovery through an extraordinarily unprecedented economic moment. The president has consistently noted that the primary drivers of inflation are the pandemic and Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""The twists and turns of both these monumental events have affected energy prices and also food prices that we have seen these past several months.""



""This is Putin's price hike, which the president refers to, and that is what Secretary Yellen was referring to if you — if you read the entire transcript. And that's what I'm trying to say to you,"" she added. ""Hopefully that lands.""

Unfortunately for the White House, Americans don't buy what Biden is selling.

Importantly, inflation and gas prices were a problem before the Ukraine war, and economists generally agree that a COVID relief package passed last spring, which injected more money into the economy, exacerbated inflation.

Bankers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in fact, have pointed out that while inflation has been a problem for developed countries post-COVID lockdowns, inflation in the U.S. far outpaced those countries, proving domestic policies drove our inflation problems.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-confronts-karine-jean-pierre-inflation-janet-yellen-admission,2022-06-02
Philadelphia Eagles star defensive tackle Fletcher Cox uses shotgun to scare off violent home intruder,"Philadelphia Eagles star defensive tackle Fletcher Cox stands 6-feet, 4-inches tall and tips the scales at 310 pounds.

He's a four-time Pro Bowler and was a first-team all-pro last season — which means he usually manhandles other giant players in trenches every Sunday.

But when a violent intruder tried to force his way into Cox's New Jersey home last week, he apparently didn't mess around by sacking him to the turf. No, instead Cox grabbed his shotgun — and then the suspect ran off, WPVI-TV reported.

What are the details?

Corbyn Nyemah showed up at Cox's Mullica Hill home in search of his ex-girlfriend, the station said, citing court records. Nyemah allegedly damaged her vehicle before throwing rocks through the home's front door in an attempt to forcibly enter, WPVI said. ESPN said his ex-girlfriend was staying at Cox's home.

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

Court records also said surveillance cameras at Cox's home captured Nyemah walking around the property's exterior with a baseball bat and trying to enter the garage multiple times, the station added.



WPVI said that Cox armed himself with a shotgun and then called police saying a man was trying to break into his home. At that point Nyemah fled in his Porsche SUV, the station reported.

A police pursuit began, but due to ""erratic driving and identification of the suspect"" the chase ended at the Commodore Barry Bridge, WPVI noted, citing the Affidavit of Probable Cause. The bridge spans the Delaware River between southern New Jersey and Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 minutes south of Philadelphia.

U.S. Marshals captured Nyemah late last week, the station said, adding that he posted bond — after which WPVI caught up with him outside his home. The station said Nyemah wouldn't comment about specifics but said much of what is in the criminal complaint is true.

Nyemah said he wanted to talk to his ex-girlfriend and believed they were working on rekindling their romance, WPVI noted, adding that his former girlfriend was granted a temporary restraining order.



He allegedly texted her a photo while brandishing a firearm after the police pursuit, the station said, adding that he's expected to appear in court later this month.

The suspect is said to have caused over $2,000 in damages to Cox's home, ESPN noted.

What did the Eagles have to say?

""The police are handling it,"" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said Wednesday, according to ESPN. ""It's a personal issue, so I'm out of it.""

Cox missed practice with an illness on the same date as the alleged incident, the sports network reported, adding that Pederson said his absence was ""unrelated to that.""

""We do our best to protect our players here on premise, but obviously they have personal lives, and we all have personal lives, and things are going to come up,"" the coach added, according to ESPN. ""And so we do the best we can to educate our players and try to protect them the best we can.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/philadelphia-eagles-star-defensive-tackle-fletcher-cox-uses-shotgun-to-scare-off-violent-home-intruder,2019-10-23
Philadelphia Inquirer says Biden not to blame for high gas prices,"The Philadelphia Inquirer editorial board is telling people not to attribute soaring gas prices to President Joe Biden.

In a piece titled ""Don’t blame Biden for higher gas prices,"" the editorial board pointed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as supply and demand factors related to the COVID-19 downturn as reasons for the high cost of fuel.

""Current pump prices are due largely to the basic economics of supply and demand. Much of the global economy shut down during the pandemic, and oil prices plummeted as demand evaporated virtually overnight,"" the piece states. ""As demand dried up, oil companies cut back on production and exploration. When the economy bounced back, demand for oil increased but production has not been able to keep pace. With demand far outstripping supply, prices have skyrocketed.""

The piece said that Biden's Build Back Better spending proposal contained ""tax credits for wind and solar power"" and ""an extension of Biden’s child tax credit, which provided $300 in monthly payments to help struggling families, which could offset some of the pain they're feeling at the pump.""



""Voters wanting to cast blame might want to turn their attention to Sen. Joe Manchin (D.-W.Va.) and the Republicans in the House and Senate who opposed efforts to boost green energy and support the child tax credit. These high gas prices aren’t Joe Biden’s fault,"" the editorial board declared.

Biden has urged Congress to suspend the federal gas tax. Such a move would not lead to substantial savings for financially beleaguered drivers because the federal gas tax is a bit higher than 18 cents per gallon, while the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas was $4.94 as of Thursday.

""Make no mistake about it, President Biden's assault on our energy industry has caused gas prices to skyrocket in Pennsylvania and harmed thousands of jobs across the country,"" tweeted Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican who is currently running for a U.S. Senate seat in the Keystone State.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/philadelphia-inquirer-dont-blame-biden,2022-06-24
"NATO to convene emergency session after suspected Russian missile lands in Poland, killing 2 citizens","Tensions were significantly heightened in eastern Europe after a suspected Russian missile landed in Poland and killed two Polish civilians as the war in Ukraine continued into its eighth month.

A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed the lethal missile strike on Tuesday on the NATO ally.

The strike was reported in the city of Przewodów, on the border with Ukraine.

The Russian defense ministry issued a statement denying responsibility for the incident and calling it a ""deliberate provocation"" in order to escalate hostilities in the region.

President Joe Biden said in a tweet from his official social media account that he had met with the Polish president to discuss the incident.

""I spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland to express my deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland and offer our full support for Poland's investigation of the explosion,"" Biden tweeted. ""We will remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as it proceeds.""

When he was asked by reporters if he could say what he knew about the explosion, however, he simply responded, ""No.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded by issuing a forceful statement by video.

“Hitting NATO territory with missiles,"" he said. ""This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a really significant escalation. Action is needed.""

Poland convened an emergency national security meeting leading to some concern over whether the missile attack would trigger Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all members.

Ukraine celebrated the retreat of Russian troops from the key city of Kherson in the last few days before the missile explosion. Some suspected the missile attack could be retaliation for the retreat.

Poland and other states bordering Russia have been on alert since the start of the Ukraine invasion. Putin has openly warned many of the former Soviet states that they historically belong to Russia, and those states have responded by significantly increasing their defensive war capabilities.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted about the incident in Poland.

""Concerning news from Poland tonight on at least two explosions. Keeping a close contact with our Polish friends. Lithuania stands in strong solidarity with Poland,"" Nauseda wrote.

""Every inch of NATO territory must be defended!"" he added.

Nauseda went on to refer to Russia as a ""terrorist regime"" in a Facebook post.

"San Francisco police raid home of journalist — with sledgehammer, guns, and FBI in tow — for not revealing his source","San Francisco police raided the home of freelance journalist Bryan Carmody on Friday morning, two weeks after he refused to betray the source of a leaked report exposing salacious details regarding the recent death of the city's longtime public defender.

Officers arrived with a sledgehammer and other equipment to break through the reporter's front gate, before he allowed them inside where they kept him handcuffed for several hours, searched his home and office with guns drawn, had him questioned by the FBI, and confiscated several items — including a copy of the report in question.

What's the background?

The San Francisco Police Department has been under pressure to find out who among them leaked the true cause of the February death of Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who, according to the San Francisco Examiner, ""dedicated his career to uncovering police misconduct.""

The Examiner said Adachi's friends and supporters believe the leak was ""political retribution.""

According to the Los Angeles Times, ""initial reports said the 59-year-old public defender had been traveling when he suddenly had a heart attack."" But soon, conflicting details began to leach out, and Carmody got his hands on the incident report.

The report revealed that on the night of Adachi's death, police responded to a 911 call from a woman — who was not Adachi's wife — saying the public defender was unresponsive. Officers arrived at an apartment where the two had reportedly planned to spend the weekend, and police photos showed ""empty bottles of alcohol, cannabis gummies, and two syringes that may have been left by paramedics,"" KGC-TV reported.

The medical examiner found cocaine and alcohol in Adachi's system, and concluded the stimulants caused ""cardiac stress"" on ""his already compromised heart,"" ultimately resulting in his death, KNTV-TV reported.

Adachi's widow made a public statement condemning the leaking of the police report, saying, ""It was despicable what the police did to myself and my daughter. ... We had no privacy. It was an ongoing investigation and I don't believe that they should have released it.""

The Public Defender's Investigative Unit also slammed the police for the leak, hinting at the possibility of it being a retaliatory act and blaming the media for exposing the details.

""The report was released prematurely at best, and far more concerning was sold to the media,"" spokesman Hadi Razzaq said at a public hearing in April. ""And something the public should be aware of is that the police report was in the hands of media within hours of Mr. Adachi's death in a situation where the police themselves viewed the location as a possible crime scene and ongoing investigation.

""The fact that this happened involving the elected public defender who had a history of battling the police, exposing misconduct, is all the more troubling,"" he added.

What did the reporter say?



Razzaq revealed that a freelance reporter allegedly sold the information to media outlets. Within days, police questioned Carmody about where he received the leaked report, but he refused to reveal his source. Two weeks later, officers showed up with a warrant to find the report, which was described as ""stolen or embezzled"" property.

While Carmody sat handcuffed, police called in and obtained a second warrant. Ultimately, Carmody told NBC News, ""They took every electronic device that I own — every computer, every hard drive, every digital photograph that I have taken in the last 25 years.""

They also took the leaked report, which they found in Carmody's safe. But the reporter said he doesn't believe they'll be able to find the source from the document.

Carmody told NBC he's always had a good working relationship with the SFPD, but now he just wants his equipment back.

""At this point, they've shut down my business completely,"" he said. ""I don't have the gear I need to do my job.""

The SFPD defended the raid, calling it ""one step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of a confidential police report.""

What else?

Meanwhile, the local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists is asking why the department ignored California's shield laws, which protect reporters from being forced to reveal their sources. The organization said the raid ""shows an alarming disregard for the right to gather and report on information.""

Carmody's lawyer, Thomas Burke, slammed the SFPD for its invasion of his client's work as a professional journalist, telling The Times, ""It's designed to intimidate. It's essentially the confiscation of a newsroom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-raid-home-of-journalist-for-not-revealing-his-source,2019-05-13
"Police: Victim of armed home invasion has his own gun, shoots intruders — one of whom is his ex-girlfriend","A Dublin, California, man told police he was in bed when he woke up to banging on his front door about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, KNTV-TV reported.

When he answered the door, he saw his ex-girlfriend and another man who was pointing a gun at him, police told the station, adding that the pair forced their way into the man's residence.

The pair also tried to assault the homeowner, KNTV said.

But the victim wasn't empty-handed for the surprise reunion. Police told the station he also had a gun — and used it in self-defense during an exchange of gunfire.

The man then fled and called police, KNTV said.

What did cops find?

Upon their arrival at the residence, police found a 28-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man suffering from gunshot wounds, the station said.

The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, police told KNTV, and the man was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.

"Polish national team refuses to play Russia in the World Cup playoffs, Swedish and Czech teams also boycott","Poland’s national soccer team is refusing to play Russia in a 2022 World Cup playoff match in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.



The president of the Polish football association, Cezary Kulesza, said that the Polish national team “does not intend” to participate in the playoff match, the BBC reported.

In a joint statement, members of the Polish team said, “We, the players of the Polish national team, together with the Polish Football Association, decided that as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, we do intend to play in the playoff match against Russia.”

“It is not an easy decision,” the statement continued, “But there are more important things in life than football. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian nation.”

Polish footballer Robert Lewandowksi said, “It is the right decision! I can’t imagine playing a march with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening.”

Cezary Kulesza, the current president of the Polish Football Association, said, “Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia.”



Polish President Andrezj Duda replied to Kulesza’s statement saying, “Rightly so, Mr. President. You don’t play with bandits!”



Poland’s Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, also chimed in saying, “You cannot play a match against Russia under such circumstances … Thank you so much for this decision.”

National teams from Sweden and the Czech Republic joined Poland in a joint statement.

The Swedish and Czech teams are to play each other in a playoff match and whichever team wins would likely advance to play the Russian team in the World Cup tournament.

The Swedish team said on Twitter that they “will not play against Russia – regardless of where the match is played.” In a statement, the team said, “The Federal Board also urges FIDA to cancel the playoff matches in March in which Russia participates.”

On Saturday, Roman Abramovich, Russian billionaire and owner of the Chelsea Football Club, handed over the “stewardship and care” of the Premier League club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, forfeited ownership of the team after the British parliament pressured him to do so in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported.



Abramovich said, “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/polish-national-team-refuses-to-play-russia-in-the-world-cup-playoffs-swedish-and-czech-teams-also-boycott,2022-02-26
Media outlet celebrates Vladimir Putin for speeding up the 'green revolution' — but makes ironic admission,"Politico Europe is celebrating Russian President Vladimir Putin for accelerating the ""green revolution.""

Wait, seriously?

The news outlet published its inaugural ""Green 28"" list of the ""power players"" driving Europe's push to fight climate change and transition to so-called ""green energy."" This year, the outlet named Putin the most influential figure.

""It took a war criminal to speed up Europe’s green revolution,"" Politico Europe said.

""By invading Ukraine and manipulating energy supplies to undermine European support for Kyiv, Russian President Vladimir Putin has achieved something generations of green campaigners could not — clean energy is now a fundamental matter of European security,"" the outlet added.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which forced Western countries to enact heavy sanctions on Moscow, indeed exposed Europe's over-reliance on Russian oil.

That dependence laid bare Europe's energy vulnerabilities, which has generated a ""green surge,"" according to Politico Europe.

""We will look back at this situation in 10 years time and see, OK, that was the moment where we really got serious about the green transition and we really had the big green acceleration,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, a climate and energy policy expert.

Ironically, the article even admitted that Europe's energy crisis has driven a new reliance on coal power, which will cause ""a surge in emissions.""

What was the reaction?

Celebrating Putin's ""achievement"" earned Politico Europe widespread mockery online, especially considering that Europe has increased its use of coal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politico-europe-vladimir-putin-green-energy,2022-10-13
PolitiFact rates Fox host's claim about Russian oil as 'mostly false' even while admitting she was spot-on,"Fact-checking website PolitiFact recently engaged in some head-scratching analysis in an attempt to discredit a claim made by Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo — but ended up doing the exact opposite.

What are the details?

At issue were remarks made by Bartiromo during an appearance on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Feb. 22. While speaking with her fellow Fox host, Bartiromoargued that U.S. dependency on Russian oil was growing at exactly the wrong time: during unprovoked Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

At that time, the U.S. and other Western allies had, in Bartiromo's opinion, only tepidly responded to Russia's troop-building near the Ukrainian border, by refusing to curtail their imports of Russian energy resources.

As an example, Bartiromo said this: ""The United States is also reliant on Russian oil — we have doubled our imports from Russia in the last year. So, [there's] no question why President Biden is begging OPEC and others to pump more oil.""

Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a military conflict the likes of which mainland Europe hasn't experienced since World War II.

As of Wednesday morning, the Biden administration continued in its refusal to cut off U.S. imports of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow — despite harsh criticism from key members in Congress.

What did PolitiFact say?

In a Monday column, PolitiFact parachuted in to assess Bartiromo's claim that the U.S. doubled oil imports from Russia as ""mostly false.""

The fact-checker suggested that when crude oil imports and refined products imports such as gasoline and kerosene are combined, it shows the year-over-year increase to be 28%, not 50%.

But that's not how oil imports are typically categorized. Normally, oil imports and energy imports — which include refined products — are categorized separately. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which PolitiFact cites multiple times, shows as much by breaking down crude oil imports in a separate chart.

A spokesperson for Bartiromo evidently explained this to PolitiFact, resulting in the fact-checker admitting, ""The U.S. more than doubled its crude oil imports from Russia, to about 208,000 barrels a day in the first 11 months of 2021, from 76,000 barrels a day in 2020.""

Amazingly, that wasn't enough for the fact-checker to change its assessment, even while it openly admitted that Bartiromo's specific claim was accurate.

""But Bartiromo’s broader point was about the extent of U.S. reliance on Russian oil, which remains fairly modest,"" the article went on to say. ""Russia accounted for only about 3% of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021 — a 2 percentage point increase from 2020.""



It seems, to cover its tracks, the fact-checker switched gears to argue that Bartiromo's apparent broader point was overstated since Russian imports only make up a relatively small portion of U.S. oil imports as a whole.

But that wasn't the specific claim that PolitiFact was examining, and so its assessment should be changed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politifact-bartiromo-mostly-false-on-russian-oil,2022-03-02
"Poll: 7 in 10 Americans say the economy is in bad shape, divided on who is to blame","About 7 in 10 Americans say the nation’s economy is in bad shape, according to a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

According to the new poll, a majority of Americans do not blame President Joe Biden for high gasoline prices, but they hold his economic leadership in low regard as inflation continues to ravage their savings and spending power.

According to the poll, less than half of surveyed Americans view the jump in gas prices as Biden’s fault. Associated Press reported that this is a “reflection of how the [United States] is processing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting increase in oil costs.”

The Associated Press continued by saying that “the polls hint at a paradox in which the public views Biden as being in power without necessarily being in control. [Biden’s] hopes for a lasting economic renaissance have faded as Americans cope with higher food and energy costs. And the promise of a country no longer under the pandemic’s sway has been supplanted by the uncertainty of war in Europe.”

According to the poll, 65% of Americans currently disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy. 96% of Republicans and 36% of Democrats surveyed disapprove, and the overall number of people saying they disapprove is up from 57% in December and from 47% in July of 2021.

Overwhelmingly, the Americans surveyed were worried about the 40-year-high rates of inflation affecting the rising costs of living.

68% of people surveyed said they were “very concerned” about the rapidly rising cost of gasoline, while 59% said they were the same degree of worried about the rising cost of groceries.

Adam Newago, a 53-year-old truck driver from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, said, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.”

Newago said that he sees inflation as spiraling out of control as the rising cost of fuel spreads to other parts of the economy, affecting prices across the board for everyone, everywhere.

48% of Americans surveyed in the new poll think that the Biden administration’s policies are hurting the economy while 24% believe that the administration’s policies are helping; 28% of those surveyed think the administration’s policies haven’t made much of a difference.

80% of Democrats say that high gas prices are outside Biden’s control, while 79% of Republicans are specifically blaming his policies for rising costs and limiting energy production.

Generally, there is consensus among Republicans that Biden’s policies are hurting the American economy while Democrats are split between thinking the administration is either helping the economy or not making a difference.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-7-in-10-americans-say-the-economy-is-in-bad-shape-divided-on-who-is-to-blame,2022-03-26
Poll: Majority of Dems would flee the US during invasion,"As Ukrainians valiantly fight to defend their nation against a Russian invasion, a Quinnipiac University national poll of U.S. adults asked people whether they would fight or flee if they faced that situation — the poll found that while a whopping 68% Republicans said they would remain and fight, just 40% of Democrats said they would stick around and fight. Among independents, 57% said they would stay and fight.

Just 25% of Republicans and 36% of independents indicated that they would leave the U.S., while 52% of Democrats said they would depart, according to the poll conducted March 4 to March 6.

Overall, 55% of people in the poll said they would remain and fight, while 38% indicated they would depart the country.

A strong majority (71%) indicated that they would back a ban on Russian oil even if such a move would result in higher gas prices in America.



More than half (60%) in the poll thought that Russian President Vladimir Putin is mentally unbalanced, while just 21% thought that the Russian figure is stable mentally.

Russia has been wreaking death and destruction in Ukraine, killing many during the invasion, including civilians.

The Associated Press reported that at The Hague, Netherlands, and Ukraine urged the International Court of Justice to call for a halt of the Russian onslaught.

Russia ""is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare, encircling cities, cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian population with heavy ordnance,"" Jonathan Gimblett of Ukraine’s legal team said, according to the outlet.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute has announced that it is bestowing the Ronald Reagan freedom Award upon Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, ""for his courageous fight against tyranny and for his indomitable stance for freedom and democracy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-finds-that-majority-of-democrats-would-flee-during-us-invasion,2022-03-08
Poll: Nearly three quarters of Americans agree Putin's invasion of Ukraine was unjustified,"If there is one issue that the vast majority of Americans can agree on, it's opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Nearly three quarters of Americans said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was unjustified, and 76% of those surveyed gave an unfavorable opinion of the warmonger-in-chief, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll.

This survey of 1.523 U.S. adults was conducted online between Feb. 24 and 27 and shows a large swing in public opinion against Russia and in favor of Ukraine.

Three weeks ago, before the invasion began, 49% of Americans said the U.S. should remain neutral while 46% said America should side with Ukraine in a potential conflict with Russia, Yahoo News reports. Now, after millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and pictures and videos from the war have circulated on social media, U.S. adults are more than twice as likely to advocate for siding with Ukraine (57%) than remaining neutral (25%).

Strong majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and self-identified independents say that the invasion of Ukraine was unjustified. Overall, 74% of U.S. adults said Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine was not justified, 20% were not sure, and 6% said the invasion was justified. Nearly half of survey respondents (47%) agree that it is in America's best interests to stop Russia and help Ukraine. Just 26% overall said ""the conflict is none of America's business,"" though more Republicans (30%) and independents (33%) said so than Democrats (17%).

Americans also appear to be in broad agreement with how the U.S. should respond to the war, with 56% of survey respondents saying they favor the sanctions imposed on Russia by President Joe Biden. Even 53% of Republicans said they favor Biden's sanctions, which cut off Russia's government from accessing Western banks and financial markets. And most Americans are opposed to military intervention, with 56% agreeing with Biden's vow ""not to send troops to Ukraine""; only 15% disagree.

However, a plurality of those polled, 39%, said Biden was ""not tough enough"" on Russia, while 28% said Biden's response has been ""about right."" Just 4% said Biden has been ""too tough."" Only a third of Americans approve of how Biden has handled ""the situation with Russia and Ukraine."" Almost half of those polled (48%) said they disapprove, while 17% are unsure.

Slightly more respondents (40%) said that former President Donald Trump would have handled the situation in Ukraine better than Biden (38%).

Most Americans (62%) would like to see the U.S. take further action against Russia, either through ""more economic sanctions"" (33%), ""military force"" (3%), or both (26%).

The American public is paying attention to the war in Ukraine, with more than two-thirds (70%) saying they're following news updates about Ukraine at least ""somewhat closely."" The Russian-Ukraine war is now tied with inflation for what Americans think should be Biden's top priority as president. The president's response to war in Europe will be one of the defining moments of his legacy.

Popular Texas sheriff is the latest elected official to reject the Democratic Party and become a Republican,"An accomplished and popular Texas sheriff has determined that to continue the ""strong tradition of excellent law enforcement in Karnes County,"" he will have to do so as a Republican.

Thrice-elected Karnes County Sheriff Dwayne Villanueva announced he has switched parties, officially rejecting the Democratic Party and what it has come to stand for.

Republican Party of Texas Chairman Matt Rinaldi said in a statement, ""I am proud to welcome Sheriff Villanueva to the Republican Party. As Democrats increasingly abandon and cripple law enforcement, it is no wonder more people are turning to the Republican Party.""

Texas Scorecard noted that while former President Donald Trump and U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) secured over 75% of the votes cast in the 2020 election in Karnes County, Villanueva still netted approximately 66% of the vote as a Democrat, winning by over 30 points.

Villanueva is popular in no small part due to the fact that he's highly effective.

Having started his law enforcement career in 1993 as a jailer for the Karnes County Sheriff's Office, he went onto become a constable and then Karnes County's sheriff.

Villanueva has a strong track record of arrests, having hunted down and put away high-profile criminals, including a serial arsonist responsible for over 50 fires, an escaped inmate, drug dealers, murderers, burglars, and others.

The sheriff stated in his re-election campaign in 2020 that his office takes a ""pro-active"" approach to fighting crime, hunting down criminals ""instead of waiting for them to commit crimes.""

Country before party

Villanueva joins other Texan lawmen and patriots — similarly committed to upholding the law and maintaining order — who have recently crossed the aisle or at the very least denounced the Democratic Party.



Terrell County Judge Dale Carruthers and Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara, both lifelong Democrats and Hispanic, switched parties earlier this year because of the Biden administration's failed border policies, reported the Center Square.

Carruthers noted that she ""came from a Hispanic heritage, which was prominently Democrat. The chaos at the border and everything that's been going on makes me realize that I needed to switch parties.""

""We are trying to protect the sovereignty of Texas. I am a constitutional judge and we are standing behind the constitution,"" Carruthers added.

Guevara, who had been a Democrat since 1992, said, ""I’ve always ran as a Democrat and this is my first year to run as a Republican. I’m very grateful for Gov. Abbott for all he has done for Texas and continues to do for Texas, especially with our border crisis.""



Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez, another lifelong Hispanic Democrat who has been fighting cartel and gang activity for years, has similarly emphasized that ""the Democratic Party doesn't represent us.""



Ryan Guillen, a pro-life and pro-Second Amendment state representative, announced he was leaving the Democratic Party and running as a Republican in Nov. 15, 2021. He won the general election on Nov. 8, 2022.

Guillen said his ""fiscally conservative, pro-business, and pro-life values are no longer in step with the Democrat Party of today.""

""Friends, something is happening in South Texas, and many of us are waking up to the fact that the values of those in Washington, D.C., are not our values, not the values of most Texans,"" said Guillen. ""The ideology of defunding the police, of destroying the oil and gas industry, and the chaos at our border is disastrous for those of us who live here in South Texas.""

Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-Texas) explained to Fox News Digital why Texans, particularly Hispanics, are leaving the Democrat Party: ""We're not complicated people here in South Texas. We love America. We want security. We love our family and we love God. It's really that easy, and that's why our values align with the Republican Party.""

According to Cruz, Democrats ""have become woke, pushing down their cultural radicalism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/popular-texas-sheriff-is-the-latest-elected-official-to-reject-the-democratic-party-and-become-a-republican,2022-12-22
Father shoots and kills armed burglar threatening his family during home invasion in Texas,"A Texas father foiled a home invasion when he shot and killed one of three armed burglars who allegedly broke into his home and threatened his family at gunpoint, including two young children.

The alarming incident unfolded in Port Arthur, a city east of Houston, on Sunday.

Port Arthur police said that they were called to the home at about 8:30 p.m. and found a deceased 27-year-old who had been shot by the homeowner and father of the family.

The victims said that three armed burglars forced their way into the home as a female resident arrived at the house. The suspects allegedly demanded that the woman hand over her belongings.

From a separate room, the 29-year-old father of the home heard the commotion from the home invasion and confronted the intruders with his rifle. He says that he shot one of the intruders and the other two fled. Police are seeking the two suspects who escaped.

The father was trying to protect his two young children, who where also in the house at the time. Port Arthur Detective Mike Hebert told KBMT-TV that the suspect who was killed was not a stranger to the homeowner who killed him.

""We know that the individual who defended himself inside the house was an acquaintance of the suspect that was shot and killed within the house,"" said Hebert.

Police said two other suspicious incidents occurred at the same residence.

Hours after the lethal shooting, the home was subject to a drive-by shooting, but no one was at the home at the time. Then, a day later, the home was engulfed in flames. Police are investigating whether the three incidents are connected.

The mother of the children, who doesn't live at the house, said that her 5-year-old child was shaken up by the incident because one of the suspects pointed a gun at his face.

The deceased suspect was later identified and KBMT reported that he had been previously arrested for assault, numerous times for deadly conduct, and for making terroristic threats.

Samantha Power says 'catastrophic' food shortages are an opportunity to implement left-wing policies,"A Biden administration member said that ""catastrophic"" food and fertilizer shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are a great opportunity to implement left-wing policies.

Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, made the comments during an interview with ""This Week"" on Sunday.

""We're seeing global food shortages all around the world,"" said anchor George Stephanopoulos, ""as the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, what more can be done to address those shortages?""

""Thank you for posing that question, it is just another catastrophic effect of Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, I mean as if the harms in Ukraine weren't enough, you have countries like in subsaharan Africa and the Middle East who get maybe eighty, ninety percent of their wheat or their grain, overall, from Russia and Ukraine, and you see massive spikes in food prices,"" said Power.

""Food prices, right now George, globally are up 34% from where they were a year ago, aided substantially, again, by this invasion,"" she added.



Power said they were working to increase food production from farmers, but also wanted to use the opportunity to make farmers choose green energy alternatives to fertilizer.

""Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer. And even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia. As a result, we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost. And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway,"" Power continued.



""So never let a crisis go to waste,"" she concluded.

She went on to defend the Biden administration against criticism that its policies led to high food prices.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is in its tenth week, with some estimates claiming civilian casualties as high as 2,685, and the U.S. State Dept. estimating that more than 10,000 Russian soldiers have perished in the brutal war.

Jeremy King told Bay News 9 that two masked intruders barged into his home last Wednesday around 9 p.m. They both pointed firearms at him and demanded money. When King told the men he did not have anything to give them, the men snatched King's 11-year-old daughter and severely beat him.

""I took a severe beating,"" King told Bay News. ""I've got a fractured eye socket, a fractured sinus cavity, a concussion, 20 stitches and three staples in my head.""

King said his wife, who is eight months pregnant, was in the back of the house during the altercation. One of the masked men shot at her — and she responded by grabbing the family's AR-15 and returning fire.



In fact, King's wife shot one of the men, who was able to escape the house before collapsing in a nearby ditch, where he died.

""When he came toward the back door in her line of sight, she clipped him,"" King explained. ""He made it from my back door to roughly 200 feet out in the front ditch before the AR did its thing.

Biden blames coronavirus and Putin for high prices,"As Americans continue to suffer under the heavy financial burden caused by rising prices, President Joe Biden is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the COVID-19 pandemic for the problem.

""I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,"" a tweet on Biden's @POTUS account claimed.



The tweet comes as Americans witness the purchasing power of their savings rapidly eroded by soaring inflation.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.2 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in February,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in a report released earlier this month. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.5 percent before seasonal adjustment."" The all items index increased by ""8.5 percent for the 12 months ending March,"" according to the BLS.

Gas prices have already risen significantly since Biden took office in early 2021, and they have gone even higher since Russia started its invasion of Ukraine. As of Wednesday, AAA's national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $4.114. Biden issued an order to prohibit importing oil and other products from Russia, and Congress has also passed legislation to ban the importation of such products from Russia.



Many on social media pushed back against Biden's attempt to deflect blame for rising prices.

""Obviously no one believes this to be true, so why are they saying it?"" tweeted Mollie Hemingway, editor-in-chief of the Federalist.

""Whichever newly-minted Berkeley poly sci grad is doing Biden’s Twitter was apparently never taught to respect voters’ intelligence. Inflation is surging because Biden dumped trillions into economy at worst possible time. Energy costs are exploding because he shut down US Energy,"" Stephen Miller wrote in response to Biden's tweet

""Then why has inflation increased every month of your presidency?"" Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas tweeted.

""I grew up in a generation when Jimmy Carter told us to turn down our thermostats due to an energy crisis. Biden has returned to the playbook of the 1970s, when presidents told families to suffer instead of addressing the crises CREATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION,"" Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana tweeted.

""FACT: Joe Biden is responsible for the skyrocketing inflation and historic gas prices. The American people know this and that is why a #REDTSUNAMI is coming this November,"" GOP Rep.

Biden says battling inflation is his chief economic priority,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, President Joe Biden continues to describe inflation as his number one economic priority.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Friday which shows that inflation continues to fly high.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April,"" according to the BLS. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

""The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981,"" the report said.

Americans have been facing skyrocketing gas prices — as of Friday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas has reached $4.986.

During a speech at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden reiterated that combatting inflation is his ""top economic priority.""

The White House has been pointing toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine as one of the main culprit's behind high inflation, and during his speech on Friday, Biden continued that practice by making a comment about Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's tax on both food and gas.""

Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, and the U.S. has banned the importation of Russian oil and other products.

""I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to my desk, so we can lower the price of goods,"" Biden said in a statement about the consumer price index on Friday. ""And, I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.""



Roaring inflation, which has been dramatically eroding the purchasing power of Americans' money, could pose a serious problem for Democrats during the 2022 election cycle.



A Trafalgar Group survey of likely general election voters found that 59.9% thought that the president's ""policies and spending"" are the top causes for increasing inflation in America, compared to 31.6% who viewed the Russian conflict with Ukraine as the chief reason for rising inflation.

Government tells privately funded border wall builders they must keep the barrier's gate open,"An international agency has ordered that a section of privately built border wall must indefinitely keep its gate opened because organizers built the wall without obtaining authority from federal officials.

What are the details?

The International Boundary and Water Commission — an agency tasked with managing land issues between the U.S. and Mexico — said organizers of the privately funded ""We Build the Wall"" GoFundMe campaign built a wall with a locked gate in New Mexico, not far from El Paso, Texas.

The group allegedly locked the gate last week, blocking access to levee road on one side of the gate and a national monument on the other, BuzzFeed News reported.

After repeated requests for organizers to open the gate to the half-mile stretch of wall, the IBWC, along with law enforcement officials, indefinitely opened the gate. However, the gate is being closed at night due to ""security concerns.""

According to the IBWC, organizers submitted incomplete paperwork to build on federal property on June 2, after the wall had already been completed and publicly unveiled. On June 6, the IBWC responded to the request and asked for additional information. It was on that day that organizers allegedly locked the gate.

""They think they can build now and ask questions later, and that's not how it works,"" Lori Kuczmanski, a spokesperson for the IBWC, told BuzzFeed News. ""This is policy and procedure, and you don't just come into our property and build first.""

How did organizers respond?

The organizer behind the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign claimed that ""Mexico just opened all gates"" through the IBWC for a ""mass invasion,"" according to BuzzFeed. However, there was no planned ""mass invasion.""

Meanwhile, the group claimed, according to KTSM-TV, that the IBWC knew about the gate and that there was an agreement to close the gate but leave it unlocked. The IBWC, however, did not indicate the existence of any agreement.

A construction foreman told KTSM— which found the gate ""closed"" when reporters inspected it — the gate was shut to allow concrete to cure.

""The only reason on the construction site, we have the gate closed, is so we can let the concrete cure for the backside of the base, it's got to cure for over 72-hours,"" the foreman said. ""We sent everybody home on Friday night.""

Anything else?

Sunland Park, New Mexico, where the wall is officially located, sent the group a cease-and-desist letter in late May ordering all construction be halted.

However, the group continued construction anyway.

In addition, the state of Florida has opened an investigation into the group behind the private campaign after fielding numerous complaints about the organization, many of which were referred from the state's attorney general's office. The organization behind the campaign is incorporated in the Sunshine State.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/privately-funded-border-wall-gate-open,2019-06-12
"Pro-Kremlin outlet reports nearly 10,000 Russian troops killed during Ukraine invasion — but later scrubs numbers from website, claims it was hacked","A pro-Kremlin tabloid report stated that nearly 10,000 Russians have been killed in Ukraine as a result of the ongoing invasion.

A Monday report from the New York Post stated that the figures were quickly removed from the report and that the outlet claimed that it had been hacked.

What are the details?

On Monday, Komsomolskaya Pravda, which cited the Russian Ministry of Defense, reported that at least 9,861 Russian troops were killed as a result of the incursion and that more than 16,000 soldiers had been wounded in Ukraine during the invasion.

The report, according to Insider, cited the Russian Ministry of Defense.

Later that day, the organization removed the figures from the website and later issued a statement noting that it had been hacked. According to the Post, the original version of the article was still ""accessible in the paper's online archives.""

Earlier this month, Russia released what it said was an official death toll and stated that just 498 troops had been killed in action and just 1,597 injured.

The New York Times last week issued a report stating that intelligence officials have estimated that approximately 7,000 Russian troops were killed during the war so far.

A Ukrainian spokesperson on Monday claimed that approximately 15,000 Russian troops had been killed. A spokesperson added that approximately 1,300 Ukrainians had been killed as of March 13. Neither number has been independently verified.

Anything else to know about this?

A Sunday report from the the Washington Post stated that Russian soldiers are being killed at a higher rate than Ukrainian troops.

""Russia’s attempt to conquer Ukraine could be headed toward a stalemate as heavy casualties and equipment losses take a toll on unprepared Russian forces that have failed so far to achieve any of their initial objectives, Western officials and military experts say,"" the report said.

"Professor calls unborn babies ‘legitimate parasite,’ compares them to cancer","A professor at the University of California San Diego's School of Medicine drew outrage on social media after reportedly comparing unborn human babies to parasites, cancers, and more.

What are the details?

According to Campus Reform, a photo of one of the professor's slides made its way onto Twitter, where it sparked anger in many social media users.

The slide, photographed by user Dylan Griswold, explained ""parallels between fetuses and cancers.""

The slide stated that fetuses are similar to cancers in that the fetus — a ""legitimate parasite"" — ""rapidly grows, invades, manipulates [the] immunity of [the] mother"" and ""reshapes blood vessels.""

Cancer, the slide said, ""crashes the party"" and is also responsible for the aforementioned effects.

Griswold, a Stanford medical student, captioned the tweet, ""No joke, a friend just sent me this slide from her upper-level biology course. I'm speechless. Create your own caption.""

Campus Reform was able to obtain the full presentation, which was reportedly titled, ""Evolution of Human Disease.""

What else?

Griswold told the outlet that it's important to place priority on mothers and unborn children, protecting the rights of both.

""In a country where abortion on demand/till birth is becoming the norm, it becomes increasingly important to recognize both the dignity of both the mother and her unborn child,"" Griswold said. ""This slide, while intended to show similar mechanisms of invasive processes, both implicitly and explicitly pathologizes pregnancy.""

""It is no wonder why Planned Parenthood performs over 300,000 abortions each year — we treat pregnancy as a disease to be avoided at any cost — often at the highest expense: the life of an unborn child,"" Griswold added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-unborn-babies-parasite-cancer,2019-04-29
Progressive activist locks down her social media account after backlash from bizarre Putin tweet,"A progressive activist shut down her Twitter account after receiving an avalanche of laughter and criticism over her claim about Russian President Vladimir Putin being aided by white supremacy.

Janel Forsythe identified herself as a ""communications specialist"" for non-profit organizations and for progressive causes, but her tweet about Putin had some unintended consequences.

""This isn't discussed much, but Putin very much benefits from white privilege,"" Forsythe tweeted.

""I just can't see a scenario in which a Black or Brown man running Russia would be allowed to invade Ukraine with no devastating consequences (see Crimea in 2014),"" she added.

Screenshots of the bizarre tweet was circulated among those who were amazed by her claim.

Others took to social media to mock and ridicule Forsythe.

""Incredible. Just incredible,"" replied Jason Whitlock of Blaze Media.

""We found it guys. The absolute worst Ukraine take, among stiff competition,"" responded commentator Inez Stepman.

""It is a cult. It doesn’t make sense but it doesn’t have to make sense,"" read one tweet.

""She needs inpatient therapy for this level of schizophrenia and paranoia,"" said another detractor.

""Black Putin is the answer to our problems,"" joked one user.

Forsythe protected her account so that no one could read her tweets or respond to them.

She also protected her Instagram account.

A full military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops is expected after Putin announced that they were recognizing the independence of two regions where his troops have been present for many years. The U.S. and its allies have responded with economic and financial sanctions against Russia and its leaders.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament voted to drop its restrictive gun laws in order to encourage citizens to arm themselves and defend their country.

"Project Dynamo, Ukraine, Afghanistan","Project Dynamo, which has been extracting people from Afghanistan, is also helping to get people out of Ukraine, where Russia has launched an invasion.

""We had a group of people that were on the ground we had identified that wanted to get out, especially if things went sideways,"" Project Dynamo spokesperson James Judge told Fox News. ""Bryan Stern, who is on our team, could feel the explosions in Kyiv and said, 'Alright, we need to go, we need to get out of here.'""

NBC News reported that the group's first bus of evacuees contained 23 people escaping from Ukraine. Fox News noted that the bus included U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.



President Biden indicated earlier this month that if Russia invaded Ukraine, he would not send U.S. troops in to rescue Americans.

Judge said that ""when the Biden administration said that they weren't going to do it, it was kind of like, 'Okay, here we go.'""

The Biden administration came under heavy criticism last year for presiding over a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and then announcing the completion of the withdrawal even as Americans remained stranded in the country.

"Protesters at Jeff Sessions' college speech — who pushed, grabbed, kicked cops — get slap on the wrist","Protesters at former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' speech at Northwestern University last month — who pushed, grabbed, and kicked campus police — were given $125 civil citations and no criminal offenses, the school said in a statement.

A ""small number of individuals"" were given the citations for disorderly conduct and interfering with the duties of a police officer, the school said, while an ""overwhelming majority of the demonstrators were peaceful and adhered to university policies.""

The school said the citations ""were issued for conduct directed toward police, such as pushing, grabbing or kicking police officers as they attempted to perform their duties and secure the building.""

'This is stupid'

Sessions reportedly blasted protesters during his speech, calling their frequent interruptions ""trash,"" Fox News reported.

""I'm just going to tell you, this is stupid,"" Sessions said as students pounded on an auditorium door and chanted phrases such as ""F*** Jeff Sessions"" and ""You are a racist, you put kids in cages,"" the Daily Northwestern student newspaper said.

""They can have a right to do it, OK, but at some point I have to speak,"" the former Alabama Republican U.S. senator added, according to the paper. ""You shouldn't be blaming young Republicans for meticulously defending their beliefs and putting up with this kind of trash.""

One video posted by Young America's Foundation shows several people tussling with campus security. One called herself a Northwestern student and screamed and cried, ""We are fighting for our lives right now! ... And that man in there has violated every single one of us! And you all are standing here like nothing's going on! ... Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves, and I'm ashamed to call myself a student of Northwestern right now!""

Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

Campus newspaper apologies — for doing its job

A week later, Northwestern's prestigious campus newspaper apologized for having ""actively harmed"" students through its coverage of the speech, such as posting ""retraumatizing and invasive"" photos of students at the public event and using the campus directory to call students for interviews.

The op-ed signed by Daily Northwestern staffers said ""nothing is more important than ensuring that our fellow students feel safe — and in situations like this, that they are benefitting from our coverage rather than being actively harmed by it. We failed to do that last week, and we could not be more sorry.""

Journalism school dean speaks out

Charles Whitaker — dean of Northwestern's renowned Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications — blasted ""naive"" complaining student protesters and told professional journalists who criticized the Daily Northwestern to give the student journalists ""a break.""

Whitaker added that he was ""deeply troubled by the vicious bullying and badgering that the students responsible for [the Sessions' speech] coverage have endured for the 'sin' of doing journalism.""

But he didn't let the Daily Northwestern staffers off the hook for their apology, either, noting that their ""well-intentioned gesture sends a chilling message about journalism and its role in society. It suggests that we are not independent authors of the community narrative, but are prone to bowing to the loudest and most influential voices in our orbit.""

Prowler kicks in back door of house in middle of night. But homeowner has a gun — and puts an end to the break-in.,"Police said a homeowner in Santa Clara, California, was awakened just before 2 a.m. Sunday by a man sneaking around in his backyard and also pounding on doors and windows, KTVU-TV reported.

Police said the suspect broke a window and then ""forcibly kicked open a rear door,"" the station said.

What happened next?

Thing is, though, the homeowner had prepared for just such an incident by exercising his Second Amendment rights.

And after the suspect kicked open the back door of the residence, the 51-year-old homeowner fired his gun ""multiple"" times and shot him, police told KTVU.

What happened to the suspect?

Police said the suspect, 26-year-old Spencer Olson of Los Gatos, was taken to a hospital and then arrested on burglary charges, the station said.

Police told KTVU the homeowner has been cooperative.

Similar recent incident

Earlier this month police said a husband and wife in their 60s were having breakfast when they heard a knock at the door of their home in Fairfield — about an hour and 20 minutes north of Santa Clara — followed by an attempt to kick down the door after they didn't respond to the knock.

The husband, fearing for his life and his wife's safety, grabbed his legally owned gun to defend them, police said.

The intruder then broke down the door completely and entered the residence, police said — after which the husband fired at the intruder, who fled from the home. KTVU-TV reported that police located the intruder collapsed across the street. Police said they detained him and found him in possession of ""a loaded semiautomatic handgun with an extended magazine.""

Officers began lifesaving measures until emergency services arrived, but the individual was pronounced dead shortly after 9 a.m., police said.

Authorities said the intruder was a 27-year-old male from nearby Suisun City who was on parole for a violent crime in Alameda County. KTVU reported that the crime for which he was on parole was a home invasion.

""Whatever the motive was, it does not look like it was peaceful or legal,"" Fairfield Police Lt. Jausiah Jacobsen told the station. ""We know the suspect was armed with a handgun, semi-automatic with magazines. As far as I know, there was no known relationship between the homeowner[s], who are the victims here, and the suspect.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prowler-kicks-in-back-door-of-house-in-middle-of-night-but-homeowner-has-a-gun-and-easily-puts-an-end-to-the-break-in,2021-07-19
Jen Psaki warns economic report will show 'extraordinarily elevated' inflation and puts the blame on Putin,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that the next economic report could contain ""extraordinarily elevated"" inflation because of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Psaki made the comments during Monday's media briefing at the White House.

""So, because of the actions we've taken to address the Putin price hike we are in a better place than we were last month, but we expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin's price hike,"" said Psaki to reporters.

""And we expect a large difference between core and headline inflation reflected in the global disruptions in energy and food markets. Core inflation doesn't include energy and food prices, headline inflation does, and of course we know that core inflation, you know, energy, the impact of energy of course on oil prices, gas prices, we expect that to continue to reflect what we've seen, the increases be over the course of this invasion,"" she added.

Psaki went on to try to directly attribute increases in gas prices to the invasion of Ukraine.

""And just as an example since President Putin's military build-up accelerated in January, average gas prices are up more than 80 cents, most of the increase occurred in the month of March, and at times gas prices were more than a dollar above pre-invasion levels,"" Psaki continued, ""so that roughly 20% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow's inflation reading, and certainly, it's not a surprise to us, but we certainly think it will be reflected.""

The administration has been harangued by Republican critics and others who have pointed out that inflation had been spiking prior to the Russian invasion. The administration has tried to pin inflation on the pandemic, greedy corporations, and finally the Russians.

Unfortunately for the Democrats, an NBC News poll showed far more Americans blame high prices on Biden's policies rather than any of the other excuses the administration has made.

"Psaki's tough talk on Russia, China comes days after Biden admin reportedly got fleeced in Iran deal negotiations: 'This looks like plain ol’ stupidity'","The Biden administration this week rightly called out Russia and China as liars and cheaters that can't be trusted. Yet apparently, that notion did not occur to White House officials when they invited those officials to take part in Iran nuclear deal negotiations earlier this year.

The nearsightedness raises concerns once again that the Biden administration — despite its tough talk — remains woefully naïve regarding the nefarious intentions of two of America's greatest geopolitical foes.

What happened?

Serving as a mouthpiece for the administration on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki raked Russia and China over the coals in a lengthy Twitter thread. She brandished the nations' government officials as ""preposterous"" propagandizers and asserted that President Biden and his administration have ""[taken] note"" of their past transgressions while being on the ""lookout"" for more.

But that type of sober-minded vigilance seemed remarkably absent in recent days and weeks when the White House not only tolerated Russian and Chinese participation in Iran deal negotiations — but actually invited their involvement.

""U.S. seeks Russian and Chinese support to salvage Iran nuclear deal,"" a Guardian report in December said.

The negotiations reportedly ended in a disaster, with Russia's top negotiator, Mikhail Ulyanov, bragging publicly that his country, along with their Chinese partners, essentially fleeced the U.S., securing more for Iran's nuclear proliferation than previously thought possible.

""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" Ulyanov said in a victory lap following talks. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""

""Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators,"" he added.

It's no wonder Psaki's words rang hollow.

What did she say?

The press secretary fumed at Russia for alleging that the U.S. was involved in biological weapons labs in Ukraine. The Kremlin, it seemed, pushed the propaganda as a pretext for invasion.

""This is preposterous,"" Psaki wrote, stating elsewhere that ""it’s Russia that has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons.""

Psaki went on to call the move ""an obvious ploy"" by the Russians, further noting, ""We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.""

One might ask, where was the ""lookout"" before Biden's White House called on Russia and China to assist in the revival of the Iran nuclear deal?

Anything else?

Reacting to Psaki's statements, Hot Air's Ed Morrissey wrote, ""So explain to me again why we invited Russia to negotiate a deal over illegal WMD development in Iran?""

""Having Mikhail Ulyanov on hand to negotiate Iran’s compliance on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is akin to having Ted Bundy mediate Jeffrey Dahmer’s sentencing,"" the conservative writer quipped. ""Were they really that naive?""

""Rather than naïveté, this looks like plain ol’ stupidity,"" he concluded.

White House warns of possible Russian 'false flag' attack in Ukraine involving chemical or biological weapons,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned of the possibility of a ""false flag"" attack by the Russians involving chemical or biological weapons after citing the proliferation of misinformation online.

Psaki released a statement Wednesday saying that the disinformation campaign might be preparing the way for a fake attack orchestrated to blame Ukrainians.

""We took note of Russia’s false claims about alleged U.S. biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine. We’ve also seen Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories,"" said Psaki in the statement.

""This is preposterous,"" she added. ""It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent.""

She went on to say that the U.S. does not develop or possess biological or chemical weapons anywhere, and noted that there was a long record of Russia using such weapons to assassinate political opponents.

""This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,"" Psaki continued.

""Now that Russia has made these false claims,"" she concluded, ""we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.""

Russian officials claimed on Wednesday that their military forces had found evidence of a military biological program in Ukraine involving plague and anthrax. Ukraine has denied the allegations.

The warning from the White House was similar to one the administration made prior to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. State Dept. spokesperson Ned Price said in early February that it was likely that Russia would orchestrate a false attack to blame with Ukrainians in order to justify an invasion.

Later in February, Russia accused Ukrainian forces of firing back at them after Russian forces shelled a kindergarten school. They invaded soon after.

""It seems that it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis, who occupied Kyiv and took the entire Ukrainian people hostage,"" Putin said, according to Politico, which noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish.

Russia has been laying siege to Ukraine, but Ukrainians have been fighting back.

People around the globe have watched in horror as Russia began invading the sovereign country, wreaking death and destruction against the Ukrainian people.

The U.S. and other nations have condemned Russia and levied sanctions — President Biden has said that American troops will not defend Ukraine against Russia, but will defend NATO allies.

The president is slated to deliver a State of the Union address next week, but has been underwater on his job approval numbers in various polls for quite awhile. In addition to domestic issues like rapidly rising prices, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to cast a pall over his upcoming speech.

Putin declares military invasion of Ukraine,"Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, announced a military invasion of Ukraine at about 5 a.m. Thursday local time.

He had previously said on Monday that Russia would recognize the independence of two regions where pro-Russian troops had held a presence for years.

In a video announcement, Putin claimed that the military operation was to demilitarize Ukraine because of the threat of it joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""All responsibility for the possible bloodletting will be on the conscience of the current Ukrainian regime,"" said Putin according to one translation. ""Truth and strength are on our side.""

He went on to claim that it was not Russia's intention to occupy the country.

Those comments are in contrast to his previous statements that Ukraine was an invention of Russia and his lamentations that the old Soviet republics should not have been allowed to leave Russia.

President Joe Biden issued a statement from the White House after the announcement from Putin.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" wrote Biden.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,"" he continued.

""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" Biden added.

He had previously called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but also ordered economic and financial sanctions against Russian leaders in response to the aggression against Ukraine.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament voted to ease gun restrictions in order to allow their citizens to arm up ahead of the expected attack.

Putin doesn't want to host 'premature' diplomatic summit with Biden,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has opted not to have an in-person meeting with President Joe Biden, the New York Post reported.

Russian leadership believes that it is too early for the two countries to hold a summit to discuss the ongoing Ukraine crisis.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said, “It’s premature to talk about any specific plans for organizing any kind of summits.”

He added, “There is an understanding that dialogue should be continued at the level of foreign ministers” and that there are “no concrete plans in place” for the two presidents to attend a summit together.

Peskov said that the two men can continue to discuss diplomacy over the phone or through other means but that an in-person meeting currently isn’t in the cards.

He said, “If necessary, of course, the Russian and American presidents can decide to hold a telephone call or connect via other methods. A meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate.”

On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden had “accepted in principle” a meeting with his Russian counterpart.

She added that “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war.”

U.S. officials previously suggested that a presidential summit would follow an upcoming meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The idea of a presidential summit has been championed by French officials and cautiously encouraged by the Ukrainian government as a way to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine and avoid armed conflict.

Dmytro Kuleba, a Ukrainian foreign minister, said “We believe every effort aimed at a diplomatic solution is worth trying. We hope that the two presidents will walk out from the room with an agreement about Russia withdrawing its forces from Ukraine.”

On Friday, Biden said he was “convinced” that Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine.

Despite the imminent threat their country is facing, Ukrainian leadership hope to avoid armed conflict by bringing Putin to the table.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said “I don’t know what the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting” and “Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris attended the Munich Security Conference along with a dozen other leaders from Western nations.

"Putin orders 'peacekeeping' troops to invade Ukraine, US to respond with sanctions","Vladimir Putin, the president of the Russian Federation, ordered an invasion of Ukraine on Monday after declaring the ""independence"" of two separatist regions of the country.

Russia has accused Ukraine of oppressing Russian-speaking populations in Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions in southeastern Ukraine. Putin on Monday said Russia would send ""peacekeeping"" troops into the separatist areas, which critics say is a brazen excuse to invade a sovereign neighbor state.

Russian-backed rebels in regions of Ukraine have called for separation since 2014, but in recent months Russia has placed more than 150,000 troops on its border with the country. In response, Ukrainian citizens have armed themselves in anticipation of the expected invasion.

A senior Biden administration official reportedly told journalists that Russia sending ""peacekeeping"" troops into Ukraine didn't necessarily constitute an invasion.

""We will observe and assess what actions Russia actually takes and respond,"" the official said.

Biden also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call after the announcement from Putin.

President Joe Biden has warned that the United States would hit Russia with punitive economic sanctions if they invaded. Those sanctions are expected to be announced on Tuesday.

The United States agreed to defend Ukraine in 1994 after the country agreed to dismantle more than 5,000 nuclear weapons left over from the fall of the Soviet Union.

Putin has reiterated many times his belief that the fall of the Soviet Union was the worst geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. In his speech Monday, he said it was ""madness"" that former Soviet republics were allowed to leave the USSR.

"Putin recognizes independence of Ukrainian rebel regions, moving toward war","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday announced in a televised address that Russia will recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine — defying Western governments and further escalating a situation that could erupt into war.

""I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago - to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic,"" Putin said, referring to areas where fighting has broken out between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Western officials have warned that Russia may use conflict in these regions as a pretext to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement comes after Putin informed Germany and France of his decision, which was received with ""disappointment,"" the Kremlin said Monday according to Reuters. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Putin's decision to recognize the two separatist regions in Ukraine was ""plainly in breach of international law.""

""It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,” Johnson added, according to the Guardian.

In a rambling, at times angry speech, Putin lamented the fall of the Soviet Union, twisted history, and essentially denied Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state.

""Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia,"" Putin inaccurately claimed, asserting that the country ""never had a tradition of genuine statehood.""

Putin characterized the current government of Ukraine as a corrupt oligarchy and accused western governments of supporting a violent coup d'état against the old pro-Russian government in 2014. He leveled numerous accusations against the Ukrainian government, claiming there is a ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people taking place in Donetsk and Lugansk and that Ukraine is attempting to develop nuclear weapons that pose a threat to Russian national security. He further claimed that Russia has ancient connections to territory in eastern Ukraine and that the Russian-speaking people there support independence

The Russian president also alleged that attempts by Ukraine to join NATO pose a threat to Russian national security, and that the United States' threat of sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine were policies designed to ""limit the development of Russia.""



""Russia has the duty to take all necessary measures to protect our security, which is what we'll do,"" said Putin.

As Putin delivered that ominous message, an estimated 150,000 Russian troops have amassed on three sides of Ukraine's eastern border. President Joe Biden on Friday said he is ""convinced"" that Russia has already decided to invade, including an assault on Ukraine's capital Kyiv.



By recognizing two independent states in eastern Ukraine, Russia has created an excuse to deploy troops there. The separatists do not hold all of the territory they claim. Should they request assistance from the Russian military, Putin will claim an invasion is an intervention to protect independent Russian allies from Ukraine's alleged tyranny. Analysts expect Russia to send ""peacekeeper"" forces into the area, Axios reported.

Though Russia has repeatedly denied having a desire to invade, it has claimed Ukraine is preparing for a major military offensive in the east, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials say is not true. Russia claimed on Monday that it killed five Ukrainian troops crossing the border, which Ukraine denied and which the U.S. said was one of several ""transparent, hackneyed plots to justify an invasion.""

Following Putin's speech, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the United Nations security council to ""discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine.""

Putin reportedly discloses conditions for ceasefire in call with Turkish president,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly revealed in full the conditions that would need to be met for a ceasefire to be ordered in Ukraine.

The Russian president is said to have disclosed the list of six priorities during a Thursday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, BBC News reported.

The demands come approximately three weeks after the launch of Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, an unprovoked land invasion that drew swift condemnation and harsh economic retaliation from the entire Western world.

According to BBC News, the demands fall into two categories. The first category, which includes four demands, was reportedly presented as less difficult. Chief among the four is a commitment from Ukraine to remain neutral and not join NATO, something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already signaled an openness to.

In addition to a pledge of neutrality, Ukraine would then have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it isn't a threat to Russia. Of course, any disarmament would leave Ukraine open to future attacks from Russia.

Next, there would have to be protections for the Russian language in Ukraine, and the country would have to undergo what Putin has called ""de-Nazification.""

The demands were passed along to the news agency by Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin.

The second category of demands, according to the BBC, is considered more difficult to satisfy. The outlet said Kalin was less specific on these points but noted they involved the status of Ukrainian territories in the eastern Donbas region.

It is ""assumed"" that Putin will require Ukraine to give up territory in the supposedly Russian-sympathetic region as well as formally recognize that Crimea, an area illegally annexed by Putin in 2014, is part of Russia.

BBC noted that Russia has no legal right to Crimea and even signed an international treaty after the fall of the USSR accepting that Crimea was part of Ukraine.

Putin's alleged demands appeared to fall in line with previous reporting on the matter.

Fox News reported that Putin's list of demands comes as more and more reports continue to surface indicating that morale among Russian forces is waning. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has indeed observed Russian forces stalling out in their advance but was careful to note that low morale was observed anecdotally and may not be indicative of the whole of the Russian military.

However, there continue to be concerns that Putin's negotiating is nothing more than a head fake to distract Ukraine as Russian forces continue to move on the capital.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-reportedly-discloses-conditions-for-ceasefire-in-call-with-turkish-president,2022-03-18
"Vladimir Putin will reportedly be 'undergoing medical procedures,' including cancer surgery","Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to undergo a cancer operation and will be handing the reins of power over to his deputy and espionage official Nikolai Patrushev, according to an insider from the Kremlin.



Putin’s health has been a topic of rampant speculation over the past several months since he launched his invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. Sun reported that there have been reports that Putin has been dealing with both a form of unidentified abdominal cancer and Parkinson’s Disease.

Putin, now 69-years-old, is expected to hand over power to the 70-year-old Patrushev who is believed to have been one of the leading advocates and thinkers behind the invasion of Ukraine. Reportedly, Patrushev was the man who convinced Putin that the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv was filled with neo-Nazis.

The neo-Nazi claim was reported on the Russian media outlet General SVR which first raised concerns over Putin’s health about a year-and-a-half ago.

The outlet quoted an anonymous former “high-ranking Kremlin military figure” who at the time said that “Putin has discussed that he will be undergoing medical procedures.”

The anonymous source also said, “Doctors insist that he needs an operation, but the date has not yet been determined.”

The source added that “[Putin] will have surgery” and that the Russian president would be incapacitated and that the leader “thinks it’ll be for a short time.”

While speaking on live television and using technology to disguise his voice, the source said that the decision to choose Patrushev came after a two-hour “heart to heart” with Putin and that selecting the spymaster to take over in his absence was the “worst option.”

The source also speculated that the Russian president’s health problems could get worse and his overall health could deteriorate.

He posed the hypothetical, “What if all of a sudden, Putin manifests particularly severe health problems?”

“We know very well that he has cancer, and Parkinson’s disease, as we have said many times,” the source continued. “It was possible to contain it for some time, but now the course of the disease is progressing.”

It is unclear when exactly when Putin will undergo surgery but it is believed that Putin won't go under the knife before May 9 as he intends to preside over Red Victory Day celebrations commemorating the role that the former-Soviet Union had in defeating Nazi Germany.

Ben Wallace, the United Kingdom’s Defense Secretary, said that he expects Putin to use the May 9 celebration to call for a final offensive in Ukraine.

Wallace said, “[Putin] is probably going to declare that we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilize the Russian people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-russia-cancer-surgery,2022-05-01
A superyacht believed to be Vladimir Putin's was just impounded by Italian officials,"On Friday, Italian authorities seized a giant superyacht that is said to be owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Italian government recommended that the ship be impounded as part of the West’s ongoing campaign of sanctions against Russia.

The Daily Mail reported that Italian authorities said that the $700 million mega-yacht named “The Scheherazade,” is more than 450 feet long and contains spas, swimming pools, and two helicopter pads.

The giant yacht has been the subject of an ongoing investigation by Italy’s financial police since the end of this past March and has been docked at Marina di Carrara near Pisa since this past September as it undergoes a refit.

The Italian government’s seizure of the ship came late at night as Italian officials grew increasingly concerned that The Scheherazade was going to slip away from their jurisdiction and into international waters to avoid Western sanctions.

Reportedly, in recent days there has been a flurry of activity around the yacht. In March, the ship's majority Russian crew had been replaced with a British staff overnight.

Indicating that the ship had connections to Russia, The Italian Financial Police released a statement that said, “After verification by the fiscal authorities, it has come to light that there is a significant economic connection between the owner of The Scheherazade and senior elements of the Russian government.”

The statement continued, “On the basis of these elements, it has been recommended that the yacht be placed on the current European Union sanctions list, and the Minister of Finance in Rome has agreed.”

Mariateresa Levi, a member of the Italian Financial police, said, “I am not in a position to tell you who the actual owner is, but we are satisfied that the yacht should be seized, and in the next few hours, officers will board and impound her.”

The ship's captain has denied that Putin is the owner of the superyacht while refusing to disclose who the real owner is.

There have been claims that the vessel might belong to Eduard Khudainatov, a Russian oil tycoon who has previously been able to escape Western sanctions, unlike many other Russian oligarchs.

Despite this, activists and investigative journalists linked to Alexei Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, are adamant that the ship belongs to Putin.

Putin suspended as 'honorary president' of the International Judo Federation,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been suspended as the honorary president of the International Judo Federation.

On Sunday, the IJF released a statement saying that it was suspending Putin from his position as the “Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation,” Reuters reported.

The IJF’s statement said, “In light of the ongoing war conflict in Ukraine, the International Judo Federation announces the suspension of Mr. Vladimir Putin’s status as Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation.”

Putin, who is 69 years old, holds a black belt in judo and has even co-authored a book titled “Judo: History, Theory, Practice” and has previously trained alongside the Russian Olympic judo team.

Black belt Putin shows off judo moves with Olympic athletes www.youtube.com

He also holds the rank of grandmaster in taekwondo. He was granted this title in 2013 by the president of the World Taekwondo Federation.



Putin being stripped of this honorary title is just the latest, and the most benign, of the measures taken against him in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States released a joint statement that said the Western allies were committed to “ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed form the SWIFT messaging system.”

By removing Russian banks from the SWIFT network, the Western leaders committed to restricting Russia’s ability to manipulate its currency to reduce the immediate fiscal impact of Western sanctions and specifically targeting Russian officials and oligarchs who encouraged military aggression with sanctions.

Restricting Russian access to the SWIFT network will greatly damage the Russian economy and make engaging in international commerce extremely difficult. This move will isolate Russia and stands to prevent it from exporting natural gas and fossil fuels.

The British Petroleum Company plans to divest from state-owned energy firms in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, despite having done business with them for more than three decades.

BP Chairman Helge Lund said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

On Sunday, the leadership of the European Union announced that it would be closing Europe’s airspace to all aircraft of Russian origin.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-suspended-as-honorary-president-of-the-international-judo-federation,2022-02-28
"poll, 70, troops should get involved, if Russia invades NATO","A Quinnipiac University poll of adults in the U.S. found that 70% believe U.S. troops should get involved if Russia mounts an invasion against a NATO nation, while 21% do not think U.S. soldiers should get involved if such a scenario unfolds.

The eyes of the world are on Ukraine as the people of that country bravely fight to defend their sovereign nation against a Russian invasion. The survey, which was conducted from Feb. 25 to 27, found that 63% are concerned that Russia might utilize nuclear weapons if NATO attempts to intervene, while 32% are not concerned.

The poll found that 66% believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to invade additional countries, while 20% do not think he intends to invade elsewhere.

President Joe Biden has said that American forces will not get involved in the Russia-Ukraine war, though he also declared that America will defend NATO territory.

Biden, who is underwater in various job approval polls, is slated to deliver a State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Ruiz calls Biden to increase refugee admissions cap,"Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) is calling on President Joe Biden to raise the refugee admissions cap for this fiscal year in light of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine has created an escalating humanitarian crisis. The United States must respond by opening its arms to those seeking safety and security. I ask that you issue an Emergency Presidential Determination raising refugee admissions for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2022, expedite family reunification of Ukrainians in the United States, and do everything possible to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admission Program,"" Ruiz said in a letter to Biden.

The refugee cap for fiscal year 2022, which runs through the end of September, is currently set at 125,000.

Ukrainians have been battling to defend their country against Russia's brutal onslaught. Many people have already fled Ukraine because of the chaos and carnage.

""While the headlines are currently focused the war in Ukraine, our country should strengthen its commitment to provide refuge to all people fleeing violence and oppression,"" the letter said.

""The CHC firmly believes that whether someone is fleeing for their life from a Russian dictator or a drug cartel, the United States should provide the safety and security that refugees need.

"Convicted felon allegedly breaks into home, attacks residents. But homeowner has a gun — and intruder takes a bullet to the face.","Police said a convicted felon allegedly broke into a home in Great Bend, Kansas, on Saturday evening and then proceeded to physically assault the residents, the Great Bend Tribune reported.

But the incident would be short lived, as the homeowner had a gun — and shot the intruder in the face, KAKE-TV reported.

What are the details?

After a preliminary investigation, officers believe 27-year-old Zachary Horyna entered the residence in the 1300 block of Jefferson Street, and then began to physically attack the residents after they confronted him, the station said.

It was at this point that the homeowner shot Horyna, KAKE said.

Officers had been dispatched to the scene for a burglary in progress, and after arriving they located and identified the suspect as Horyna with a gunshot wound to the face, the station said.

The homeowners were treated for their injuries on the scene, KAKE said, adding that Horyna was restrained and treated for his injures by emergency medical services and taken to a Great Bend hospital before he was flown to a Wichita hospital. The paper said Horyna was in stable condition Monday morning.

Police said the pending charge against him is aggravated burglary.

The Tribune, citing the Kansas Department of Corrections website, reported that Zachary Cole Horyna had been discharged from the KDOC when his sentence for previous convictions expired July 26.

His past convictions, no longer active, include drug possession and possession of paraphernalia with five or more plants, committed Nov. 28, 2014, in Saline County, the paper said. He also was convicted of drug possession in Sedgwick County in 2017 and criminal possession of a weapon in Sedgwick County in 2018, the Tribune reported.

What did folks have to say about the incident?

Commenters on the Great Bend police department's Facebook page were not too sympathetic toward Horyna and decidedly behind the homeowner's actions:

""He's lucky he only took a shot to the face....I'd probably have blown his head clean off,"" one commenter said.

""I love this family; they are wonderful people; my heart goes out to the both of them to have to experience such a violent act in their own home, so I'm proud of you. I would've done exactly the same thing to protect my family!!"" another commenter wrote.

Crooks try forcing their way into home to steal money for heroin.

The homeowner told Macon County Sheriff's Deputies that a woman knocked on his door — and that when he answered a man tried to force his way inside his home, the station reported.

But this homeowner decided to exercise his Second Amendment rights and was armed and ready, shooting the male intruder in the arm, after which three suspects escaped in a car, WLOS reported.

Their flight from the scene apparently didn't last too long, as the trio — Natasha Kerberg, Carmelita Pike, and Kenneth Lawrence — were later arrested, the station said.

They admitted to law enforcement that they were trying to rob the homeowner for money to buy heroin, WLOS reported.

The information they divulged also led to the drug trafficking arrest of Dean Myers, the station said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-crooks-try-forcing-their-way-into-home-to-steal-money-for-heroin-but-who-knew-homeowner-would-have-a-gun,2020-07-15
Cuomo scrambles to recoup millions in taxpayer dollars from bad COVID-19 deals that didn't deliver,"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) used his emergency powers to spend more than $1 billion in taxpayer funds to acquire critical medical equipment such as ventilators and PPE in the fight against the virus.

But many of the vendors never fulfilled their end of the bargain, and for several months, his administration has been scrambling to recoup the funds.

What are the details?

The New York Post reported Tuesday that Cuomo's Department of Health was ""duped"" into buying millions of dollars worth of medical supplies from Chinese firms ""and has been forced to hire a law firm in Hong Kong in a bid to recoup the taxpayer money it lost.""

The newspaper, which first reported that Cuomo's administration intentionally underreported nursing home deaths during the pandemic, has now reported that the DOH hired the Hong Kong firm Gall Solicitors for $125,000 in an effort to get money back from overseas suppliers.

A Cuomo spokesperson confirmed the contract, saying they hired the firm in late December ""to help us pursue recovery of state funds there, related to procurement.""

Gall is reportedly trying to get back a $12.5 million deposit Cuomo's administration delivered to a company called Please Me LLC, which had promised 1,000 ventilators to the state despite never selling the devices. The supplier never delivered a single ventilator.

The Post pointed to a New York Times article from December that showed Please Me LLC is a company ""whose products include not just small medical devices but also sex toys, children's books and a mask for dry eyes.""

The owner of the company, Eddie Sitt, defended his firm to The Times, claiming that medical products were actually his main business. New York officials claim the company asked to substitute the ventilators requested for a different model after the deposit was already made but the state refused. Sitt claims the ventilators were, in fact, shipped to New York but remain in storage amid the dispute.

Cuomo's people are also trying to get $10 million back from a man named Yaron Oren-Pines, whom they paid $69 million for 1,450 ventilators after he tweeted to former President Donald Trump, ""We can supply ICU Ventilators, invasive and non-invasive. Have someone call me URGENT."" He never delivered, but has thus far returned $59 million of what he was handed by the state.

The Times also reported that at the time of its December report, New York had already recouped $233 million in wasted funds from companies that failed to hold up their end of bargains.

Meanwhile, Cuomo is facing calls to resign from New York Republicans and Democrats alike over the reports of his mishandling of nursing home policies regarding the coronavirus and subsequent allegations of burying the true data. President Joe Biden and the White House has refused to speak on the scandal, after previously saying that Cuomo's response was the ""gold standard"" among U.S. governors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-cuomo-scrambles-to-recoup-millions-in-taxpayer-dollars-from-bad-covid-19-deals-that-didnt-deliver,2021-02-24

"'Stop fingering me, bro!': DC settles lawsuit with ice cream vendor who received anal probing from metro police officer","The city of Washington, D.C., has settled a lawsuit brought by an ice cream vendor who says he was subjected to repeated anal probes by a Metropolitan Police officer looking for weapons. Plaintiff M.B. Cottingham claims he was targeted by law enforcement because he is a black man and believes the cop who searched him should be terminated.

What happened?

Cottingham said that he agreed to be frisked by Officer Sean Lojacono on Sept. 27, 2017, when police approached him and his friends about an open container of alcohol. Instead of the quick pat-down the plaintiff expected, Lojacono reportedly dug his fingers between Cottingham's buttocks, leading Mr. Cottingham to protest.

At that point, the officer placed Cottingham in handcuffs and continues to probe the man's anal area.

""Stop fingering me, though, bro!"" Cottingham can be seen telling Lojacono in video footage of the incident. ""You're fingering my ass, man!""

No weapons were found in the search, and no one was arrested or charged in the encounter.

According to the ACLU, which represented Cottingham in his suit, ""No warrant, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or consent justified the scope of these probes, which were conducted in broad daylight in public and with no other discernible reason than to humiliate and degrade Mr. Cottingham and to display the officer's power over him.""

""The escalation of a low-level stop into a public body-cavity search was an affront to Mr. Cottingham's dignity as well as his constitutional rights,"" the ACLU added.

The Daily Mail reported that Cottingham said in a separate statement: ""The most important thing to me is that Officer Lojacono can't do this to anyone else. I filed this lawsuit because I want policing in D.C. to change.""



Anything else?

ACLU-DC legal co-director Scott Michelman told the Mail he thinks the timing of the city's settlement agreement is noteworthy.

""The fact that the settlement was reached on the eve of the District's deadline to disclose information about Officer Lojacono's extensive disciplinary history suggests MPD officials were worried what the documents would show regarding how long they ignored or tolerated his problematic behavior,"" Michelman said.

In September, MPD announced the officer would be fired, but Lojacono remains on administrative leave while he fights his termination.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-stop-fingering-me-bro-city-of-d-c-settles-lawsuit-with-ice-cream-vendor-who-received-anal-probing-from-metro-police-officer,2018-12-11
Targeted marketing under the spotlight after WaPo editor posts about heartbreaking birth of stillborn son,"Washington Post video editor Gillian Brockell exposed the potential for the cruel impacts of targeted marketing through a social media post on Wednesday, pointing to the flaws in algorithms used by big tech and big credit firms following the birth of her stillborn baby.

What are the details?

In an open letter to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Experian, Brockell questioned why the companies target advertising to expectant mothers, but then continue their marketing after birth under the assumption that all went well during the delivery.

Brockell posted her message via Twitter on Wednesday, initially saying, ""It's all my fault"" for clicking on posts that hinted to the tech firms that she was pregnant. But the editor went on to ask why the companies' marketing departments didn't pick up on her Google searches signaling alarm over the child's well-being. Ultimately, her son was stillborn, yet she subsequently received advertisements for nursing bras, strollers, and tips for getting an infant to sleep through the night.

""You see, there are 26,000 stillbirths in the U.S. every year,"" Brockell wrote. ""And millions more among your worldwide users; and let me tell you what social media is like when you finally come home from the hospital with the emptiest arms in the world, after you've spent days sobbing in bed, and pick up your phone for a couple minutes of distraction before the next wail.""

""It's exactly, crushingly, the same as it was when your baby was still alive,"" the editor explained. ""Pea in the Pod. Motherhood Maternity. Latched Mama. Every goddamn Etsy tchotchke I was planning for the nursery.""

Brockell concluded her message by saying, ""Please, Tech companies, I implore you: If you're smart enough to realize that I'm pregnant, that I've given birth, then surely you're smart enough to realize that my baby died, and can advertise to me accordingly, or maybe just maybe, not at all.""

Anything else?

While targeted advertising has been seen as invasive by critics for years, Brockell's message called for online marketers to step up their calculations to recognize more than just dollar signs. Several of Brockell's Twitter followers responded to her message by sharing stories of their own stillborn children.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-targeted-marketing-under-the-spotlight-after-wapo-editor-posts-about-heartbreaking-birth-of-stillborn-son,2018-12-12
Trump administration sending more federal officers to protect Portland courthouse from rioters,"The Trump administration has taken action to send more federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to protect a federal courthouse targeted by rioters as violent protests continue to rock the city.

What are the details?

The Washington Post reported Monday that internal emails from the U.S. Marshals Service last week revealed plans for an additional 100 deputy U.S. Marshals being deployed to Portland to assist and relieve existing federal agents guarding the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse, which has been the target of the nightly attacks.

Drew Wade, a spokesman for the Marshals Service told the outlet in a statement, ""The agency took steps to identify up to 100 personnel to send to the District of Oregon in case they were needed to relieve or supplement deputies permanently stationed in the district.""

Wade added, ""They may also be used to rotate with personnel already sent there to support district operations during the civil unrest mission to insure the function and safety of judicial proceedings.""

The Post also reported that the Department of Homeland Security is also considering sending another 50 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to Portland to assist, but no final plans have been solidified.

News of the reinforcement comes after an Associated Press reporter gave his account of what it was like being barricaded inside the federal courthouse as it fell under attack by protesters, among reports that numerous U.S. Marshals standing guard have been injured in attacks from rioters.

The Oregonian reported that Sunday marked the 60th night of protests in Portland in reaction to the death of George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis police officers in late May.

What about the lawsuit?

Also on Monday, members of three groups representing protesters sued the Trump administration ""over its use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other aggressive means in response to protests in Portland,"" The Hill reported.

Black Lives Matter joined groups Wall of Moms and Don't Shoot Portland in filing a nine-count complaint in federal court in Washington, D.C., accusing the Trump administration of violating protesters' First Amendment rights by sending federal agents to intervene in the ongoing demonstrations.

The lawsuit was filed by left-leaning group Protect Democracy, who wrote on Twitter that it was seeking to ""stop the @realDonaldTrump administration's unlawful invasion of Portland.""

What did the president say?

"Record label CEO blasts critics who call for artist to be canceled over controversial conservative, patriotic song: 'Message is speaking to millions of people'","Scott Borchetta, Big Machine Label Group founder and president-CEO, has issued a passionate defense of musician Aaron Lewis' latest single, ""Am I the Only One,"" which lauds a conservative lifestyle over what he says is a damaging, invasive groupthink known as liberalism.

Borchetta's label has produced music for the likes of Taylor Swift, Florida Georgia Line, Rob Zombie, and even Sheryl Crow's 2020 pro-Kamala Harris song, ""Woman in the White House.""

What's a brief history here?

Lewis, Staind frontman, released the stand-alone single with Big Machine Records on July 2. The release marks Lewis' first solo release of 2021.

Some of the song's lyrics include:

Am I the only one, here tonight/ Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right/ Is it just me? Am I losin' my mind? Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time?



Am I the only one? Tell me I'm not/ Who thinks they're takin' all the good we got/ And turnin' it bad, hell, I'll be damned I think I'm turnin' into my old man



Am I the only one, willin' to bleed/ Or take a bullet for bein' free/ Screamin', ""What the f***!"" at my TV For tellin' me, yeah, are you tellin' me? That I'm the only one, willin' to fight/ For my love of the red and white/ And the blue, burnin' on the ground/ Another statue comin' down in a town near you



...



Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone/ I'm not the only one/ I can't be the only one



Am I the only one who quits singin' along/ Every time they play a Springsteen song?



Am I the only one sittin' here/ Still holdin' on, holdin' back my tears/ For the ones who paid with the lives they gave/ God bless the U.S.A.

According to a Monday report from Taste of Country, Lewis' song has become just the ninth song ever to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.

The outlet added that as of July 12, the single is the No. 2 all-genre sales song in the country and has sold more digital singles in one week than any other country song over the previous three years, and Variety reports that Big Machine's subsidiary label Valory will start going for radio play on July 26.

What are the details?

According to a Saturday report from Variety, Borchetta heartily defended Lewis' single after leftist industry blogger Bob Lefsetz criticized the label for producing what Lefsetz said was a clearly divisive song.

In a Thursday blog post, Lefsetz castigated Lewis' single and wrote, ""It's HEINOUS!""

""This middle-class, right-wing wanker has recorded a song that should have been played at CPAC in between speeches by nitwits like Lauren Boebert saying to refuse the 'Fauci Ouchie,'"" he added during the takedown and personally slammed Borchetta for allowing the song to run.

He continued, ""Why does Valory release such crap. Come on Scott Borchetta, David Geffen dropped the Geto [sic] Boys over their odious lyrics and now you're marketing this junk? ... Come on, Scott, get your head out of your rear end. How much money are you gonna make here anyway, and it is all about money at this point, right?""

In a response to Lefsetz's posts, Borchetta wrote, ""Firstly, I believe in the First Amendment. My job has never been to tell my artists what to sing and write about.""

He continued, ""Aaron Lewis and I have political disagreements. But there are also things we agree on. I think that's the foundation for the idea of our country. It doesn't work if we're so divided that we can't reach across the aisle, have a conversation or an argument, and ultimately shake hands. If we can't do that, and this moment is so divisive, we may never get our country back.""

""To just 'cancel' (drop) Aaron is ridiculous and I'm disappointed that you would even suggest such a thing,"" Borchetta added. ""Comparing Aaron Lewis to the Ghetto Boys? That's a reach and a half. You don't have to agree or acknowledge, but Aaron's message is speaking to millions of people. Let it be a wake up call to reps and dems alike — be loud and be heard! It woke you up. It inspired you to make a statement. It worked. And it's working. It's inspiring conversation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/record-label-ceo-defends-aaron-lewis-song,2021-07-20
Remains of kidnapped teen found in Arizona desert 9 days after grandfather shot,"A teen is dead, and his grandfather is recovering from his injuries after a horrific home invasion in Arizona was caught on surveillance video earlier this month.

Around 3:15 a.m. on December 19, two armed suspects wearing baseball caps crept inside a home in Phoenix, Arizona. Within moments, a grandfather, who was asleep, was shot, and 17-year-old Jesse Sainz Camacho was taken hostage. Camacho was then forced into ""a dark colored sedan"" and driven away, a police report stated.

One neighbor and former classmate of Camacho claimed he heard the shooting that night through his bedroom window. ""I was awake around two-ish, talking to my friends on the phone,"" the witness claimed. ""And then, I hear gunshots.""

Camacho's deceased body was ultimately recovered nine days later at a remote location somewhere in Maricopa County. Investigators have not disclosed the exact location or a cause of death.

The suspects have not been identified and remain on the loose. However, police are confident that the two men were after Camacho, not his grandfather. ""Jesse was actually the intended target in that home invasion,"" Sgt. Philip Krynsky asserted.

Though police would appreciate the public's help in apprehending the suspects, they caution that the men should be considered dangerous. ""We don’t suggest that you approach these individuals,"" said Sgt. Krynsky. ""Just give us whatever information you have, so detectives can work those leads and ... hold these individuals responsible for what they did.""

Krynsky also attempted to reassure the public that law enforcement officers have no intention of giving up on this case until they see justice served.

""Obviously, [the crime] hurts our community,"" he said. ""We want to make sure we get these individuals off the street. We don’t want there to be any more violence with this. So again, we are looking for you, we’re gonna identify you and hold you accountable.""

The grandfather, whose name and age have not been released, is expected to survive his injuries.

Rep. Ilhan Omar stands with Venezuelan dictator Maduro,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said in an interview that she ""absolutely"" did not support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, and that she thought that the aid that the United States was sending into that country was a pretext for an eventual military invasion of Venezuela.

What's happening in Venezuela?

Venezuela's current leader, Nicolás Maduro, was re-elected in 2018 with 68 percent of the vote in what was largely condemned by the international community as a fraudulent election.

Under Maduro's leadership, the economy of Venezuela has spiraled out of control. Venezuelans have reportedly taken to eating garbage in order to survive.

As the leader of the National Assembly, Guaido declared himself to be the legal interim president according to the guidelines laid out in the Venezuelan constitution. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most of South America and Europe have thrown their support behind Guaido and recognized him as the rightful leader of the country.

Russia and China have supported Maduro's regime, while Mexico, Uruguay, and Vatican City have all called for a dialogue between the two sides.

The U.S., Brazil, and Colombia recently tried to send supplies to the starving Venezuelan people. Soldiers loyal to Maduro have violently blocked these aid shipments from entering the country.

Prominent Democrats, including Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and former Vice President Joe Biden have joined the Trump administration in expressing their support for Guaido. Pelosi even met with an ambassador representing Guaido on Jan. 13.

What did Rep. Omar say?

When Omar was asked, during an interview with The Intercept, what she wanted to see happen in Venezuela, she spoke out against what she said were American threats.

Well the constitution of Venezuela says that there needs to be an election called within 30 days and we're waiting for that to happen. What we should be involved in is having diplomatic conversations and bringing people to the table and being a partner in facilitating that. But we are threatening, we are threatening intervention. We're sending humanitarian aid that is in the guise of, you know, eventually invading this country and the people of the country don't want us there.

Asked if she joined the U.S. government in supporting Guaido, she replied ""absolutely not.""

She also clarified that she was ""certainly"" trying to move the Democratic Party's foreign policy further to the left.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-says-she-absolutely-does-not-support-maduro-opponent-juan-guaido,2019-03-01
Report: Biden admin gave China intelligence on Russia in bid for help — then China handed it off to Russia,"President Joe Biden's diplomatic strategy in Russia has been roundly criticized in recent days following Russian President Vladimir Putin's launch of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine over and against the U.S. president's wishes.

In the months preceding the invasion, Biden resolved to appeal to Putin's reason, urging him to ""return to diplomacy"" for the sake of Russia's ""credibility worldwide."" The strategy failed. Under threat of certain sanctions, but never military resistance, Putin went ahead with the unprovoked assault.

But Biden's mismanagement of the situation may have been worse than previously understood. According to an eye-opening new report from the New York Times published Friday, the Biden administration since late last year endeavored to enlist Chinese assistance, only to have its plan turned on its head.

What are the details?

Unnamed U.S. officials told the Times that over the past three months, senior administration officials arranged urgent meetings with Beijing during which they shared intelligence showing Russia's troop build-up on the Ukraine border in hopes that China would step in and tell Russia not to invade.

Each time, the officials said the Chinese rebuffed the Americans, playing coy about Russia's intentions — and at least one time, the Chinese turned around to hand over the intelligence to Moscow.

""After one diplomatic exchange in December, U.S. officials got intelligence showing Beijing had shared the information with Moscow, telling the Russians that the United States was trying to sow discord — and that China would not try to impede Russian plans and actions,"" the Times reported.

The account indicates that the Biden administration began its farfetched, if not foolhardy, Chinese outreach following a video summit held between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Nov.15. Over the course of the next few months, administration officials engaged China with similar diplomatic efforts as they did with Russia.

They warned that economic sanctions on Russia could hurt China, as well, and argued that because China was widely seen as a partner to Russia, its global image would suffer if it stood idly by while Russia invaded, the Times reported.

""But their entreaties went nowhere,"" the paper added.

The account raises concerns about the White House's naivety regarding Russia and China, the U.S.'s two strongest adversarial powers.

In a statement to the Times, Chinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said, “For some time, China has actively promoted the political settlement process of the Ukraine issue.”

What else?

Biden so far has been somewhat tepid in his response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, though that is not an assessment the president would give himself. In a press conference Thursday, Biden announced a slew of new sanctions on Russia that he said would be ""devastating.""

But when reporters questioned whether more could be done — such as personally sanctioning Putin and booting Russia from SWIFT, an international banking system — Biden suggested that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the current sanctions are ""working.""

Critics slammed the president for not meeting the urgency of the moment. The pressure may have worked because, on Friday, Biden reversed course on one of those items.

CNN reported that the U.S. would move quickly to freeze assets belonging to Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergeĭ Lavrov. Earlier in the day, the European Union and U.K. also announced sanctions against the two officials.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-biden-admin-gave-china-intelligence-on-russia-in-bid-for-help-then-china-handed-it-off-to-russia,2022-02-25
Report: Biden officials made requests to Israel that mirrored demands from Hamas terrorists,"When tensions flared between Israel and Palestine two weeks ago, the Biden administration reportedly made requests of Israel that mirrored demands from Hamas terrorists, who have controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007.

What is the background?

Growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over on May 10 when Hamas began firing missiles at Israel.

Prior to the military escalation, Hamas had demanded Israel remove their security forces from and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which sits on the Temple Mount, a site holy to Jews and Muslims.

Israeli security forces only entered the compound after increasing violence from Palestinian activists. ""Anger had been mounting for weeks among Palestinians ahead of a now-delayed Israeli court ruling on whether authorities were able to evict dozens of Palestinians from the Old City's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and give their homes to Jewish settlers,"" the Guardian reported.

What did the Biden admin tell Israel?

As tensions escalated at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, top Biden administration officials reportedly spoke with their Israeli counterparts and made three demands of Israel.

The demands included canceling evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and canceling the annual Jerusalem Day flag parade.

Axios reported:

[W]ith tensions escalating fast, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had called his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, while Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke to the director general of the Israeli foreign ministry, Alon Ushpiz.



The Biden administration had three immediate demands of Israel: stop the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah, lower tensions on the Temple Mount and cancel the annual Jerusalem Day flag parade, during which Israeli nationalists celebrate the unification of Jerusalem under Israeli control.

Israel reportedly rejected U.S. requests, though, as Axios noted, it appeared that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to thwart further escalation.

""[Netanyahu] asked the Supreme Court to postpone its verdict on the evictions, banned visits by Jews to the Temple Mount and rerouted the flag parade so it wouldn't pass through the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City,"" Axios reported.

What were Hamas' demands?

A Hamas spokesperson told Newsweek their goal in attacking Israel was ""to have the Israeli occupation authorities accept our demands.""

Those demands included ""giving free access to worshipers from all parts of Palestine to pray at Al Aqsa Mosque without restriction or harassment by the Israeli police or the Israeli settlers and halting the attempts to expel the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah,"" the Hamas spokesperson told the media outlet.

An Israeli official reportedly responded to the demands by explaining they were ""already and partially the policy of Israel,"" as indicated by Axios' report.

Report: Massachusetts school bans 'The Odyssey' as progressives demand purge of classics,"A Massachusetts school has reportedly removed ""The Odyssey"" from its English curriculum as progressive education activists and critical race theory ideologues seek to ""disrupt texts"" by purging material they deem objectionable from classrooms.

Meghan Cox Gurdon, in an opinion column for the Wall Street Journal, wrote about a ""sustained effort"" by ""critical-theory ideologues, schoolteachers and Twitter agitators"" to ""deny children access to literature."" These activists object to classic texts, such as Homer's Odyssey or Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter,"" because they allege such texts may teach ""racism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate.""

""The subtle complexities of literature are being reduced to the crude clanking of 'intersectional' power struggles,"" Gurdon wrote.

She quoted from an article by young-adult novelist Padma Venkatraman published in the School Library Journal, that claims ""challenging old classics is the literary equivalent of replacing statues of racist figures.""

""[E]xposing young people to stories in which racism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate are the norm may sow seeds of bias that can grow into indifference or prejudice,"" Venkatraman wrote.

""Racism in classics can't be negated merely by alerting young readers to its presence,"" she continued. ""Unless we have the time, energy, attention, expertise, and ability to foster nuanced conversations in which even the shyest readers feel empowered to engage if they choose, we may hurt, not help. Pressuring readers of color to speak up also removes free choice and can be harmful.""



She further claimed, ""Insisting on exposing diverse children to racist classics in which they see characters like themselves demeaned, or, at best, entirely excluded, is not just insensitive, but downright cruel,"" but she does not advocate banning classic texts from the classroom.

""I'm not advocating we ban classics. Or erase the past. Classics are undoubtedly examples of excellent writing, or they wouldn't have survived the test of time. I'm just suggesting we study classics in social studies classrooms, where inherent ideas of inequity are exposed and examined,"" Venkatraman clarifies.

However, Gurdon's column provided examples of other activists that indeed want to outright ban classics.

Ninth-grade English teacher Heather Levine, who works for Lawrence Public Schools in Massachusetts, celebrated the fact that ""The Odyssey"" was removed from the school curriculum in response to a tweet calling the epic poem about the Greek mythological hero Odysseus ""trash.""

Gurdon contacted Levine to confirm that the school banned the Odyssey, but was told her inquiry was ""invasive."" The English Department chairman of Lawrence Public Schools did not return Gurdon's multiple requests for comment.

Seattle English teacher Evin Shinn in 2018 tweeted that he'd ""rather die"" than teach ""The Scarlet Letter"" in class.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-massachusetts-school-bans-the-odyssey,2020-12-28
Reporter confronts Psaki over Biden's own words promising Putin's days of intimidating US allies would be over with him in WH,"Fox News reporter Peter Doocy grilled White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday over the Biden administration's response to Russian aggression and the invasion of Ukraine.

What is the background?

While campaigning for president, Biden claimed several times that Russian President Vladimir Putin feared the possibility of him being elected president.

""Putin knows that if I am president of the United States his days of tyranny and trying to intimidate the United States and those in eastern Europe are over. I'm going to stand up to him — he's a bully,"" Biden said in 2019.

In February 2020, Biden also said, ""Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be president. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe to toe with him.""

What is the background?

During the White House press briefing, Doocy confronted Psaki with Biden's words and asked how they are consistent with the administration's current response in light of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""It’s two and a half years later. [Putin] is intimidating the United States and those in Eastern Europe. What happened?"" Doocy asked.

In response, Psaki said Biden has ""rallied the world"" to push back against Putin, a claim that seems a bit disconnected from reality considering that Putin has thus far moved forward with his military operation in Ukraine.

""I’d hardly put it that way,"" Psaki said. ""I would look at it, actually, from the prism of: The United States and President Biden has rallied the world, rallied Europe to stand up against the efforts and the actions of President Putin.""

""You don’t think people who are totally strapped for cash,"" Doocy tried to respond as Psaki talked over him, ""right now are intimidated by $4 gas, $5 gas, however high you guys think it’s going to go? Something like that is not intimidating?""

""You asked me if we were intimidated by President Putin, and I think the evidence of that doesn’t exist,"" Psaki shot back before abruptly moving onto the next reporter.

Earlier in the briefing, Doocy also questioned whether the Biden administration still believes the biggest threat to the U.S. is climate change. Doocy was referring to remarks Biden made last June, when he claimed that top military commanders told him global warming is ""the greatest threat facing America.""

Psaki responded by pointing Doocy to the Pentagon, and she did not answer the question directly. Instead, she reiterated that Biden ""has no intention of sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight in Ukraine.""

Doocy also pressed Psaki on the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions against Russia, considering Biden administration officials have made it clear they believe Putin is determined to press forward with operations against Ukraine.

""Why do you guys think that sanctions are going to stop Putin if his goal ultimately is to redraw the map so it looks like it did 70 or 80 years ago? What sanction is going to stop him from doing that?"" Doocy asked.

Describing sanctions as a ""powerful tool,"" Psaki explained the Biden administration's ""intention is to have a deterrent effect"" and to ""prevent a large-scale invasion"" of Ukraine. She also said sanctions are ""not an end"" and claimed the sanctions are working.

She did not, however, address specifically how the sanctions will stop Putin from redrawing the eastern European map.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-confronts-psaki-over-biden-s-own-words-promising-putin-s-days-of-intimidating-us-allies-would-be-over-with-him-in-wh,2022-02-23
Reporter embarrasses Kamala Harris by exposing contradiction in Russia response: 'What leverage do you really have?',"A reporter exposed the contradictory messaging of the White House on Sunday upon confronting Vice President Kamala Harris over the Biden administration's response to looming war in Eastern Europe.

Harris — whom President Joe Biden dispatched to Germany last week to address Russia's seeming impending invasion of Ukraine — claimed on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has made his decision"" to invade Ukraine.

But on Sunday, Harris also claimed the Biden administration is prepared to authorize crippling economic sanctions that she alleged would devastate the Russian economy. The measures, according to Harris, would deter Putin from invading Ukraine and triggering the biggest European war since World War II.

What happened?

So, which is it, Madam Vice President? Has Putin made his decision to go to war, or can the U.S. deter him? That is the contradiction a reporter exposed on Sunday during a press conference with Harris before she returned to the U.S.

""If you believe Putin has made up his mind, what leverage do you really have? Why not put those sanctions in place now?"" the reporter asked.

Harris, however, failed to answer the question or address the glaring contradiction between her claims.

""The purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence,"" Harris responded. ""But let’s also recognize the unique nature of the sanctions that we have outlined. These are some of the greatest sanctions, if not the strongest that we’ve ever issued, as I articulated yesterday. It is directed at institutions — in particular, financial institutions — and individuals, and it will exact absolute harm for the Russian economy, and their government.""

""But if Putin has made up his mind, do you feel that this threat that has been looming is really going to deter him?"" the reporter asked again.

""Absolutely,"" Harris responded before engaging in word salad.

""We strongly believe — and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States, but a shared perspective among our allies. And the allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because — remember, also — we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment,"" Harris continued. ""And within the context then of the fact that that window is still opening — although it is absolutely narrowing — but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that if the U.S. truly believes a Russian invasion of his country is imminent, then the U.S. should enact the economic sanctions immediately, Politico noted. The White House has not explained why sanctions have yet to be placed on Russia.

Biden extended an olive branch to Putin on Sunday, offering to hold a diplomatic summit with the Russian president in hopes of staving off war. But Putin rejected Biden's offer.

Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence indicates that Russia is moving forward with plans to invade Ukraine, CBS News reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-embarrasses-kamala-harris-by-exposing-contradiction-in-russia-response,2022-02-21
"Reports: Christian missionaries under fire for sharing the gospel, handing out Bibles while giving aid to Ukrainian refugees","Samaritan's Purse, Jews for Jesus, and other Christian groups aiding Ukrainian refugees in Europe and Israel are being criticized for ""weaponizing"" humanitarian aid by also sharing their faith, according to reports surfacing online.

What are the details?

The missionary groups have reportedly been coupling evangelistic efforts with the provision of humanitarian aid to the tens of thousands of Ukrainian residents who have fled the country amid Russia's unprovoked invasion.

They are routinely handing out Bibles and sharing the gospel message with the refugees while also providing them with food, shelter, medicine, and other physical needs.

""Ukrainian families are hurting and in desperate need of physical aid and prayer during this difficult time,"" Samaritan’s Purse president and evangelist Franklin Graham said to the Tribune Papers earlier this month. ""We are deploying life-saving medical care to aid people who are suffering. We want to meet the needs of these families in their darkest moments while pointing them to the light and hope of Jesus Christ.""

Susan Perlman, one of the founders of Jews for Jesus, an organization with a staff spread across Eastern Europe, told the Times of Israel in a statement, ""We give people food and medicine and Bibles and gas for their cars to get them moving. We see the Bible as just as practical as all these other things.""

For these groups and others, the efforts are an attempt to model Jesus' behavior and obey his commands to help the suffering and spread the gospel to all nations.

But not everyone sees the evangelistic efforts as appropriate.

What has been the reaction?

In a report published on OpIndia, a staff writer complained that ""preying upon the vulnerable has always been the standard modus operandi of the evangelist missionaries.""

""This very same strategy is back in action, this time in Ukraine, as millions fleeing the war are being targeted by American missionaries for conversion,"" the report said. ""As the refugees look to cross over to Poland and relative safety, they are being pestered by American preachers asking them to 'love Jesus.'""

The article specifically cited Samaritan's Purse as one of the missionary agencies supposedly doing more harm than good by sharing their religious beliefs.

Others took issue with Messianic Jewish groups sharing the gospel with specifically Jewish Ukrainian refugees.

Rabbi Tovia Singer, the head of Outreach Judaism, an organization set up to counter Christian missions to Jewish people, claimed Messianic groups were ""weaponizing humanitarian aid in order to share the gospel.""



Shannon Nuszen, who leads a nonprofit called Beyneynu that tracks Christian missionary activity in Jewish communities, added to the Times of Israel that such outreach efforts are ""disrespectful, offensive and sinister.""

“They are targeting vulnerable people who are looking for food and shelter to rob them of their faith,"" Nuszen said, adding that practices such as distributing Bibles are ""disrespectful, it’s crossing the line, it’s offensive. It’s not the way that a true friend would act.""

""They have their hands in any place where there are vulnerable Jews, whether it’s refugees, kids on college campuses, kids on summer vacation,"" she continued.

This disagreement holds special significance because Messianic Jews are ethnic Jews who believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah spoken of in Jewish tradition and literature, including the Old Testament. Practicers of Judaism believe the Messiah, or savior, is yet to come.

What else?

The Messianic groups, however, have responded to criticism by arguing the gospel is an essential part of their message and insisting that acceptance of Christ is in no way a prerequisite for receiving physical aid.

""We can’t help but pray for people, share the gospel with them. People are coming to know the Lord. It’s not in place of caring for their immediate physical needs, but it is a part of who we are,"" Perlman said. ""It’s not, 'You have to read this Bible in order to get help from us,' but we think that the Bible is a great source of help and encouragement and hope in times like these.""

Mitch Glaser, who runs New York-based Chosen People Ministries, a Messianic group helping care for around 230 people at a Christian camp outside Warsaw, shared a similar sentiment.

""We literally want to follow the model that Jesus set in the gospels, where he cared for people who were needy,"" Glaser said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reports-christian-missionaries-sharing-gospel-aid-ukrainian-refugees,2022-03-25
Massachusetts' Republican governor signs ban on conversion therapy for children,"Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker signed into law a bill prohibiting the use of conversion therapy on minors who identify as LGBTQ.

What are the details?



The new law bans medical practitioners from attempting to counsel children under the age of 18 into or out of their ""sexual orientation and gender identity.""

In March, the state legislature passed the bill unanimously in the Democrat-controlled Senate after it has overwhelmingly passed the state House.

Baker previously said that he would be "" inclined to support"" the bill if it made it to his desk.

According to WBUR-TV, such types of therapy is illegal in 14 other states and in the District of Columbia.

What have people said about this?

Arline Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, told the Boston Globe that he was grateful for Baker's move in ""moving so quickly to ban conversion therapy for minors.""

""Being LGBTQ is not an illness or a disease that needs to be cured,"" Isaacson insisted in a March statement. ""These fraudulent treatments are cruel and barbaric. And now thankfully, they are banned in Massachusetts.""

Andrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, said that the organization plans to pursue legal action against the law, insisting that the law denies ""critical mental health treatment to sexually confused youth.""

""This law is an extraordinarily invasive assault on the rights of parents to raise their children and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech for the counselors whose help they seek,"" he added.

In March, Beckwith insisted that the new law would do more harm than good, noting that it would eliminate ""options for struggling youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity and really takes away the rights of parents to find the treatment that is best for their children and their families.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republican-governor-signs-conversion-therapy-ban,2019-04-09
Republican lawmaker introduces bill saying no aid for Ukraine until the southern border is secured,"On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) introduced legislation that would prevent the United States from sending military aid to Ukraine until the U.S. southern border is secured.

Fox News reported that the Secure America’s Border First Act would prevent the United States from making any monetary obligations or commitments of personnel to assist Kyiv in staving off Russian invasion until there is “operational control” of the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I think it’s quite hypocritical if someone in the U.S. Congress is willing to expend the funds to secure a border overseas thousands of miles away while they’re not willing to secure our own border,” Rosendale said in an interview. “And we are witnessing not a threat, but we are witnessing an absolute invasion that is taking place right now.”

“We have war hawks on both sides of the aisle willing to go over there and spend American blood and treasure in Ukraine,” Rosendale continued, “What I’m saying is we’re not obligated and so at least the minimum we can do is secure our own border first if you are going to go over there and spend money.”

Rosendale’s bill stipulates that no funds are to be provided to Ukraine until the federal government finishes building the southern border wall and “operational control,” as defined by the 2006 Secure Fence Act, is achieved.

Noting the recent influx of illegal immigrants, Rep. Rosendale said, “We witnessed an invasion over the last year of two million individuals trying to get into the country, we’re not even sure how many of them have been successful, so let’s build the border wall system, let’s gain operational control of our southern border, and then we might be able to have a conversation about what we’re going to do overseas about securing someone else’s border.”

During the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Donald Trump made securing the southern border a core part of his campaign. Upon winning election, the former president signed an executive order to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall” and provide additional resources to officials on the southern border so they could effectively enforce the country’s immigration laws.

Since Joe Biden became president, the immigration crisis at the southern border has gotten significantly worse. In 2021, there were nearly 2 million illegal border crossings.

Republicans in Congress are prepared to subpoena Hunter Biden over his international business deals and content found on his laptop,"Republicans in the House of Representatives plan to subpoena Hunter Biden after the 2022 midterm elections and force him to answer a series of questions about his foreign business dealings and the contents of his infamous laptop.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), who currently serves as the House GOP conference chair, said, “We will subpoena Hunter Biden,” the New York Post reported.

Biden, the 52-year-old trouble child of the Biden family and youngest son of President Joe Biden, previously abandoned his personal laptop at a computer repair shop in Delaware in the Spring of 2019. The computer’s hard drive contained years’ worth of correspondence over emails and texts, legal documents, and photos that detailed the younger Biden’s international business ventures.

The owner of the computer repair shop made copies of the laptop’s hard drive and provided them to the FBI and Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and advisor to former President Donald Trump. Ultimately, the New York Post obtained a copy of the hard drive and ran an expose a month before the 2020 presidential election which was suppressed by Facebook and Twitter and largely ignored by legacy-corporate media.

At the time, Biden’s laptop was falsely dismissed by the media and many in the American intelligence community as “Russian propaganda.”

Accusing these entities of collaborating to benefit the First Family, Stefanik said, “It should concern every American that they did this for the Biden family’s financial gain, which came at the cost of our national security.”

One of the questions, Republicans in Congress are most seeking for an answer for from Biden is who the moniker “the big guy” refers to in emails to one of his business partners. “The big guy” is described as a partner in a Chinese business venture and is entitled to 10 percent of the venture’s profits; “the big guy’s” shares were to be held for him by Hunter Biden.

“That’s one of the critical questions — perhaps the most critical question,” said Stefanik.

Stefanik stated that she believes “the big guy” is none other than Hunter’s father, Joe Biden.

Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter’s, said that there is “no question” that Joe Biden was “the big guy.”

“The American people absolutely deserve answers,” Stefanik said. “There is no greater ethical concern or frankly conspiracy … whether this president is compromised because of his illegal ties to his family members.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-in-congress-are-prepared,2022-03-27
Republicans want greater oversight for weapon shipments to Ukraine — only 10% of U.S. weapons have been inspected in person,"The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in first-world weaponry to Ukraine since its invasion by Russia. House Republicans, poised to take control of Congress in January, are now pressuring the Biden administration for greater accountability and transparency about these weapons transfers as well about other aid packages sent to the embattled Slavic nation.

The push for greater oversight comes after it was revealed that there have only been two in-person weapons inspections conducted by U.S. monitors since February.



Some accountability at last

Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told CNN in early November that there ""has to be accountability going forward.""

Underlining his support for Ukraine, McCarthy said, ""You always need, not a blank check, but [to] make sure the resources are going where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.""

Another GOP lawmaker clarified to CNN, ""McCarthy was not saying, 'We wouldn't spend money.' McCarthy was saying, 'We're gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend.' ... A 'blank check' means that people get whatever they ask for. What we're saying is there's going to be some thought, there's going to be accountability.""

The New York Post reported that Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, indicated that Republicans continue to support aid to Ukraine, but on the condition that it's clear where it's going and that there is accountability for how it's utilized.

""We have a voice now, and we're going to do this in an accountable way, with transparency to the American people,"" said McCaul. ""These are American taxpayer dollars doing in.""

Rep. Mike Turner, the ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, indicated funding will no longer be included in ""Democrat bills,"" whereby assistance for the Slavic nation is contingent upon Democrats getting what they want in the way of domestic funding for their pet projects.

""We don't need to pass $40 billion, large Democrat bills ... to send $8 billion to Ukraine,"" Turner told ABC's ""This Week.""

Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) suggested that oversight has been long been regarded as necessary for weapons shipments to countries far less corrupt than Ukraine. According to Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked 122nd out of 180 countries.

Waltz said, ""With the volumes of goods that we're pushing, it's our responsibility to have third-party oversight. We do it all over the world.""

On Nov. 17, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and other Republican lawmakers held a press conference to discuss taxpayer funding to aid Ukraine.

Greene, who introduced a privileged resolution to audit the funds allocated to Ukraine by Congress, noted that ""Congress has appropriated $54 billion to aid in the Ukrainian conflict, and then our president, Joe Biden, has requested another $38 billion this week.""



""The American people, the taxpayers of this country, deserve to know where their money is going and how it's being spent,"" said Greene.

In the press conference, Greene said that of the aforementioned $54 billion, $44 billion ""is for aid to Ukraine and other affected countries. But what other countries? And how are they affected? And how did the American people's taxpayer dollars go to those countries? And to who? And to what organization? To their government? And in what way?""



Although Greene's resolution will likely be shot down by Democrats in the House sometime in the next two weeks, the Washington Post indicated that not all Democrats are opposed to clarity on how U.S. tax dollars are being deployed in Ukraine.

""The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it's intended to go,"" said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.).



Crow reportedly led an initiative in the House Armed Services Committee to include in the defense bill instructions to the Pentagon inspector general to audit, investigate, and review the Pentagon's efforts to support Ukraine.

Although certain that various weapons will be inevitably be ""lost,"" Crow said, ""We're not trying to prevent every single piece from falling into the hands of the Russians, but we want to make sure it's not happening at a large scale.""

Unlike Greene and McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recommended that the House Republican caucus ""focus its oversight on ensuring timely delivery of needed weapons and greater allied assistance to Ukraine.""

By oversight, McConnell doesn't appear to be concerned about accountability but on faster and ""more proactive"" weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

Glaring lack of oversight

The budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development in 2021 was over $53 billion. It requested billions more for fiscal year 2022.



The Washington Post reported that despite these billions of dollars, the State Department allegedly cannot afford to have weapons inspectors in Ukraine check every incoming shipment.

As of early November, only two in-person inspections had been conducted by U.S. monitors since the war began. That means only 10% of the 22,000 U.S.-provided weapons requiring enhanced oversight, including Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, had been accounted for.

NBC News reported that it was only in October that Brig. Gen. Garrick Harmon, the U.S. defense attaché to Ukraine, had been dispatched to Ukraine to keep track of billions of dollars' worth of first-world weapons. Similar checks were terminated after Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

According to the State Department, included among the largely uninspected weaponry and systems committed to Ukraine are:

Over 1,600 Sting anti-aircraft systems;

Over 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Over 38,000 other anti-armor systems;

Over 700 Switchblade drones;

142 155mm Howitzers plus 924,000 155mm artillery rounds;

4,000 precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds;

36 105mm Howitzers plus 180,000 105mm artillery rounds;

1,500 tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW) missiles;

8 national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (MASAMS) and munitions;

4 Avenger air defense systems;

20 Mi-17 helicopters;

45 T-72B tanks;

200 MII3 armored personnel carriers;

Over 11,000 grenade launchers and small arms;

Over 84 million rounds of small arms ammunition;

58 coastal and riverine patrol boats; and

plenty of other defensive, offensive, protective, and explosive equipment, systems, and military vehicles.

While downplaying the possibility that unaccounted-for weapons might end up on the black market, the State Department conceded both that ensuring American weaponry makes it into the right hands can be ""difficult"" owing to the ""chaotic nature of combat"" and that Russia may be able to capture these weapons to ""develop countermeasures, propaganda, or to conduct false-flag operations.""



According to the Post, the Arms Export Control Act requires the Biden administration to provide ""reasonable assurance"" that the recipients of the billions of dollars' worth of weaponry are using them for their intended purposes.

With weapons going missing and so few incoming U.S. weapons inspected in Ukraine, it is unlikely a reasonable assurance can be given at the present time.

In April, one senior defense official told reporters, ""I couldn't tell you where [helicopters, cannons, and Switchblade drones] are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point. ... They're not telling us every round of ammunition they're firing and who and at when.""

National Security Council coordinator John Kirby suggested that weapons provided by the Pentagon were usually picked up by Ukrainian armed forces in Poland and then driven into Ukraine. Afterward, ""it's up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they're allocated inside their country.""

On July 22, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation issued a statement, warning that ""the proliferation of firearms and explosives in Ukraine could lead to an increase in firearms and munitions trafficked into the EU via established smuggling routes or online platforms. This threat might even be higher once the conflict has ended.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-want-greater-oversight-for-weapon-shipments-to-ukraine,2022-11-28
"Armed intruder allegedly tried to break into an apartment in Ohio, but the occupant had a gun, too — and used it","A man shot and killed an armed intruder Sunday night at an apartment complex in a suburb outside Columbus, Ohio, WSYX-TV reported.

The intruder, who was armed with a gun, allegedly tried to force his way into the residence. But the occupant had a gun, too, and decided to use it to protect himself and his property.

The incident reportedly took place about 8:30 p.m. on the 800 block of Falcon Hunter Way.

The resident who allegedly neutralized the intruder called 911 Sunday night to report the crime and his subsequent actions.

He told police that he was in the process of answering the door after someone had knocked when a man with a gun suddenly attempted to break into the apartment.

""Police are saying the man knocked on the door, and when the resident answered, that's when he found himself with a gun pointed at him,"" WBNS-TV reported. He said he quickly responded in self-defense by shooting the intruder in the chest while another man fled the scene.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found the alleged intruder suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest and performed CPR until being relieved by medics.

The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of his injuries but did not survive. None of those involved have been identified by police.

Police said they are still investigating the incident and looking into allegations about the second intruder, though they acknowledged his whereabouts are currently unknown. Nevertheless, police insisted that the community is no longer under an active threat.

"Rose McGowan sues Harvey Weinstein, his formal legal team, and private intelligence firm Black Cube for alleged attempt to silence her","Update 10/25/2019, 11:49 a.m. ET: McGowan issued a statement to TheBlaze regarding Weinstein's response denying the credibility of her lawsuit.

She told TheBlaze, ""Truth has never been their forté. The good news is that people are now seeing through their old-fashioned smear tactics. A greedy attention seeker, TERF, whore, crazy druggie... that's what they love to say about me. They are so lame, it's hard to put it into words.""

Original story continues below ...

Actress and activist Rose McGowan is suing embattled film executive Harvey Weinstein for reportedly trying to silence her and other victims of sexual assault, The Hollywood Reporter revealed.

McGowan has been the leading voice in the fight against Weinstein, who allegedly sexually assaulted her and myriad other women in Hollywood.

What are the details?

McGowan's suit alleges that Weinstein deployed ""fixers"" in order to salvage his tarnished reputation and to make sure that her accusations of his behavior weren't revealed in her best-selling 2018 memoir, ""Brave.""

McGowan claims to be a victim of racketeering, an invasion of privacy, fraud, and intentional inflection of emotional distress, and says that defendants are in violation of the Federal Wiretap Act.

According to the complaint, ""This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America's most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims. And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.""

McGowan insists that Weinstein's team attempted to steal a working draft of ""Brave"" when it discovered her book contained graphic depictions of a forced sexual encounter between the actress and the producer. McGowan also says that Weinstein and company attempted to buy her off when they were unable to procure the book by stealth.

The suit also names former Weinstein attorneys Lisa Bloom and David Boies and private intelligence agency Black Cube as defendants.

""Weinstein's campaign against McGowan and others involved some of the most powerful forces that money could buy,"" the suit adds. ""[Weinstein] enlisted prominent, media-savvy representatives David Boies and Lisa Bloom. He hired the international spy agency, Black Cube.""

McGowan filed the suit Wednesday in California federal court.

What are Weinstein's lawyers saying?

Phyllis Kupferstein, Weinstein's attorney, told The Hollywood Reporter that McGowan's claims are baseless.

""Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is; a publicity seeker looking for money,"" the statement said. ""From the moment she sought a multimillion dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this.

""We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit,"" the statement concluded.

Eric George, an attorney for Bloom, said that McGowan's suit is not ""credible.""

""It is inexcusable that Ms. McGowan chose to include my client in her lawsuit,"" George told the outlet. ""Facts matter. There is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.""

What else?

McGowan preemptively addressed any fallout from her suit on social media Wednesday night.

""I'm preparing for the smear campaign to begin again,"" she tweeted. ""If you start reading horrible things about me on Instagram, Twitter or FB, understand that they are likely bots being paid for to damage my reputation. If you start reading sites that trash me, know where it's coming from, an indicted rapist and his fixers. I tell the truth to power, I've done it my whole life. I'm not perfect, but I know I am a good person who fights for the voiceless. If it's happening to me, it can happen to all of us. Here's to justice, yours and mine. #RoseArmy.""

Russia and China agreed to a 'no limits' relationship at the Beijing Olympics,"The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing are off to a strong start for America’s enemies.

During the first day of the Winter Olympics, China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership. Chinese and Russian leadership agreed to support each other in their respective efforts to expand their borders to include the currently independent nations of Taiwan and Ukraine.

According to Reuters, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the two came to the consensus that their new relationship was “superior to any Cold War-era alliance” and that the two nations “would work together on space, climate change, artificial intelligence and control of the internet.”

Reuters reports that Xi Jinping supported Russia’s demands to exclude Ukraine from NATO and Vladimir Putin agreed to oppose any form of national independence for Taiwan. Both China and Russia have become increasingly aggressive as they seemingly prepare to invade sovereign nations they believe are theirs to reclaim.

Daniel Kritenbrink, the State Department’s leading East Asia diplomat, said, “If Russia further invades Ukraine and China looks the other way, it suggests that China is willing to tolerate or tacitly support Russia’s efforts to coerce Ukraine.”

President Putin endorsed China’s stance that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China.”

Whereas Russia continues to insist that it is not planning an invasion of Ukraine, Xi Jinping has made clear that it is a matter of “when” and not “if” China makes a move on Taiwan.

Xi Jinping condemned the membership of NATO and how its member states continually inflate their influence while excluding Russia. The Chinese President also supported Russia’s demands for security guarantees from its rivals in Western Europe.

In a joint statement, Russia and China said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” This new agreement pushes the two country’s friendship to new levels.

During the Xi-Putin meeting, China agreed to a natural gas deal with Russia estimated to be valued around $118 billion and Putin promised to increase exports to China.

This agreement marks the most detailed and aggressive statement of Russia and China’s efforts to recalibrate the global pecking order by unseating the United States as the hegemon. And, the symbolism of its timing cannot be understated. During an international festival that the United States subjected to a diplomatic boycott, America’s two greatest geopolitical rivals more-or-less agreed to usurp the United States.

Russia and China may not be formally allied, but the countries’ new agreement brings them closer than ever before.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-and-china-agreed-to-a-no-limits-relationship-at-the-beijing-olympics,2022-02-05
"Nearly 2,000 arrested at anti-war protests across Russia; prominent Russians rail against Ukraine invasion, including daughter of Putin's spokesperson","Thousands of Russians have poured into streets across the country to participate in anti-war protests. Even prominent Russians have demonstrated their frustration with Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine, and some have purportedly faced retaliation from the Kremlin.

Massive anti-war protests across Russia

Russian authorities arrested at least 1,866 people in 60 cities who had been participating in anti-war protests since Thursday, according to OVD Info – a Russia-based human rights organization that monitors political persecutions.

There were huge protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg condemning Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

Prominent Russians rail against invasion of Ukraine

There were also prominent Russians dissenting against their president's decision to invade Ukraine.

Ivan Urgant – a popular talk show host on state-run Channel One, posted a black square on Instagram with the caption: ""Fear and pain. No to war.""

The Guardian reported, ""His show has not gone on air since. Channel One has claimed it is just a scheduling issue, although several reports in Russian media say that they have been blacklisted.""

A Channel One spokesperson told the Associated Press that the decision to remove Urgant's show from the schedule was not related to his anti-war post on social media. The television network said they had made a programming decision to replace entertainment shows with news and political shows ""because of the current situation.""

Rapper Oxxxymiron canceled six sold-out Moscow and St. Petersburg shows because of Russia's aggression.

""I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine,"" Oxxxymiron, whose real name is Miron Fyodorov, said. ""When residents of Kyiv are forced to hide in basements and in the metro, while people are dying.""



""I know that most people in Russia are against this war, and I am confident that the more people would talk about their real attitude to it, the faster we can stop this horror,"" Fyodorov said, according to the New York Times. ""This is a crime and a catastrophe.""

Yuri Shevchuk, frontman of the Soviet-era rock band DDT, blasted Putin's decision by saying, ""We're being pulled like through an ice hole into the past, into the 19th, 18th, 17th centuries. And people refuse to accept it.""

Elena Chernenko, a veteran journalist for the Moscow-based Kommersant newspaper, published an open letter voicing her opposition to the war in Ukraine. More than 280 other journalists signed her letter, including some who are employed at state-run news agencies.

Despite not criticizing the government directly, Chernenko was expelled from the Foreign Ministry pool, which she had covered for more than 11 years. The Kremlin said she was removed from the pool for ""unprofessional"" behavior.

Chernenko told the Guardian that there was ""nothing complicated"" about writing the letter.

""It was a spontaneous reaction,"" Chernenko explained. ""My country has started a military operation against another … but we’re for diplomacy, we’re for the UN charter, moral values, brotherly nations, and all that. And I had the feeling that this is the wrong path.""



Daughters of influential Russians oppose Vladimir Putin's aggression

The daughter of billionaire and Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich posted an anti-Putin message on social media. The daughter of Abramovich, who has a net worth of $13.5 billion and owns the world's second-largest yacht, shared a post on Instagram that stated: ""The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin.""



Even the daughter of Putin's own spokesperson called for an end to the war with Ukraine. Yelizaveta Peskova, the 24-year-old daughter of Dmitry Peskov, posted an anti-war message on social media.

Newsweek reported, ""The 24-year-old posted 'HET BOЙHE' (or 'no to war' in English) to her Telegram account."" The post was later deleted.

Coincidentally, Dmitry Peskov attempted to pacify protesters by claiming that Putin ""hears everyone's opinion."" The spokesperson added that Putin also knows ""the share of those who have a different point of view and those who are sympathetic to such a necessary operation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-antiwar-protests-ukraine-invasion,2022-02-25
"Video: Russia attacks airports, hospitals, apartment buildings in Ukraine, is reportedly 'making a move on Kyiv' to overthrow government","The Russian military has attacked airports and damaged hospitals and apartment buildings amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to videos shared online and reports from multiple outlets on Thursday.

What are the details?

Despite claiming that the Russian military would target only military installations in a so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, it quickly became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in the neighboring country matched an all-out war, in which widespread civilian casualties are possible.

Footage obtained by the New York Times appeared to show a mass of airstrikes hitting an airport in Hostomel, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Subsequent reporting from CNN indicated that Russian forces had seized control of the facility, though Ukraine's military had apparently launched a counteroffensive.

More video of that attack was also posted online.

A hospital in southeastern Ukraine was also struck by ballistic missile fire Thursday in an apparently targeted attack. Amnesty International reportedly verified the attack and claimed it killed at least two civilians. The group noted that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law.

Ukraine's health minister, Viktor Lyashko, claimed that more hospitals are now being targeted by Russian forces.

Additionally, Russian rocket fire destroyed an apartment building near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The New York Times posted footage of firefighters and other first responders putting out flames and clearing debris from what remained of the building.

Video uploaded by the Daily Wire appeared to show a missile striking a building directly adjacent to a home with a woman and her children inside.

BuzzFeed News documented the extent of the devastation by posting a series of pictures online.

What else?



In all, the Russian military claimed Thursday it has overtaken 74 military installations, including 11 airfields. Ukraine has reported that at least 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed so far.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is focused on three main axes of assault: a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and a northeast-to-south approach near Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently happening.

The defense official, offering the information as part of an operational update, said Russia clearly intends is to overtake key population centers and is ""making a move on Kyiv,"" NBC News reported.

Russia has ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance,"" the defense official said.

They added that Russia's maneuvering so far is not surprising and ""is very much in line with what was expected."" U.S. intelligence predicted days ago that a full-scale invasion was imminent.

Russia bans comedian Jim Carrey and 99 other Canadians over their opposition to the invasion of Ukraine,"The Russian Federation banned comedian Jim Carrey and 99 other Canadians over their opposition to President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Also included in the ban was author Margaret Atwood, the creator of ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" and other prominent Canadian politicians, business people, and celebrities.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that the Canadian government would send another $500 million in military aid to Ukraine while adding 23 Russians to Canada's sanctions list.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the 100 Canadians of being ""directly involved in the formation of an aggressive anti-Russian course"" in its statement about the ban.

""In response to the ongoing practice of imposing sanctions by the regime of Prime Minister J. Trudeau against the Russian leadership, politicians and parliamentarians, representatives of the business community, experts and journalists, cultural figures, as well as anyone whom the Canadian Russophobic authorities consider objectionable,"" the statement read, ""entry is closed on the basis of reciprocity for 100 Canadian citizens.""

In April, Carrey posted an endorsement of a documentary about Alexei Navalny, a political opposition figure in Russia.

""Navalny himself exposes Czar Putin and his soulless minions in their fiendish conspiracy to poison him, suppress the truth and intimidate the Russian people,"" he tweeted.

Atwood was among more than 1,000 writers who signed an open letter in February condemning the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's invasion is in its eighth month and has suffered a major setback as Ukrainians have been able to push Russian soldiers out of the key city of Kherson. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy made a surprise visit to the city and condemned Russia for what he said was evidence of over 400 war crimes.

U.S. officials have reportedly pressed Zelenskyy to negotiate peace terms with Russia, but his list of demands is unlikely to be agreed upon by Putin, who has repeatedly claimed Ukraine belongs to Russia.

China provides rhetorical cover for Russia and their 'new model of international relations',"In recent days, China has amped up its rhetorical support for Russia in a direct slight to the U.S. and other nations who had hoped that Beijing would opt to condemn Moscow for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said, “An important takeaway from the success of China-Russia relations is that the two sides rise above the model of military and political alliance in the Cold War era.”

Zhao suggested that China and Russia are able to collaborate so effectively because the countries and their leadership “commit themselves to developing a new model of international relations.”

Bloomberg reported that Zhao made this statement during a briefing Friday in Beijing.

Zhao emphasized that the “model” relationship between China and Russia is predicated on the two countries’ hesitance to cause confrontation between other nations and respecting the sovereignty of other states.

He added that this relationship broke with the “Cold War mentality” displayed by countries allied with the U.S. through geographic blocs like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping in March that there would be “implications and consequences” if the Chinese government provided any form of material support to their Russian counterparts over the invasion of Ukraine.

To date there has been no indication that China has supported the Russian invasion or helped the country skirt the Western sanctions that torpedoed its economy, but the Chinese government has provided “rhetorical support” for Russia by repeating its propaganda.

The Chinese government also repeatedly states that it will stand by the “no limits” relationship agreement that Presidents Putin and Xi agreed to at a private meeting between the two heads-of-staet before the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

During this meeting, Xi and Putin agreed to support each other in their respective efforts to expand their borders to include the independent nations of Taiwan and Ukraine, respectively.

The very existence and basis of this dynamic calls into question the validity of claims recently made by Zhao that Russia and China avoid confrontation with other nations on the international stage.

The reality is that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Chinese government’s blatant hostility towards Taiwan indicate that both nations are, in fact, dedicated to the military conquest of sovereign nations while meddling in their affairs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-china-new-model,2022-04-30
Russia and China will hold talks about a future joint venture regarding the construction of lunar base,"Russia and China plan to engage in a “detailed dialogue” about how to move forward with the construction of a base on the moon.

The Washington Examiner reported that Dmitry Rogozin, the chief executive of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said, “Before the end of May, I plan to hold detailed dialogue with our Chinese colleagues on our cooperation in this direction.”

The expansion of Russia and China’s collaborative efforts in space indicate the strengthening of the two countries’ relationship as they continue to find themselves at odds with the U.S. and its Western allies.

In recent months, since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Western relations in space have deteriorated. In February, in response to Western sanctions on the Russian economy, the Russian government threatened to crash the International Space Station into the Earth by ceasing to provide the satellite with the propulsion technology and resources necessary to keep it in orbit. The saga concluded with the Russian government withdrawing its support from the International Space Station program so long as Western sanctions remained in place.

For years, even during the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, Russian cosmonauts and American astronauts worked side-by-side on the International Space Station, but the International Space Station serving as a symbol of geopolitical peace between a post-soviet Russia and the West may very well be at an end.

Despite this, Russia cosmonauts are currently still aboard the International Space Station and will continue conducting experiments on a timeline established by the Russian government.

Speaking with TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Rogozin said, “We should not hustle now declaring our stance and will carry on with our work within the timeframe set by the government, which is until 2024. A decision regarding the [International Space Station’s] future will depend to a great extent on the developing situation both in Russia and around it.”

A crew of European and American astronauts arrived at the International Space Station earlier this week as Russia cosmonauts conducted a spacewalk lasting 7 hours and 42 minutes. The Russia cosmonauts used the spacewalk as an opportunity to display the Soviet era “Victory Banner” that first flew in Berlin at the end of World War Two.

Dmitry Strugovets, a Roscosmos spokesman, said, “Cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev voiced an idea several days ago to spread the Victory Banner in the open space and wrote about it to the Roscosmos press office.

According to BBC, the U.S. Department of State confirmed that Moscow notified them of the alleged arrest, but did not confirm the arrest or the man's name.

According to Reuters, the man was allegedly arrested on December 28th, but neither the United States nor Russia have commented on the nature of his alleged spying activity. The State Department has requested consular access to see the American citizen. A spokesperson told Reuters, ""We have requested this access and expect Russian authorities to provide it.""

Russian authorities indicated that they had opened a criminal case against the alleged spy, which could carry penalties of 10 to 20 years in prison.

Public accusations of spying have become more commonplace in recent years, as relations between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia have deteriorated since the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.

American authorities detained and charged Russian national Maria Butina with spying earlier this year. Butina pled guilty last week to a conspiracy charge, but Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the charges as a ""lie,"" saying, ""I don't understand what they jailed her for. There are no grounds.""

Russia debuts new hypersonic missiles in strike on Ukrainian munitions depot,"The war in Ukraine might be about to take a dark turn as Russian forces deploy the use of hypersonic missiles. This marks the first time Russian forces have used hypersonic missiles in combat.

The Kinzhal hypersonic missiles were used by Russian forces to destroy an underground ammunition storage facility in Delyatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.

The Daily Star reported that information on the attack remains scant but that Russia has long boasted about its hypersonic weapons arsenal which contains missiles that can evade traditional anti-missile defense systems.

These missiles include the 3M22 Zircon missile which is a low-flying rocket that is able to speed past early detection technologies. It, and other similar weapons in the Russian arsenal, have a range of around 1,000 kilometers.

The state-owned Russian television network, TV Zvezda, said that “The Russian Zircon hypersonic missile’s stealth features have been disclosed” indicating that this missile was, in fact, utilized against the Ukrainians.

“The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponent’s air defense system from detecting its impact in time,” the state-owned network boasted.

It continued by suggesting that “[the missile’s] launch will be known only after the target has been hit” and that the missile has “variable trajectory” making it difficult for even advanced defense systems to detect it.

Igor Krokhmal, the launching frigate’s commander, said, “No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target.”

The U.S. Sun reported that Krokkhmal said there won’t be anything that can counter the Zircon missile for years to come.

He said, “A surface target, a coastal target. I don’t think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.”

In December, when the missile was being tested, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “Zircon are our newest missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets.”

He added, “The [missile] tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly” and said that “this is a big event for our country, a significant step in improving Russia’s security, in increasing [our] defensive capability.”

Similarly, last-October, the Chinese government launched a nuclear capable hypersonic missile into space that was able to circle the globe without being detected.

The Long March rocket, operated by the China National Space Administration, purportedly caught American intelligence agencies by surprise.

Russian embassy in Ireland gets roasted over its outraged statement about a 'violation' of its territory,"The Russian embassy in Ireland faced mockery and ridicule on social media after it released a statement of outage against a ""violation"" of its territory.

The embassy released a statement from its official social media account Monday decrying an incident where a man drove a truck into the embassy gates.

""On March 7, 2022, 13:30pm, a large truck came over to the gates of the Embassy, pulled back and torn down the gates of the Embassy,"" the statement read in part.

""The Embassy strongly condemns this criminal act of insanity directed against peaceful diplomatic mission,"" the statement continued.

""The incident is cause of extreme concern. We believe that no people of sound mind could support such senseless and barbaric actions,"" the statement concluded.

Here's the statement from the embassy:

Many took to social media to excoriate the embassy for its outrage over such a small matter when Russia was accused of purposely shelling innocent civilians in Ukraine.

""It's not nice to have your home invaded and vandalised for no reason, is it?"" replied photographer Nicolas Chinardet.

""My Irish sources have informed me that the Russian Embassy gates attacked the lorry and it was forced to take special operations to save itself,"" joked another critic.

""You're gonna s*** when you see what your armed forces are up to in Ukraine,"" replied another detractor.

""After invading Ukraine and murduring innocent men, women, children and animals, the Russian embassy did in fact believe they could support senseless and barbaric actions,"" responded another user.

""I understand diplomacy, but expecting Irish to put up with Russians on their soil while Russians invade a country? Laughable,"" read another tweet.

""Wouldn’t be going about drawing too much attention to who is or isn’t violating international conventions at the moment, given the circumstances,"" said another user.

Others replied by posting scenes of horror from the invasion.

Still others pointed out that the embassy failed to tell the truth in its relatively short statement, since the driver of the bus had been arrested despite the embassy's claim that the Irish officers stood by and not intervened.

The man, later identified as Desmond Wisley, told onlookers that he had been overcome by photographs of a family that was killed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

""I want the Ambassador and his colleagues to leave this country, leave this free country,"" he said. ""It’s about time we stood up.""

Russia claims Facebook and Meta is an extremist organization,"Russian authorities have called for Facebook's parent company Meta to be categorized as an ""extremist organization,"" according to an Interfax report.

Earlier this month, Russia reportedly banned access to Facebook. Now, Russia's prosecutor general's office is attempting to label Facebook's parent company as an ""extremist organization.""

Last week, Facebook temporarily allowed users to post threats to Vladimir Putin and the Russian military forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

Now, Russia has declared the parent company of Facebook to be an ""extremist organization,"" while also restricting access to the Instagram application.

Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor claimed, ""Messages shared on Instagram encourage and provoke violent actions toward Russians.""

On Monday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded to the social media block: ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.""

Meanwhile, Facebook has enabled users to temporarily express violent posts calling for the death of Vladimir Putin and Russian military forces.

Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said, ""Our policies are focused on protecting people's rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country. The fact is, if we applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable.""

""We have no quarrel with the Russian people a d will not tolerate Russophobia or any kind of discrimination, harassment or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Meanwhile, Russia has made a crackdown on anti-war demonstrations and reportedly arrested nearly 800 people in 37 Russian cities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-facebook-meta-extrmist-organization,2022-03-14
Russia has begun a 'selective default' on foreign debts as it attempts to pay in rubles,"The S&P credit rating agency has said that Russia’s attempts to pay bondholders in rubles, not dollars, amount to defaults on the country’s foreign debt.

Russia has now attempted to pay holders of two dollar-denominated bonds that recently finished maturing with rubles, CNN Business reported. The S&P said that this amounted to a “selective default” because the people redeeming these bonds are likely unable to convert the rubles into “dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts.”

A “selective default” is declared when an entity has defaulted on a specific obligation but not on its entire debt.

The Russian government is currently in the middle of a 30-day grace period that began April 4 that will enable Moscow to make payments of capital and interest on the redeemed bonds. However, the S&P does not expect that Russia will be able to convert the bonds into dollars given the thoroughgoing sanctions placed on Russia by Western nations.

These sanctions undermine Russia’s “willingness and technical abilities to honor the terms and conditions” of its financial obligations to bond holders.

If Russia issues a full foreign currency default, it will be the country’s first in more than 100 years. The last time Russian leaders issued a default was after the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin rejected bonds that were previously issued by the regime of Tsar Nicholas II.

Currently, the Russian government cannot access the more than $310 billion it has stored in foreign currency reserves as a result of Western sanctions aggressively isolating the Russian economy. Up until last week, the U.S. allowed Russia to continue using some of these frozen assets to pay back specific investors with U.S. dollars.

Since then, the U.S. Treasury has blocked Russian banks from accessing its financial reserves held in American banks in a deliberate effort to diminish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ability to finance his military.

JPMorgan estimates that Russia had around $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of 2021, and it believes that half of that was held by foreign investors.

The Russian government remains defiant in the midst of this default and intends to take legal action at the international level so that investors can receive what they are owed.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, said, “We will sue, because we undertook all necessary action so that the investors would receive their payments.”

He said, “We will show the court proof of our payments, to confirm our efforts to pay in rubles, just as we did in foreign currency. It won’t be a simple process.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-has-begun-a-selective-default-on-foreign-debts-as-it-attempts-to-pay-in-rubles,2022-04-11
Russia is holding nuclear drills in response to Biden sending rockets to Ukraine,"The nuclear forces of Russia are holding drills in a region just northeast of Moscow.

The decision to begin these drills comes just one day after President Joe Biden announced his decision to send advanced missile system to Ukraine, the New York Post reported.

According to an independent news agency in Russia, around 1,000 Russian soldiers are taking part in intense maneuvers using more than 100 military vehicles, including Yars intercontinental missile launchers.

These drills are taking place in the Ivanovo Oblast, which is just under 200 miles northeast of Moscow.

The drills, which are said to be aimed at preparing Russia’s intercontinental missile systems for combat, required Russian soldiers to march more than 60 miles, camouflage sophisticated military equipment, and practice posting guard.

The training exercises also involved Typhoon-M armored counter-sabotage vehicles, which are said to be equipped with remotely operated weapon stations.

Russia’s nuclear drills commenced after Biden published an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday in which the president announced his administration’s intention to send anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and precision rocket systems to Ukraine.

In the editorial, Biden said, “We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.”

The president indicated that his administration’s priority of achieving a “sovereign and prosperous Ukraine” is more likely to be achieved if the U.S. provides the country with the weaponry and munitions required to dispel the invading Russian forces.

Biden wrote, “America’s goal is straightforward: We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.”

The president continued, “That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.”

The Biden administration’s plans to send weapons are an about-face from a position just previously held by the president in which he insisted that the U.S. would not deliver any rockets to Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government does not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy not to fire rockets into Russian territory.

Peskov also accused the U.S. of escalating tensions and hindering peace talks by sending additional weapons to Ukraine.

He said, “We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently adding fuel to the fire. The United States is adhering to the position of fighting Russia until the last Ukrainian.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-is-holding-nuclear-drills-in-response-to-biden-sending-rockets-to-ukraine,2022-06-01
Russia is requesting that China provide support for the ongoing invasion of Ukraine,"Russia asked China for assistance in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials warn.

The New York Times reported that Russian officials sought military equipment and support from their Chinese counterparts as the invasion of Ukraine — launched last month by Russian President Vladimir Putin — continues.

Russian leaders also sought economic assistance from China to help lessen the burden of sanctions issued by Western nations that have devastated the Russian economy.

American officials declined to describe the specific hardware requested by the Russian government.

Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, said that China will “absolutely” face consequences if it chooses to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fox News reported.

Sullivan said, “We believe China, in fact, was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something. They may not have known the full extent of it, because it’s very possible that Putin lied to them in the same way he lied to Europeans and others. We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support, or economic support to Russia.”

He went on to say, “I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats, but what I will tell you is that we are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them. We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world.”

Sullivan would not say whether the U.S. would issue sanctions on China if it was found to be supporting the Russian invasion.

During the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Vladimir Putin for a series of diplomatic discussions where the two leaders agreed to declare a “no limits” partnership.

This agreement committed China and Russia to support each other on the geopolitical stage as both countries grow increasingly aggressive.

At the time of the agreement, Russian leadership continued to deny that it had any intention of launching an invasion of Ukraine.

China is one of the few global powers to avoid condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government did call for a diplomatic peace to be brokered between Russia and Ukraine.

MarketWatch reported that the Chinese government abstained on the votes in the United Nations censuring Russia and has criticized the West’s sanctions against Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-is-requesting-that-china-provide-support-of-the-ongoing-invasion-of-ukraine,2022-03-13
Russian police detain 5 children for trying to lay flowers at Ukrainian embassy in Moscow,"Russian police detained two women and five children who were trying to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow, according to a report on social media.

Alexandra Arkhipova said in the Facebook post Tuesday that the mothers and their children were held in a police van before being taken to a police station.

She posted photographs and video of the children in the detainment center behind bars in the Russian station. She also claimed that the police threatened to take away custody of the children from their mothers.

Initially, the parents were told they might be held overnight but eventually they were released the same day.

“The parents are in fear,” wrote Arkhipova, who added that they are facing a trial and a fine, but with unspecified charges.

Arkhipova said the children were aged from 7 to 11 years.

Protests against the invasion into Ukraine have grown in Russia despite a crackdown by law enforcement. One report from last week said that as many as 2,000 were arrested for joining in the demonstrations against the war, but that number has jumped to more than 6,840.

Arina Adju, an activist in Russia, told The Guardian that the opposition to the war has divided Russians between the older generations and the youth.

""To be honest, it's deep propaganda here that worked for almost 20 years I guess, so most of the older generation, they're looking to the TV, and there is total propaganda, not any word of truth,"" she explained.

Protests against the war are expected to grow as economic and financial sanctions take a toll on the Russian economy.

""It's impossible to forgive us, but I hope there will be peace again,"" Adju added.

Russia issues military threat if Finland or Sweden join NATO,"Russia has issued a veiled threat of ""military and political consequences"" if Finland and Sweden attempt to join NATO.

Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned the Scandinavian countries on Friday about joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""Finland and Sweden should not base their security in basing it on damaging security of other countries,"" Zakharova said during the press conference.

""Their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,"" Zakharova cautioned.

""We regard the Finnish government's commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe,"" Zakharova said.

The scare tactic by Russia arrived a day after Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin declared that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine would force Finland – which shares an 833-mile border with Russia – to reconsider joining NATO.



""Finland is not currently facing an immediate military threat, but it is also now clear that the debate on NATO membership in Finland will change,"" Marin said on Thursday, according to YLE News.

In January, Marin discussed potentially becoming a NATO member, ""Finland retains the option of applying for NATO membership. We should uphold this freedom of choice and make sure it remains a reality, as this is part of every country's right to decide on its own security policies.""



Finland and Sweden – which are not NATO members but are NATO partners – are both attending NATO's virtual emergency summit regarding the Ukraine situation on Friday.

""It is important for Finland and Sweden to be involved in the NATO meeting, due to the situation in the Baltic Sea region, for example,"" Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Thursday.

Haavisto added, ""We consider it important that Nato continues its open-door policy and that we can apply for membership if we wish.""

Former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb reacted to the threat by saying, ""Russia is pushing Finland closer to NATO membership. Closer than ever before. Our security has been partially based on an option to join. At this rate, we have no other option but to join. Finland's accession would strengthen the alliance and help keep Northern Europe stable.""

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Finland on Friday for financial aid during the Russian invasion.



""Discussed with [Finnish President Sauli] Niinistö countering the aggressor,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter. ""Informed about our defense, insidious shelling of Kyiv. Grateful to Finland for allocating $50 million aid. It's an effective contribution to the anti-war coalition. We keep working. We need to increase sanctions & Ukraine defense support.""



Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson declared on Thursday that her country would help Ukraine.

""I have ... today given the Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist the task of immediately preparing a decision so that we, from the Swedish side, can support Ukraine with further ways to... to strengthen their resilience,"" Andersson said.

Putin had previously issued veiled threats if Ukraine attempted to become a member of NATO.

In the weeks leading up to NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit, Putin told U.S. Undersecretary for Political Affairs William J. Burns, ""No Russian leader could stand idly by in the face of steps toward NATO membership for Ukraine. That would be a hostile act toward Russia.""

Russia-owned media member decries being labeled as Russian state media by Twitter and gets swift backlash,"A media reporter who works for Russian state-owned media angrily denounced Twitter for adding a label proclaiming the affiliation to her tweets, and she saw swift backlash online.

Rachel Blevins is a co-host for the financial new show ""Boom Bust,"" which is a subsidiary by Russia Today, a media company openly owned and run by the Russian government, but she denounced the injustice of being labeled accurately by Twitter on Monday.

""Twitter just added the 'Russian state media affiliated' label to my account,"" Blevins groused. ""I am asking for the immediate removal of this label, due to the fact that I am an individual journalist who does not speak for Russia or Russian media.""

Blevins later deleted the tweet after she was excoriated by many on social media platforms for the suggestion that she was being treated unfairly, but screenshots were widely circulated.

Many ridiculed her for suggesting the accurate label was a grave injustice.

""Well, being you, I wouldn’t complain. It could be 'blood on hands' label. And all your colleagues working for Russian state-funded media could have it as well. I would rather be homeless than work for Putin,"" replied Czech journalist Filip Horký.

""You literally host a show on RT - Russian state media,"" responded U.K. reporter Ben Bloch. ""Not entirely sure how you can complain that you don't speak for the Russian government when it literally pays your wages.""



""If you don't want to be identified as Russian state media, don't be Russian state media. Happy to help!"" said one detractor.

""It's going to blow your mind when you find out who you work for,"" joked another user.

Not all laughed at Blevins, however. One columnist who worked for Chinese state-owned media agreed with her claim of injustice.

""I just got my label last week too — Twitter is on a roll,"" tweeted Andy Boreham.

Twitter announced on Monday that they would be labeling tweets with hyperlinks to Russian state-owned media and also throttling their spread through Twitter's algorithm.

Blevins was also upset in April when Twitter suspended her account for posting a very graphic video of a U.S. military operation that she admitted would be upsetting to the families of the deceased.

Russia plans nuclear drills as tensions escalate with Ukraine,"Russia is escalating its military activity as Western officials are increasingly certain Russian President Vladimir Putin will launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the coming days.

The Russian military on Friday announced military drills involving the country's strategic nuclear forces, which will be personally overseen by Putin on Saturday, the Associated Press reports.

The exercises will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said.

Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin, said Putin would watch the drills from the Defense Ministry's situation room and supervise the practice missile launches in person.

Russia claims these exercises have been planned well in advance and are intended to check the readiness of Russia's military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons.

But the exercises are being conducted as Russia has placed an estimated 150,000 troops along the border with Ukraine. President Joe Biden and other Western leaders have indicated an invasion of Ukraine is imminent and have attempted to dissuade Putin from war through diplomacy and by threatening severe economic sanctions.

Moscow continues to deny it has plans to invade. But Russia has demanded that the U.S. and NATO withdraw their forces from Eastern Europe and make legally binding commitments that Ukraine will not become a NATO member, demands that have been rebuffed by Washington and Brussels.

The location of the nuclear drills is significant. According to the AP, the maneuvers will involve the Black Sea Fleet based on the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

While Russia holds annual strategic forces drills in the fall, U.S. officials say Moscow may have shifted the exercises to February to coincide with an invasion of Ukraine.

Officials also warn that the Russians are trying to execute a false flag operation to serve as a pretext to invade.

Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists are engaged in a second day of shelling after a kindergarten was hit by separatist artillery on Thursday. Western leaders warn that Russia may use the infighting in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region as an excuse to invade.



""Ukraine is not your enemy, but those who want to defend you against Ukraine are. Do not heed rumours about some offensive operation,"" Ukraine's defense minister said in a speech Friday, addressing the rebel faction. ""We have no intentions to conduct any force actions towards the ORDLO (Donbas) or the Crimea. At all. We will move by the political and diplomatic way. Because there are our citizens and we will not put them in danger.""

While Russia has claimed it is moving troops away from the border with Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Friday there is no evidence to support Russia's claim.

""Although Russia has announced it is moving its forces back to garrison, we have yet to see that. In fact, we see more forces moving into that region, that border region,"" Austin said at a press conference. ""We also see them going through, continuing to prepare, by doing things you'd expect elements — military elements — to do as they were preparing to launch an attack.""

President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak at 4 p.m. ET on Friday on the evolving situation in Eastern Europe.

"Russia says some troops will withdraw from border, but Ukraine demands evidence","Russia is pulling back some troops from military districts adjacent to Ukraine after completing drills, the Russian defense ministry said Tuesday, though Ukrainian officials are demanding to see evidence that this is true.

In a video statement Tuesday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that while large-scale military exercises across the country continued, some forces in the southern and western military districts near Ukraine have completed their drills and will return to base, Reuters reported.

The Russian government posted video showing some tanks and other armored vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars.

But Ukraine isn't taking Russia's claims at face value. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""believe in de-escalation"" only after it witnesses Russian troops withdraw from the border, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency.

""We continuously hear different statements from the Russian federation, so we have a rule ... we believe what we see. If we see the pullout, we will believe in de-escalation,"" Kuleba reportedly said.

NATO officials echoed Ukraine's skepticism of Russia's intentions. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said there were no signs of de-escalation on the ground during a press conference Tuesday, according to Newsweek.



""Everything is now in place for a new attack, but Russia still has time to step back from the brink,"" Stoltenberg said.

Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders over several months, leading Western governments to believe President Vladimir Putin intends to invade. Western analysts have long suspected Putin has ambitions to expand Russia's borders and restore the perceived greatness of the Soviet Union as a superpower. Russia has deep historical ties to Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and Putin has described the collapse of the Soviet Union as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.""

While Putin has insisted there are no plans to launch an invasion of Ukraine, Russia previously annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has excused the buildup of troops along Ukraine's borders as an act of deterrence against alleged Western aggression. Moscow has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and its allies that Kyiv will not be allowed to join NATO. Washington and Brussels have so far rebuffed these demands.

The White House said Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent and could happen at any time this week. The United States has partially moved its forces out of Ukraine and ordered the evacuation of most embassy staff in expectation of war. State Department officials have warned any American citizens residing in Ukraine to flee the country before hostilities begin, emphasizing that the U.S. will not be able to extract them in the event of war between Russia and Ukraine.

Russia threatens countries helping to arm Ukraine: 'Legitimate targets' for Russian attacks,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday said that any countries providing military equipment to aid Ukraine in its fight against the Russian incursion would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for any Russian strikes.

What are the details?

In a statement, Lavrov told the RT television channel that any cargo containing foreign supplies that Russia believes to include military equipment will be ""fair game.""

""We clearly said that any cargo moving into the Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game,"" he said. ""This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from the Ukrainian soil.""

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov made similar comments last week, the Financial Times reported.

At the time, Ryabkov said that ""pumping up [Ukraine] with weapons from a whole range of countries"" was ""not just a dangerous move,"" but ""something that turns these convoys into legitimate military targets.""

According to the Times of Israel, he added that Moscow had previously warned “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defense systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on.”

What else?



Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday delivered remarks about the ongoing invasion during a jam-packed outdoor concert in Moscow.

According to reports, the slogan ""For a world without Nazism"" appeared on the stage on which Putin spoke.

Of the ongoing invasion — which the Russian president previously referred to as a ""special military operation"" — Putin reportedly said, ""It is precisely to save people from this suffering, from this genocide that is the main, main reason, motive and goal of the military operation that we launched in the Donbass and Ukraine.""

""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost,"" he was said to have added. ""And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-threatens-countries-helping-to-arm-ukraine-legitimate-targets-for-russian-attacks,2022-03-18
Russian state-owned media lays off most employees and shuts down operations in the US,"The U.S. arm of a Russian state-owned media outlet shut down on Thursday after being expelled from several platforms over the Russian invasion into Ukraine.

CNN first reported that Russia Today was ceasing operations and firing most of its staff in the United States.

The memo obtained by CNN from the general manager of T&R Productions blamed the shutdown on ""unforeseen business interruption events.”

“Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” wrote Misha Solodovnikov.

The media network had been an outlet for pro-Russian propaganda but was removed from DirecTV this week and then later from Roku streaming services.

On Tuesday, Google said that they had blocked mobile apps connected to Sputnik and RT from their app store and from their search tool. Apple made similar moves on its app store.

RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina issued a statement angrily decrying the bans.

""This collective ‘establishment’ seems to be terrified of a mere presence of any outside voice for the fear of losing their historically captive audience, if that audience encounters a different perspective,"" she said.

CNN also detailed a personal meeting between Solodovnikov and the hosts, correspondents, and producers of RT American in the Washington, D.C., bureau on Thursday based on a source who attended it.

Solodovnikov told the employees that their jobs were being terminated with two months severance pay.

One RT host spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity about the somber meeting.

“I have never felt more heartbroken as they have nothing to do with this conflict and seriously were just trying to make a decent living to provide for their families,” the host said.

Another source told CNN that people were shocked and many cried after the announcement.

Biden issued sanctions on Russia that target the country’s “aerospace industry, including their space program,” the U.S. Sun reported.

In response to Biden’s sanctions, Dimitry Rogozin, the Director-General of Roscomos, suggested that the United States wants to “destroy our cooperation on the ISS.”

Russian leadership claimed that the United States needs to cooperate with Russia if they want to prevent the ISS from falling on the United States or Europe.

Rogozin said, “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the International Space Station (ISS) from an uncontrolled de-orbit and fall into the United States or … Europe?”

He added, “There is also the possibility of a 500-ton structure falling on India and China.”

NASA has sought to ease tensions with its Russian counterparts.



A spokesperson for the agency said, “NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station.”

“The new export control measures will continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation,” the spokesperson added, “No changes are planned to the agency’s support for the ongoing in orbit and ground station operations.”

Brandon J. Weichert, a geopolitical and space expert, suggested that Russia has a “decade to 12-year advantage on the U.S. in the galaxies.”

Weichert said that the United States are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

He said, “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America possibly ever. And, we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert criticized politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. for not having the foresight to ward off rivals in space exploration after the Cold War.

He said, “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventive security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.”

Weichert added, “Here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-warns-that-biden-s-sanctions-could-cause-it-to-drop-the-international-space-station-on-the-united-states,2022-02-26
Russia will cease collaborating on the International Space Station until Western sanctions are lifted,"Russia announced on Saturday that it will stop collaborating with Western-led nations on the International Space Station (ISS) until these nations stop sanctioning Russia.

Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos wrote a lengthy thread on Twitter explaining the agency's decision to end its cooperation with the West, the Daily Mail reported.

In the thread, he said, ""I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions.""





Rogozin went on to say in the thread that he will submit a timetable for the completion of projects currently in the works to the Kremlin.



Russia's decision to end collaborative efforts on the ISS comes after weeks of threatening to do so and delaying and outright canceling projects on the ISS in response to Western sanctions placed on the Russian economy and Russian oligarchs.

Previously, Rogozin suggested that the Roscosmos would stop collaborating with the West and allow the ISS to crash into the Earth.

He asked, ""Who would save the ISS?""

This prompted Tesla CEO Elon Musk to offer the support of his spacefaring company SpaceX.

Historically, astronauts aboard the ISS return to Earth on the Russian Soyuz crafts. However, Elon Musk's SpaceX Crew Dragon has made four visits to the ISS since 2020 and is able to drop off and return astronauts aboard the station.

When asked if SpaceX would keep the ISS from falling onto the Earth, Musk replied: ""Yes.""

The United States supplies the ISS with life support technology while Russia provides it with propulsion, so without Musk stepping in to offer to keep the station afloat, Russia's threats to let it drop crash into the planet posed a tangible threat.

Rogozin previously said that Russia pulling out of the ISS would require either the US or one of its European allies to take on additional responsibilities for the station's maintenance. US officials, in the past, have said that it would be ""very difficult"" to operate the ISS independently.

Despite the ongoing and seemingly increasing diplomatic tensions between the US and Russia, the two countries were able to safely return three astronauts — two Russian, one American — to Earth from the ISS.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-will-cease-collaborating-on-the-international-space-station-until-western-sanctions-are-lifted,2022-04-03
Russian airlines and private jets are banned from European airspace,"Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said that the European Union would close its airspace to Russian aircraft in response to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, ABC News reported.

In a press conference, Von der Leyen said, “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU.”

“So let me be very clear,” she continued, “Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane, and that includes the private jets of oligarchs too.”



Von der Leyen also announced that the European Union would be prohibiting media backed by the Russian government.

She said, “The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war. We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.”

Her press conference concluded with the von der Leyen issuing sanctions on the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.

The European Union also plans to purchase and supply weapons to Ukrainian forces.



Von der Leyen said, “For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack.”

These sanctions will further hurt the Russian economy, which has been in a freefall since Russian forces started their invasion of Ukraine. The Russian ruble is plummeting in value, and Western nations continue to barrage Russia with sanctions.

In response to the ruble’s freefall, the Russian central bank is intervening in the foreign exchange market and expanding the list of securities that it will accept as collateral. It is also offering banks 1 trillion rubles so that they have additional liquidity to keep them afloat.

On Saturday, Western leaders proceeded with excluding Russia from the SWIFT telecommunications network, which will prevent the Russian central bank from manipulating its monetary policy to avoid the economic impact of sanctions and make it virtually impossible for Russia to conduct business with its international trade partners.

In a joint statement, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to targeting Russian banks and oligarchs by blocking Russia’s access to the SWIFT network.

The Western leaders said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-airlines-and-private-jets-are-banned-from-european-airspace,2022-02-27
Russian and Cuban leadership reignite Cold War romance,"Tensions continue to rise across the world as Russian President Vladimir Putin rekindles his country’s relationship with the island nation of Cuba.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and Putin discussed their countries’ “strategic partnership” and how they might work together to pursue “actions in the international arena.” The two men chatted on the phone as NATO allies continued to worry about a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stars and Stripes reported.

Earlier this month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, compared the Russian buildup of forces around Ukraine and the subsequent international tension to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the New York Post said.

Ryabkov continued by explaining that Russia fully intends to annex parts of Ukraine. He said, “We are not bluffing. ... The West’s awareness of this needs to be facilitated, and we are going to make every effort to achieve it.”

In mid-January, the Associated Press reported that Russia grew increasingly frustrated with NATO allies interfering with its plans and that Russia could consider deploying its military to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the United States escalated.

Minister Ryabkov said he could “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility of Russian military involvement in Cuba and Venezuela should the United States continue to increase pressure on Russia.

Ryabkov said that the decision to do so “depends on the action by our U.S. counterparts” in an interview with the Russian television network RTVI. Ryabkov noted that Putin is open to the possibility of using Russia’s military resources should the United States use its military to pressure Russian decision-making about Ukraine.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan dismissed this as “bluster in the public commentary,” the Daily Mail reported.

In preparing for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States ordered family members of American embassy staff in Kyiv to leave the country. This decision frustrated Ukrainian leadership, with some diplomats calling it an “instance of excessive caution.”

On Monday, according to the New York Post, White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated that American citizens currently in Ukraine “should leave now” and that the United States government does not currently have intentions to evacuate them should an armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia occur.

Psaki said, “There is not an intention for there to be a departure or an evacuation. ... So we are conveying to the American citizens they should leave now.”

When asked whether or not Americans would be on their own should armed conflict begin, Psaki said, “There’s commercial airlines, you can depart over land.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-and-cuban-leadership-reignite-cold-war-romance,2022-01-25
"Top Russian diplomat brags about new Iran nuclear deal and suggests US taken to cleaners by China, Russia, and Iran","Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov celebrated the forthcoming new Iran nuclear deal in a recent interview, essentially saying the United States was taken to the cleaners by Iran, China, and Russia.

What is the background?

The Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was originally negotiated under the Obama administration. But then-President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the controversial deal in May 2018.

President Joe Biden, during his campaignand after his election, expressed willingness to re-enter the JCPOA and lift sanctions on Iran that were imposed by the Trump administration.

Diplomats officially returned to negotiation last year in hopes of reviving the plan.

What did Ulyanov say?

Ulyanov, the top Russian diplomat working on JCPOA negotiations, boasted in a recent interview that Iran received more in the forthcoming deal than even he expected.

""Iranian clerics are fighting for Iranian nuclear national interests like lions,"" Ulyanov said. ""Indeed, I’m very serious. They fight for every comma, every word, and, as a rule, quite successfully. I must recognize that.""



""I am absolutely sincere in this regard. Iran got much more than it could expect — much more,"" he added. ""Realistically speaking, Iran got more than frankly I expected, others expected. This is a matter of fact.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ulyanov said that Beijing and Moscow worked together to achieve their goals within the JCPOA.

""Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators,"" Ulyanov said. ""We could rely on each other on many, many points. And on many, many points of joint differences we succeeded. I can recollect dozens of such cases, when on rather serious, significant questions, we managed together to get positive results close to what we wanted to achieve.""

The totality of concessions made by the U.S. and western allied powers will not become clear until the deal is finalized.

However, the Jerusalem Post reported:

Among the concessions to Iran that Israel has been concerned about are allowing Iran to keep its advanced centrifuges even when they are out of use, and lifting the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization by the US, as well as rescinding all sanctions placed by the previous US administration, including those put in place due to terrorism and human rights violations.

Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, corroborated on Monday that a finalized deal is nearing completion as long as the Biden administration makes the concessions that Tehran demands, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What is the US saying?

State Department deputy spokeswoman Jalina Porter said last week that ""significant progress"" had been made and a final deal is imminent.

""We are close to a possible deal, but a number of difficult issues still remain unsolved,"" she said. ""We will not have a deal unless we resolve quickly the remaining issues. If Iran shows seriousness, we can and should reach an understanding of mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA within days.""

In a nod to Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken admitted Sunday that sanctions imposed by Washington on Moscow because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be totally disconnected from the Iran nuclear deal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-diplomat-brags-iran-nuclear-deal-us-taken-to-cleaners-by-china-russia-iran,2022-03-07
"Report: Russian forces firing rockets at Kharkiv physics institute, which houses a nuclear reactor","Russian invaders have reportedly fired rockets at a Kharkiv, Ukraine, physics institute — a building that is said to house a nuclear reactor and more.



What are the details?

According to a Sunday report from The Independent, Ukraine's national security service has claimed that forces have been firing rockets at the institute, which they say could prompt a ""large-scale ecological disaster.""

The outlet reported that Russian forces are firing missiles from Grad launchers, which reportedly do not have precise targeting.

The facility, which houses a nuclear research division called Neutron Source, and is said to store at least 37 nuclear fuel cells.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether the inside of the building — and more particularly, the area in which the reactor and other nuclear materials are stored — sustained any damages from the rockets.

This week, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzheppar said that the embattled country “continues to collect evidence of [Russian] war crimes for the Hague.”

What else?

The disturbing news comes on the heels of a near-miss at a Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, nuclear power station in which Russian forces stormed the facility and took over at gunpoint.

According to The Independent's report, Malcolm Grimston — honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London's center for energy policy — said that the level of artillery necessary to destroy a nuclear power station would be immense, and beyond mere bullets and fire, indicating that Russian forces want to overtake the facility, and not trigger a large-scale disaster.



“So it’s much more consistent at least at this stage with them wanting to take a facility that happened to be a nuclear facility in that area, but not to cause a radiological incident,” he reasoned. “These power stations are an enormous asset; Ukraine gets more than half of its electricity from nuclear power. You would expect the Russians to want to maintain that because if they’re going to run it as part of Russia, it will still need energy.”

According to the Evening Standard, Linda Thomas-Greenfield — U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — on Saturday warned that Putin’s forces were closing in on a third plant in the Yuzhnoukrainsk area.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that nuclear power stations ""cannot become part of this conflict.""

“Reliable electricity is vital for the nuclear facility, as are back-up diesel generators and fuel,"" she continued. ""Safe transit corridors must be maintained. Russia must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine — or interfere with Ukraine’s ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and their surrounding populations.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-forces-firing-rockets-at-kharkiv-institute-a-dangerous-move-considering-there-s-a-nuclear-reactor-inside-the-building,2022-03-06
'My life is being taken away from me': Russian influencers burst into tears over their country's Instagram ban — but the reaction is swift and harsh,"Several Russian influencers were moved to tears over the weekend after their country decided to ban Instagram, lamenting that their lives and livelihoods are being taken from them.

The Kremlin officially blocked use of the popular social media platform on Monday to restrict the flow of negative information surrounding its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

What are the details?

Business Insider reported that Russian reality TV star Olga Buzova who boasts 23 million followers on the platform, posted a nearly seven-minute video to fans crying over her new reality.

""I am not afraid of admitting that I do not want to lose you,"" the 36-year-old reportedly said in Russian.

""I do not know what the future holds. I don't know,"" she continued. ""I just shared my life, my work, and my soul. I did not do this all as a job for me, this is a part of my soul. It feels like a big part of my heart, and my life is being taken away from me.""

Buzova ended her video by saying she was ""going to go and continue crying.""

Another influencer, reportedly a Russian beauty blogger, posted a message to fans in which she broke down in tears over the loss of her lifestyle, saying she is in the ""first stage of grief.""

""Do you think that for me, as an Instagram influencer, this is [a] source of income?"" she asked, according to video posted on Twitter by NEXTA.

""To me, it’s all life, it’s the soul. It’s the one with which I wake up, fall asleep, f**king five years in a row,"" she said.

Other influencers, including Valeria Chekalina and Karina Nigay, also lamented their country's Instagram blackout while urging followers to join them on Telegram or Russian state-controlled social platform VK.

""Instagram is no more,"" Chekalina said, Insider reported.

""This is my work,"" Nigay said in a live video, according to the Washington Post. ""Imagine you were just fired completely from work and you aren’t receiving any income at all, but at the same time you have expenses for your family, for your team if you have subordinates, and then all of a sudden you have nothing to pay your team.""

What was the response?

While the tearful influencers received pity from some of their Russian followers, several critics on social media slammed the privileged stars over their insensitivity.

""In Ukraine, people are dying, children are in the subway, there is nowhere to sleep, they have lost everything, and you are crying because of Instagram,"" one person reportedly commented in response to Buzova's post.

""Wow, those are some problems you have,"" another commenter wrote after Nigay’s video.

""I’m shocked, we have air sirens on here,"" another follower said.

In the caption of its Twitter post, NEXTA alleged, ""[The influencer] does not care at all about the thousands of dead people, including her compatriots. Obviously, her biggest worry right now is that she won’t be able to post pictures of food from restaurant.""

That influencer's comments came as the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol entered its 13th day without food, water, and electricity, the Daily Mail noted.

Anything else?

Russia’s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced on Friday that it would ban Instagram, giving users 48 hours to say goodbye to the app.

In announcing the ban, the regulator cited parent company Meta's decision to allow posts calling for violence against Russian invaders in Ukraine.

Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri decried the ban, saying in response that it would ""cut 80 million [people] in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-influencers-cry-over-instagram-ban,2022-03-14
Russian official apologizes for unjustified invasion of Ukraine at UN climate meeting,"The head of the Russian delegation to a major United Nations climate conference offered an apology for his country's unjustified invasion of Ukraine on Sunday, according to a report.

Russia's Oleg Anisimov told delegates from 195 nations at the closed-door virtual meeting of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that ""those who know what is happening fail to find any justification for the attack,"" according to AFP.

""Let me present an apology on behalf of all Russians not able to prevent this conflict,"" he told the government ministers and scientists participating in the meeting.

Anisimov spoke in Russian after the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Svitlana Krakovska, spoke passionately about Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion.

""We will not surrender in Ukraine, and we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate resilient future,"" she reportedly said in English.

""Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots — fossil fuels — and our dependence on them,"" she added.

A source who attended the meeting told AFP ""everyone 'in the room' was really moved"" by Krakovska's message.

Delegates were surprised when the Russian Anisimov expressed ""huge admiration"" for the Ukrainian delegation.

""He knows that there is a risk for him, it was a very sincere message,"" said another participant, according to AFP.

Reached for comment, Anisimov told AFP his statements ""expressed my personal opinion and attitude,"" and should not be taken as an ""official statement of the Russian delegation.""

U.N. delegates on the IPCC had gathered to finalize a major assessment of how climate change could impact the world over the next few decades. Anisimov, a scientist and longtime Russian delegate to the IPCC, has previously been the lead author on many IPCC climate reports.

Anisimov's dissenting comments on the unprovoked war come as hundreds of anti-war activists in Russia are protesting against Putin's government, often at risk of arrest. The protests began Thursday, when Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, sea, and air.

Russian police have begun to crack down on the protests in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to the Associated Press. The Kremlin is issuing propaganda to downplay opposition to the war, but in addition to street protests, tens of thousands of people have endorsed open letters and signed petitions condemning the invasion. Celebrities, athletes, and famous TV personalities have spoken out against the war too.

Russian government officials have attacked opponents of the war. The speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said recently that the anti-war position of ""certain cultural figures"" was ""inappropriate"" and ""nothing short of betrayal of your own people.""

It is difficult to ascertain the extent of the anti-war sentiment in Russia because Putin's tyrannical regime has restricted access to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, police are swiftly ending anti-war demonstrations, and state-run Russian media propagandizes for the government.

Russian oil revenues up 50% as Western sanctions on oil exports prove ineffective,"Russian oil revenues have risen by 50% since the beginning of the year despite Western nations attempting to isolate and weaken the Russian economy.

The Epoch Times reported that a new report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that the Russian Federation had earned about $20 billion each month in 2022. Russian oil producers sold roughly eight million barrels of oil per day.

Russian oil companies were able to achieve this feat largely because Western nations were unable to come to a consensus on isolating Russia’s oil industry in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

While the U.S. sanctioned Russian oil in early March, the European Union (EU) and its member states were unable to reach a unanimous agreement to ban the import of Russian oil by member nations. About two-thirds of the oil imported by EU member states comes from Russia, so the continued import of this oil, despite thorough sanctions on other sectors of the Russian economy, continues to provide Russia with a vital lifeline.

The European bloc continues to be the largest consumer of Russian oil. Despite the EU member nations presenting themselves as united in diplomatic and economic opposition to the Russian regime, they account for roughly 43% of all Russian oil exported in April.

Last March, economist Elana Ribakova suggested there might be a latent paradox that could arise should Western nations move to sanction Russian oil. Ribakova indicated that, in theory, imposing sanctions on Russia, which is one of the world’s leading exporters of natural gas and petroleum, would cause a scarcity of oil-based resources, causing prices to rise. These rising prices would in turn present Russia with an opportunity to collect higher revenues through exporting the products to countries not sanctioning the industry, thus rendering any sanctioning regime’s attempts counterproductive.

In early March Ribakova said, “10$ on oil price gives Russia [about] $20 [billion] of current account inflows per year. With imports collapsing[,] Russia’s 2022 current account could exceed $200 billion. Despite ~40% of $640 [billion] [Bank of Russia] reserves arrested, Russia could rebuild buffers from the current account surplus.”

Countries like China and India have not shied away from purchasing Russian fuel since the Ukraine invasion commenced, and with some EU member states continuing to import Russian oil, Russia will likely survive any current and future sanction packages that don’t affect its ability to export oil.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-oil-revenues-up-50-as-western-sanctions-on-oil-exports-prove-ineffective,2022-05-17
Russian president turned Putin aide issues ominous warning to US: We possess the might to put you in your place,"Former Russian president turned Putin aide Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia has the ""might"" to put the U.S. in its place after accusing the Western country of trying to stoke ""disgusting"" Russophobia amid the ongoing Russian invasion.

What are the details?

According to a Thursday report from Reuters, Medvedev, who served as president of Russia from 2008 to 2012 and who currently serves as deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that the U.S. was guilty of spreading Russophobia in an apparent attempt to cause strife in the communist country.

""It will not work,"" he warned. ""Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place.""

What else?

In February, Medvedev took a swipe at President Joe Biden and said that weak U.S. sanctions only demonstrated the country's ""political impotence,"" prompting an overall anti-Western sentiment.

“We are being driven out of everywhere, punished and threatened, but we don’t feel scared,” he said according to reports, going on to mock the sanctions as weak theater to make up for previous ""shameful decisions"" such as the U.S.'s ""cowardly retreat from Afghanistan.""

Russia has insisted that despite sanctions against the country, it can rise up and form alliances with other world powers — including China. China, however, has thus far avoided publicly committing military aid to Russia.

Russian forces continue to march toward Ukrainian capital Kyiv as the invasion enters its fourth week, ushering in a relentless barrage of violence and destruction.

According to a Thursday report from CNN, the head of the Chernihiv region — which is northeast of Kyiv and near the Russian border — said that Chernihiv city continues “suffering great losses.”

The U.N. Security Council is set to hold a meeting on Thursday concerning the ongoing humanitarian crisis that is continuing to develop across the war-torn country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday also addressed German lawmakers, pointing out similarities between the Cold War's Berlin Wall and the current climate in Ukraine and blasting the country for what he said was a failure to help Ukraine.

Zelenskyy added that Berlin needs to stop buying Russian oil and gas in order to help drain the Russian government's access to war money, but the country has said that it has no alternative but to continue relying on Russian energy sources.

“After 80 years, something like this happens and I am telling you: Every year politicians repeat the words ‘never again’ and now we see that these words are simply worth nothing,"" he said in his address. ""In Europe a people is being destroyed. There is an attempt to destroy everything that is dear to us.""

He added, “The world may not have seen so clearly yet, but you are separated from us by a kind of wall. Not a Berlin Wall, but a wall in the middle of Europe between freedom and a lack thereof. And this wall is getting taller with every bomb that falls on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for peace.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-president-turned-putin-aide-issues-ominous-warning-to-us,2022-03-17
Russian prosecutors reportedly threaten to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies seeking to leave Russia,"Russian prosecutors are threatening to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies in Russia.

Companies with corporate leaders who criticize the Russian government or threaten to withdraw their business from the country in accordance with Western sanctions run the risk of coming into conflict with Russian prosecutors.

American corporations including Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM, and Yum Brands received stern warnings from prosecutors in Russia. They received phone calls, letters, and physical confrontations where prosecutors threatened to seize company assets, including trademarks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin also expressed support last week for a new law that would nationalize the assets of foreign companies that leave Russia in response to Western sanctions levied upon the country after it invaded Ukraine.

The Russian government’s approach to preventing businesses from leaving has led to some companies limiting communications with their Russian counterparts out of concern that their communications were being monitored.

Other companies have begun working to move their executives out of Russia.

The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., took to Twitter to refute the claim that its government was either seizing assets or arresting executives.

The embassy said, “The decision whether to continue entrepreneurial activity in our country is entirely up to the Americans. As well as the right to ignore Russophobic hysteria that encourages foreign businesses to suffer huge losses in order to hit Russia.”

The alleged threats to arrest company executives and seize assets reportedly came in response to Western sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions have debilitated the Russian economy.

In late February, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement calling for the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In doing so, Western leaders committed to “imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

This and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT network make it incredibly difficult for Russia to participate in international trade and keep its economy afloat.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent Western sanctions, compelled many international corporations to reconsider their business relationships and practices within Russia.

Financial sector giants Visa and Mastercard severed their ties with the Russian market, subsequently making all Russian-issued Visa and Mastercard bank and credit cards useless; the British Petroleum Company liquidated its holdings in the Russian energy sector and ended its long-standing business relationships; McDonald’s and PepsiCo proceeded to end their operations in Russia; and Disney opted to halt film releases in the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-prosecutors-reportedly-threaten-to-arrest-executives-and-seize-the-assets-of-western-companies-seeking-to-leave-russia,2022-03-14
"Russian ruble craters to less than 1 US cent, stock market freezes after Russia's removal from global banking system","New financial penalties levied on Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine appeared to hit the country's economy hard on Monday as Russia's currency cratered to a record low value and its stock market froze.

What are the details?

The Russian ruble's value plummeted to less than one U.S. cent on Monday, Time reported, dropping more than 25% to 105.27 per U.S. dollar, down from approximately 84 per dollar late Friday.

After initially declining to do so, the U.S., Japan, and several European nations on Saturday agreed to enact more severe sanctions on Russia as its forces continued an assault on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in an attempt to overthrow the government.

The group of nations went after central bank reserves that underpin Russia's economy and removed several key Russian banks from SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a vital international banking system.

Time noted the ruble's calamitous decline would likely send inflation soaring, a development that would hurt all Russians and not just the elites who were targeted in earlier sanctions.

Critics had called for the forceful move to be enacted immediately upon Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Western leaders initially balked. Even now, Time noted that the disconnection from SWIFT is ""partial,"" leaving room for the U.S. and Europe to escalate penalties.

Yet the effects are reportedly being felt already, as Russian residents rushed to ATMs to withdraw cash amid the ruble's free fall.

What else?

In addition to the currency plunge, the Russian stock market also took a major hit on Monday. According to the New York Times, officials closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day, citing the ""developing situation.""

""The economic reality has, of course, changed,"" the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reportedly told members of the press while announcing that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an emergency meeting with top finance officials.

Western restrictions effectively have placed a chokehold on the Kremlin's ability to access its war chest of financial reserves and sent to the country careening towards an economic crisis. At the very least, the world intends to financially isolate Russia in a way not experienced since the Cold War.

""Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine, but what he is also doing, in fact, is destroying the future of his own country,"" European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday.

Anything else?

Yet even as Russia's economy faced significant distress and delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Belarus for peace talks, the Russian offensive showed no signs of letting up.

Ukrainian officials claimed Monday that an air raid on residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, left dozens of people dead, including several civilians.

“It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,” Met General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement Thursday, the AP noted. “Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward.”

Gelb said Sunday that the Met would not engage artists who back Putin, the outlet added.

The Met made repeated efforts to convince Netrebko, 50, to repudiate her support for Putin but couldn't persuade her, according to an individual familiar with the situation who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because that detail wasn't announced.

Netrebko was to perform in Giacomo Puccini’s “Turandot” in the spring and Giuseppe Verdi’s “Don Carlo” next season, the New York Post reported, adding that Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska is slated to replace her in both productions.

The developments followed the international career implosion of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who has been close to Putin as artistic and general director of the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, the AP said.

Russia's invasion has resulted in a striking show of solidarity with Ukraine among members of the arts and culture world, as well as those in thesports world; it also has resulted in backlash against Russia and those who won't denounce Putin, the AP said.

Netrebko, who hails from Krasnodar, received the People’s Artist of Russia honor from Putin in 2008, the outlet noted.

Anything else?

Netrebko withdrew from all her upcoming performances, the AP said, adding that her next listed performance was April 3 at Barcelona’s Gran Teatre del Liceu followed by three concerts with her husband — Azerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov — and an April 13 concert with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

“I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression, and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us. We need peace right now,” Netrebko said, according to the AP. “This is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.”

The outlet said Netrebko didn't immediately respond to Gelb’s announcement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-star-soprano-wont-repudiate-support-for-vladimir-putin-now-shes-gone-from-ny-metropolitan-opera,2022-03-04
Russian troops enter Ukrainian capital; officials tell residents to stay indoors and 'prepare Molotov cocktails' to defend the city,"Russian troops moved into Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, on Friday as officials urged residents to stay indoors and ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend against the advancing enemy force, the New York Times reported.

What are the details?

Kyiv entered into a defensive phase on the second day of fighting since Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighboring country. Air raid sirens continued to blare as Russian missiles pounded the city and residents took cover in subway stations and other makeshift shelters, Reuters reported.

Russia claimed to have captured an airport in Hostomel, just northwest of the capital, on Thursday, after fierce fighting. The airport will likely serve as a strategic staging post to launch attacks on the city.

In a tweet, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense indicated that a Russian ground presence had reached Obolon, a northern district of Kyiv. It is the closest the Russian military has been to Ukraine's capital thus far. In an attempt to stymie the advance, the Ukrainian government reportedly destroyed three bridges to the north of the capital.

The Ukrainian government has urged its residents on numerous occasions to stand fast against the encroaching enemy. In a pair of tweets on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that he would ""give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country,"" adding, ""Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

But at the same time, Ukraine is eager for an end to the bloody conflict, the likes of which Europe hasn't seen since World War II.

As its forces advanced, Russia surprisingly signaled it may be open to talks with the Ukrainian government, though the reported conditions are strict. The Kremlin said it would agree to send a delegation to Minsk for negotiations, but warned that any agreement would be based on ""demilitarization"" and neutral status for Ukraine — both of which have previously been red lines for Zelenskyy.

What else?

Ukraine reported that 137 citizens died and another 316 were wounded during the first day of fighting. Based on earlier reports, at least 40 of those who died were soldiers, while up to 10 were civilians.

Early Friday morning, Zelenskyy appeared to criticize Western nations for their military inaction.

""This morning, we are defending our country alone,"" the leader lamented in recorded remarks. ""Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.""

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO?""

""Today, I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer,"" he continued.

President Biden on Thursday joined a host of NATO allies in announcing further sanctions against Russia for its military assault. But it remains unclear when, or even if, the economic penalties will force Russia to back down.

In response to pressing from reporters on the need for more urgent action, Biden insisted that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the sanctions are ""working.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-troops-enter-ukrainian-capital-prepare-molotov-cocktails,2022-02-25
Russian TV channel condemns war as staff walk out while live on air,"Staff at an independent Russian television station signed off their final broadcast by decrying war and walking out of the studio in protest.

According to a report from Newsweek, Russian authorities ordered the station to cease broadcasting over its coverage of the country's invasion of Ukraine. The reported noted that Russian authorities demanded media refrain from referring to President Vladimir Putin's invasion as a ""war"" and instead insisted they use the term ""special military operation.""

Station staffers signed off their final show on Thursday and walked out of the studio

""No to war,"" Natalia Sindeyeva, the station's general director, said on Thursday as staff left the studio and made the decision to air Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" which according to the report, ""was aired on Soviet state TV during the collapse of the Soviet Union.""

""We need strength to exhale and understand how to work further,"" Sindeyeva said in a statement shared on the channel's website. ""We really hope that we will return to the air and continue our work.""

Ukraine News UK tweeted video footage of the walkout and captioned it, ""The Entire staff of the Russian TV channel 'the rain' resigned during a live stream with last words: 'no war' and then played 'swan lake' ballet video (just like they did on all USSR tv channels when it suddenly collapsed).""

Independent Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy this week also shut down.



""The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,"" editor in chief Alexei Venediktov said in a statement on the closure.

Russia's prosecutor general in a statement said that such ""fake news"" — or ""information known to be false regarding the actions of Russian servicemen"" as ""part of a special operation to protect the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic"" is illegal and will not be tolerated.

"Russian vodka boycott in Texas, Ohio and Canada","Numerous countries, including the United States, have launched sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Now, there will be local and state boycotts on one of Russia's most iconic exports – vodka.

In Canada, Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy ordered the provincial Liquor Control Board of Ontario to have stores remove vodka and other alcoholic products from Russia.

""Ontario joins Canada’s allies in condemning the Russian government’s act of aggression against the Ukrainian people, and will direct the LCBO to withdraw all products produced in Russia from store shelves,"" tweeted on Friday with the hashtag #StandwithUkraine.

""Ontario and the LCBO can’t say it’s truly standing with Ukraine while continuing to be Putin’s customer,"" said Steven Del Duca, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, according to Fox News.



Russian products will be removed from nearly 700 stores across Ontario.

Canada's Newfoundland Labrador Liquor Corporation (NLC) also declared that it would yank Russian products off the shelves.

""The Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation, along with other Liquor jurisdictions throughout Canada, has made the decision to remove products of Russian origin from its shelves. These include Russian Standard Vodka and Russian Standard Platinum Vodka,"" the NLC Liquor Store wrote on Twitter.

In the United States, liquor stores and bars in Kansas, Michigan, Oregon, and Vermont plan on removing bottles of Russian vodka from their shelves as a ""protest against the aggression,"" according to The Hill. The stores also planned on promoting Ukrainian vodka more prominently.

Virginia State Sen. L. Louise Lucas (D) called on Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) to ""order the removal of all Russian vodka and any other Russian products from our ABC stores immediately.""

On Saturday, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) directed the Ohio Department of Commerce to ""cease both the purchase and sale of all vodka made by Russian Standard, the only overseas, Russian-owned distillery with vodka sold in Ohio.""

The Ohio Division of Liquor Control estimates that there are roughly 6,400 bottles of vodka made by Russian Standard currently for sale in Ohio's 487 liquor agencies across the state.

DeWine also said that retailers had been asked to immediately take Russian vodkas from their shelves.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested retailers in the Lone Star state to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their stores as a protest against Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""I've asked the members of the Texas Restaurant Association, Texas Package Stores Association & all Texas retailers to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their shelves.

Report: Sky News reporter ambushed and shot by Russian troops while covering Ukraine invasion,"A Sky News correspondent was shot while covering Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to reports.

What are the details?

Sky News chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey said that Russian attackers fired on him and his team as they tried to leave the Kyiv area on Monday.

According to a report from the New York Post, Ramsey said that he and his team of five heard an explosion and felt a tire on the vehicle they were traveling in begin to pop and sag.

As the vehicle rolled to a stop, he said, bullets began raining down on the vehicle's windshield, forcing the team to cower in fear.

""We were under full attack,"" he said. ""Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel and dashboard had disintegrated. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car — they didn't miss.""

Ramsey said that he and his team screamed that they were journalists, but the bullets kept on coming.

The report added that Ramsey attempted to flee from the vehicle, and began running toward a nearby embankment for shelter when he was struck in his lower back by a bullet.

One of Ramsey's camera operators, too, was struck by gunfire.

""Our world turned upside down,"" Ramsey said of the incident. ""I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful.""

Ramsey said that he and his team were able to make it to the embankment despite the injuries and were able to gain entry to a nearby building where they awaited rescue.

""The five of us were alive,"" he recalled. ""We couldn't believe it.""

Ramsey added, ""We were very lucky. But thousands of Ukrainians are dying, and families are being targeted by Russian hit squads just as we were, driving along in a family saloon and attacked. This war gets worse by the day.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russians-targeting-on-scene-journalists-with-their-bullets-report,2022-03-05
London Mayor Sadiq Khan says Trump not worthy of state dinner — but look what Queen Elizabeth did,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan made headlines last week when he declared that President Donald Trump is ""not in the same class"" as previous United States presidents, citing George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and, therefore, is not worthy of a state dinner.

Fortunately for Khan, he will not have to sit through a state dinner with Trump when the president visits the United Kingdom next month.

But that does not mean Trump will not be honored with a state dinner.



In fact, according to Express UK, Queen Elizabeth II will honor Trump with a state dinner at Buckingham Palace — but Khan is not on the guest list.

""The mayor has not been invited to the state banquet,"" Jonathan Weisgard, Khan's spokesman, told Newsweek.

Khan has long been a vocal critic of the president. Khan's criticism reached a fever pitch after Trump implemented a temporary travel ban that prevented certain citizens from Muslim-majority nations, all of which have deep connections to terrorism, from traveling to the U.S. Khan, who is Muslim, has characterized the controversial policy as a ""Muslim ban.""

Meanwhile, Trump has been equally critical of the London mayor and the so-called ""knife control"" policies enacted in London.

Trump will travel to London early next month for his state visit during which he will also commemorate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sadiq-khan-queen-trump-state-visit,2019-05-12
"Sally Field rails against abortion laws, DeSantis, Abbott","Hollywood actress and activist Sally Field is so upset with recent abortion laws passed in Texas and Florida that she is warning the governors of those states to steer clear of her because – in her own words – she said, ""I cannot be responsible for what I would do."" Field gave an interview to Variety last week, and claimed that states like Texas and Florida have passed ""criminal"" legislation on abortions.

The interviewer asked Field about her ""social activism"" and how she is ""politically engaged."" The interviewer brought up how Field has been an ""advocate for LGBTQ rights, speaking up about the AIDS crisis, climate change, nuclear weapons,"" and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Field noted she is an activist to a ""degree,"" but said she is not as die-hard of a political activist as her friend and far-left actress Jane Fonda.

The two-time Academy Award-winning actress recalls how Fonda and she participated in a climate change demonstration on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol and was arrested, which Field described as ""fun.""

During the interview, Field's 2018 memoir ""In Pieces"" was mentioned.

When the autobiography was released, The Hollywood Reporter said of the memoir, ""Fields writes that she had her own 'sexual awakening' in high school, leading to a secret abortion she got in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old.""

Field had an abortion in 1964 — nine years before the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.

The Variety interviewer asked the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" star, ""In your autobiography, you wrote about going to Tijuana when you were 17 to get an abortion. What do you think of these abortion bans in Texas and other states like Florida?""



Field responded, ""Those men who are doing that, and they're mostly male governors who are doing it, are so backward, so ignorant and really just power-hungry. I think it's criminal.""

""They're so wanting to roll back the achievements and important progress for women, for Blacks, for the LGBTQ community,"" the ""Forest Gump"" actress claimed. ""I can't say enough horrible things about what I feel about those men.""

Field then took aim on the governors of Texas and Florida for recent abortion laws.

Last May, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law the pro-life Texas Heartbeat Act that prohibits physicians from ""knowingly perform[ing] or induce[ing] an abortion on a pregnant woman if the physician detected a fetal heartbeat for the unborn child ... or failed to perform a test to detect a fetal heartbeat.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to sign a ban on abortions after 15 weeks to protect unborn babies.

The 75-year-old actress issued a veiled threat to the governors of Florida and Texas.

""If you see them coming toward me, those two governors specifically [Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis], lead me out of the way because I cannot be responsible for what I would do. Heidi [she addresses her publicist, who is in the room], do you hear me? Lead me away.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sally-field-abortion-desantis-abbott,2022-03-28
"San Francisco sued for adding victim's DNA from rape kit to police database, using it to arrest her on unrelated burglary charges","On Monday, a sexual assault victim filed a lawsuit against the city and county of San Francisco for storing her DNA collected from a rape kit in the police database. The suit alleged that her DNA was stored without her consent and later used to arrest her on unrelated burglary charges.



The victim, only identified as Jane Doe in court documents, also filed the lawsuit against the police chief, the crime lab director, the criminalist, and an officer for the San Francisco Police Department.

Another 50 unidentified defendants were listed in the court filing, Fox News reported. The case accused the unnamed defendants of negligence and breach of duty.

The lawsuit stated that Jane Doe provided a DNA sample to the police department in 2016 to investigate the victim's sexual assault. However, Doe claimed that she never agreed that her DNA would be stored in a permanent database or used for any other purposes.

""There are reportedly thousands of people who are being subjected to this arbitrary, unlawful unconstitutional invasion of privacy,"" the case read. ""Plaintiff Jane Doe, a sexual assault survivor, was re-victimized by this unconstitutional practice.""

The police department is being accused of storing the DNA unlawfully for at least six years. The lawsuit alleged her DNA would have been ""tested in thousands of criminal investigations"" during that timeframe.

Jane Doe was arrested in December 2021 because her DNA allegedly linked her to a burglary. However, San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin dropped the charges against Doe after discovering how the DNA was collected and added to the police database.

The lawsuit alleged that the unlawful practice violated the victim's constitutional rights and caused pain, suffering, and emotional distress. Doe is seeking an unspecified payout for damages and the removal of her DNA from the database.

The San Francisco Police Department told Fox News that it could not comment on pending litigation.

In a February statement, SFPD Chief William Scott said, ""We must never create disincentives for crime victims to cooperate with police, and if it's true that DNA collected from a rape or sexual assault victim has been used by SFPD to identify and apprehend that person as a suspect in another crime, I'm committed to ending the practice.""

""I am informed that our existing DNA collection policies have been legally vetted and conform with state and national forensic standards,"" Scott stated. He reported that the police department's DNA collection practices are currently being reviewed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-francisco-sued-storing-dna-rape-kit,2022-09-13
Sens. Sasse and Merkley introduce bipartisan bill to crack down on porn sites making money from child rape,"Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) on Friday introduced new legislation to crack down on pornography websites that may be complicit in human sex trafficking or rape.

Their bill, called the ""Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act,"" would require online platforms that host pornography to implement ""critical safeguards to protect Americans from sexual exploitation online,"" the senators said in a news release.

A recent exposé by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof showed how Pornhub, one of the internet's largest and most popular pornography websites, permits videos featuring sex trafficking victims, non-consensual sex, child rape, and other heinous criminal activity on its platform with little or now oversight. Kristof reported that the victims of these crimes have little to no recourse to have videos of their abuse removed from the internet. Sasse and Merkley aim to change that with their bill.

""Human dignity matters. A decent society has an obligation to fight sexual exploitation and human trafficking,"" Sasse said. ""For years, Pornhub and its parent company Mindgeek monetized rape, abuse, and child exploitation. While these suit-wearing traffickers got rich, their victims have lived with the pain and fear. That has to end now. Our bill is aimed squarely at the monsters who profit from rape. Washington ought to be able to come together to combat human trafficking and make this right.""

""The posting of intimate photos and videos without participants' consent is a massive invasion of privacy that drives shame, humiliation, and potentially suicide,"" Merkley said. ""While some online platforms have recently announced steps to change some practices, much more needs to be done. We must ensure that not another single life of a child, man, or woman is destroyed by these sites.""



The legislation would impose several new restrictions on online pornography platforms to protect victims of abuse.

Under the proposed law, pornography websites would be required to verify the identity of any user who wants to upload a video to their website and the user must provide a signed consent form from every individual appearing in the video before it can be published. The law would create a private right of action against any video uploader who posts pornographic content without the consent of the individual(s) featured in the image or video, giving victims of ""revenge porn"" a right to sue.

Also, pornography websites would be required to feature a notice or banner on the website instructing how an individual can request removal of a video featuring persons who did not consent to having that content uploaded on the platform. Video downloads from pornographic websites would be prohibited by law.

Pornographic websites would also be required by law to maintain a 24-hour hotline staffed by the website that people can contact to request removal of a video that has been distributed without their consent. The website would be required by law to remove the flagged video within two hours. They would be required to use software to block a removed video from being re-uploaded after removal.

The Federal Trade Commission would be responsible for enforcing the various parts of this legislation. The bill would also create a database of individuals who have indicated they do not consent to having pornographic materials about them distributed on the internet and porn sites would be required to check new content against this database before it can be uploaded to their platforms.

In response to Kristof's damning article, Pornhub this week announced several policy changes to combat the uploading and distribution of abusive content. Going forward, the website will ban unverified uploaders and has suspended all previously uploaded content that was not created by verified users or Pornhub partners. The company purged more than 10 million videos that did not meet this standard, removing almost 80% of the content on its website.

Sasse and Merkley's legislation would force other websites to follow suit and go even farther to crack down on abuse. Kristof praised the senators for working in a bipartisan fashion to fight against online rape videos and child pornography.

""The porn platforms have shown that self-regulation is not enough,"" Kristof tweeted Friday. ""They did nothing for too long and simply monetized assaults on children. Some regulation is essential, along with liability both to compensate victims and incentivize better self-policing.""

Laila Mickelwait, the director of abolition for anti-sex trafficking group Exodus Cry and the founder of the #Traffickinghub campaign — a movement that seeks to hold Pornhub accountable for ""enabling and financially profiting off of videos of real sex-trafficking, child sexual abuse and other non consensual content"" — hailed the proposed legislation as ""highly critical"" in a statement to TheBlaze.

""This new bi-partisan legislation by Senator Sasse and Senator Merkley is a highly critical and essential preventative measure that will do an enormous amount of good in stopping the monetization and immortalization of victim's sexual trauma on mainstream porn sites such as Pornhub,"" Mickelwait said.

She further called on Congress to ensure that there is third-party oversight of pornographic websites to enforce compliance with the proposed regulations.

""These regulations must be implemented by a third-party and use reliable methods for age verification, identification, and the guarantee of consent for those in videos uploaded to porn sites. We have evidence of fake IDs and forged documents being used in the past on these sites and they cannot be trusted to self-police,"" she said.

""We must also see serious consequences for non-compliance such as risk of shut-down and hefty monetary fines in order for this law to have teeth.""

Saudi oil giant Aramco reported record first-quarter profits as oil prices soar around the globe,"The Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported more than an 80% jump in net profit on Sunday setting a new quarterly earnings record for the company.

The oil producing behemoth said that its net income rose 82% to $39.5 billion in the first three months of 2022. CNBC reported that this is up from $21.7 billion over the same period in 2021.

The company’s income to date obliterates forecasts by economic experts, as well. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast Aramco’s income to be $38.5 billion.

The record quarter income for Aramco comes as companies throughout the oil industry are experiencing windfall profits from sharp rises in oil and gas prices. Aramco said that its earnings were largely driven by higher crude oil prices which in turn caused increasing volumes of product to be sold as downstream margins improved.

In the Sunday earnings release, Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said, “During the first quarter, our strategic downstream expansion progressed further in both Asia and Europe, and we continue to develop opportunities that complement our growth objectives. Against the backdrop of increased volatility in global markets, we remain focused on helping meet the world’s demand for energy that is reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable.”

Now with a market cap around $2.43 trillion, Aramco has surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company in the world.

Aramco’s stock is up more than 15% so far in 2022 amid widespread market selloffs. In March, the oil giant reported that its full-year profits from 2021 more than doubled due to the ongoing rise in global oil prices that has now been greatly exasperated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

As member states in the European Union and the United States look for alternatives to Russian oil Aramco has the opportunity to corner the Western oil market.

In early May, the European Union planned on moving forward with issuing additional sanctions against Russia. In order for the European Union to implement sanctions, all of its 27 member states must agree to enforce them in their respective nations.

An embargo of Russian oil by the European Union would dramatically increase tensions between the European Union’s member states and Russia as the member nations would subsequently isolate the nation from which they import almost two-thirds of their oil.

Ultimately, the European Union member states failed to reach a unanimous consensus on banning the import of Russian oil. Hungary was the sole dissenter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reported-record-first-quarter-profits-as-oil-prices-soar-around-the-globe,2022-05-15
"Intruder who took drugs, drank alcohol at party reportedly breaks into home in middle of night. But homeowner has a gun — and puts threat to bed.","An intruder who reportedly admitted to sheriff's deputies that he took drugs and drank alcohol at a party before he broke into a South Carolina home over the weekend ended up getting shot by the homeowner.

What are the details?

The suspect — 37-year-old Lawrence Butler Jr. — shattered a glass window in the front door of a home on the 5300 block of Mauss Hill Road in Adams Run early Saturday morning, the Charleston County Sheriff's Office said in a release, according to WCIV-TV.

With that, the suspect climbed through the opening, at which point the homeowner shot him in the left arm, deputies told the station.

Deputies arrived at the home around 3:30 a.m. over reports of a home invasion, WCIV said, adding that arriving deputies found a wounded man lying inside the home near the front door.

Butler told detectives that shortly before he broke into the home, he was at a party where he took drugs and drank alcohol, the station said.

Authorities found a small bag of cocaine after searching the suspect, WCIV said, citing the sheriff's office.

An earlier story from the station indicated the suspect was taken to a hospital where he was recovering.

Butler soon was booked into the Al Cannon Detention Center shortly before noon Saturday on charges of first-degree burglary and cocaine possession, WCIV reported.

'Your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war': Arnold Schwarzenegger appeals to Russian people against the invasion of Ukraine,"Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a video message to the Russian people to appeal to them to not believe war propaganda and reject the invasion of Ukraine.

The video went viral online with more than 11 million views on Twitter.

""I'm speaking to you today because there are things that are going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" said Schwarzenegger.

He went on to relate his personal ties to Russia and how he grew to respect and love the country since he had been 15 years old.

""I know that your government has told you that this is a war to denazify Ukraine. Denazify Ukraine? This is not true! Ukraine is a country with a Jewish president, a Jewish president I might add, whose father's three brothers were all murdered by the Nazis,"" Schwarzenegger continued.

""You see, Ukraine didn't start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war,"" he added.

Schwarzenegger praised the thousands of Russians who risked imprisonment and worse to protest in the streets against the war. He then addressed the Russian soldiers and told them they were being told lies by the Russian government.

""Your lives, your limbs, and your futures are being sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world,"" Schwarzenegger said.

He also compared the lies of the Russian government to that of the Nazis and talked about how his father felt guilty for fighting on the side of the Nazis.

""He lived the rest of his life in pain,"" Schwarzenegger explained. ""Pain from a broken back. Pain from the shrapnel that always reminded him of those terrible years. And pain from the guilt that he felt.""



22 days since the initial invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military continues to bomb major cities in the former Soviet republic. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the fighting.

Schwarzenegger successfully ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2003 after gaining fame as a Hollywood actor.

Supreme Court issues stinging defeat to unions,"The U.S. Supreme Court issued a stinging defeat for unions on Wednesday in a decision that struck down in part a California law allowing unions access to private property of companies they wanted to unionize.

The court ruled 6 to 3 to knock down the union law in favor of the business owners' private property rights.

""The upshot of this line of precedent is that government-authorized invasions of property — whether by plane, boat, cable, or beachcomber — are physical takings requiring just compensation,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority decision.



The ""right of access"" law passed in California allowed farmworker unions to gain access to the private property of farm owners in order to help unionize their workers.

The three liberal justices argued in their dissent that the law was a regulation did not constitute taking away anyone's private property.

Union supporters were outraged at the decision.

""Today the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned nearly a half-century of progress for California's farm workers, who have struggled to exercise their right to bargain for decent wages and to protect their health and safety,"" said Karla Walter, the director of employment policy for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

""Reaching farm workers — the overwhelming majority of whom are Latinx and migrant workers — where they work is critical to protecting their rights and interests,"" she added.

In a video interview with John Stossel, one of the litigants in the original case argued that his migrant workers make almost double the minimum wage in California and that unions had technological access to any of the workers.

""Of the 450 people that are in that facility at the time, they had maybe 20 to 25 people join them,"" said Mike Faher, owner of Cedar Point Nursery in Indico, California. He also argued that unions had access to his farm workers before and after work.

California officials have defended the law as a temporary regulation of the business owner's property and compared it to allowing access to meat inspectors or health and safety inspectors.

The New York Post reported that Blinken said, “I think the president, the White House made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.”

The US’s top diplomat went on to say that the American government’s official stance on Russia did not include Biden’s alleged insistence of regime change.

“As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia — or anywhere else, for that matter,” Blinken added.

Blinken suggested, instead, that the Russian people should oust their president through democratic processes.

“As in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russians,” he affirmed.

On Saturday, during a speech in Poland, Biden raised eyebrows when he appeared to make an explicit call for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden proclaimed.

“A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love of liberty,” Biden said. “Free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.”

Biden also called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, a “butcher.”

Many of Biden’s statements were quickly walked back by White House officials who implied the president’s words did not accurately relay US foreign policy.

A White House official said, “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”

This past weekend, Biden also suggested to US troops who were stationed in Poland that they would witness the bravery of the Ukrainian people “when you’re there” explicitly insinuating that American troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

Biden said, “You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle in front of a dammed tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground.’”

True to form, the White House quickly clarified that the president was mistaken and that he had not, in fact, changed his stance on deploying the military into Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-says-that-joe-biden-didn-t-mean-what-he-said-when-appeared-to-call-for-regime-change-in-russia,2022-03-27
A 'sex coach' wants people to know the beauty and power of menstrual blood. So she smears it all over her face.,"A 26-year-old California woman's Instagram account is going viral — because it features photos of the woman, Demetra Nyx, smearing menstrual blood all over her face because it's ""magical"" and ""powerful.""

What are the details?

According to The Sun, Nyx, a ""sex coach"" who lives in Los Angeles, had her first menstrual cycle when she was 12 years old, and she'd been embarrassed and ashamed of it ever since.

The article noted how Nyx would try to hide the very normal fact that she had a monthly period and would obsess over her period to the point of journaling about it.

""I was simultaneously embarrassed and fascinated by my period,"" she admitted. ""I felt apologetic about it a lot and tried to hide it from boyfriends.""



Nyx blamed the way she felt on society.

""Our society teaches us that periods are dirty and inconvenient,"" she explained. ""Ads about menstrual products talk about smelling 'fresh' or making us cleaner, implying that our bodies' natural functions are gross.""

Nyx said that an experience with implantable birth control turned her perspective on its head.

After she discarded the invasive method, she decided that her period was going to be ""magical"" from then forward.

""Sharing pictures of blood on my face and body was just an impulse,"" Nyx explained. ""I was creating a series to help women connect with their menstrual cycle, and I thought it would be fun.""



""We can also do things like paint with it, or pour it into the earth,"" she added. ""I believe it's a beautiful thing to get comfortable with touching your own blood.""



Nyx shared a video in January and captioned it:

Just a reminder that some days are so painful that all you do is cry and lie in bed but then some days you can cover yourself in blood and dance around the house and are about to launch your podcast and have moved to Southern California where it almost never rains and are making thousands of dollars talking to people about topics that freak most of humanity out and LIFE IS SO GREAT! (That is my reminder to myself. My reminder to you is that you can be whoever you want. And the people who love you will find you always. And the people who don't will leave. And you can say bye forever because it is way more fun being true to yourself!!!)

She also shared a graphic photo, her face covered in blood, explaining why she loves smearing her face with menstrual blood.

Vowing to continue sharing such photos on a monthly basis, Nyx said that she aims to normalize menstrual cycles.

""I will do it until little girls stop being taught that the natural functions of their bodies are disgusting and unclean,"" she wrote. ""I will do it until women stop feeling like they can't have sex on their period because it is gross.""

She added, ""Also, it's fun and I like it.""

Nyx told the outlet that even though she gets a lot of flak for sharing such disturbing photos, she isn't discouraged.

""My blood to me has become fun, beautiful, and powerful, and playing with it brings me closer to myself,"" she explained. ""A really common comment I get is, 'Oh, you should just wipe poop all over your face then, it's the same thing.'""

Even though she receives negative feedback from both friends and family, she won't stop.

""That encourages me to keep posting [the photos] – if it wasn't having a necessary impact, people wouldn't be so bothered by it,"" Nyx shrugged.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sex-coach-smears-menstrual-blood,2019-02-28
Sex offender wanted for shooting sheriff's deputy breaks into home with Trump 2020 flag flying outside — and homeowner kills him in shootout,"An armed sex offender — wanted for shooting a Florida sheriff's deputy and who was said to have an ""evil mindset"" and was out to ""kill and destroy""— made the last mistake of his life when he broke into a home flying a Trump 2020 flag Wednesday morning.

What are the details?

The Dixie County Sheriff's Office said it assisted the Taylor County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday about 9:45 p.m. after it was reported that a Taylor County deputy was shot during a traffic stop. Dixie County deputies and other agencies searched all night for the suspect without success.

Then on Wednesday around 7:20 a.m., Dixie County deputies responded to a call from a homeowner who said he shot an intruder. The homeowner told arriving deputies he exchanged gunfire with the suspect who'd entered the home. The suspect, Gregory Miedema, was dead at the scene. Miedema was suspected of shooting the Taylor County deputy Tuesday night.

An official told WCTV-TV the Steinhatchee homeowner was shot while protecting himself during the break-in and was taken to a hospital with minor injuries and was expected to be released soon.

'An evil mindset'

Deputies also found at the scene the suspect’s vehicle and several firearms strategically placed in what appeared to be an ambush setup, the sheriff's office said.

During a subsequent press conference, Dixie County Sheriff Darby Butler said he believes Miedema ""had an evil mindset; his thought process was to kill and destroy innocent people, and fortunately he did not succeed in that.""

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd had nothing but praise for the homeowner who took out Miedema, telling WTVT-TV that ""when you break into a house of a stranger and you're shot — shot and killed — that's on you. The homeowner did exactly what he should have done, and that's protect himself, his family, and his home.""

What do we know about the dead suspect?

Miedema, 33, was a registered sex offender in the state. The Sarasota County Sheriff’s said Miedema was convicted in 2011 while serving the in the U.S. Army on one count of ""lewd or lascivious battery, intercourse with a victim 12 to 15 years old"" and one count of possession of child pornography. The sheriff's office added that Miedema was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison followed by two months of probation.

What happened to the wounded deputy?

The Taylor County Sheriff's Office identified the wounded deputy as Troy Andersen, who was part of the K9 unit, WCTV said. The station added that he was airlifted to a hospital and was undergoing reconstructive surgery on his face and was in stable condition.

Anything else?

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued a ""Blue Alert"" for Miedema around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday after he shot the Taylor County sheriff's deputy in Perry, WTVT said.

The station said the Blue Alert notification system has been in place for a decade to alert the public when a law enforcement officer is seriously hurt, killed, or missing in the line of duty. It was only the fourth time a Blue Alert had been issued.

""It's immediately 'all hands on deck' because something terrible has happened to a law enforcement officer, and the suspects are not in custody,"" Judd added to WTVT, also noting that ""if you shoot at a law enforcement officer — an armed law enforcement officer — or you're trying to kill them, no one is safe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sex-offender-wanted-for-shooting-sheriffs-deputy-breaks-into-home-with-trump-2020-flag-flying-outside-and-homeowner-kills-him-in-shootout,2022-02-24
"Florida sheriff doubles down, says if homeowners fatally shoot intruders, 'the chances of them reoffending ... are zero — and we like those odds'","Bob Johnson, sheriff of Santa Rosa County in Florida, doubled down Tuesday on his headline-grabbing declaration last week that homeowners under his watch are ""more than welcome to shoot at"" crooks who break into their houses — and added a little mustard.

""If somebody breaks in your house in Santa Rosa County, and you shoot and kill 'em, the chances of them reoffending after that are zero — and we like those odds,"" Johnson told ""Fox & Friends"" host Ainsley Earhardt.

What's the background?

Johnson briefed the media last week on the arrest of Brandon J. Harris — a ""frequent flyer"" crook with long rap sheet starting when he was just 13 years old. Harris broke into several homes in Pace, and one of the homeowners shot at Harris without hitting him.

Harris' last stand went down when he broke into yet another home and authorities cornered him in a bedroom, after which Harris jumped through a window's glass and got captured.

""We don't know which homeowner shot at [Harris]. I guess they think that they did something wrong, which they did not,” Johnson said at the press conference. “If somebody is breaking into your house, you’re more than welcome to shoot at them in Santa Rosa County. We prefer that you do, actually.”

Johnson added, ""Whoever that was, you're not in trouble. Come see us. We have a gun safety class we put on every other Saturday, and if you take that, you’ll shoot a lot better and hopefully save the taxpayers money.”

Doubling down

In his interview with Earhardt, Johnson said the ""frequent flier"" suspect had broken into ""four houses in a row,"" but the homeowner who fired the gun ""unfortunately did not hit him.""

""If somebody breaks in your house in Santa Rosa County, and you shoot and kill 'em, the chances of them reoffending after that are zero — and we like those odds,"" Johnson added.

Earhardt asked the sheriff if his unapologetic attitude regarding guns garners support in the community, and he replied that he's a cop, not a politician.

""In Santa Rosa County, if you break into a house, you roll the dice,"" Johnson said, adding that ""99% of the people here love law enforcement, and the other 1% are in my jail currently,"" which he humorously referred to as the ""Milton Hilton.""

Anything else?

As for Harris, at the time of his arrest he was wanted on two felony warrants and one misdemeanor warrant, the sheriff said. For this latest run-in with the law, Harris was charged with felony attempted burglary with assault, two counts of felony burglary to an occupied dwelling, felony burglary to an unoccupied dwelling, resisting arrest without violence, criminal mischief, and attempted larceny. His bond was set at $157, 500. He had previously been arrested 17 times and served a 6.5-year prison sentence for home invasion.

""We're hoping this will be his third strike, and he'll go to prison and not get out because we're tired of dealing with him, to be honest with you,"" Johnson told Earhardt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sheriff-homeowners-shoot-crooks,2022-04-27
Another sheriff gives kudos to homeowners for exercising their Second Amendment rights,"Yet another sheriff had high praise for homeowners who exercised their Second Amendment rights and successfully defended themselves against intruders.

What are the details?

Homeowners in Garden City, Alabama, were awakened early Monday morning by four suspects breaking into their residence, the Cullman County Sheriff's Office said.

But the quartet were promptly met by the homeowners who had armed themselves for the occasion, the sheriff's office added. Suddenly, the uninvited guests decided they couldn't stay a second longer and took off, authorities said.

One of the homeowners followed the foursome, and the sheriff's office said there was an exchange of gunfire — with one of the suspects getting shot and later being transported to a regional hospital.

Sheriff's deputies and officers from the Hanceville Police Department managed to detain three of the suspects — including the shot intruder. The fourth suspect fled in a vehicle but was shortly after located and arrested, authorities said.

Kudos from the sheriff

The sheriff's office indicated there's no further danger to the community — and gave kudos to the homeowners for arming themselves.

""This is a great example of citizens utilizing their Second Amendment rights and protecting themselves and their family,"" Sheriff Matt Gentry said. ""I have often stated that law enforcement can be minutes away when you only have seconds to defend yourself and your family. That's why we at the sheriff's office are proponents of not only having a weapon for self defense but also being proficient in how to use it.""

Anything else?

It's a sentiment that's common among sheriffs — and it was just echoed by the sheriff of Pasco County, Florida, who sang the praises of a homeowner who protected his family against a gunman who'd broken into their Land O' Lakes home Aug. 8.

""He was defending himself and his family,"" Sheriff Chris Nocco said of the homeowner, who ended up fatally shooting the intruder. ""Any loss of life is tragic, but the victim was utilizing his Second Amendment rights to protect himself and his family ... I can't imagine the fear that they were going through, but I'm very happy [about] the fact that he was able to defend himself ...""

Nocco added that ""when their lives were on the line, when that door was being kicked in, they utilized their Second Amendment rights, and they're safe because of it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sheriff-praises-homeowners-second-amendment,2020-08-17
Sinema calls for increased US oil production,"Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona called Tuesday for raising U.S. oil production to offset the loss of imported Russian oil, according to the Associated Press.

""The reasonable way to address what is going to be an oil shortage in America is for us to responsibly increase our own domestic oil production,"" the senator remarked during a luncheon for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, according to the outlet.



Americans have been getting slammed by high gas prices — as of Tuesday, the AAA national average for a gallon of regular gas was $4.098.

Last month, President Joe Biden issued an executive order banning the import of crude oil and other products from Russia, a country that has been waging a devastating invasion in Ukraine.

""We can help our European allies do the same, but it is incumbent on us to help fill that gap,"" Sinema said, according to the AP.



High fuel costs directly hurt American drivers each time they fill up their vehicle, but the financial pain does not necessarily stop there since high gas prices can also drive up the costs associated with transportation and lead to higher prices across the board.

On March 31, President Biden announced plans to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the rate of one million barrels each day over the span of six months.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Tuesday which showed that rising prices are continuing to hammer Americans hard. ""The gasoline index rose sharply in March, increasing 18.3 percent after rising 6.6 percent in February. (Before seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices rose 19.8 percent in March.),"" the BLS noted.

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin issued a statement about the nation's rapidly rising inflation.

""Here is the truth, we cannot spend our way to a balanced, healthy economy and continue adding to our $30 trillion national debt. Getting inflation under control will require more aggressive action by a Federal Reserve that waited too long to act. It demands the Administration and Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, support an all-the-above energy policy because that is the only way to bring down the high price of gas and energy while attacking climate change,"" Manchin said in the statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sinema-calls-for-increased-us-oil-production,2022-04-13
Sloppy! Crooks botch getaway after homeowner fires at them — and bloodhound team nabs one shot suspect in swamp,"An alleged residential heist by a trio of men apparently became a comedy of errors in rapid fashion Thursday morning in Ridge Spring, South Carolina.

What are the details?

A homeowner told Aiken County Sheriff's deputies he was walking his dog around 8:30 a.m. when he saw at least two men and two vehicles on his property, the Augusta Chronicle reported.

The man told deputies he approached the suspects, yelled, and fired shots at them, the paper said.

With that, the suspects high-tailed it their vehicles and drove away through the woods, the Chronicle reported.

But alas, their getaway fell a bit short when one vehicle got stuck and the other stalled on Cobblestone Road, the paper said, adding that the suspects reportedly opted for Plan B and ran off on foot.

Enter the Bloodhound Team

But never fear, the Aiken Bloodhound Tracking Team and additional deputies responded to the area to search for the suspects, the Chronicle said.

And wouldn't you know that the bloodhound team later found and detained James Franklin Fink Jr. in a swamp adjacent to Whispering Pines Road, the paper said.

Fink was found with a gunshot wound to his left hand, taken to a hospital for treatment, and then booked into the Aiken County Detention Center, the Chronicle said. Jail records show the 46-year-old suspect was still in jail Friday. He's expected to be charged with second-degree burglary and grand larceny, the paper added.

In addition, Alister Keith Wingard, 32, and Brandon Lee Hall, 23, were identified as additional suspects and also are expected to be charged with burglary and grand larceny, the Chronicle said.

Canadian energy official is 'frustrated' Biden is looking to Venezuela and Iran for oil: 'We're right next door! We're here!',"A Canadian energy official expressed frustration with the Biden administration for seeking to increase oil production from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia instead of looking to its neighbor to the north.

Sonya Savage, the energy minister for Alberta, made the comments in an interview with Lisa Fletcher of WJLA-TV.

""What did you think when President Biden called on OPEC and other oil drilling nations like Saudi?"" asked Fletcher.

“I thought ‘what?’ ‘We're right next door. We're here!’"" Savage responded.

""It's extremely frustrating when we see the United States administration reaching out to Saudi Arabia to ask for more oil production, to ask OPEC for more oil production, to look at Iran, to look at Venezuela when we're right next door here in Alberta,"" she explained. ""They should be looking at us as the solution to energy security, not around, not Venezuela.”

Savage said that Canada could more than make up the lack of oil imports resulting from the ban on Russian imports over its invasion of Ukraine.

She has previously criticized the Biden administration from her official social media account.

""US now looking to replace Russian barrels with Venezuelan? You can’t make this stuff up - desperate times require desperate measures,"" she tweeted.

""A reminder of the folly of energy policy over the past decade. Canada, with the 3rd largest reserves, could have supplied the US and the world,"" Savage added.

Republicans and other critics have assailed Democrats for seeking to increase oil production from unfriendly countries while seeking to restrict domestic oil production that could have curbed the skyrocketing price of gas.

""The result of Biden's presidency has been that the enemies of America, countries like Russia, like Iran, like Venezuela are all getting stronger, getting richer, getting more aggressive, getting more hostile,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), ""because the president is simultaneously weakening our own ability to produce energy and strengthening their ability to produce energy.""

Source: Ukrainian sniper reportedly kills highly decorated Russian general,"A highly decorated Russian general was killed Wednesday, the Daily Mail reported, adding that a military source said a Ukrainian sniper did the job on Major Gen. Andrey Sukhovetsky.

What are the details?

Sukhovetsky was deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of Russia's Central Military District, the outlet said, adding that Russia's Ministry of Defense had not confirmed his death.

However, Sukhovetsky's colleague Sergey Chipilyov announced his death on social media, and several Russian and Ukrainian news outlets reported the general's demise, the Daily Mail said.

The post from Chipilyov — who's with the Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers — reads as follows, the outlet said: ""With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation. We express our deepest condolences to his family.""

The Daily Mail said it wasn't clear where Sukhovetsky was killed. The military source also told the outlet a funeral will be held Saturday in Russia, the outlet said.

Sukhovetsky would be by far the most senior Russian figure to have have died since the invasion of Ukraine commenced last week, the Daily Mail said.

The 47-year-old was a highly decorated veteran who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021, the outlet said, adding that he previously commanded the 7th Airborne Assault Division in Novorossiysk for three years, completed several combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia, and the intervention in Syria, and received special commendation for his participation in Russia's annexation of Crimea.

The Daily Mail said Sukhovetsky's death would be seen in Ukraine as another encouraging sign that the Russia's invasion isn't going well.

What else?

The Kremlin on Wednesday acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and another 1,600 have been injured in Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, the outlet said, adding that the real numbers are ""almost certainly higher.""

Ukraine's armed forces said Thursday that Russia's army had suffered 9,000 casualties, the Daily Mail added, although noting that the military's statement said the actual death toll ""is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.""

A Ukrainian defense official also announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces.

What's more, some Russian troops in Ukraine reportedly are surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

Zelenskyy on Thursday lauded the fight his fellow citizens are waging against Russian's military and claimed ""all lines of defense are holding"" in the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv, the Daily Mail reported.

""They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken, or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the outlet: ""We will restore every house, every street, every city, and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations.' You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.""

He added, ""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy. They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment,"" the Daily News reported, and also said Russian soldiers ""are not warriors of a superpower. These are confused children who have been used.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/source-ukrainian-sniper-reportedly-kills-highly-decorated-russian-general,2022-03-03
Gov. Kristi Noem bans TikTok for South Dakota gov't workers: 'We will have no part in intelligence gathering for China',"Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed an order banning the TikTok social media platform in her state over concerns that the application was gathering information to be used by the hostile communist government in China.

""South Dakota is banning TikTok for state government. We will have no part in intelligence gathering for China, a nation that hates America,"" Noem tweeted.

""I hope other states quickly follow this example and protect the vital private information of our citizens,"" she added.

Her statement said the bill would ban the application for ""state government agencies, employees, and contractors using state devices.""

Experts have expressed concerns that the popular application appears to be very invasive when downloaded onto phones, and there is evidence that the company is sending users' private information to the Chinese government. TikTok was bought by ByteDance, a company partly owned by the Chinese government.

""The Chinese Communist Party uses information that it gathers on TIkTok to manipulate the American people, and they gather data off the devices that access the platform,"" Noam added.

Others have pointed out that the application appears to be tweaked to keep users distracted in the U.S. while it reinforces good habits and behavior in China.

South Dakota Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson applauded Noem's announcement and said there were efforts to do the same in the federal government.

""This is great news. I’ve been leading legislation to do this at the federal level, too. China and TikTok pose a real threat to national security,"" tweeted Johnson.

""It’s great to see momentum growing from other leaders to #BlockTheTok,"" he added.

A report in August from Forbes found that hundreds of employees at TikTok and ByteDance had previously worked for the Chinese government, and many others continued to work for both the communist government and the social media companies.

Squad and Bernie Sanders willing to spend $40 billion for Ukraine war,"There were 57 Republican House members and Sen. Rand Paul (R-K.Y.) to oppose the massive foreign aid package to Ukraine. Every Democrat in Congress voted in favor of the $40 billion war package to supply aid to Ukraine. Every member of the so-called ""Squad"" and other progressive Democrats voted for the gargantuan payout to Ukraine despite condemning military spending in the past.

President Joe Biden initially requested $33 billion for Ukraine, but Congress tacked on another $7 billion. The $40 billion is in addition to $14 billion in Ukrainian aid that Congress just approved in March.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voted for the $40 million military package for Ukraine. However, AOC called for an amendment to cut the budget of the Pentagon by 10% to ""prioritize the very needs of our communities here at home"" in September 2021.

""I rise today to offer Amendment 40, to reduce the Pentagon budget by 10%, Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor. ""During a time when our country is withdrawing from foreign wars, when COVID 19 and its fallout is one of the greatest threats that we face, when record levels of unemployment, housing, and healthcare crises are among us, the United States should be reducing its military spending by at least 10% and prioritize the very needs of our communities here at home.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) voted in favor of the package, but had a very different viewpoint in March.

""A lot of progressives, I feel, have abandoned their principles of being anti-war, anti-broad-based sanctions, anti-harmful policies that not only impact us here in the United States, but inadvertently impact the civilians of our adversary regime,"" Omar told Insider in March.

Progressive Caucus co-chairs Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) previously declared that there was ""no military solution out of this crisis"" and the ""flood of hundreds of millions of dollars in lethal weapons will only raise tensions.""

""We continue to watch Russia’s threatening behavior towards Ukraine with alarm. There is no military solution out of this crisis — diplomacy needs to be the focus. We support the Biden administration’s efforts to extend and deepen the dialogue, allowing for robust negotiations and compromise,"" the progressive Democrats proclaimed in January. “We have significant concerns that new troop deployments, sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions, and a flood of hundreds of millions of dollars in lethal weapons will only raise tensions and increase the chance of miscalculation. Russia’s strategy is to inflame tensions; the United States and NATO must not play into this strategy.""

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald points out in a Substack article, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) discussed the Russian invasion of Ukraine during a ""Democracy Now"" appearance on Feb. 8. Khanna asserted that sending lethal aid to Ukraine ""will only inflame the situation.""

I certainly join [House progressives] in the concerns of having increased aid, lethal aid, into that area. That will only inflame the situation. I also join them in the concern that we need restraint, that the last thing the American people want is an escalation which could lead us to some long war in Ukraine with Russia, that that’s a very dangerous situation, and no one in this country — or, very few people in this country would want that. There’s a reason President Obama didn’t send lethal aid into Ukraine and had a greater restraint in his approach. So, I do think we should do everything possible not to escalate the situation, while having the moral clarity that Putin is in the wrong in this case.

In October 2020, Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO) proclaimed that she is going to ""defund the Pentagon.""

However, this week, Bush bizarrely attempted to justify her vote by highlighting that billions of dollars in military equipment will be sent overseas to private defense contractors.

“Additionally, at $40 billion, this is an extraordinary amount of military assistance, a large percentage of which will go directly to private defense contractors,"" Bush said in a statement. ""In the last year alone, the United States will have provided Ukraine with more military aid than any country in the last two decades, and twice as much military assistance as the yearly cost of war in Afghanistan, even when American troops were on the ground. The sheer size of the package given an already inflated Pentagon budget should not go without critique. I remain concerned about the increased risks of direct war and the potential for direct military confrontation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/squad-ukraine-war-spending-billion,2022-05-15
"Steven Ray Hessler cold case solved, rapist sentenced to 650 years in prison","An Indiana man convicted in a series of home invasions and sexual assaults in the 1980s was finally sentenced to a total of 650 years in prison for his crimes. A utility bill helped law enforcement apprehend the man who terrorized women in Shelby County some 30 years ago.

Steven Ray Hessler sentenced to 650 years in prison

Steven Ray Hessler, 59, was found guilty on March 3 of 19 felony charges for crimes against 10 victims between 1982 and 1985.

Following an eight-day trial in Shelby Circuit Court, Hessler was convicted on two counts of rape, six counts of unlawful deviate conduct, seven counts of burglary resulting in bodily injury, three counts of criminal deviate conduct, and one count of robbery, according to WXIN.

Shelby Circuit Court Judge Trent Metzler described Hessler's crimes as ""monstrous"" and ""horrific."" The judge gave Hessler the maximum of 50 years on each count, all of which were Class A felonies, WRTV reported.

How a utility bill broke open the cold case

Hessler was arrested at his home in Greensburg in August 2020 after investigators linked him to the cold case crimes through DNA evidence.



In 2019, the Shelby County Sheriff's Department decided to renew interest in the cold case after learning of advances in forensic technology. ""A detective asked prosecutors if they would pay for samples to be sent to a company that uses the same sort of DNA testing that resulted in the capture of ""the Golden State Killer,"" according to the Associated Press.

The prosecutors agreed and sent a DNA sample left in the victim's garage from the last reported assault on Aug. 17, 1985. Investigators also sent a licked utility bill that they had intercepted in the mail to Parabon NanoLabs. The DNA on the sample and the utility bill matched.

""Police said there was a one trillion-to-one chance the DNA found at the scene belonged to anyone but Hessler,"" the Indianapolis Star reported. ""A subsequent test by Indiana State Police of DNA from Hessler's arrest confirmed the match.""

Police found other evidence linking Hessler to the crimes, including pictures stolen from one of the victims was found in his possession. Law enforcement also determined that he searched for some of the victims on his computer.

The 'monstrous' crimes committed by the 'Coward Sadist'

In the middle of the night, Hessler – wearing a ski mask or tights to conceal his face – would break into the houses of women who were often home alone and force them to perform sexual acts while threatening harm if they did not do as he said, according to police. Hessler would bind, rape, and sexually torture his victims at gunpoint and knifepoint, investigators said. He also stole money and valuables from his victims.



""In a few cases, men who were in the home were made to watch or participate,"" according to the Indianapolis Star. ""The man would sometimes lecture his victims about the lack of security in their homes, according to police. Before he left, some victims reported he would unplug phones and take their money.""



Hessler allegedly took photos of the victims to blackmail them not to inform the authorities and said if they told the police, he would come back and kill them.

Several of the victims testified during the sentencing hearing about the trauma they experienced from the heinous attacks. Some expressed fears that Hessler would return to kill them or their children.

Shelby County Prosecutor Brad Landwerlen issued a statement:

Steven Ray Hessler is one of the most evil, dangerous, sadistic predators that I’ve had the pleasure of prosecuting in my 30+ year career. He derived great pleasure from his unnecessarily brutal methods of terrorizing and sexually torturing his victims. I promised the victims early-on that my goal would be that he go to prison the rest of his life, and all involved are very happy that we have achieved that goal.

Landwerlen dubbed Hessler the ""Coward Sadist.""

""He's a sadist because he loves getting pleasure from hurting other people,"" Landwerlen said. ""He's a coward because he would only do it when he was armed.""

In his closing arguments, defense attorney Bryan Cook said, ""It's a hot mess of a case the state has.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/steven-ray-hessler-cold-case-rapist,2022-04-01
Stock market crashes in worst day since pandemic over fears of a recession,"The stock market crashed in the worst day since the pandemic outbreak in 2020 over fears that the economy was heading into a recession after several companies reported weak earnings.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,136 points, or 3.5%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 4% and the Nasdaq composite fell by 4.6%.

Wednesday's losses added to investors' woes over a month of declining values.

Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, explained that earnings from retail companies set off the market collapse.



“Today’s broad-based market selloff concerns the ability of companies to pass along higher costs, something that was questioned but which found somewhat of an answer with the retailer’s earnings reports,” wrote Krosby.

“To be sure, consumers continue to spend, but many of the top retailers are unable to pass along the higher labor costs and higher prices wrought by a still constrained supply chain,"" he added.

Among those were Target, which reported lower earnings despite having an increase of sales because inflation had made its expenses grow at a larger rate. Target's stock dropped by more than a quarter as a result.

""Higher costs coupled with more cautious consumers have the market worrying about the prospect of a recession,"" Krosby added.

The market also appeared to respond to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday that the Fed was willing to hike up interest rates even more in order to battle inflation.

On Monday, a Morgan Stanley analysis said that the ""excessive"" fiscal stimulus spending from the Biden administration was to blame for ""turbocharged"" consumption and surging inflation.

""In other words, we created too much demand for the supply chains to handle. The fact that the supply chains had been impaired to some degree only exacerbated the shortages and inflation, especially for consumer goods,"" the analysis read.



Voters said in a recent poll that they blame Biden's policies for inflation more than any other cause, including the invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and supposed corporate greed.

Ring video shows armed robbers rush into home after accomplice selling chocolates gets homeowner to open door,"A stunning Ring doorbell video showed the moment that three armed robbers rushed into a home after their accomplice got the homeowner to open the door by pretending to sell chocolates.

The harrowing incident unfolded in Stockton, California, on Monday at about 1:47 p.m., according to police.

The video shows the man with a box of chocolates, pretending to be selling them. When the homeowner opens the door and gives him cash, three armed masked men run into the home.

Police said the female homeowner was ordered to the ground while the robbers stole personal items from her home. She said they were in their twenties or thirties.

Even more startling is the video from a neighbor that showed what appeared to be the same chocolate-selling accomplice pulling the same scheme at his door.

The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said that he felt something was off with the man at his door so he decided not to open it.

“At that moment, nothing was going through my head, I just thought they were someone selling candy,” he said to KOVR-TV.

He said that he was suspicious because the man outside was not facing his camera as he rang the bell.

“What if I had opened the door? What if I would’ve decided to buy some candy? It’s definitely put me on situational awareness,” he added.

Another neighbor said the same suspects knocked on the doors of homes on the entire block.

Police said they are looking for three Asian male adults and one black male adult as suspects in the armed robbery. They drove off in a black SUV. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to their arrest.

They are also warning homeowners to be careful when opening their door to a stranger.

"Student at far-left college mocked for being 'angry, scared' that 'cisgender' men installed radiators in 'safe space' dorm for women, trans residents","A student at far-left Oberlin College in Ohio is being mercilessly mocked for penning an op-ed in the school newspaper complaining of being ""angry"" and ""scared"" that ""cisgender"" men installed radiators in the author's ""safe space"" dorm designated for women and transgender students.

What are the details?

The op-ed's author — Peter Fray-Witzer — wrote that the radiator work was being done in Baldwin Cottage, which the school's website says is ""the home of the Women and Trans* Collective, a close-knit community that provides women and transgendered persons with a safe space for discussion, communal living, and personal development. It has a capacity for 30 residents, and is open to anyone who identifies as female or trans, regardless of race, nationality, religion, assigned sex, or sexual orientation.""

Fray-Witzer wrote, ""In general, I am very averse to people entering my personal space. This anxiety was compounded by the fact that the crew would be strangers, and they were more than likely to be cisgender men.""

The author added that when work began in common areas, ""I could see immediately that they were all men.""

More from the op-ed:

I was angry, scared, and confused. Why didn't the College complete the installation over the summer, when the building was empty? Why couldn't they tell us precisely when the workers would be there? Why were they only notifying us the day before the installation was due to begin?I felt mildly violated and a little peeved. [...]



I couldn't help but think that, though there were other dorms affected by the installation, Baldwin Cottage was one of the worst places for it to occur. There are myriad reasons to want to be housed in Baldwin Cottage, but many people — myself included — choose to live there for an added degree of privacy and a feeling of safety and protection. A significant portion of students choose to live in Baldwin because they are victims of sexual assault or abuse, have suffered past invasions of privacy, or have some other reason to fear cisgender men. [...]



They should have taken measures to keep students comfortable and safe — especially those who have elected to live in a specifically designated safe space.

Given Fray-Witzer's first name — Peter — and the fact that Baldwin Cottage is for women and trans students, it isn't clear why Fray-Witzer is allowed to live there. The author doesn't elaborate in the op-ed or offer personal pronouns.

How did commenters on the op-ed respond?

Fray-Witzer's op-ed has since gone viral, but not in a very positive way. The author is getting mocked — even in the comments connected to the op-ed. Here are some responses:

""I read this and all I see is a bigot playing victim,"" one commenter wrote. ""We seriously need to stop entertaining nonsense like this.""

""Please let this be a joke!"" another commenter declared. ""Please!""

""I'm surprised that the writer of this essay didn't tell us his/her/their pronouns,"" another commenter observed. ""This is exactly the kind of newspaper where such information would be expected to appear.""

""I'm so sorry that the students whose families can afford to send them to an $80k/year tuition college like Oberlin are so oppressed by the $15/hour maintenance men who just happen to be male and heterosexual,"" another commenter noted. ""The nerve of those privileged monsters to step into your dorm to make sure the radiators work and to unstop the toilets. When will the class intimidation of the blue collar privileged over the oppressed rich and woke ever end?!""

Anything else?

Suspect breaks into woman's home around midnight and confronts her — but she has a gun and shoots intruder,"Yet another individual has learned the sometimes painful lesson that if you break into a home in the United States, you might come face to face with a homeowner who not only owns a gun, but also is willing to fire it at you in self-defense.

And in this latest case out of Washington state, the lesson was most definitely painful.

What are the details?

Grant County sheriff's deputies spotted a stolen vehicle being driven in the area of Wheeler Road and O Road in Moses Lake — about 100 miles southwest of Spokane — and when the driver failed to stop, the deputies ended their pursuit, KEPR-TV reported.

However, Moses Lake police officers spotted the stolen vehicle abandoned in the 1400 block of Cougar Drive, and the station said that while police attempted to establish a perimeter, a 911 caller reported a break-in at her residence.

And it soon got even scarier.

According to an ifiberone.com report, the suspect actually confronted the female homeowner.

And since she had a gun at the ready, the woman shot the intruder in self-defense around midnight Sunday, KEPR said.

Police told the station they found the suspect exiting the home, and medics transported the suspect by ambulance to Samaritan Healthcare to treat non-life-threatening injuries.

The suspect's name has not been released, ifiberone.com reported. But KPQ-AM said charges are pending.

Anything else?

Moses Lake Police Chief Kevin Fuhr told KPQ that deputies terminated the vehicle chase due to Washington state's new policing laws.

Grant County Sheriff Tom Jones penned a July letter to citizens about the new laws — and he said one of them ""virtually eliminates all police vehicle pursuits. Moving forward, deputies must have 'probable cause' to believe a person in the fleeing vehicle has committed a specific violent crime. This is a very high standard and nearly impossible to meet.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/suspect-breaks-into-womans-home-she-shoots-intruder,2021-09-14
"Suspects in police chase try breaking into house by shooting through door. But homeowner has gun, too — and is in no mood to play.","A police chase in Georgia over the weekend in which two men in a pickup truck were firing at sheriff's deputies took a detour when the suspects pulled into a residential driveway and tried to break into a house by shooting through the door, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.

But the suspects soon had a radical change of heart.

You see, the homeowner also had a gun — and he fired back at the suspects, who decided to not try anything further at the house and took off, authorities said.

How did this all start?

GBI said a Seminole County sheriff's deputy on Saturday tried to conduct a reckless driving traffic stop on a white 2500 Chevrolet pickup truck with a Florida license plate. There were two men in pickup, the driver refused to stop, and a chase began, the agency said.

A second Seminole County deputy joined the pursuit, and the suspects began to fire at the deputies, GBI said, adding that the deputies returned fire.

The deputies continued the chase into Decatur County, where sheriff's deputies there joined the pursuit, the agency said. That's when the suspects pulled into the driveway of the Decatur County residence and tried to break in by shooting through the door, after which the homeowner returned fire, GBI said.

What happened next?

After the suspects took off from the home, one of the suspects shot at an arriving Decatur County deputy's vehicle and hit the deputy, the agency said. The deputy was taken to a hospital for treatment and surgery and was listed in critical condition, GBI said.

The suspects fled in their truck and wrecked it a short time later in a wooded area, the agency said.

A Georgia State Patrol helicopter and crew responded to the spot where the truck was wrecked, and one of the two suspects — 41-year-old Brad Phillips — was taken into custody without further incident, GBI said. Brad Phillips has been charged with aggravated assault on a peace officer, the agency added.

But Troy Arthur Phillips got away — and a manhunt involving multiple local, state, and federal law enforcement officers commenced, GBI said. Citizens were warned to not approach Phillips, whom the agency considered ""armed and dangerous"" and who was wanted for aggravated assault on a peace officer.

GBI then reported Sunday that Phillips was arrested and in custody of law enforcement.

Anything else?

Family members identified the Decatur County deputy who was shot as Lieutenant Justin Bedwell, WSB-TV reported. His sister said he was flown to a Tallahassee hospital, the station said, adding that a GoFundMe has been set up to help Bedwell's family with medical expenses.

WSB said it's unclear whether the suspects are related.

Tables turn on the Soros-backed Democratic prosecutor who forced Missouri's GOP governor to resign,"St. Louis circuit attorney Kimberly Gardner is facing heat following a seven-count felony indictment against her chief investigator for his actions in a failed prosecution against former Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens.

Gardner, who was funded heavily by liberal megadonor George Soros during her election, made waves in 2018 when her office led the arrest of then-Gov. Greitens on felony invasion of privacy charges.

Greitens was accused of tying up his mistress, blindfolding her, taking a picture without her permission, and then threatening to release the picture if she ever went public about the affair. Later in the investigation, Gardner's office charged Greitens with computer tampering as it related to his campaign's alleged procurement of donor lists.

The governor later resigned after mounting pressure from his colleagues.

But now, many months later, the picture has never been found and both sets of charges have been dropped — and the investigation is coming back on Gardner.

According to a Just the News report, investigators now allege that the Greitens prosecution, which led to the governor's resignation, was built on false testimony and evidence tampering.

Most significantly, testimony transcripts and court records obtained by Just the News show the woman Gardner built her case around, beautician Katrina Sneed, testified she was asked unsolicited by Gardner's office to come forward as a witness and that she was actually reluctant to accuse Greitens because the entire story of a photo on his mobile phone may have been a dream.



""And at any point where you were in the basement with E.G. (Eric Greitens) at his home, did you see what you believed to be a phone?"" Sneed was asked during an April 6, 2018 pretrial deposition with defense lawyers.



Sneed answered: ""So not that's like a very vivid memory which is the reason why I haven't talked about it because I don't know if it's because I'm remembering it through a dream or I — I'm not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven't spoken about it because of that.""

Ahead of the 2018 prosecution, Gardner had hired an out-of-state investigator, William Tisaby, to build the case against Greitens. Tisaby reportedly met with Gardner in early January to gather gather background material ahead of a meeting with the governor's paramour, Katrina Sneed. Sneed had not contacted authorities with a complaint prior to the meeting.

Gardner would eventually make the allegation that Greitens took a compromising picture of Sneed to use as blackmail, but no photo was ever found.

Last summer, Tisaby was indicted for six counts of felony perjury and one count of evidence tampering stemming from the Greitens prosecution. According to Just the News, Gardner has been ordered to appear before the grand jury in Tisaby's criminal trial. She can be seen listed as a key witness for the upcoming trial in a copy of the indictment obtained by the news outlet.

The report goes on to indicate that the indictment against Tisaby may implicate his former boss, as well.

Facts disclosed in the Tisaby indictment suggest Gardner herself was complicit in his wrongdoing by staying silent while Tisaby allegedly lied. For instance, the special prosecutors alleged that when Tisaby falsely denied during a March 2018 pretrial deposition in the Greitens case that there was a functioning videotape of the Sneed interview, Gardner did not correct him even as she questioned him.



""There is no recording of this interview?,"" Tisaby was asked by Gardner. ""None whatsoever,"" he answered.



Tisaby's indictment declared that Gardner's office had videotaped the sessions and she ""failed to disclose the fact for several months.""



Prosecutors say a functioning videotape was found in Gardner's office, and the camera had not malfunctioned as had been claimed, according to the Tisaby indictment.

Tisaby's criminal trial is set to begin later this month.

In advance of the trial, for which she is set to appear, Gardner sued the city of St. Louis under a law passed in the 1800s to help fight the Ku Klux Klan, arguing there are ""white supremacists"" in the police force.

In the lawsuit, she accused city officials, police, and a special prosecutor of a ""racially motivated conspiracy to deny the civil rights of racial minorities"" interfering with her efforts to crack down on corruption within law enforcement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tables-turn-soros-prosecutor-gardner-greitens,2020-03-05
Taiwan reports Chinese aircraft in its air defense zone after Russia invaded Ukraine,"Nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone, Taiwan's defense ministry said Thursday, on the same day that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Tawian reported eight J-16 sorties and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft flying over an area to the northeast of the Pratas Islands, at the top end of the South China Sea, which prompted the island nation to scramble its air force. According to Reuters, the number of aircraft involved in the incursion is smaller than the last large-scale incident, when 39 Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwanese territory on Jan. 23.

China claims Taiwan, the seat of the exiled Republic of China government, as its own territory, and over the past two years it has regularly conducted fly-over missions in Taiwanese air space.

Taiwanese fighters were deployed to warn the Chinese aircraft to back off and air defense missiles were set up to ""monitor the activities,"" the defense ministry said, according to Reuters.

The government in Taipei is paying close attention to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the response from Western governments over concerns that China may use the situation to move against the island.

Chinese officials have dismissed comparisons between the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has claimed historical ties to the region as a pretext to invade, and China's relationship with Taiwan.



On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said that Taiwan is ""not Ukraine"" and claimed the territory has always been part of China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made those remarks responding to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have widespread consequences, including for Taiwan, if the western nations failed to rally to support Ukraine.

""Taiwan is not Ukraine,"" Hua said while speaking in Beijing. ""Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. This is an indisputable legal and historical fact.""

After Russia began its attack on Thursday, Hua refused to condemn Putin's actions and urged western nations to refrain from intervening.

""We are closely following the situation and we need more information to make our judgement, isn't that enough?"" Hua said.



U.S. defense officials have previously warned there is an ""urgent"" need to strengthen Taiwan's defenses against the ""real and dangerous"" possibility of an attempt by China to invade the nation.

""Bolstering Taiwan's defenses is an urgent task,"" Ely Ratner, the assistant secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said in December. ""We are modernizing our capabilities, updating U.S. force posture and developing new operational concepts.""

Reacting to U.S. policy in the region, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said Thursday that Taiwan remains a ""core issue"" for China and that foreign interference will not be tolerated, Reuters reported.

""We urge the U.S. side to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,"" Tan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taiwan-reports-chinese-aircraft-in-its-air-defense-zone-after-russia-invaded-ukraine,2022-02-24
Teacher calls 911 when intruder breaks into students' home during remote-learning class,"A California teacher is being hailed a hero after she called 911 in response to a home invasion that took place during a remote class on Thursday.

What are the details?

According to Newsweek, teacher Jennifer Peterson was waiting for all of her students to log off their remote learning segment when she noticed that two of her teenage students were crying out for help.

The outlet reported that Peterson watched her students' faces go from ""concern to panic"" as they began screaming for help. As it turned out, a suspect broke into the home through a window.

""They kept saying 'Help us, help us' and calling out to me,"" she recalled.

The California teacher jumped into action and called 911 and remained online with her students until authorities arrived on the scene.

The children's mother, Reyna Luna, who was not at home when the incident took place, according to the International Business Times, said that she saw police surrounding the neighborhood when she returned.

She livestreamed the incident on Facebook, saying that her children were terrified.

She captioned the stream, ""Guy broke in to the house then went out the back door and jumped over to the neighbors [sic] house saying he was being chased by guys with rifles. Then he went to the neighbors [sic] house in to her garage and hid under their car. So scary.""

According to WXIX-TV, Luna said, ""My kids are like completely terrified right now. They said that a guy opened the window and went inside the house.""

Burglary in progress

Galt police said that officers responded to a burglary in progress at a residence near Lake Canyon Avenue and Golden Heights Drive.

Authorities revealed they arrested 55-year-old Louis Dulay in connection with the reported break-in. Dulay was charged with burglary, child endangerment, loitering on private property with intent to commit a crime, and tampering with a vehicle.

He was booked into the Sacramento County Main jail.

The Galt, California, police shared a Facebook post on the incident, writing:

On 10/15/2020, at approximately 1341 hours, Officers responded to a residence near Lake Canyon Ave/Golden Heights Drive, to a report of a burglary-in-progress. The reporting party advised a male subject had entered through a window of the residence while two children were inside. The male subject fled from the residence and jumped over their back fence into a neighbor's yard.



As officers were responding to the scene, an additional caller reported a male subject, matching the description, had made entry into their garage. The male subject stated he was being chased by several subjects with rifles.

Officers arrived on scene and attempted to locate the male. Officers searched for the suspect, who was found to have made entry into the residence through their garage door, and had attempted to conceal himself between a couch and coffee table.



The male suspect was identified as Louis Dulay, 55, of Galt. Dulay was arrested for burglary, child endangerment, loitering on private property with intent to commit a crime, and tampering with a vehicle. Dulay was transported and booked at Sacramento County Main Jail without incident.

Ted Cruz hammers Biden for claiming the Russian invasion is solely to blame for high gas prices: 'This is a flat-out lie',"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ripped into President Joe Biden (D) for attempting to pin all of the blame on higher gas prices on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Cruz was referring to comments from Biden to reporters on Tuesday saying that gas prices would get worse, but he was powerless to do anything about it.

""They're going to go up,"" said Biden about gas prices.

""Can't do much right now. Russia's responsible,"" he added.

Cruz took to Twitter to refute the claim from the president.

""This is a flat-out lie. Gas prices have increased 48% under Biden—BEFORE RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE. Biden did that,"" Cruz tweeted.

He went on to list the policies that Biden pursued which have led to higher gas prices prior to the Russian invasion, including his opposition to the Keystone pipeline, freezing federal oil leases, and shutting down drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Cruz explained his criticism in a guest appearance on CNBC Tuesday morning where he hammered away at Biden's energy policies.

""It really is striking, in 2019 the United States became a net energy exporter, we are an oil and gas superpower, and yet under Joe Biden last year, for the first time since then America stopped being a net energy exporter, as our production went down,"" Cruz said.

""And the result of Biden's presidency has been that the enemies of America, countries like Russia, like Iran, like Venezuela are all getting stronger, getting richer, getting more aggressive, getting more hostile,"" he continued, ""because the president is simultaneously weakening our own ability to produce energy and strengthening their ability to produce energy.""

NBC reported that the shift in messaging was purposeful by the White House after taking the blame for gas prices and increasing inflation before the invasion.

Ted Cruz calls for American energy independence in proposed legislation,"Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to restore American energy independence as the global energy sector experiences ongoing difficulties in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Fox Business reported that Cruz announced the “Energy Freedom Act” in a Friday press release that he also used to criticize President Joe Biden for allowing America to fall behind on its ability to export fuel.

Cruz said that the Biden administration has caused America to lose its “status as a net petroleum exporter.”

In the press release, Cruz said, “These policies have poured billions of dollars into countries such as Russia and Iran, which use those funds to attack our allies and undermine the national security of America.”

“President Biden has imposed more restrictions on U.S. oil companies than he has on Russian oil,” Cruz said, “With Iran, he has looked the other way as the regime busted through sanctions and raised their exports to more than one million barrels per day for the first time in almost three years.”

Cruz said that should his legislation pass, it would provide an economic boon for the country while enabling the United States to reduce trade with countries it hopes to punish on the international stage.

Cruz said that his bill is focused on “[reversing] Biden’s actions so we can restore American energy independence” and that it “won’t cost taxpayers a dime” While creating “Billions in revenue in the coming years’ For the United States “by expediting permitting, leasing, safe new pipelines, and exports, and providing much needed regulatory certainty.”

He said, “It would create new jobs, lower energy costs, and because modern energy production in the United States is far cleaner than in any other country by every measure, it would help the environment. The Energy Freedom Act would put a stop to the Biden administration’s sabotage of the American energy industry, and Congress should take it up without delay.”

Cruz also recently amplified statements made by tech CEO Elon Musk calling for American energy independence.

Musk took to Twitter and said, “Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil [and] gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.”

Responding emphatically, Cruz said that he “couldn’t agree more.”

Some of the Biden administration’s first actions in office were to restrict American oil drilling. Upon entering the White House, Biden revoked the Keystone XL pipeline’s permit to transport fossil fuels and moved to prevent the issuing of new leases to drill for oil and gas on federal lands.

These steps considerably reduced the amount of energy being domestically produced and has led to American leadership considering the purchase of oil from hostile nations like Iran.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-calls-for-american-energy-independence-in-proposed-legislation,2022-03-06
"Teen who tracked Elon Musk's private jet now following Putin, Russian oligarchs","The teenager who famously launched a Twitter account that tracks tech billionaire Elon Musk's private jet is now monitoring the travel activity of Russian President Vladimir Putin and several Russian oligarchs.

What are the details?

Jack Sweeney, a 19-year-old freshman student at the University of Central Florida, runs the accounts by programming bots to monitor flight tracking data and tweet every time a certain plane departs one airport or lands at another.

Now under Sweeney's gaze on an account called ""Russian Oligarch Jets"" are 39 planes and helicopters belonging to 19 oligarchs — including Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich, steel magnate Alexander Abramov, Vladimir Potanin, and Norilsk Nickel, among others.

Another account, called ""Russian VIP & Putin Jets,"" seeks to monitor the travel of other high-profile members of Russia's elite class and perhaps even the notorious Russian president himself.

Though Sweeney was careful to note that data coming from this account might not be ""too accurate"" given the sheer number of private jets and issues relating to aircraft coverage in Russia. Likewise, Putin is not necessarily known to be a jet-setter.

What else?

The accounts only started days ago but have already garnered massive followings due to the worldwide attention being given to Russian leaders amid the country's unprovoked invasion of neighboring country, Ukraine.

“It’s just been crazy,” Sweeney told NBC News. ""I just figured some people would be interested in it. I just didn't think all kinds of people would be.""

He added that ""people have been asking me about Putin for a while. They wanted to know if they could track him.""

As of Tuesday afternoon, the account tracking Russian oligarchs had attracted more than 180,000 followers. The account tracking Putin, which was launched later, had attracted more than 30,000 followers.

The college freshman added that he knew almost nothing about the Russian power structure heading into the weekend.

""Before this, I didn’t even know there were these [influential] oligarchs like this,"" he said. ""They probably do have a decent amount of power from what I can understand.""

Others, however, are well aware of the influence such men have and are eager to penalize them in any way they can for Russia's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, a move that has destabilized global politics.

Anything else?

The oligarchs were apparently on the move this week, as jets and helicopters owned by Abramovich moved from Moscow to distant locations such as Basseterre in Sint Kitts and Baku, Azerbaijan. aircraft owned by Abramov touched down in London, England, and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.



Interestingly, one of Abramov's private jets landed in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday afternoon.

Starting Sunday, Russian aircraft were no longer permitted to fly in airspace owned by the European Union, Reuters reported. While the U.S. is reportedly considering similar action, no decision has been made.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teen-tracks-russian-oligarchs-flights,2022-03-01

Police added to WTIC that the teens were rushed to hospitals, where they were pronounced dead.

The resident suffered minor injuries in the attack, WTIC noted, adding that the handgun used in the shooting is registered to the resident, who is cooperating with police.

Officer Marc Caruso of the East Hartford Police Department told WTIC that ""the only weapon recovered on scene"" belongs to the resident.

Police are calling the incident a ""targeted home invasion"" but still are trying to figure out what led to it, WTIC said.

""It appears as though the homeowner had no knowledge of his attackers,"" Caruso added to the station. ""We're looking into several possibilities. The detectives are tracking down leads at this time.""

Police also were looking for one or more armed individuals who may have been involved and possibly left the scene, Lt. John DuPont told CT Insider.

No 'stand your ground' law

Kenneth Gray — a senior lecturer at the University of New Haven and a former FBI agent — told WTIC that Connecticut does not have a ""stand your ground"" law, which means the victim of a threat must first try to get away before using deadly force.

""You are justified in using self-defense to include a firearm if you fear for your life or the life of a third person, but it's not totally unrestricted,"" Gray added to the station. ""By that I mean if the person is threatening you, you can use deadly force. But if you have other options — for instance, if you can run away — you have to run away.""

Caruso added to WTIC that police are characterizing the shooting ""as a home invasion type incident where two males came into the home. And it appears to be a case of self-defense at this time, where the homeowner was a legal owner of the firearm.""

Anything else?

Hartford Public Schools released a statement regarding the teens' deaths, WTIC said:

On Thursday, June 16, 2022, we were informed of the deaths of two former Hartford Public School students. This is an unfortunate and tragic incident, and we are deeply saddened by the loss of members of our Hartford Public Schools community. We are prepared to provide proper support and resources for students and staff affected by this tragedy. Our thoughts are with our former students’ families, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teens-shot-dead-after-attack,2022-06-20
"'Tell him I will thrash them,' Putin reportedly declares as he rejects a handwritten bid for peace from Zelenskyy","Roman Abramovich, the former owner of the Chelsea FC soccer team, in recent weeks has been serving as an impromptu diplomat as he works to convey messages between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Abramovich, a fabulously wealthy Russian businessman, is currently attempting to avoid Western sanctions on his wealth by residing in Istanbul, Turkey. Aside from his business endeavors, Abramovich is well known for his close relationship with Putin.

From his residence in Turkey, Abramovich has been acting as a “peacemaker,” according to the Daily Mail, as he flies back and forth between Moscow and Ukraine communicating with Putin and Zelenskyy.

Last Wednesday, Abramovich left his Istanbul residence aboard a private jet for Moscow.

The oligarch flew into the Russian capital to meet with Putin and give him a handwritten note from Zelenskyy that outlined Ukraine’s terms for peace.

In response to this, Putin is reported to have said, “Tell him I will thrash them.”

After meeting with Putin in Moscow, Abramovich returned to Istanbul, where he met with the Ukrainian politician turned negotiator Rustem Umerov.

In Turkey, Abramovich and Umerov were assisted in negotiations with Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Kalin suggested that Ukrainian officials make a deal with their Russian counterparts in which Crimea and Donbas be held under a long-term lease — similar to the situation between Britain and China regarding Hong Kong.

Putin is reportedly considering the agreement, but his intense frustration with his military’s lack of success and disdain for Zelenskyy are holding him back.

Abramovich is one of several Russian oligarchs seeking refuge from Western sanctions in Turkey. He currently has two of his superyachts moored in Bodrum, a city on the country’s southwest coast.

Abramovich, in particular, has been able to work around sanctions from the Turkish government, despite his close relationship with Putin, because of his utility and willingness to participate in and assist with peace talks.

Previous peace talks hosted by Turkey between Russian and Ukrainian coalitions reportedly failed.

This experience is not unique, however.

Efforts to secure peace are proving to be increasingly difficult as the conflict drags on.

Leadership in the Israeli government has also run into trouble trying to advocate for peace.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Zelenskyy over the phone in mid-March and urged him to accept Putin’s conditions for peace, including an immediate cease to military action, enshrining geopolitical neutrality in the Ukrainian constitution, officially recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, and recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy was not agreeable to these terms.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tell-him-i-will-thrash-them-putin-rejects-handwritten-bid-for-peace-from-zelenskyy,2022-03-28
Tesla will continue paying salaries of Ukrainian employees who return home to fight,"As a way to support Ukraine in its fight against invading Russian forces, Tesla has announced that it will continue paying the salaries of Ukrainian employees asked to return to their homeland to fight for at least three months.

The announcement was disclosed in an internal email to employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, CNBC reported. The outlet noted, however, that it wasn’t immediately clear whether the policy had been or would be extended to employees in North America and elsewhere around the globe.

The company reportedly said that after the three-month time period, it would reassess the situation depending on how the conflict is going.

""For any Tesla employees who is a Ukrainian national and has been asked to return to Ukraine for active duty as a reservist, we will maintain their employment and salary for 3 months, with a view to assessing after this period as needed,"" read the email, sent by Axel Tangen, Tesla's director of Northern Europe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up military reservists late last month as Russian troops continued to mass around the country's borders. Only days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion, sending Europe into its bloodiest land war since World War II.

Since the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy has leaned on the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, promising to supply weaponry to any citizen who would remain and fight.

The United States and several other Western nations have responded to Russia's unprovoked attack by heavily sanctioning the invading country while supplying Ukraine with a deluge of armaments and high-tech weaponry.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, too, has been aiding the war efforts. Tangen's email announcing the three-month pay for military policy shed light on Musk's enterprise to quickly bring fortified internet service to Ukraine.

""Tesla teamed up with SpaceX to provide coverage expansion for its Starlink services to help provide an alternative internet infrastructure,"" Tangen wrote, noting that volunteers tested, configured, and shipped several hundred Starlink units to Ukraine this month.

He added that ""in true Tesla fashion, the solution has been put together in less than 3 days.""

Additionally, Tesla’s Energy team assembled and provided lithium-ion battery storage systems known as Tesla Powerwalls to run the Starlink equipment.

Ukraine vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who also oversees digital transformation for the country, personally thanked Musk on Twitter, writing, ""Received the second shipment of Starlink stations!

"Texas deputy’s wife, 4-year-old shot during violent home invasion","A suspect reportedly broke into a Texas deputy's home Sunday night and shot the officer's wife and 4-year-old stepdaughter.

The family has not been publicly identified at the time of this reporting, according to the New York Daily News.

What are the details?

During a weekend news conference, Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said the deputy, who was off-duty at the time, was at home in the early hours of Sunday morning when a suspect armed with a shotgun and assault rifle broke into the family home.

The suspect, who also remains unnamed at the time of this reporting, purportedly began firing, and struck the deputy's wife in the leg and 4-year-old in the arm.

The deputy returned fire and phoned authorities for backup. When backup arrived at the scene, they reportedly discovered a blood trail leaving the family's home.

Finner added that it remains not clear whether the deputy was targeted. He added that the family is expected to recover.

""We don't know anything, what's the motive of this, if it was targeted or what, all we know is he forced entry,"" Finner said. ""At some point, the deputy exchanged gunfire with him. He feels that he struck the subject. There is a separate blood trail.""

On Sunday, KTVT-TV reported that the child required surgery following the injury, but is in stable condition following the procedure.

Authorities investigating incident

""Anytime a citizen gets shot in Houston, let alone a deputy's or officer's family, it's something we take seriously, but a lot of investigation has to go on with it,"" Finner added.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing. Authorities describe the suspect as a Hispanic male about 5 feet 5 inches tall, according to a report from Newsweek.

""We really need to get this guy in custody,"" Finner insisted.

Gov. Greg Abbott bans use of TikTok on Texas gov't issued devices over communist Chinese surveillance concerns,"Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered a ban of the use of the popular TikTok social media application among Texas state employees and agencies over concerns about communist Chinese surveillance.

TikTok boasts over 80 million users in the U.S., but experts have warned the public that the company that owns the platform has strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party and has very invasive digital behavior.

Abbott issued a press release about the order Tuesday.

“TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users’ devices—including when, where, and how they conduct Internet activity—and offers this trove of potentially sensitive information to the Chinese government,” wrote the governor in part.

""While TikTok has claimed that it stores U.S. data within the U.S., the company admitted in a letter to Congress that China-based employees can have access to U.S. data. It has also been reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok location information to surveil individual American citizens,"" he explained.

Abbot has ordered that TikTok be removed from all government-issued devices used by officers and employees, including all computers, tablets, and desktop computers.

""Further, under China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law, all businesses are required to assist China in intelligence work including data sharing, and TikTok’s algorithm has already censored topics politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party, including the Tiananmen Square protests,"" he concluded.

Abbott is not the first governor to ban the app for state employees. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem banned TikTok in South Dakota in November.

""South Dakota is banning TikTok for state government. We will have no part in intelligence gathering for China, a nation that hates America,"" she tweeted at the time.

Maryland has also similarly banned TikTok.

Experts have warned that TikTok might be used by the Communist Chinese Party to obtain sensitive and personal information from the cellphones of U.S. citizens that it can use later to blackmail or otherwise undermine its victims.

"Homeowner shoots alleged intruder — then suspect kicks open ambulance door, runs off, and is so combative when cops recapture him that he's injected with sedative","A Texas homeowner shot a man over the weekend who allegedly tried to break into the homeowner's residence — but when the suspect was getting treatment, he kicked the ambulance door open, ran off, and was soon recaptured by police.

What are the details?

San Antonio homeowners told police that a man was in their yard and was trying to break into their home around 1:30 a.m. Sunday, KABB-TV reported.

One homeowner said he warned the suspect about the possibility of getting shot, the station said.

But after the suspect charged toward the home's back door, authorities told KABB that the homeowner shot the suspect twice.

What happened next?

Police were driving around the 300 block of Wilmot Street when they heard gunshots, after which they conducted a search and found a man in his 40s with gunshot wounds to his right thigh and elbow, the station said.

KABB said officers called for help and began to treat the man in an ambulance — but officials added to the station that the man decided he didn't want treatment, kicked the ambulance door open, and tried to flee.

The station said the man was immediately apprehended and brought back into the ambulance.

But that wasn't the end of the cops' problems.

Police told KABB that the suspect was so combative that he was sedated so medical staff could treat him.

Police are still investigating the incident, the station said, and no other injuries were reported.

Texas home invasion thwarted by 17-year-old with shotgun,"Three armed men attempted a home invasion of a residence in Texas. However, two of the home invaders never made it off the property because a 17-year-old blasted the alleged burglars with a shotgun.

Three armed men wearing masks broke into a home in east Harris County around 10:40 p.m. on Friday, police said. Inside the home were an adult female, a 12-year-old boy, and two 17-year-old males. One of the 17-year-old reacted to the break-in by grabbing a shotgun.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the 17-year-old fired several times and struck two of the suspects who allegedly broke into the home in Channelview – a suburb east of Houston.

Police found the two men unresponsive and suffering from gunshot wounds at the home. The two suspects were pronounced dead at the crime scene by emergency management personnel, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.

The third suspect fled the home and drove away in a dark-colored four-door sedan.

None of the people already in the home were harmed.

The identities of the shooter, the deceased suspects, or the man who got away have yet to be revealed by authorities.

The case was presented to the Harris County district attorney's office, which recommended the case be presented to a Harris County Grand Jury, the Harris County Sheriff's Office stated.

There is still an ongoing investigation into the shooting and a search for the third suspect that fled.

""I had my kid in the house with me, and that's the first thing that came to my mind, my family's safety,"" he added to the station, saying he then grabbed his gun and shot through a window.

Investigators told KABB the homeowner said he was asleep at the time of the incident and gave the intruder a verbal warning before opening fire.

""He heard someone prying on some plywood that was covering up a hole in the house,"" a San Antonio police officer added to KABB. ""Right now, we're investigating an attempted burglary.""

KSAT said the suspect was hit in the thigh and is expected to be OK.

""I just knew I got him 'cause he yelled and then he ran to the front, and I stopped him right there and waited for the police to show up,"" the homeowner noted to KSAT, adding that the suspect tried to convince him he wasn't doing anything.

'He was cussing me out'



""He was cussing me out and telling me that I got the wrong person,"" the homeowner added to KSAT.

The homeowner will not be charged, KABB said.

Police have visited the home 10 times so far this year, and eight of those calls involved burglaries, KABB reported, citing police records the station said it obtained.

""I don't know why,"" the homeowner told KSAT of the repeated incidents. ""You can walk inside the house, and you will see that I don't have nothing here, nothing worth of any value. I don't know. They just keep on coming back for some reason.""

The homeowner added to KSAT he hopes others also will protect their residences: ""I definitely recommend that because you don't know what these other people are capable of doing. You need to have everything to protect your family.""

"Texas rancher says illegal immigrants have caused $60,000 in property damages on his land: 'We don't have the same rights as other people do'","A Texas rancher says he has sustained $60,000 in property damages because of the ongoing ""invasion"" of illegal immigrants coming across the southern border.

Brent Smith, a rancher and attorney from Kinney County, told Fox News on Monday that ranchers in the area where he lives have been forced to hire private security ""to defend their own property rights.""

""Us Americans, in this part of Texas, we don't have the same rights as other people do,"" Smith said. ""We can't enjoy our property and go in our backyards anymore at night. It's a tragedy.""

He harshly criticized President Joe Biden for neglecting to enforce immigration law by permitting migrants who cross the border illegally to be released from detention and enter the U.S.

Since assuming office, Biden has prioritized dismantling the immigration and border security policies of his predecessor President Donald Trump. Biden reinstated ""catch and release"" policies that ended under Trump, and he also canceled construction of a wall on the southern border and overturned the Trump administration's remain-in-Mexico policy requiring migrants to wait for their asylum cases to be processed before entering the U.S.

Because of Biden's policies, immigration enforcement agencies have reported record numbers of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border. This fiscal year there have been more than 1.1 million migrants encountered by Border Patrol agents.

These migrants are trespassing on land owned by American ranchers to avoid detection by immigration and border enforcement, and Smith said that criminal activity on the border has left many Americans in border communities feeling unsafe, even during the day.

""If you don't have a gun with you, you're taking a chance,"" he said of ranchers walking on their own property. ""And it's sad that that's the reality we live in today.""

He added that criminal drug cartels ""are in absolute control of both sides of the border right now.""

According to Smith, no one is compensating the ranchers for damages inflicted on their property.



""If it's a stolen vehicle that goes through the property, their vehicle insurance isn't going to pay for it and ours won't either so the landowners are stuck with paying for this,"" Smith said.

He explained that ranchers are also liable to cover the costs when livestock escape from damaged fences and cause accidents on the road.

Some in Congress are working to correct the injustice. Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas) on July 30 introduced bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives that would reimburse farmers and ranchers for costs incurred by vandalism of their property from the illegal immigration surge.

Pfluger's bill would redistribute $300 million in unspent COVID-19 rescue funds to pay farmers and ranchers for damages on their property related to migrant activity.

""Farmers and ranchers near the border are enduring livestock loss, crop loss, and damage to fences, physical structures, and more at the hands of trespassing coyotes and illegal migrants,"" Pfluger said on social media. ""My bill, the #RAPIDAct, would reimburse farmers for these damages.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-rancher-illegal-immigrants-property-damage,2021-08-02
"Texas task force deploys drones, K-9s to manage 'unprecedented number' of illegal immigrant 'gotaways'","Texas recently launched a new specialized task force that is deploying K-9 units and drones to help manage the surge of illegal immigrant ""gotaways"" evading border authorities, Fox News reported.



""Gotaways"" are illegal immigrants who crossed the border and were detected by surveillance cameras or other methods but were not captured by Border Patrol agents. In November, there were an estimated 73,000 gotaways, the highest number ever recorded at the southern border.

""Last month, at least 2,400 people evaded Border Patrol EVERY DAY along our southern border,"" Abbott posted on Twitter. ""The border is not secure despite what the Biden Admin. claims. Texas continues stepping up to fill in the dangerous gaps left by Biden's open border policies.""

Customs and Border Protection reported an additional 136,000 encounters at the Texas border in October, a 50% increase from numbers reported in October 2021.

In response to the southern border crisis, Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) launched Operation Lone Star in March 2021. The border security initiative is a joint mission involving the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department. Since its launch, the initiative has grown substantially to keep up with the record-breaking invasion at the border.

Texas' new elite task force, which is part of Operation Lone Star, includes troopers, drone operators, and tracking K-9s. The unit's goal is to locate and apprehend illegal immigrant gotaways evading border agents and entering the United States.

So far, the team has arrested multiple groups of single adult men hiding from authorities. The task force is also responsible for gathering intelligence, preventing human smuggling, and identifying cartel scouts.

""This is in part due to the unprecedented number of gotaways,"" spokesperson Lt. Christopher Olivarez told Fox News. ""We will continue to deploy specialized teams and task forces in strategic areas to address threats against public safety and provide support to our federal partners.""

The cartel scouts have been using radios and drones to track and monitor the movements of law enforcement agents to find the best window of opportunity to traffic migrants across the border.

According to a December 2 press release from the governor's office, Operation Lone Star has successfully apprehended 328,000 migrants and made more than 22,100 criminal arrests. Of those arrests, 19,600 have led to felony charges. Since April, Abbott has bused over 13,000 migrants to sanctuary cities, including Washington, D.C., New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-task-force-deploys-drones-k-9s-to-manage-unprecedented-number-of-illegal-immigrant-gotaways,2022-12-08

During a news conference Monday, Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne told reporters that the autopsy confirmed initial fears that Rollins' death was caused by ""exsanguination due to feral hog assault,"" the Daily Mail reported.

According to CNN, authorities believe ""that 'multiple hogs' assaulted Rollins when she arrived at work, likely between 6 and 6:30 a.m., when it was still dark outside."" She had exited her vehicle and locked the door behind her when the attack occurred.

""My detectives and the criminal investigation team felt like [feral hogs] was what it was but we couldn't come close to announcing until we had the cause of death from the medical examiner's office,"" Hawthorne said. The sheriff did not give further details, but added, ""In my 35 years, I will tell you, it's one of the worse things I've ever seen.""

The Houston Chronicle noted that feral hog attacks on humans are incredibly rare, reporting that ""only four fatal wild pig attacks have ever been reported in the United States, including three instances where the pig was injured during a hunt.""

Wild hogs are an invasive species in several states, including Texas, where ""landowners can get rid of a hog [on] their property by any means necessary,"" the Chronicle added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-woman-killed-by-feral-hogs-in-pre-dawn-attack,2019-11-26
The Beau Biden Foundation took in millions of dollars in donations while spending just thousands on philanthropy in 2020,"The Beau Biden Foundation spent less than $750,000 in 2020 on its purported mission despite raking in nearly $4 million in donations the same year.

The New York Post reported that the Delaware-based charity, which was started in honor of President Joe Biden’s late son, received an infusion of $1.8 million from the Biden Foundation — started by Joe and Jill Biden — prior to that organization ending operations before Joe became president.

The Beau Biden Foundation also received more than $200,000 in charitable donations from entities that are tied to a top political donor of the president.

Reportedly, the charity spent just over $500,000, in 2020, towards its stated purpose of protecting children from abuse, according to tax filings.

The charity spent an almost equivalent amount that year in paying six-figure salaries of longtime Biden associates who hold executive-level jobs at the Beau Biden Foundation. This includes Patricia Day Lewis, who served as Delaware deputy attorney general during Beau Biden’s tenure as the state of Delaware’s Attorney General. Lewis currently runs the non-profit and, as of 2020, receives an annual salary of over $150,000.

Joshua Alcorn, a Democratic operative with a long resume who has also worked as a consultant on campaigns for both Joe and Beau Biden, served as the COO of the non-profit, in 2020, and received $131,437 in compensation. He has since left this role.

Hunter Biden, the middle-aged trouble child of the Biden family, also previously served on the board of the Beau Biden Foundation.

Currently, Hallie Biden, with whom Hunter had a prolonged affair after the death of his brother, is the only member of the Biden family serving on the board.

The board also features former FBI director Louis Freeh.

CharityWatch, a watchdog group, stated that non-profits that receive its highest ratings generally spend at least 75 percent of their annual budget on their charitable giving programs. The Beau Biden Foundation, in this case, only dedicated 58 percent of its spending to its mission.

Laurie Styron, the executive director of CharityWatch, said, “A 58 percent ratio does not reflect a high level of financial efficiency.”

The non-profit said that following the 2021 inauguration of Joe Biden, in a bid to increase transparency, it would no longer take money from lobbyists or foreign donors and would release the names of its major contributors.

Currently, the Beau Biden Foundation conducts virtual and in-person workshops for adults starting at $500 a session and holds sessions for children focusing on topics like bullying and internet safety.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-beau-biden-foundation-took-in-millions-of-dollars-in-donations-while-spending-more-on-salaries-than-philanthropy-in-2020,2022-03-26
Biden admin recruits TikTok influencers to combat 'misinformation',"The Biden administration announced this week that it plans to utilize social media influencers to ""combat scams and misinformation"" about the new federal student loan debt relief program. The White House has repeatedly enlisted TikTok stars to push the administration's preferred messaging, including previous campaigns focused on vaccines and the invasion of Ukraine.



""The White House will engage directly with digital creators and influencers on social media platforms to help spread accurate information about the program and alerts concerning potential scams,"" the White House fact sheet read.

The announcement comes just days after Biden came under heavy scrutiny for walking back student loan forgiveness eligibility, a move that NPR called a ""remarkable reversal."" An administration official told the news outlet that 800,000 borrowers would no longer be qualified to receive the relief.

The White House hopes its ""influencer army"" will help reach and spread more desirable information about the Biden administration to younger audiences.

After passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration invited 20 social media influencers to the South Lawn of the White House, where they were briefed on the legislation. Select online personalities with large audiences received a special invitation to attend the event.

V Spehar, a TikTok user with 2.7 million followers, told NPR, ""I got a magical email from the digital communications team at the White House saying they were going to be doing essentially a creator briefing for the Inflation Reduction Act.""

The influencers who attended the intimate event were briefed in the Roosevelt Room by members of the National Economic Council, the climate policy office, President Biden, and Vice President Harris.

Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, told NPR, ""The reality is, if we want to go out and talk to a wide amount of people whose lives are going to be impacted by the Inflation Reduction Act, and both take credit and also tell people how they can access some of the benefits, then we need to get out into the digital communities that people exist in — and that means spending time with digital creators who have huge reaches into those audiences.""

Pew Research reported that 33% of individuals ages 18 to 29 said they get their news from social media.

""We're not expecting them to become Biden administration propagandists,"" Flaherty said. ""But we want to make sure that they have the best information that they can get and be able to ask questions, just like reporters would, to be able to inform their audiences.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-admin-recruits-tiktok-influencers-to-combat-misinformation,2022-10-09
The Biden administration resumes oil and gas leases on federal land but in a reduced capacity and with steeper fees,"This past Friday, the Biden administration announced that it would resume granting lease sales for the drilling of oil and natural gas on federal lands.

However, as the Washington Examiner reported, the Biden administration intends to drastically decrease the amount of federal land available for drilling and plans to increase the royalty it charges companies to produce oil on federal lands.

In a recently released press release, the Department of the Interior said that it will make 144,000 acres of federal lands available for drilling. This is an 80% reduction in acreage that was originally designated for natural gas production. The department will also begin charging companies drilling royalties of 18.75% instead of 12.5%.

The release said, “The [Bureau of Land Management] will issue final environmental assessments and sale notices of upcoming oil and gas leases that reflect this strategic approach.”

“The lease sales will incorporate many of the recommendations in the Department’s report,” the release continued. “Including ensuring Tribal consultation and broad community input, reliance of the best available science including analysis of GHG emissions, and a first-ever increase in the royalty rate for new competitive leases to 18.75 percent, to ensure fair return for the American taxpayers and on par with rates charged by states and private landowners.”

It continued, “The BLM assessed potentially available and eligible acreage in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming. It began analyzing 646 parcels on roughly 733,000 acres that had been previously nominated for leasing by energy companies. As a result of robust environmental review, engagement with Tribes and communities, and prioritizing the American people’s broad interests in public lands, the final sale notices will offer approximately 173 parcels on roughly 144,000 acres, an 80 percent reduction from the acreage originally nominated.”

This move by the Department of the Interior comes as the Biden administration begins to acknowledge the importance of increasing domestic energy production amid soaring energy prices.

Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, called the department’s new plan an overdue “reset’ of the leasing program.

She said, “For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries above local communities, the natural environment, the impact on our air and water, the needs of Tribal Nations, and, moreover, other uses of our shared public lands.”'

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western nations issued thoroughgoing sanctions on the Russian economy. The U.S. was quick to stop importing Russian oil, and since the Biden administration ended American energy independence, American energy prices drastically rose as there was suddenly less oil being imported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-administration-resumes-oil-and-gas-leases-on-federal-land-in-reduced-capacity,2022-04-16
The Bidens celebrate their new cat as the economy worsens and global tensions rise,"As global tensions rose and economic uncertainty plagued the American people this week, the Bidens welcomed a new four-legged friend into the White House.

The first lady’s office announced that America’s first family welcomed a two-year-old gray-and-white-striped cat named Willow to the White House.

Reuters reports that a spokesperson for Jill Biden, Michael LaRosa, confirmed that the young tabby cat — named Willow — was named after Mrs. Biden’s hometown of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.

According to LaRosa, Mrs. Biden met Willow at a campaign stop in 2020.

“A farm cat from Pennsylvania, Willow made quite an impression on Dr. Biden in 2020 when she jumped up on the stage and interrupted her remarks during a campaign stop in 2020,” LaRosa said, “Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr. Biden.”

While Willow may be living her American dream, many humanoid Americans are having an incredibly rough winter as the domestic economy aggressively trends downward and tensions continue to rise abroad.

Americans are watching their wages and savings evaporate due to inflation, and Russia continues to mass forces along Ukrainian borders.

Inflation increased by 7% last year, according to data provided by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the biggest increase in inflation since the early 1980s, marking a 40-year high. Notably, core inflation — the inflationary rate not accounting for price fluctuation in things like food and gas — rose by 5.5%.

While the Biden White House celebrates the addition of a new pet to the first family’s rotating menagerie of critters, the American people are watching as their wages and savings shrink before their very eyes as the economy spirals down the drain.

American citizens are without evacuation assistance from the government and the American embassy in Kyiv has been closed, as Russia stands ready to attack and invade Ukraine. The U.S. State Department believes foreign intelligence shows “every indication” that Russia will use force against Ukraine by mid-February, reports Fox News.

The Washington Examiner reports that President Biden previously stated he has “no intention of putting American forces or NATO forces in Ukraine.” But, regardless of his intentions, American lives are still at risk and American interests abroad are being compromised.

According to the Associated Press, the first lady has been expecting Willow to move into the West Wing since last April. Whereas the legacy media and its left-wing acolytes might find the Bidens' new pet endearing, the American people continue to worry about what lies in the future.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-biden-s-celebrate-their-new-cat-as-the-economy-worsens-and-global-tensions-rise,2022-01-28
The Chinese government is accelerating the build-up of its nuclear arsenal as tensions with the US rise,"People familiar with the thought process of China’s leadership say that the Chinese government has begun to accelerate the development of its nuclear arsenal after reassessing the threat posed to mainland China by the United States.

The Wallstreet Journal said that China’s nuclear effort “long predates Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the U.S.’s wariness about getting directly involved in the war there has likely reinforced Beijing’s decision to put greater emphasis on developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent.”

It is believed that Chinese leaders see a stronger nuclear arsenal as a way to deter the U.S. from involving itself in a potential future conflict over Taiwan.

The Chinese government has also accelerated work on more than 100 suspected missile silos that could be used to store nuclear-tipped missiles in remote western regions of China.

American officials and independent security analysts who study nuclear proliferation say they are unsure about what is motivating Beijing’s race to develop its nuclear arsenal.

The Wallstreet Journal reported that the “people close to the Chinese leadership said China’s increased focus on nuclear weapons is also driven by fears Washington might seek to topple Beijing’s Communist government” as American foreign policy becomes more hawkish towards China.

American military officials and security analysts worry that China rapidly accelerating the development of its nuclear arsenal could embolden the Chinese Communist Party to launch a surprise nuclear strike.

Reportedly, the Chinese government plans to maintain an arsenal “no larger than necessary to ensure China’s security interests.”

A person close to the leadership of China suggested that another reason Chinese leadership is rushing to strengthen its nuclear arsenal is so that the U.S. can’t push them around on the geopolitical stage. The person said, “China’s inferior nuclear capability could only lead to growing U.S. pressure on China.”

This past year, the American security apparatus was caught entirely off guard as the Chinese government launched a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into space that circled the earth before sailing towards its target on the planet’s surface.

An unnamed U.S. official said, “We have no idea how [China] did this.”

People familiar with the thinking of Chinese leadership have said that it is unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has had an impact on the Chinese government’s nuclear acceleration despite the lingering threat of Putin using a nuclear weapon against Ukraine causing immense anxiety within the international community.

The Pentagon estimates that China will have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of this decade.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-chinese-government-is-accelerating-the-build-up-of-its-nuclear-arsenal-amid-heightened-tensions-with-the-united-states,2022-04-10
The Egyptian government extends the stays of Ukrainian tourists for free in wake of the Russian invasion,"The Egyptian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry allows tourists affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to extend their stay at Egyptian hotels free of charge until it is safe to return home.

On Thursday, Ahram Online, Egypt's largest online news organization, reported that Egypt's Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Khaled Anani, made this decision following the closing of Ukraine's airspace.

The Hotel Association of Egypt also issued a directive to all of its member hotels to extend the stays of Ukrainian and Russian tourists until Russian and Ukrainian airspace reopens, enabling them to return home safely.

Hotels were instructed to provide these stranded tourists with their resort's full amenities free of charge.

The South Sinai Hotels Chamber issued a statement to the general managers of hotels in Sharm El-Sheikh that implored them to extend the stays of Ukrainian tourists who had returned from the airport after having their flights canceled.

The chamber also told hotel management that they should provide stranded Ukrainians with whatever assistance they need and not let ""any tourist leave any hotel.""

The chamber's statement encouraged hotel management to be careful moderating potential confrontations between Ukrainian and Russian tourists.

The Ukrainian embassy in Egypt shared the Hotel Association of Egypt's directive and the South Sinai Hotels Chamber's statement on its official Facebook page and encouraged stranded Ukrainian tourists to present these documents to hotel management if necessary.

Prior to the Ministry's announcement, the Ukrainian embassy said that it was cooperating with officials in tourism and tour operators to help provide stranded Ukrainians with resources due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the temporary closure of Ukrainian airspace.

The embassy also said that it was working to find routes of entry into Ukraine through Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary so that the stranded Ukrainians can return home.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace, Ukrainian citizens abroad should stay in place, closely follow events, and register in the ministry's digital communications system that connects Ukrainians with their embassies and consulates abroad.

The head of Egypt's National Company for Air Navigation, Ihab Mohi El-Din, said that on Thursday prior to Ukraine barring commercial flight from its airspace, Egyptian airports received hundreds of Ukrainian civilians from airports in Kiev and Lviv.

Egypt is one of the most popular tourist destinations for Ukrainians. In 2019, nearly 1.5 million Ukrainians visited and during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 over 700,000 Ukrainians vacationed in Egypt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-egyptian-government-extends-the-stays-of-ukrainian-tourists-for-free-in-wake-of-the-russian-invasion,2022-02-26
The Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes that the Fed is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March.

“Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” Powell said in prepared testimony before Congress.

Powell said that it was too soon to tell how the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent sanctions on Russia issued by Western nations, could affect the U.S. economy, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The chairman’s remarks highlight the delicate economic climate that the Federal Reserve must navigate as it raises interest rates for the first time since 2018 amid rapid inflation that could be further exasperated in response to Western sanctions on Russia.

He said, “The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain.”

It’s typically unusual for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during times of geopolitical conflict. That said, the Fed is under increased pressure to raise rates since inflation is running far above the Fed’s 2% target and Western sanctions on Russia stand to further raise prices.

In late February, allied leaders of Western nations issued a joint statement expressing their intentions to restrict Russian access to the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In the statement, Western leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States said, “As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies.”

Targeting the Russian financial sector, oligarchs, and the Russian central bank with these sanctions will economically isolate Russia and make international commerce extremely difficult for the country.

Similar to previous spikes in inflation being caused by supply chain shortages and difficulty importing goods, Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve believe that the extra duress put on international trade as a result of these sanctions will cause prices to further to inflate for American consumers.

“We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors. We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched,” Powell said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-federal-reserve-is-on-track-to-raise-interest-rates-in-mid-march,2022-03-02
The first all-civilian crew of astronauts has docked with the International Space Station,"The world's first fully private space crew has docked with the International Space Station.

On Friday morning, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket containing a Dragon capsule launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday morning ""without any major hiccups,"" Engadget reported.

Reportedly the crew's flight to the ISS took around 20 hours and experienced a brief delay in the docking sequence due to a video routing problem.

CBS News reported that the SpaceX rocket carried ""a retired NASA astronaut and three wealthy civilians on the first non-government, fully commercial flight to the International Space Station – a trailblazing mission intended to help pave the way to a privately operated space lab.""

The crew consisted of Michael Lopez-Algeria, commander and former NASA astronaut, and businessmen Larry Connor, Eytan Stibbe, and Mark Pathy.

The crew is expected to spend eight days on the space station where they will conduct science experiments along with ""outreach and commercial activities."" The crew is also expected to return scientific samples back to Earth for NASA to study.

The mission was conducted by Axiom Space, a company that is — according to its website — dedicated to ""the full realization of low Earth orbit's possibilities.""

Axiom Space ""has been involved with every ISS mission since the program's inception"" and hopes to make ""the possibilities of Low Earth Orbit accessible to visionary governments, researchers, manufacturers, and individuals.""

The company believes that ""microgravity is the most promising environment for innovation and problem-solving since the Internet"" and plans on ""building the first commercial space station in our solar system starting in 2024.""

This launch marked the sixth piloted flight of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, is the ""second fully commercial flight to orbit,"" a ""d the ""fi"" st all-commercial visit to the International Space Station.""

Over the past twenty years, eleven private astronauts have had the privilege to visit the International Space Station under commercial arrangements with Russia'Russia'sagency.

In recent weeks, the Russian government announced that it would no longer collaborate with Western nations on maintaining the International Space Station. Russian officials indicated that they would see to the completion of already ongoing projects and tasks but that the country will withdraw its support of the station so long as Western nations continue to sanction the Russian economy in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Prior to pulling out of the International Space Station, Russian officials threatened to drop the station on the Western world by ceasing to provide it with resources for propulsion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-first-all-civilian-crew-of-astronauts-has-docked-with-the-international-space-station,2022-04-09
"Iranian Revolutionary Guard claims responsibility for missile barrage in Irbil, says it responded to crimes from the 'Zionist regime'","The Iranian government has claimed responsibility for a recent missile barrage that targeted the expansive U.S. consulate complex in the Iraqi city of Irbil – also spelled Erbil.

There are no reported American fatalities, according to the Associated Press, but the attack marks a significant escalation between the U.S. and Iran.

The Iranian Revolutionary guard said that it launched the attack against an Israeli “strategic center of conspiracy” in Irbil.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard said that Israel recently acted offensively by planning a recent strike that killed two members of the Revolutionary Guard which prompted an Iranian response.

“Following the recent crimes of the fake Zionist regime and the previous announcement that the crimes and evils of this infamous regime will not go unanswered; Last night, the ‘Strategic Center of Conspiracy and Evil of the Zionists’ was targeted by powerful and point-to-point missiles of the IRGC,” the Iranian Revolutionary Guard said in a statement following the attack.

An American defense official and an Iraqi security official confirmed that the strike was launched from Iran.

An Iraqi official in Baghdad initially said that several missiles had struck the U.S. consulate in Ibril and that the consulate was the target of the attack.

However, Lawk Ghafari, the head of the Kurdish foreign media office, said that none of the missiles struck the U.S. facility but that areas around the sprawling complex had been hit.

The U.S. defense official said it was unclear how many missiles were fired and what the precise area of impact was. A second U.S. official said that there was no damage at any building belonging to the U.S. government and that there is no clear indication that the target was the consulate complex.

The barrage came several days after the Iranian government said that it would retaliate for an earlier Israeli attack outside of Damascus, Syria, that resulted in the deaths of two members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

The attack also coincided with increasing regional tensions.

Negotiations between U.S. and Iranian officials over the Iran nuclear deal have been paused in response to Russian complaints over Western sanctions stemming from the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian diplomats have been serving as meditators during the negotiations.

Iranian officials also suspended the ongoing secret Baghdad talks that were aimed at defusing longstanding tensions with its rivals in Saudi Arabia.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi responded to the attack by tweeting: “The aggression which targeted the dear city of Erbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants is an attack on the security of our people. I discussed these developments with the KRG PM. Our security forces will investigate and stand firm against any threats toward our people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-iranian-revolutionary-guard-claims-responsibility-for-missile-barrage-in-irbil-says-it-responded-to-crimes-from-the-zionist-regime,2022-03-13
The Russian central bank takes steps to stabilize the ruble as it plummets in value,"The Bank of Russia is proceeding with emergency measures to stabilize its economy and to prevent the Russian ruble from losing further value.

For the first time, the Russian central bank said that it will intervene in the foreign exchange market and expand its Lombard list of securities that it will accept as collateral, Bloomberg reported.

The central bank did not mention whether or not it would raise interest rates but it did proceed with agreeing to provide Russian banks with additional liquidity. It is preparing to offer banks 1 trillion rubles — roughly $11.5 billion —in an overnight repo auction.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin, ordered Russian forces to launch their invasion of Ukraine and strike strategic targets to demilitarize the country. Upon doing so, the ruble fell to a record low in value.

In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, leaders of Western nations are implementing a wide array of sanctions to weaken the Russian economy.

Less than a day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, President Joe Biden announced that the United States would target Russia’s largest financial institutions, Sherbank and VTB, to prevent them from using the American financial system to conduct transactions. These sanctions are fairly comprehensive and will restrict nearly 80% of Russian banking assets.

Previously, Biden stopped short of calling for Russia’s removal from the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).

Biden said, “It is always an option, but right now it’s not the position the rest of Europe wishes to take.”

Kicking Russia out of SWIFT would greatly damage the Russian economy in the short term and make recovery incredibly difficult in the long term. It could prevent Russia from engaging in international transactions and would cripple their ability to export oil and gas.

On Saturday, the allied leaders of several Western countries — including the Untied States — expressed their support for preventing Russia from being able to access and utilize the SWIFT network.

The Western leaders agreed to target specific Russian banks for removal from the SWIFT system, to prevent the Russian central bank from manipulating its monetary policy, and to take aggressive steps to sanction and financially punish Russian individuals involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

By preventing Russia from using the SWIFT network, the West will effectively isolate them and inhibit them from conducting trade with some of its largest trade partners.

At the time of writing, a Russian ruble is worth about 0.012 U.S. dollars. The in-game currency for the popular children’s videogame “Roblox” – aptly named Robux – is worth about 0.0125 U.S. dollars per unit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-russian-central-bank-takes-steps-to-stabilize-the-ruble-as-it-plummets-in-value,2022-02-27
The truth about those US-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine,"In case you haven't noticed, there has been quite the controversy in the last week about whether Ukraine does or does not have biological research facilities that were funded, at least in part, by the United States military. The accusation has been the subject of some absurd fact-checks by our corporate media and accusations of ""Russian disinformation"" from our government.

The truth is: Yes, there are indeed biological research facilities in Ukraine that have been funded by our government. We don't have any way to know whether these facilities were conducting research that was intended to produce weapons or not, but we do know that if the pathogens housed in these facilities escaped, they would be just as deadly as as an intentionally produced bioweapon.

The controversy began when the Russian government tweeted the following accusation:

Specifically, the Russian government stated that it found evidence of a ""military-biological programme"" that was funded by the United States Department of Defense and that was being cleaned up during the course of the invasion.

Promptly, the United States government leapt into action to dispute this contention with the assertion that the United States military does not, and never has, funded a ""biological weapons"" program and claimed that this accusation was part of a ""Russian disinformation"" campaign. This assertion was dutifully repeated by the government's stenographers in the corporate media.

Amazingly, the seminal ""fact-check,"" written by USA Today, argued that there were no ""biolabs"" funded by the military, even while acknowledging the existence of such labs. The ""fact-check"" notes that the United States and Ukraine did have such labs, but that they were to ""prevent the proliferation of dangerous pathogens and related expertise and to minimize potential biological threats"" and further explicitly stated that the United States was providing funding to those labs, albeit for the purpose of ""making repairs, updating equipment and purchasing supplies"" at those laboratories.

At the risk of overstating the obvious, if the military is ""purchasing supplies"" at these laboratories, to say nothing of ""updating equipment"" or ""making repairs"" at these laboratories, it is funding them.

In a remarkable off-camera briefing held last week, the Defense Department further spoke about these claims. In that briefing, an unidentified ""senior Department of Defense official"" said, among other things:

A few key points about the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program Biological Threat Reduction Program activities in Ukraine this is part of the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Through that program, we have invested approximately $200 million in Ukraine since 2005, supporting 46 Ukrainian labs, health facilities, and diagnostic sites . DOD's CTR program began its biological work with Ukraine to eliminate the remnants of the Soviet Union's illegal biological weapons program left in the Soviet successor states after the USSR fell. There are no DOD bioweapon labs in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world.

The first and most obvious point to make about this statement is that it is an admission that: a) these laboratories exist, and b) we have given them a lot of money. Now, the unnamed senior official follows this up with two red herrings. First, the senior official asserted that our cooperation with Ukraine on this project began as an effort to eliminate the bioweapons program that was being carried on by the Soviet Union. Assuming that is true, it has nothing to do with our efforts that began in 2005, some 14 years after the Soviet Union fell. Second, the official asserted that ""there are no DOD bioweapon labs"" anywhere in the world.

Let's assume that this assertion is true, because it seems to be all that either the DOD or the press is focusing on. Assume that nowhere in Ukraine is a laboratory that has the express purpose of creating or proliferating a bioweapon. Fine. The assertion is simply not responsive to the charge that was actually made by the Russian government, which was that they found evidence of a ""military-biological programme"" that was funded by the United States Department of Defense. That assertion is demonstrably true and has been confirmed as true by our government. Now, our government says, and I have no reason to disbelieve it, that the purpose of those labs was not to create a bioweapon. But that doesn't mean, in this case, that what the Russian government said was false.

We know some of what the government was doing in Ukraine from documents that were released by Wikileaks. In a 2008 cable, it was revealed that Andrew Weber of the OSD/CTR (the same Department of Defense agency referred to in last week's briefing) held a discussion with Ukrainian officials about the need to create one central laboratory in Ukraine that would house its most dangerous pathogens because, among other reasons, ""the U.S. seeks to consolidate the strains/pathogens that could be used by terrorists on human or agricultural targets.""

This illustrates the problem with the government's straw man protestations that it does not fund bioweapon labs. Unlike other potential weapons of mass destruction, there is no functional difference between the danger associated with biological materials that are collected for peaceful purposes and materials that are collected for illicit, non-peaceful purposes. If a terrorist breaks into a nuclear power plant, they can't make off with a functioning nuclear bomb. However, if they break into a biological research facility that houses a dangerous pathogen that is being kept for the purpose of, say, vaccine development, they now have a fully functioning dangerous pathogen.

It probably (hopefully) is true that the Ukrainians are not housing dangerous pathogens in order to develop bioweapons on the U.S. taxpayer's dime. However, after we have just come through a two-year pandemic that has taken millions of lives and may well have been started due to a leak from a laboratory that was trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine, that may come as cold comfort to people who are justifiably concerned about the safety of those pathogens during the course of the scorched-earth campaign the Russian military is now conducting.

By the way, the initial Russian accusation did not just say the program existed, it said that there was an ""emergency cleanup"" under way that was trying to eradicate the program. This is, frankly, good news. It's exactly what should be happening.

Absolutely no one would begrudge the Ukrainians an aggressive research program into chemical and biological agents, given Russia's nasty history with poisons and pathogens — a history that includes the probable attempted assassination of Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko by the Russian government in 2004. And, given that the Russian military is now carpeting Ukraine with explosive devices, with apparently little care or ability to deliver those devices with precision, it is entirely appropriate for a cleanup operation to be under way to ensure that those pathogens are not inadvertently released.

But the United States government should be saying that, in order to ensure that our credibility remains intact on the world stage after the sad and senseless invasion of Ukraine is over.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-truth-about-those-us-funded-biological-laboratories-in-ukraine,2022-03-14
"World wakes up to all-out war: Ukraine says more than 40 soldiers, 10 civilians killed during ongoing invasion; Putin issues ominous threats to West as Ukraine declares martial law","All-out war is unfolding across Ukraine as Russian forces have invaded the neighboring country.

What are the details?

Ukraine officials say that more than 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed thus far in the early hours of the Russian invasion as explosions have rocked cities across Ukraine.

In response to the violent attacks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared martial law.

Residents have taken to the highways in an attempt to to flee Ukrainian capital Kyiv, while others have taken to subway stations as fortified, improvised bunkers.

Ukraine Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, noting that Russia is on a ""path of evil,"" comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack to that of Adolf Hitler.

In Thursday remarks, Zelenskyy called for ""everyone who is able"" to join the military and called on veterans to help.

Putin took to the airwaves early Thursday morning and issued disturbing threats while detailing the invasion — which he referred to as a ""special military operation.""

In a series of implausible remarks, he claimed that two ""people's republics"" — Ukrainian regions of Donbas — of Donetsk and Luhansk ""turned to Russian with a request for help.""

In response, Putin said, he vowed to ""demilitarize"" and ""deNazify"" Ukraine, which he claimed had been subjected to genocide.

""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he falsely claimed. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone. ... NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats.""

He concluded, ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history. We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made. I hope that I have been heard.""

What else?

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed to hand down the ""harshest ever sanctions"" against Russian in response to the ""barbaric attack,"" threatening to ""weaken Russia's economic base"" as well as its ""capacity to modernize.""

""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,” Von der Leyen told reporters during the early hours of Thursday morning. “We condemn this barbaric attack and the cynical arguments that are being used to justify it.”

She added, “These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war. And we know that millions of Russians do not want war. We will not allow President [Vladimir] Putin to replace the rule of law, by the rule of force, and ruthlessness. Ukraine will prevail.""

NATO member states Estonia, Latvia, Lithiuania, and Poland have all triggered NATO Article 4, CNN reported, to ""launch consultations within the alliance over Russia's attack on Ukraine.""

“The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any of the Parties is threatened,” Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty states. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, previous invocations of NATO Article 4 have resulted in a NATO response to include military aid and more.

Later Thursday morning, CNN reported that NATO is set to ""increase land, sea, and air forces on its eastern flank"" amid the attack.

In a statement, the security alliance said, ""Russia’s actions pose a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security, and they will have geostrategic consequences. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the security and defense of all Allies.""

“We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,"" the statement continued. ""We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.""

“Today, we have held consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty,"" the statement concluded. ""We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all Allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defense across the Alliance. Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.""

President Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned the attack.

""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,"" Biden said in a statement on the invasion. ""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-world-wakes-up-to-all-out-war-ukraine-says-more-than-40-soldiers-10-civilians-killed-during-ongoing-invasion-putin-issues-ominous-threats-to-west,2022-02-24
'This guy is brutal': Biden calls for Putin to be tried for war crimes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin was met with intense Western condemnation on Monday, as President Joe Biden and his Western allies called for the Russian leader to stand trial for war crimes.

These alleged war crimes were discovered as Ukrainian forces worked to reclaim the areas around Kyiv from withdrawing Russian troops. The Los Angeles Times reported that Ukrainian forces found mass graves in the suburbs of Kyiv. Reportedly, these graves were filled with the corpses of civilians, and the suburban streets are also said to be littered with civilian corpses.

Many of the slaughtered civilians bore mark marks of torture and execution. Bodies were found with their hands tied behind them and seemingly fatal gunshot wounds at the base of their skulls.

“This guy is brutal,” Biden said. “What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.”

The Ukrainian government said that it has counted more than 400 civilian deaths so far in the suburbs of Kyiv, including those in Bucha.

Biden’s rhetoric towards his Russian counterpart, Putin, has been intensifying as the conflict in Ukraine drags on.

In mid-March, Biden referred to Putin as a “war criminal” in remarks that the White House quickly disavowed, saying the statement reflected the president’s personal opinion and not formal U.S. policy.

About a week later, the U.S. government formally accused the Russian Federation of war crimes.

Toward the end of March, Biden referred to Putin as “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire.”

Most notably, however, Biden at one point appeared to call for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” the president said.

True to form, White House officials subsequently had to walk back Biden’s statements.

One official said that Biden “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change” but was instead insisting that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”

This past Monday, Biden said, “[Putin] is a war criminal, but we have to gather information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight.”

His comments come as Russian forces continue to withdraw from Kyiv and the surrounding northern regions of Ukraine. However, this withdrawal is not a retreat, as Russian forces have continued to strike Ukraine’s southern coastal cities and move offensive operations into the country’s eastern region.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited parts of Ukraine’s recently vacated northern region and described the decimated residential areas as a “genocide.”

In a recent address to the Romanian parliament, Zelenskyy said, “Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/this-guy-is-brutal-biden-calls-for-putin-to-be-tried-for-war-crimes,2022-04-05
'This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it': Ex-Obama official drops truth bomb as Biden blames Russia,"President Joe Biden is trying to blame February's record-high inflation numbers on Russia — but a former Obama administration official is not having it.

Steven Rattner, a former counselor to the treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, called out Biden on Thursday for misleading the American people on the record high inflation rates seen in February.

""This is Biden's inflation and he needs to own it,"" Rattner tweeted after the president released a statement blaming Russia for rising prices.



Earlier, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 7.9% increase in the consumer price index over the past year — representing a 40-year high inflation increase.

Biden referred to the price increases as ""Putin's price hike,"" claiming the Russian invasion of Ukraine is behind the surge in fuel prices punishing American pocketbooks.



""A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin’s unprovoked war, but Americans can know this: the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing,"" Biden said in a written statement.

The president pledged to take further action to ease the supply chain logjams that have contributed to inflation and to ""reduce the huge federal budget deficit that I inherited from my predecessor.""

But Rattner said the president was wrong.

""Well, no. Those are Feb #'s and only include small Russia effect,"" he explained.

Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. The BLS report covered price increases for the entire month of February. And inflation is an issue the Biden administration has struggled to address for months. Last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and others dismissed rising prices as ""transitory"" and expected inflation to subside as the economy recovered from COVID-19 lockdowns.

But inflation never slowed down, and over the past year it rose at the highest rates seen in 40 years. In response, the Fed has made plans to raise interest rates in order to combat rising prices, with the first rate hikes expected to come next week.

Before blaming Russia, Biden blamed disrupted supply chains for rising prices, but Rattner also called this excuse ""simplistic and misleading"" in an op-ed for the New York Times three weeks ago.

""Blaming inflation on supply lines is like complaining about your sweater keeping you too warm after you’ve added several logs to the fireplace,"" Rattner wrote.

""The bulk of our supply problems are the product of an overstimulated economy, not the cause of it,"" he stated, explaining that as pandemic restrictions eased, Americans began spending more money — aided by generous COVID-stimulus payments started by President Donald Trump and continued under Biden's American Rescue Plan.

""All that consumption has resulted from vast amounts of government rescue aid (including three rounds of stimulus checks) and substantial underspending by consumers during the lockdown phase of the COVID crisis,"" Rattner wrote, chocking inflation up to ""a classic economic case of 'too much money chasing too few goods'"" once the pandemic began to end.



He suggested that Biden ""make deficit reduction as important as [his] other initiatives"" to combat inflation, noting that ""smaller deficits reduce net spending by government, thus helping offset demand by consumers.""

However, Biden and Washington Democrats have shown no appetite for reduced government spending. The president has instead prioritized a multi-trillion dollar Build Back Better plan projected to add at least $750 billion to the deficit, which has already eclipsed $1.3 trillion for this year.



If Biden follows Rattner's advise he has two options: Compromise and work with Republicans to reduce spending, over the protestations of his progressive base, or attempt to raise taxes ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Neither seems likely to happen.

Thousands of illegal aliens storm El Paso in 'one of the largest mass crossings ever',"Thousands of criminal noncitizens poured into El Paso, Texas, over the weekend, apparently aided along the way by Mexican state police. Rarely before have border agents seen so many foreign nationals steal into the U.S. at one time and in one place.

For El Paso, already strained amid an unprecedented flood of criminal noncitizens, this is only a taste of things to come. Texas officials expect the deluge of illegal aliens to worsen significantly when Title 42, the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" policy, ends later this month.

Punching a hole in American sovereignty

Fox News' Bill Melugin reported that a ""huge migrant caravan of over 1,000 people crossed illegally into El Paso, TX last night, making it the largest single group we have ever seen. The city of El Paso reports Border Patrol now has over 5,000 in custody & has released hundreds to city streets.""

El Paso Matters confirmed Melugin's report, indicating that over 1,500 illegal aliens crossed the Rio Grande from Juárez into El Paso Sunday night.

The illegal aliens, who allegedly came from Nicaragua, Peru, and Ecuador, were escorted by Chihuahua State Police from the city of Jiménez to facilities run by nongovernmental organizations in the Mexican border city of Juárez.

Melugin posted a video of the buses packed with illegal aliens that were escorted by Mexican state actors to the NGO facilities:

From Juárez, the migrants then flouted American laws and stole into the United States.

Illegal aliens lined up to be taken into custody by Border Patrol with the understanding that — rather than facing a penalty for violating American territorial sovereignty — they would likely be cut loose inside the U.S.



1,744 illegal aliens were released into El Paso between Saturday and Sunday, reported El Paso Matters.

The El Paso sector of the southern border reportedly had over 2,600 illegal crossings over a period of 24 hours from Friday to Saturday.

According to the City of El Paso's ""Migrant Situational Awareness Dashboard,"" as of Dec. 12, 5,105 illegal aliens were in custody.



A problem rapidly getting worse

U.S. Customs and Border Protection noted that the El Paso sector saw a 280.6% increase in its encounters with illegal aliens stealing into the U.S. in October, and a 39.1% increase in single adults crossing.



Last month, 53,574 illegal aliens were apprehended entering the U.S. in the El Paso Sector. The Center Square indicated that figure does not include the the 24,124 illegal aliens who evaded Border Patrol in November.

Illegal border crossings unchecked by the Biden administration exceeded 2.76 million in fiscal year 2022.

In the fiscal year now under way, Border Patrol saw 230,678 criminal crossings in October alone.

This latest surge of illegal border crossings comes ahead of the end of Title 42. This Trump-era public health order, invoked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March 2020, was implemented to stop the spread of COVID-19, enabling American officials to quickly send around 40% of illegal aliens encountered on the southern border packing.

Twenty-one states sued to block the Biden administration from ending Title 42.

The complaint said, ""This suit challenges an imminent, man-made, self-inflicted calamity: the abrupt elimination of the only safety valve preventing this Administration’s disastrous border policies from devolving into unmitigated chaos and catastrophe.""

This effort to help bolster America's porous southern border was in vain. Title 42 will be lifted on December 21.

Brandon Judd, president of the national Border Patrol Union, told the New York Post, ""Once Title 42 goes away, it just means we’re going to be releasing even more people into the United States which, of course, just encourages more people to come.""



Migrants are massing in Mexico and preparing to participate in what is anticipated to be a migratory ""avalanche.""

In March, the Washington Post noted that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had enlisted Federal Emergency Management Administration officials to prepare for nearly 18,000 illegal migrants a day at the southern border upon Title 42's expungement.

TheBlaze previously reported that extra to depressing the wages of low-skilled Americans, committing crimes beyond their initial contravention of American immigration laws, and potentially undermining the integrity of elections, illegal aliens also are costing U.S. taxpayers a great deal of money.

The illegal aliens who entered the U.S. from between the beginning of President Joe Biden's term in office and Sept. 14 impose an additional burden of $20.4 billion yearly on taxpayers.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform indicated that that this annual figure is not included in the estimated $140 billion per year that taxpayers are already weighted with, which compensates for the provision of services and benefits to the ""longer-term"" illegal alien population.

In the event that crossing figures meet or exceed DHS expectations, this burden will be compounded by the millions more set to cross into the United States in fiscal year 2023.

When asked on Dec. 5 whether he planned to visit the border for the first time as president, Biden said he wouldn't, claiming that ""there are more important things going on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thousands-of-illegal-aliens-storm-el-paso-in-one-of-the-largest-mass-crossings-ever,2022-12-12

Bipartisan lawmakers introduce legislation to ban TikTok over threat of Chinese communist spying,"A group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced legislation to ban the social media platform TikTok in the U.S. over communist Chinese spying concerns.

The popular application is used by about 80 million people in the U.S. but is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company with very close ties to the communist government.

“The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok. This isn’t about creative videos — this is about an app that is collecting data on tens of millions of American children and adults every day,” said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement.

Experts say the application is invasive and collects far more information from users' cellphones than other social media apps. The threat that information gathered from users' phones might be passed on to the Chinese Communist Party has led many state governments to ban TikTok from devices provided to state employees and agencies.

""We know it’s used to manipulate feeds and influence elections,"" Rubio continued in his statement. ""We know it answers to the People’s Republic of China. There is no more time to waste on meaningless negotiations with a CCP-puppet company. It is time to ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good.”

The bill was also sponsored by Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois.

TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement to The Hill that the legislation was politically motivated.

“It is troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States,” said Oberwetter.

She went on to say that the company has plans to ""further secure"" the platform in the United States.

The stock price for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, jumped by 4.74% partly based on the news of the possible ban.

Tim Scott will take on critical race theory and Biden's record in Reagan Library remarks,"South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott (R) will warn educators against ""teaching kids that they are oppressors"" when he takes the stage at the Reagan Library in California Tuesday night on April 19.

Scott is participating in the Reagan Foundation & Institute's ""Time for Choosing"" speaker series, which seeks to provide a platform for ""leading voices in the conservative movement to address critical questions facing the future of the Republican Party."" His speech will take a shot at critical race theory and the New York Time's controversial 1619 Project, as well as address rising inflation and criticize President Joe Biden's leadership, according to excerpts reported by Axios.

The southern lawmaker, who is the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, will say he's living proof that conservatism provides opportunity for Americans of color.

""It was education, hard work, and faith that allowed my family to go from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,"" Scott will say, according to his prepared remarks.

Scott will reportedly speak in favor of transparency in schools, saying that ""parents have a right to know what their kids are being taught in the classroom"" and that ""teaching kids that they are oppressors is just as bad as teaching kids they are always going to be victims.""

His remarks touch on issues that have been a priority for Republican lawmakers across the country. Backlash against critical race theory in 2021 led many GOP-controlled legislatures to advance bills prohibiting schools from teaching ""divisive concepts"" like the idea that one particular race is ""inherently superior or inferior"" to another or ""inherently responsible for actions committed in the past."" Such legislation was filed in response to reports that schools were adopting lesson plans that teach how ""all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism,"" or that American institutions were designed for the ""impoverishment of people of color and enrichment of white people,"" as a school in Buffalo, New York taught.

Republicans have also introduced curriculum transparency bills, which they claim are needed to keep parents informed of what their children are being taught. Opponents say such legislation could have a chilling effect on speech in schools and argue that parents should not have a role in school curricula.



Elsewhere in his speech, Scott will take shots at President Biden's record in office and the Democratic majorities in Congress, with the 2022 midterm elections in view.

""President Reagan once said, 'Inflation is as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man ... Democrats’ leadership has led to a 40-year high in inflation, and they’re still pouring more money on this crisis. That’s not good for moms making decisions in homes like the one I grew up in,"" Scott will say, according to Axios.

He will also claim that Biden's ""weakness on the global stage has emboldened terrorists, bullies, and dictators,"" most notably Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

""Bloodthirsty dictators like Putin only understand strength, and that’s what we must project from the United States,"" Scott's prepared remarks say.

Scott will also call for U.S. energy independence, ""a physical barrier on our southern border,"" and will criticize ""the 1619 Project.""

Joe Biden meets trans activist Dylan Mulvaney in White House,"Interviews with President Joe Biden are very rare and difficult to procure. According to a report from the White House Transition Project, Biden only gave 28 interviews in his first year in office – compared to 95 by Donald Trump, 162 by Barack Obama, and 50 by George W. Bush. In 2022, Biden went 220 days without an interview with an American TV journalist until he sat down with ""60 Minutes"" host Scott Pelley in mid-September. However, Biden has reportedly found the time to fit in interviews with six young people at the Oval Office.

NowThis – a progressive video-centric news site for young people – was allegedly granted access to Biden for interviews regarding Democrat-friendly topics such as gun legislation, student loan relief, abortion access, criminal justice reform, climate change, and trans rights.

NowThis said of the event, ""President Joe Biden sat down with six young people focused on finding solutions to some of the most critical issues facing their generation"" during the ""NowThis Presidential Forum.""

Transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney will be interviewing President Biden about trans rights. Mulvaney is a 25-year-old TikTok content creator who hosts a social media series titled ""Days of Girlhood"" about transitioning.

In a TikTok video posted on March 12, the transgender activist claimed to have become a ""girl."" In the video, Mulvaney mocked negative female stereotypes, such as crying throughout the day and buying unaffordable dresses.

The ""dylanmulvaney"" TikTok account has more than 8.3 million followers and over 267 million likes.



One of Mulvaney's viewers is apparently President Joe Biden – who turns 80 years old in less than a month.

Mulvaney announced on Thursday that Mulvaney had interviewed President Biden for NowThis. The trans activist noted that President Biden had watched the ""Days of Girlhood"" series about Mulvaney's transgender transition.

""It's day 222 of being a girl. I'm in Washington D.C., and I’m going to the White House to speak to the President of the United States,"" Mulvaney said on the video on Chinese social media platform TikTok.

""You know that phrase, ‘I think I may have girlbossed too close to the sun?’ Well that’s how I feel today,"" Mulvaney said while wearing a ""Don't mess with trans kids"" shirt and filming in a bathroom. ""Because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and NowThis News, and I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States and talk to him about my transness, and I really just want to represent my community the best that I can.”

""And you know what, as silly as I am on here, I am ready to step up and show that trans people, we’re not going anywhere, and that trans kids, they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves,"" Mulvaney continued.



To meet President Biden, the transgender activist wore an outfit featuring the colors of the trans flag, including white high heels and a pink scarf.

Video shows Mulvaney entering the White House, seeing a portrait of Michelle Obama, and saying, ""Our queen, love you, I love you.""

President Biden allegedly gave the trans activist a cookie in the Oval Office.

Mulvaney frantically gushed about petting Biden's dog.



Mulvaney said of the meeting, ""I left with a lot of hope and optimism, not only for just trans people, but many different topics.""

""And the fact that our president has watched 'Days of Girlhood' – it's kind of epic,"" the trans activist said of Biden watching the TikTok series about transitioning.

""And I'm not gonna lie I have been having a rough go of it lately. A lot of darkness,"" Mulvaney added. ""And today was what I needed to keep going.""

Mulvaney called on everyone to vote in the midterms because they will ""be one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.""

Mulvaney said, ""We're going to clean up some messes that have needed cleaning for hundreds of years.""

The NowThis interviews with Biden are said to be released on Sunday night.

Last week, Mulvaney was embroiled in a controversy involving cosmetics behemoth Ulta Beauty. Mulvaney appeared in a Ulta-sponsored video along with gender-fluid hairstylist David Lopez. The two biological men discussed girlhood and motherhood.



Mulvaney declared, ""I know I can find love, I know I can still be a performer, I know I can have a family. I want to be a mom one day — and I absolutely can!""

The controversial video sparked outrage, and many women vowed to boycott Ulta Beauty.

This isn't the first time Biden's White House has enlisted social media influencers to appeal to young voters.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced it would utilize social media influencers to ""combat scams and misinformation"" about the new federal student loan debt relief program.

In March, the White House welcomed popular TikTok content creators to deliver a briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In December 2021, Biden appeared in a TikTok video with the Jonas Brothers to promote COVID-19 vaccines.

Transgender man gives birth after sperm donation from transgender woman: 'It felt so right',"Reuben Sharpe began living as a man in 2007 and took male hormones, which gave him a beard, a deep voice, and masculine features, the Mirror reported.

But the Brit — now 39 — still had maternal instincts and stopped taking testosterone six years ago in the hope of one day having a child, the outlet noted.

Then Reuben met fellow wedding photographer Jay in a pub, and they became a couple, the Mirror said.

Jay, 28, has undergone a double breast removal but is nonbinary, doesn't identify as male or female, and uses the pronouns ""them"" and ""they"" rather than ""he"" or ""she,"" the outlet added.

Getting pregnant

Soon Reuben talked to Jay about getting pregnant.

Referring to Jay, Reuben told the Mirror, ""I realized I would have to talk to them. If they didn't want kids, we'd have to break up. I managed to bring up the subject, but luckily Jay was open to the idea.""

The couple then found a sperm donor on Facebook — a transgender woman who can still produce sperm, the outlet said.



""I thought they would be perfect,"" Reuben told the Mirror. ""Sperm donation is a big decision to make, but when we asked the donor, it felt so right. We sent a message on Facebook to ask.""

Soon a doctor — who also is transgender — inserted the donor's sperm into Reuben's womb, and tests confirmed a pregnancy, the outlet said.

Three months ago, baby Jamie was born, the Mirror reported.

“I finally feel complete,"" Reuben told the outlet. ""It wasn't that I was desperate to have the birthing experience or pregnancy experience, but I wanted a child, and I had the facility to do it.""



'Invasive questions'

But not all was tea and crumpets for the couple, particularly when they ventured into medical facilities for tests.

“I found it frustrating that people didn't just ask my gender or not use it. I look like a man, have a beard. It's bizarre you wouldn't just avoid saying 'she,'"" Reuben added to the Mirror. ""People asked very invasive questions about body parts and how I'd give birth. Giving birth isn't a trans thing. Women give birth in different ways, too.""

However, Reuben also acknowledged to the outlet that ""I actually liked my pregnant body and liked being bigger. It was very affirming, and I really enjoyed it — I'm a man and I get pregnant. There's a lot of changes to go through, but I felt free of that. Women struggle with their bodies when they go through pregnancy, too, so it isn't something a trans man would exclusively feel.""

The future

The couple — who plan on marrying next year — told the Mirror that raising Jamie among like-minded people in Brighton is a priority.

“It's about having the right kind of community around us so they are able to see different kinds of family set-ups,"" Jay added to the outlet. ""All we can do is try to be really open from the start with them and other people around us — give them the best chance.""

Reuben and Jay also refuse to be hemmed in by traditional mother and father roles, the Mirror said, adding that Jay is open to giving birth in the future.

“Like with many things, people have got it into their heads 'this is a female thing, this is a male thing.' Having a child is male, female, everyone,"" Reuben added to the outlet. ""Even when people go through that pregnancy experience with their partner, it's a joint thing. Wanting to have a baby doesn't feel like a female thing for me. I don't think pregnancy is the ultimate female experience, therefore it didn't challenge me as a man. It doesn't make a woman less of a woman if she's not keen on pregnancy, infertile, doesn't want a baby. This isn't a trans issue — it affects everyone.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-man-gives-birth-after-sperm-donation-from-transgender-woman-it-felt-so-right,2020-01-02
"Transgender woman who wants to leave Ukraine rips country's transphobia, says 'there's no way Ukrainian border people can let me through'","A transgender woman living in Ukraine wants to get out of the country amid the Russian invasion, but Zi Faámelu's passport says ""male"" — and the 31-year-old noted to CBS News that ""there's no way Ukrainian border people can let me through. There's no way.""

What are the details?

The Ukraine State Border Guard Service reportedly announced last week that men ages 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. But Faámelu may not be granted entry into a neighboring country anyway because of the mismatch between Faámelu's legal sex and lived gender, LBGTQNation said.

""This is not a very rainbow-friendly place. ... Lives for trans people are very bleak here,"" Faámelu noted to CBS News. ""If you have a male gender in your passport, they will not let you go abroad. They will not let you through.""

The LGBTQ community has become more accepted over the years, but the network said it's more complicated for transgender people.

LBGTQNation explained it's not easy for transgender Ukrainians to get updated passports, as Human Rights Watch said they're likely still required to undergo psychiatric observation and gender-affirming surgery to update their documents.

“I don’t want to go through that. This is like, humiliating for the world…. I decided to keep my passport, keep male in my passport, and now I cannot leave this country,” Faámelu noted to CBS News. “[It’s] a war within a war, truly.”

'I'm literally scared for my life'

The network said Faámelu — who lives in Kyiv, which has been barraged by Russian military forces — is running out of food and hasn't left home for days.

""A few hours ago I heard bombings and my windows were shaking. ... I'm literally scared for my life,"" Faámelu added to CBS News.

What's more, Faámelu told the network that transphobia is the norm in the city and in neighboring countries, and fears that if that trying to leave will increase the chances the transgender woman will be treated violently.

""Many people have guns and weapons. ... It can be an excuse for violence,"" Faámelu told CBS News, adding, ""This is a very scary situation.""

CBS News added that Faámelu also was a popular contestant on the Ukrainian singing competition show ""Star Factory.""

Anything else?

Adding to the difficulty are Faámelu's parents, who live in Crimea, the network said — and, according to Faámelu, don't believe Russia has invaded Kyiv: ""They are literally brainwashed. The world sees the picture, but they are simply blind in this case. My parents think it's all fake, that we bomb ourselves, that we try to create some drama.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-woman-who-wants-to-leave-ukraine-rips-countrys-transphobia-says-theres-no-way-ukrainian-border-people-can-let-me-through,2022-03-02
"Transgender female athletes shouldn't be required to reduce testosterone to compete, International Olympic Committee says","The International Olympic Committee said transgender females shouldn't be required to reduce testosterone to compete in sports, Sky News reported.

What are the details?

The IOC's updated guidelines are not legally binding, the outlet said, adding that the organization said it's not in a position to issue broad regulations defining eligibility for every sport and will instead leave such decisions in the hands of individual federations.

""What we are offering to all the international federations is our expertise and a dialogue, rather than jumping to a conclusion,"" IOC director of the athletes' department Keveh Mehrabi said, Sky News noted.

But where the IOC stands on transgender issues seems pretty clear.

The body's new guidelines say that no athlete should be excluded from competition due to perceived ""unfair and disproportionate advantage"" as a result of gender, Sky News reported.

Previously transgender female athletes were allowed to compete only if their testosterone levels were below a required limit 12 months before their first competition, the outlet said.

But no longer apparently.

""You don't need to use testosterone [to decide who can compete] at all,"" IOC medical director Richard Budgett said, according to Sky News.

The IOC also decried sex testing to verify an athlete's gender as ""disrespectful"" and ""potentially harmful"" and ""invasive,"" the outlet added.

""We really want to make sure that athletes are not pressured or coerced into making a harmful decision about their bodies,"" added Magali Martowicz, IOC head of human rights, according to Sky News.

Pushback

Not everyone was in complete agreement with the IOC.

Joanna Harper — visiting fellow for transgender athletic performance at England's Loughborough University — told ESPN that not presuming physical advantages when it comes to transgender females is ""problematic for me. There is no doubt that transgender women are on average taller, bigger, and stronger than cisgender women and that these are advantages in many sports.""

Laurel Hubbard

Indeed, the IOC's updated guidelines come just months after New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard — a biological male who identifies as female — became the first transgender athlete to compete in the Olympics.

Many critics have said Hubbard's presence is unfair to biologically female weightlifters.

In fact, it was reported in May that some biologically female weightlifters were told to ""be quiet"" after complaining about Hubbard competing against them.

""We're all about equality for women in sport, but right now that equality is being taken away from us,"" former Olympic weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs told Australia's 7 News in regard to Hubbard. ""I've had female weightlifters come up to me and say, 'What do we do? This isn't fair, what do we do?' Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do because every time we voice it, we get told to be quiet.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-women-athletes-shouldn-t-be-required-to-reduce-testosterone-to-compete-international-olympic-committee-says,2021-11-18
Trespasser lunges at homeowner investigating suspicious activity on his property. But homeowner is armed — and brings the pain.,"Jimmy Stubblefield told sheriff's deputies he noticed someone turning security cameras on his Tennessee property Saturday, so the homeowner went outside to investigate, the Covington Leader reported.

As Stubblefield rounded a corner, a man lunged at him, the paper said.

Here comes the boom



But the problem for the suspected trespasser is that his target was armed.

Sure enough, Stubblefield fired at the man, the Leader reported, adding that the homeowner told deputies he believed the perpetrator was hit by gunfire.

Fella doesn't get far



Deputies searched the area and found 32-year-old Thurman Morrow in the attic of a nearby home, the paper said.

However, Morrow was uncooperative and refused to surrender to deputies, the Leader noted. But it was all in a day's work for the sheriff's office K-9 which finally apprehended the reluctant suspect, the paper said.

Morrow was treated for his gunshot wound and later released from medical care, the Leader added.

'It basically just dropped off a cliff': Analysts fear major trucking downturn spells doom for US economy,"The U.S. trucking industry has suffered a dramatic downturn in recent months and financial analysts are worried the bad news is a presage of widespread economic trouble.

What are the details?

According to data compiled by Reuters, the demand for trucking every kind of product from food to furniture has been in a free fall since March. And one segment of the industry that deals with on-demand trucking, known as the ""spot market,"" has been hit especially hard.

""It basically just dropped off a cliff,"" said Craig Fuller, the CEO of transportation data company FreightWaves, in conversation with the news agency.

The demand-sensitive spot market is now in correction territory, Reuters reported. Average first-quarter spot rates, excluding fuel, plummeted 55 cents per mile from $2.78 in mid-January to $2.23 on April 14. A slight downtick is reportedly common for that time of year, but the industry normally only sees a 22 cent per mile decrease.

The rate deterioration took hold when diesel prices nearly doubled amid backlash over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has been pummeling trucker wages ever since.

Reuters cited one California-based trucker, 63-year-old Marco Padilla, to demonstrate just how bad things have gotten. Padilla told the outlet he used to spend about 25-30 cents per mile to run his truck. But he's nowhere near that range anymore.

""For every dollar (of pay), I was pocketing 70 cents,"" he said. ""Now it costs $1 a mile.""

What does it mean?

Those familiar with the trucking industry know spot market trouble is rarely an isolated incident.

One expert, Joseph Rajkovacz, who serves as director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association, described it as the ""proverbial 'canary in the mineshaft,'"" meaning it is an early indicator of coming danger.

Analysts fear the downward trend could soon ""decimate truckers' ability to dictate prices and push some small trucking firms into bankruptcy,"" the outlet stated. But not only that, it could foreshadow a wider recession across all sectors of the U.S. economy.

Trucking data company Convoy found that economic recessions followed six of the 12 trucking recessions since 1972. The reason is simple: When consumers buy less, companies ship less, causing trucking activity to slow.

Stated another way, decreased trucking activity typically means only one thing: Consumer retail activity is down. And since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic activity, any decline can be catastrophic for the overall economy.

That seems to be exactly what the economy is experiencing at the moment. American consumers, hurt by historically high inflation and global supply chain crises, have cut back on spending.

What else?

Trucking activity, however, is not the first recession indicator to come up this year. Last month, news that the U.S. Treasury note yield curve had inverted first caused many economists to worry.



An inverted yield curve has correctly predicted nearly every recession the U.S. has experienced in the last 60 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trucking-downturn-foreshadows-recession,2022-04-25
"Trump offers questionable retelling of Afghan war, Mattis firing during televised Cabinet briefing","President Donald Trump held a Cabinet meeting Wednesday during which he stated that he had fired former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a poor performance and claimed that the former Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan had led to the USSR's collapse.

No new timeline, but Trump justifies troop withdrawal from Syria

In December, Trump announced that he was pulling U.S. troops out of Syria because the U.S. had ""defeated ISIS."" After this announcement, Mattis and Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS, resigned in protest. Members of his own party criticized Trump for abandoning U.S. Kurdish allies who are caught between the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, against whom they had rebelled, and Turkish forces determined to wipe the Kurds off the face of the planet.

Other high ranking members of the Republican Party, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), called the move an ""Obama-like mistake,"" and argued that ISIS had not yet been defeated.

During his Cabinet meeting, Trump refused to give a specific timeline for the troop withdrawal but stressed that he did not think there was a point in having U.S. forces remain in Syria.

""We're talking about sand and death,"" he said, describing Syria. ""We're not talking about vast wealth. We're talking about sand and death.



""The Kurds, it's very interesting, Turkey doesn't like them, other people do,"" he said. ""I didn't like the fact that they're selling the small oil that they have to Iran, and we asked them not to sell it to Iran.

""The Kurds, our partners, are selling oil to Iran. We're not thrilled about that, OK? I'm not happy about it at all,"" he continued. ""But we want to protect the Kurds, nevertheless, we want to protect the Kurds.""

According to Trump, he 'essentially' fired Mattis

On Dec. 20, Mattis tenured his resignation as Defense Secretary. In his resignation letter, Mattis expressed his displeasure with Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria. At the time, the plan was for him to stay on as defense secretary until Feb. 28, or until a replacement could be found. However, by Dec. 23, Trump announced that Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan would be taking over starting Tuesday, Jan. 1.

During Wednesday's Cabinet briefing, Trump gave a different version of events. He argued that he had fired Mattis because he had been disappointed with the secretary's performance.

""I wish him well. I hope he does well. But as you know, President Obama fired him and essentially so did I,"" Trump said. ""What's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good. Not too good. I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan, and I shouldn't be happy.""

Trump continued to criticize the role of not just Mattis, but all U.S. generals in Afghanistan. Trump said he ""gave our generals all the money they wanted"" but that ""they didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan.""

Trump claimed that Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union

According to Trump, Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union.



Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan. Russia. So, you take a look at other countries. Pakistan is there. They should be fighting. But Russia should be fighting. The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there. The problem is, it was a tough fight. And literally they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot of these places you're reading about are no longer part of Russia, because of Afghanistan.

Trump: ""Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan. Russia.""

— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 2, 2019

But that version of events is questionable at best. In the 1970s, Afghanistan had a communist government closely allied with the Soviet Union. When local insurgents tried to overthrow that government in 1979, the Soviet Union sent 30,000 troops to crush the insurrection and tried to reinstate the communist government. The U.S. supplied weapons to the Afghan rebels in an attempt to combat Soviet expansionism.

The war did drag on and tens of thousands of more Soviet troops were deployed. By 1988, the USSR had signed a deal to withdraw from Afghanistan completely.

The Soviet Union collapsed a few years later in 1991, due to the rampant failure of its communist policies, and increased pressure from the United States, particularly under the Reagan administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-afghanistan-mattis-cabinet,2019-01-02
Senate voted to summon witnesses in Trump impeachment trial,"The Senate voted 55-45 on Saturday to summon witnesses in former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, where he is facing a charge of incitement of insurrection for the Capitol riots on Jan. 6. However, only hours later the Democrats decided against having witnesses after reaching a deal.

A last-minute agreement was made on Saturday to avoid calling witnesses to the trial. Republicans and Democrats agreed to enter into the record a statement about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's alleged phone call with Trump during the Capitol riots on Jan. 6.

The trial now could be over as early as Saturday night.

Earlier in the day, House lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, wanted to subpoena Rep. Herrera Beutler, a Washington Republican, who divulged a conversation between Trump and McCarthy that took place during the Capitol riots.

""When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was anti fascist that had breached the Capitol,"" Beutler said in a statement on Friday. ""McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said: 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'""

Of the alleged conversation, Raskin said, ""After the breach and invasion took place he was not working on the side of defending the Capitol. But rather, he was continuing to pursue his political goals, and the information that came out last night. This piece of evidence is relevant to that.""

""Needless to say, this is an additional, critical piece of corroborating evidence further confirming the charges before you, as well as the president's willful dereliction of duty,"" Raskin continued. ""For that reason, and because this is the proper time to do so under the [Senate impeachment rules], we would like the opportunity to subpoena congresswoman Herrera [Beutler] regarding her communications with [McCarthy] and to subpoena her contemporaneous notes.""

Trump defense attorney Michael van der Veen was outraged at the delay, proclaiming that the case should have been ""closed today."" He added that he would ask for at least 100 witnesses, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris, adding they will need to give depositions in person in his office in Philadelphia.

""If they want to have witnesses, I'm going to need at least over 100 depositions. Not just one,"" van der Veen said.

""We did not do this hearing by Zoom,"" he declared. ""These depositions should be done in person in my office in Philadelphia,"" van der Veen said. ""That's where they should be done.""

Five Republicans voted in favor of trial witnesses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who questioned the story about Trump's conversation.



""Isn't it a bit odd that these liberal news reports about impeachment, just like what happened during #BrettKavanaugh - which prove to be unreliable - always come out right before we are set to vote? I have found it wise to realize the source of these stories is the liberal media with an agenda,"" Graham tweeted on Saturday morning. ""If you want a delay, it will be a long one with many, many witnesses.""



Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would vote to acquit Trump. McConnell made the declaration in an email he wrote to fellow Senate Republicans, according to a Senate staffer who was read the email by a GOP senator, Politico reported.

""The Constitution makes it perfectly clear that Presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the President has left office, which in my view alleviates the otherwise troubling 'January exception' argument raised by the House,"" McConnell reportedly wrote in the email.

""While a close call, I am persuaded that impeachments are a tool primarily of removal and we therefore lack jurisdiction,"" McConnell purportedly wrote.

"After Trump's visit, Iraqi leaders demand US withdrawal from Iraq","Following President Donald Trump's surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, Iraqi leaders have expressed their desire for the remaining U.S. forces to leave their country permanently.

What's the background?

Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American forces initially left Iraq in 2011 under the Obama administration. However, they returned to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government to help with the fight against ISIS. Now, Iraqi lawmakers argue that ISIS has been beaten back enough that they can finish that fight on their own.

Trump announced last week that the U.S. troops would be completely leaving Syria and that the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan would be reduced. However, on Wednesday he said he had ""no plans at all"" for U.S. troops to pull out of Iraq.

While announcing the U.S. pullout of Syria on Dec. 19, Trump declared that ISIS in Syria had been defeated. Critics of the move have expressed concern that the pullout could leave U.S. Kurdish allies in Syria caught between the forces of Turkey, which views them as terrorists, and the forces of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, against whom they had rebelled. This decision also led to the resignations of both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and U.S. envoy to the coalition to fight ISIS Brett McGurk.

While Iraq's Parliament is divided between two blocs, lawmakers from both sides have called for a vote to demand that U.S. troops leave the country. More than 5,000 U.S. troops are currently in Iraq.

What else?

Iraqi lawmakers also criticized Trump for failing to meet with any Iraqi leaders while he was visiting that country.

When he landed in Iraq, Trump reportedly gave the Iraqi prime minister two hours' notice to meet with him. The Iraqi prime minister could not make this meeting with Trump that quickly so the two talked on the phone instead, according to CBS News. During his visit, Trump did not meet with any other Iraqi leaders.

"Trump fires back at Pelosi, calls her a 'very sick person' over 'meltdown' at White House meeting","President Donald Trump offered his own version of the events on Wednesday after Democratic leaders stormed out of a meeting about foreign policy and accused him of acting irrationally.

The president implied that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had mental issues, and referred to her as a ""very sick person,"" in a tweet issued from his official account.

""Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her 'upstairs,' or she just plain doesn't like our great Country,"" he tweeted.

"Trump repeatedly interrupts Jim Acosta during news conference, accuses him of having an agenda and being 'fake news'","President Donald Trump talked over CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta in a heated exchange during a news conference Friday at the White House. Acosta accused the president of fabricating a crisis on the border in order to declare a national emergency after he could not get a border wall approved by Congress.

What was the news conference about?



Trump called a news conference on Friday morning to announce that he planned to declare a national emergency in order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border without congressional funding.

What happened with Acosta?

After making his announcement, Trump took some questions from reporters.

When the president called on him, Acosta began: ""Thank you,. Mr. President. I wondered if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what's happening at the border, calling it an invasion, talking about women with duct tape over their mouths and so on. And yet, there's a lot of reporting out there, there's a lot of crime data out there, there's a lot of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near record low—

""That's because of us,"" Trump interrupted him. ""It's still, excuse me, it's still massive numbers.""

Acosta continued ""—that shows undocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels — that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels than native born Americans. What do you say—""

""You don't really believe that stat. Do you really believe that stat?"" Trump interjected. ""Take a look at our federal prisons.""

""I believe in facts and statistics and data but— "" Acosta said

""OK, real quick, let's go,"" Trump said, trying to make him hurry up.

""What do you say to your critics who say you are creating a national emergency, that you're concocting a national emergency here, in order to get your wall because you couldn't get it through other ways?"" Acosta asked.

""Let's ask the angel moms. Do you think I'm creating something?"" Trump said, referring to the mothers of people killed by illegal immigrants whom he had invited to the press briefing. ""Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons. OK? Because your question is a very political question, because you have an agenda. You're CNN. You're fake news. You have an agenda. The numbers that you gave are wrong. Take a look at our federal prison population. See how many of them, percentage wise, are illegal aliens. Just see. Go ahead and see. it's a fake question.""

Trump spars with CNN's Acosta: You have an agenda, you're fake news youtu.be

Do we know what percentage of federal inmates are illegal immigrants?

Figuring out the number of illegal immigrants in federal prisons is not as easy as it sounds. In the past year, the pro-border wall Federation for American Immigration Reform put out a study that claimed that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of crimes on average than American citizens.

A few months earlier, however, the Libertarian think tank CATO released a study claiming that immigrants are about half as likely to commit crimes.

These two studies are so different because there is no direct way to get at the number of how many illegal immigrants are incarcerated in the U.S., so researchers need to find creative ways to get at that information through other data sets.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-repeatedly-interrupts-jim-acosta,2019-02-15
"President Trump tweets actions he's taking against Turkey over invasion into Syria, and a warning","President Donald Trump tweeted Monday that his administration would be taking actions against members of the Turkish government after reports of atrocities committed in the invasion into Syria.

"" I will soon be issuing an Executive Order authorizing the imposition of sanctions against current and former officials of the Government of Turkey and any persons contributing to Turkey's destabilizing actions in northeast Syria,"" said the president in statement issued via his Twitter account.

The president said steel tariffs would be increased to 50 percent, and a $100 billion trade deal being negotiated with Turkey would immediately ended.

""Turkey's military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peach, security, and stability in the region. I have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,"" the statement continued.

The president has faced criticism on all sides for his decision to pull back troops from northern Syria ahead of an invasion by Turkish military forces. He has defended his actions by deriding the Kurds, who are facing a massacre and mass displacement.

"Federal judge rules against Donald Trump Jr., says defamation lawsuit over his tweet can proceed","A federal judge ruled against Donald Trump Jr. and said Wednesday that a defamation lawsuit over his tweets against him can continue.

The lawsuit stems from comments Trump Jr. made against Don Blankenship, a failed Constitution Party candidate for West Virginia's Senate seat in 2018.

Trump Jr. urged his followers on Twitter to vote against Blankenship, but he referred to the candidate as a ""felon"" on the social media platform.

Although Blankenship had been found guilty of a misdemeanor involving a 2010 coal-mining disaster, he had never been convicted of a felony, and thus could not be called a felon. He served a yearlong sentence over the conviction.

Blankenship filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against Trump Jr., and accused him of defamation, false light invasion of privacy, and civil conspiracy.

""The defamation of Mr. Blankenship as a 'felon' has so smeared his reputation that he has been prevented from pursuing other businesses and opportunities and generating similar returns of billions of dollars,"" read the lawsuit against Trump Jr.

In his motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Trump Jr. argued that his statement was conveyed as an opinion instead of a statement of fact, and also that the tweet had been sent to a random user on Twitter, not Blankenship.

The court refused his arguments and said the lawsuit could continue.

West Virginia Judge John Copenhaver, a Gerald Ford appointee, said in his decision that Trump Jr.'s tweet showed that he knew his accusation against Blankenship was a false one.

""Based on this article that Trump, Jr. himself cites within his own quote tweet,"" Copenhaver wrote, ""there is a plausible inference that he had knowledge of the plaintiff's conviction history in association with the mine explosion, and in particular that the conviction was a misdemeanor, not a felony.""

Trump Jr. also argued that his tweet had been an ""exaggeration"" offering ""colorful rhetoric,"" and that this kind of speech was protected by the First Amendment.

Copenhaver disagreed with that argument as well. The lawsuit can now proceed to trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trumpjr-blankenship-libel-tweet-lawsuit,2021-09-03
TSA spends $18.6 million on non-binary screening systems,"The Transportation Security Administration spent $18.6 million on ""non-binary screening systems"" to ""advance civil rights.""

The Biden administration awarded $18.6 million in funding to the TSA within the FY22 Omnibus Appropriations to implement non-binary screening systems. The millions of American taxpayer dollars will be used to modify Advanced Imaging Technology units in airport checkpoints to provide ""increased accuracy and efficiency.""

""By replacing the current, gender-based AIT system, this new, more accurate technology will also advance civil rights and improve the customer experience of travelers who previously have been required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in sensitive areas,"" the TSA stated.

Currently, TSA agents press a pink button for a female traveler and a blue button for a male airline passenger before a passenger enters the full-body scanner.

ProPublica reported in 2019, ""The body scanner is programmed to look for penises on passengers scanned as male and breasts on passengers scanned as female. If the officer selects the female button and the machine detects something in the passenger’s groin area it could interpret a body part as a potential threat, issuing an alarm.""

Jose Bonilla – the TSA's executive director for traveler engagement – told WCAX-TV, ""This technology should really be gender neutral, you know, it really should be, and we're there.""

Fox News reported, ""TSA data shows the agency receives 26,542 screening complaints annually, 6% of those complaints are from members of the LGBTQ community. That number tracks roughly with census data from Gallup, which notes that 7% of people identify as LGBTQ.""

The new non-binary screening systems are set to roll out in January.

On March 31, the Transportation Security Administration announced new standards for screening transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming airline passengers.

""TSA has updated its Transgender, Nonbinary, and Gender Nonconforming Passengers web page to provide information to the traveling public on all gender-related updates, including changes to AIT screening protocols, identity-verification practices, and the TSA PreCheck program, as well as links to relevant sites for more comprehensive customer support,"" read the TSA statement released on International Transgender Day of Visibility.

The TSA instructed Transportation Security Officers to reduce the number of pat-down screenings and to provide ""less invasive screening procedures for certain passengers who trigger the AIT scanner in a sensitive area.""

In February, the TSA updated its standard operating standards to ""remove gender considerations when validating a traveler’s identification at airport security checkpoints.""

""When travelers appear at the travel document checker podium for identity verification, gender information is irrelevant in determining that a traveler may proceed into the screening area,"" the TSA declared.



The TSA allows PreCheck travelers to select an ""X"" gender marker option on its application as an ""alternative gender category.""

TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in March, ""On this internationally recognized day for the transgender community, TSA is proud to announce significant initiatives as a direct result of close partnership with community stakeholders. Over the coming months, TSA will move swiftly to implement more secure and efficient screening processes that are gender neutral, as well as technological updates that will enhance security and make TSA PreCheck enrollment more inclusive. These combined efforts will greatly enhance airport security and screening procedures for all.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tsa-nonbinary-screening-systems-transgender,2022-12-15
"Report: Turkey’s Erdoğan muddled Oval Office meeting by playing a 'clunky' anti-Kurd 'propaganda' film for Trump, GOP senators","In an Oval Office meeting with President Trump and five GOP senators Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan pulled out an iPad and forced the group to watch a propaganda video that depicted Kurds as terrorists, according to an Axios report.

The report, published Thursday morning states, ""the meeting hosted by President Trump included five Republican U.S. senators who've been among the most vocal critics of Turkey's recent invasion of Syria and attacks on the U.S.'s Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS,"" but that Erdoğan ""apparently thought he could sway these senators by forcing them to watch a clunky propaganda film.""

The film was ultimately unpersuasive as the senators in the meeting — Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) — repeatedly pushed back against Erdogan.

The meeting comes amidst potential U.S. sanctions against Turkey for their purchase of an S-400 Russian air defense system.

Fireworks in the Oval Office

According to sources speaking to Axios, after the film ended, Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Erdoğan: ""Well, do you want me to go get the Kurds to make one about what you've done?""

Graham later confirmed to Axios that he and Erdogan clashed in the meeting, saying, ""The Turkish narrative that they have done more to destroy ISIS, I rejected forcefully, and I let Turkey know that 10,000 SDF fighters, mostly Kurds, suffered, died or injured, in the fight against ISIS, and America will not forget that and will not abandon them.""

In a statement after the meeting, Sen. Ted Cruz described Turkey as ""a deeply problematic ally, but an ally nonetheless"" and said that he ""made clear to President Erdoğan that so long as Turkey continues to procure or deploy the S-400 air defense system from Russia, the U.S. will not sell F-35 fighter jets to Turkey.""

According to Axios sources, Sen. Rick Scott pressed Erdoğan during the meeting on ""why Turkey should enjoy the protections of NATO when they're cozying up to Russia.""

All the senators in the room were in agreement over the insistence that Turkey cease their S-400 dealings with Russia.

A bit of background

Last month, shortly after President Trump made the decision to pull ground troops out of Syria despite bipartisan opposition out of the House, Turkish forces invaded territory in northern Syria previously held by U.S.-allied Kurdish forces.

President Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey in retaliation for the offensive, which he warned Erdoğan against initiating.

Later, after Turkey agreed to permanently halt their invasion, Trump ceased all sanctions on the country.

Now, ahead of the Oval Office meeting with Erdoğan Wednesday, President Trump is again considering enforcing sanctions on Turkey unless they get rid of the S-400 air defense systems they purchased from Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/turkeys-erdogan-oval-office-propoganda,2019-11-14
Turkish NBA player Enes Kanter blasts Ilhan Omar for not voting to recognize Armenian genocide,"The House of Representatives voted to affirm its existing record of recognizing and condemning the 1915 Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Empire. The resolution passed overwhelmingly, but Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was one of only two Democrats not to vote ""yea.""

Enes Kanter, an NBA player for the Boston Celtics who is a citizen of Turkey, called Omar out on Twitter for her refusal to acknowledge the genocide that resulted in 1.5 million deaths.

""What an absolute disappointment and shame that the only democrat who did NOT support the Turkish bill aiming to stop the killing of innocent people is @IlhanMN who seems like on #DictatorErdogan's payroll working for his interests, but not for the American people and democracy!"" Kanter wrote.

Kanter's tweet is partially incorrect, as Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas voted ""present"" alongside Omar and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). ""Present"" means not taking a side on the issue.



Omar said her refusal to vote in support of the resolution was due to a desire to have more human rights injustices condemned, such as the trans-Atlantic slave trade and Native American genocide. She also objected to the timing of the resolution, which is an apparent shot at Turkey for the nation's aggression against Kurdish forces in Syria.

""I believe in accountability for human rights violations — especially ethnic cleansing and genocide — is paramount,"" Omar said in a statement about her vote. ""But accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as cudgel in a political fight. It should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics.""

Omar has also opposed sanctions against Turkey, calling them part of a ""failed foreign policy playbook.""

Kanter, who is wanted by the Turkish government for his opposition, is an outspoken opponent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Because he has a Turkish passport, he cannot travel outside the United States for fear that his passport will be revoked and he will be detained by international authorities.

Turkey has, for decades, opposed U.S. resolutions that would recognize and condemn the genocide, having paid millions to lobbyists on the issue. As a result, a vote on such a resolution has not been held since 1984.

The resolution affirms that ""the United States has a proud history of recognizing and condemning the Armenian Genocide"" and notes numerous other ways in which the U.S. has recognized the genocide, and cites Adolf Hitler's infamous reference to the Armenian genocide before the German invasion of Poland.

""Whereas, as displayed in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military commanders to attack Poland without provocation in 1939, dismissed objections by saying '[w]ho, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?', setting the stage for the Holocaust.""

Eleven Republicans voted ""no"" on the resolution.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/turkish-nba-player-enes-kanter-blasts-ilhan-omar-for-not-voting-to-recognize-armenian-genocide,2019-10-30
Twisted Sister's Dee Snider supports Ukraine using 'We're Not Gonna Take It' as battle cry against Russian invasion,"Dee Snider — the outlandish and outspoken frontman for '80s metal band Twisted Sister — tweeted over the weekend that he's all in favor of Ukraine adopting the band's famous anthem ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" as its battle cry amid Russia's invasion.

""I absolutely approve of Ukrainians using 'We're Not Gonna Take It' as their battlecry,"" Snider tweeted Saturday. ""My grandfather was Ukrainian, before it was swallowed up by the USSR after WW2. This can't happen to these people again!""

Snider added a ""F***RUSSIA"" hashtag to the end of his missive.

However, when it comes to folks in the anti-mask movement wanting to use ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" as their own rallying cry, Snider has no love for their cause. Indeed, on Sunday he added the following explanation to his Twitter page:

He explained that ""one use is for a righteous battle against oppression; the other is [an] infantile feet stomping against an inconvenience.""

It's not like Snider can prevent ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" from blasting through loudspeakers at any given event, so his disagreement has no actual teeth. Rolling Stone said that earlier this month, the song was used at an anti-vaccination protest in New Zealand, and Snider responded by saying “while I may not agree with some of the things it’s used to fight, I can’t pick & choose the ones I want.”

The magazine added that when a similar protest was held in New York, Snider said he's ""aware many people representing many causes use ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ as their battle cry. Some I agree with & some I don’t (anti-vaxxers for example) BUT the song was designed for the listener to 'fill in the blank' (what from whom?) with their own cause.”

Anything else?

According to the New York Post, Snider has been openly anti-Russia since the days of the Cold War and commented on a photo of him wearing a “Russia Sucks” button onstage back in the late 1970s.

“My Ukrainian grandpa would have been so proud!” Snider tweeted Sunday.

Image source: Twitter, redacted

But when a Twitter user posited that Russian citizens didn't have a choice in the war that President Vladimir Putin started, Snider fired back:

Then when a user told Snider she's a young Russian woman protesting against the war and getting arrested for it, Snider agreed to stop using the ""F***RUSSIA"" hashtag in favor of a ""F***PUTIN"" one.

“And change will come from the young and young at heart,"" he added to the twee. ""It’s never easy.""

Twitter is now labeling and lessening the visibility of tweets hyperlinked to Russian state-owned media,"Micro-blogging platform Twitter will label and lessen the visibility of tweets hyperlinked to Russian state-owned media in an attempt to tamp down propaganda from the country.

CNN tech reporter Brian Fung posted an example of the label that would be added to tweets that are hyperlinked to certain sites like Russia Today and Sputnik.

Twitter users are able to bring articles to the attention of their followers, but the social media site can tweak its algorithm to lessen the spread of those tweets when it deems it necessary.

The company said that the ""overwhelming majority"" of tweets containing the state-sponsored content was shared by individuals and not by the accounts run by those outlets. About 45,000 tweets were sent per day by these individual accounts, according to the company.

Facebook and Google recently blocked Russian state-owned media from appearing in Ukraine at the behest of that country's government. The two platforms also barred the state-owned organizations from monetization and profiting from advertisements anywhere in the world.

Russia called these efforts censorship and threatened to throttle Facebook in their country while Twitter has already reported disruptions in its access.

Many of the heroic Ukrainian efforts to resist the Russian invaders have gone viral on social media and inspired admiration from onlookers around the world. On the other side of the coin, Russia has been caught trying to use social media in order to spread misinformation about its invasion of Ukraine.

Tech expert Ritesh Kotak told CTV News that Russia had passed laws in order make social media companies more vulnerable to state censorship.

""The thing about disinformation is it's so easy to put up and propagate now because of the internet and just how connected we are,"" said Kotak.

"Two armed men show up at home; one opens fire, hits homeowner. But shooting victim also has a gun — and his aim is deadly.","A pair of armed men decided to pay a visit to a residence in Moss Point, Mississippi, to pull off a home invasion Sunday evening, Police Chief Brandon Ashley told WXXV-TV.

But it didn't go so well for at least one of the suspects.

What are the details?

Police said in a press release that the two armed men went up to the front door of their ""target"" residence, encountered the homeowner, and one of suspects opened fire ""multiple times"" and struck the homeowner at least once.

But the homeowner came to the door prepared.

Police said he returned fire and struck one of the intruders — who collapsed in the roadway and died.

Police said they received a call around 6:30 p.m. reporting ""shots fired"" in the Mill Avenue area of East Moss Point — and upon arrival found the dead suspect in the street.

Police have not yet identified the two suspects, WLOX-TV reported, adding that it's not clear if the other home invasion suspect was arrested.

Jackson County Coroner Bruce Lynd Jr. said the suspect's body was sent to the state crime lab in Jackson for an autopsy, the Sun Herald reported. Lynd added to the paper that officials are running the dead suspect's fingerprints to try to confirm his identity since the he didn't have any identification on him.

What happened to the homeowner?

Police said the homeowner was treated and released from a hospital for his gunshot wounds and is not facing any charges, the Sun Herald noted.

But the paper added that a Jackson County grand jury will hear evidence in the case to determine if any criminal wrongdoing occurred — or if the homeowner acted in self-defense.

How did folks react?

The man also can be heard on a 911 call — distraught and breathing heavily — saying one of the intruders ""held my mom at gunpoint."" He added to the dispatcher that ""me and my mom are fine, thank God"" and that ""the person that had the vehicle is dead in my bed.""

Smalls was pronounced dead at the scene; Lynn ran outside, collapsed near the street, and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, WESH reported, citing deputies.

A neighbor told the station that the shooter's mother was talking to the two intruders outside before the incident, and officials believe the mother might have known one of the men.

The Orlando Sentinel said the sheriff's office declined to release the name of the shooter and cited Marsy's Law, a Florida constitutional amendment passed in November that protects the privacy of crime victims.

""Right now it appears it is a case of them defending themselves in the home,"" sheriff's spokesperson Tod Goodyear told WESH.

A crying woman, possibly a relative, was seen on camera being restrained by a deputy while trying to get through the police lines after the shooting, the station added.

Deputies told WESH that the shooter is cooperating amid the investigation.

Two gun-toting Detroit homeowners open fire on intruders in separate incidents. One of the suspects is armed — and ends up dead.,"Once again we have another example of criminals not getting the picture that everyday folks in growing numbers are armed and ready for them.

And this time the tale concerns a pair of Detroit homeowners with concealed pistol licenses who successfully used their guns to protect themselves after intruders invaded their residences.

What are the details?

The first incident happened around 7 p.m Monday when police said a suspect armed with a long gun entered a home on Fenton, just west of Telegraph between McNichols and 7 Mile, WJBK-TV reported.

The suspect then confronted the homeowner, pointing his gun at him, police told the station.

But the homeowner was able to arm himself, too, and shot the 22-year-old intruder several times with a handgun, WJBK said, adding that the suspect died at the scene.

Officers recovered both guns, the station said, adding that the CPL-holding homeowner was detained for questioning.

The circumstances are still being investigated, WJBK reported.

The second incident took place Wednesday night at a home in the 16600 block of Fairmount Drive when police said the 39-year-old homeowner heard a strange noise above her, WDIV-TV reported.

When she went to investigate the noise, police told the station she discovered a 19-year-old male in her attic — and officials believe the suspect was hiding there as part of an attempt to burglarize the home.

After a brief standoff, the intruder reportedly made a sudden move -- and that's when the CPL-holding homeowner fired a shot at the suspect, WDIV reported.

Police arrived at the scene, and the suspect was taken to a hospital, the station said. He was in stable condition, WDIV reported — but police said once he's well enough he'll be taken into custody.

"Two men enter home, pull gun on homeowner. But he pries away weapon, fires, and hits both suspects — killing one of them.","Two men entered a home in Elk City, Oklahoma, sometime before 6 a.m. Saturday and went into a bedroom when one of the men pulled out a gun, pointed it at the homeowner's face, and demanded money, according to a document police provided to TheBlaze.

What happened next?

The homeowner told police he was afraid he would be killed, so he grabbed the handgun and pointed it away from his face. A struggle for the gun ensued, after which the homeowner told police the two men pinned him on the bed, the document states.

The homeowner told police that after he gained control of the gun, he fired it several times until the man who pointed it at him fell to the floor. The document also states that, according to the homeowner, the other man who was with the gun-wielding assailant ran out of the house.

That man — Isaiah Johnson, 25 — was shot in the chest during the struggle, the document from police states.

But he had quite a story for cops at the hospital later, telling them he heard shots while walking near the house on the 600 block of North Watkins, realized he was hit, and went to the hospital for treatment, the document states.

Soon, however, Johnson came clean.

Upon further questioning, he confessed that he knew the other suspect — Samuel Castro Jr., 39 — had a handgun before they entered the house and was intending to rob the victim, the document states. Johnson added to police after he heard the gunshots and felt pain in his chest, he fled the home and walked to the hospital. He also said he originally told cops he was hit while walking near the residence so that he might avoid being arrested, the document states.

Johnson was still in jail Tuesday afternoon, police told TheBlaze.

Police found Castro's body surrounded by a large pool of blood in the bedroom where the struggle with the homeowner took place, the document says, adding that officers also observed a Walther .380 handgun on a small table in the bedroom.



A medical examiner investigator found several gunshot wounds on Samuel's body, the document adds.

Police on Tuesday would release no other information to TheBlaze.

But homeowner has a gun — and fatally shoots one intruder in head.,"A homeowner in Jefferson County, Missouri, told sheriff's deputies two men came to his residence in the 400 block of Sequoia Drive after midnight Thursday and knocked on the door, KSDK-TV reported.

The homeowner told deputies he asked who was there, and an unfamiliar voice replied, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Even scarier was the sound of the doorknob being shaken — as if those outside were trying to enter the residence, the paper added.

What happened next?

With that the homeowner grabbed his revolver, the station said.

Then the homeowner opened the door and saw two men standing on the porch with masks on, the Post-Dispatch said, citing court documents.

One of the men reached inside the home and sprayed mace, the paper said. The homeowner said he was hit with the mace, KSDK reported — after which he fired multiple gunshots at the men in self-defense and then ran into a room to call 911.

The station said the homeowner figured the men ran off.

Well, one did — temporarily — and the other one apparently didn't make it off the porch.

When deputies arrived at the residence around 1:40 a.m., they found a man with a gunshot wound to the head lying on the doorstep, KSDK reported, adding that the sheriff's office said he died at the scene. The man was identified as 36-year-old Wayne Roam of House Springs and determined to be one of the suspects involved in the incident, the station added.

Second suspect located

Just minutes after their arrival, deputies told KSDK they saw an SUV drive slowly past the home. The Post-Dispatch, citing court documents, said deputies stopped the vehicle and questioned the driver and a front-seat passenger.

More from the paper:

The two men had ""conflicting stories"" about why they were in the area and deputies noticed the passenger's shirt had red stains on it, believed to be blood, charging documents said.



The passenger was later identified as 29-year-old Sean Ramsey, of Festus. He and the driver were arrested on outstanding warrants at the scene.



Ramsey is now facing charges with second-degree murder because a death occurred during a crime, charges said. He was also charged with first-degree burglary and third-degree assault.



The homeowner was not arrested.

More than two dozen people were wounded in the shooting. One victim is in critical condition at Del Sol Medical Center, and five others are in stable condition.

One of the victims died late Sunday night, and the other died Monday morning. They have not yet been identified, although the director of trauma at Del Sol, Dr. Stephen Flaherty, said one of the victims was an elderly woman.

According to Flaherty, she suffered from ""major and devastating"" gunshot wounds.

UK court stops forced abortion order imposed upon disabled woman,"A British high court has overturned a ruling forcing an abortion on the child of a disabled woman in the United Kingdom, reports indicated on Monday.

According to a report at Catholic News Service, the English Court of Appeal —which includes Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Peter Jackson — overturned a ruling reached Friday by Justice Nathalie Lieven just days before.

The three-judge panel says that it will release the reasons for its ruling at a later date, according to the CNA report, but admitted that the circumstances of the case were unique.

Lieven permitted the involuntary abortion to go forward in a decision on Friday, despite the fact that the unborn child's grandmother made it clear that she would assume care for the child. Lieven also acknowledged the highly invasive nature of her ruling, but still decided the need for a coerced abortion outweighed that, despite the will of the mother, the grandmother, and a social worker.

""I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" Lieven ruled. ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""

Levien said that the abortion was in the developmentally disabled woman's ""best interests"" because she said that having the child would be more traumatic than killing it in utero and that she didn't understand the gravity of childbearing.

""I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,"" Lieven decided.

In a statement released after the decision, the pro-life Right to Life U.K. celebrated the decision, but said that its fight in matters like this was far from over.

""This is a very welcome decision that will save the life of the unborn child and the mother from a forced late-term abortion and much undue distress,"" said Right to Life U.K.'s Clare McCarthy. ""However, the horrific original ruling should never have happened.

""Unfortunately, we fear that this is not a one-off case,"" McCarthy's statement continues. ""We are calling on the Department of Health to urgently reveal how many women have been forced to have an abortion in the UK over the last 10 years and make it clear how they will ensure it will not happen again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-court-stops-forced-abortion-order-against-disabled-woman,2019-06-24
"State Department orders family members of US diplomats to evacuate Ukraine. Biden reportedly considers deploying thousands of troops, warships, and aircraft into Eastern Europe to deter Russia.","The situation in Ukraine is quickly developing. The latest updates regarding the potential hot spot for hostilities, include the U.S. State Department ordering family members of U.S. diplomats to evacuate the country, and a report that President Joe Biden is considering deploying thousands of American troops, warships, and aircraft into the powderkeg region to deter Russia from executing any advancements.

A senior State Department official told reporters Sunday night, ""Military action by Russia could come at any time. The United States government will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens in such a contingency.""

Also on Sunday, the U.S. Department of State issued an update on its official website.

""Do not travel to Ukraine due to the increased threats of Russian military action and COVID-19,"" the alert warned. ""Exercise increased caution in Ukraine due to crime and civil unrest. Some areas have increased risk.""

""On January 23, 2022, the Department of State authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. direct hire employees (USDH) and ordered the departure of eligible family members (EFM) from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action,"" the notice cautioned. ""U.S. citizens in Ukraine should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options.""

The State Department's warning emphasized, ""There are reports Russia is planning significant military action against Ukraine. The security conditions, particularly along Ukraine’s borders, in Russia-occupied Crimea, and in Russia-controlled eastern Ukraine, are unpredictable and can deteriorate with little notice. Demonstrations, which have turned violent at times, regularly occur throughout Ukraine, including in Kyiv.""

Another report that surfaced on Sunday night added more concern for the region, especially for U.S. military members. The New York Times reported that President Biden is ""considering deploying several thousand U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft, to NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, an expansion of American military involvement amid mounting fears of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, according to administration officials.""

The potential escalation of U.S. forces in the region was reportedly discussed by senior Pentagon officials and Biden at presidential retreat Camp David on Saturday.

""Senior Pentagon officials presented Mr. Biden with several options that would shift American military assets much closer to Mr. Putin’s doorstep, the administration officials said,"" the NYT reported. ""The options include sending 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the potential to increase that number tenfold if things deteriorate.""



According to the report, Biden is expected to make a decision ""as early as this week"" on whether he will send military troops and hardware to the region as a deterent.

This is a far different message than Biden's press conference last week, where he was much more leniant with Vladimir Putin, ""I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does, it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.""

A day after his press conference, President Biden attempted to walk back his comments about Ukraine.

""Let me start by first saying a few words about Russia and Ukraine,” Biden said on Thursday. “I’ve been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.""

“It will be met with [a] severe and coordinated economic response that I’ve discussed in detail with our allies as well as laid out very clearly for President Putin,” Biden continued. “But there is no doubt — let there be no doubt at all — that if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-biden-russia-military,2022-01-24
Congress poised to approve billions more in aid for Ukraine,"As Americans struggle under the heavy financial burden caused by soaring inflation, Congress could soon approve around $12 billion in additional aid pertaining to embattled nation of Ukraine.

The Associated Press, citing an unidentified individual familiar with the measure, reported that more than $12 billion in aid pertaining to Ukraine will be inserted into the stopgap spending legislation that would fund the U.S. government into the month of December.

The Biden administration's request for the spending measure included $11.7 billion for security and economic assistance related to Ukraine, according to the AP. The outlet reported that in order to avert a partial government shutdown both houses of Congress would need to approve legislation by the the end of Friday, which marks the conclusion of the fiscal year.

Reuters, citing unidentified sources, reported that congressional negotiators had agreed to insert almost $12 billion of fresh military and economic aid for the nation of Ukraine into the measure. The outlet said that Biden had requested that the legislature supply $11.7 billion in new aid for Ukraine in the bill.

Ukraine has been seeking to defend itself against a brutal Russian invasion.

But Americans have been facing the devastating financial consequences caused by sky-high inflation. According consumer price index data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller figure than the 8.5- percent increase for the period ending July.""

Last month, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel massive amounts of federal student loan debt, a move that some have warned will worsen America's inflation problem. The plan calls for cancelling $10,000 of student debt for individuals earning less than $125,000 per year, or less than $250,000 for married couples — people earning below those income thresholds who received Pell Grants would be eligible for $20,000 of loan cancellation.

""Sad to see what’s being done to bribe the voters. Biden's student loan forgiveness plan may win Democrats some votes, but it fuels inflation, foots taxpayers with other people’s financial obligations, is unfair to those who paid their own way & creates irresponsible expectations,"" GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted last month.

"Ukraine, calls for Twitter to ban Russian account","Ukraine's official Twitter account has called for the social media company to put the kibosh on Russia's @Russia account.

Ukraine tweeted, ""hey people, let’s demand @Twitter to remove @Russia from here."" The Ukrainian account declared that there is ""no place for an aggressor like Russia on Western social media platforms"" and ""they should not be allowed to use these platforms to promote their image while brutally killing the Ukrainian people.""



Blaze Media's Elijah Schaffer responded to the post by tweeting, ""Banning a social media account will stop a war LOL.""

""I don't know who needs to hear this, but: banning an account on social media will not prevent a full-scale invasion that is already underway,"" Elizabeth Faddis of the Washington Examiner tweeted.

A tweet posted earlier by Ukraine's account urged people to ""Tag @Russia and tell them what you think about them.""

Last year, Twitter made the highly controversial decision to permanently suspend Donald Trump's @realDonaldTrump account. Trump, who was still presdient at the time, had been a prolific tweeter who frequently utilized the platform to disseminate his views.

The country's call for Twitter to ban Russia's account comes as Russia invades Ukraine. The U.S. and other nations have condemned Russia and levied sanctions.

According to the Associated Press, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of ""consequences you have never seen"" for any nation that seeks to interfere.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-calls-for-twitter-to-ban-russian-account,2022-02-25
"Ukraine fights back: Air defenses reportedly 'wreaking havoc' on Russian aircraft; civilians take up arms; former president stands ready to fight, vows country will hold off Russian troops 'forever'","Despite being outmatched in nearly every facet of warfare, the Ukrainian people are reportedly standing strong in defense of their country, seeking to hold off Russian troops who initiated an unprovoked invasion on Thursday.

What are the details?

Though it is difficult to get an accurate picture of how exactly the fight is going in Ukraine, images and videos shared on social media over the last several hours offered signs of Ukranian determination to defend their homeland.

Forbes reporter David Axe tweeted that Ukrainian air defenses and fighters were ""wreaking havoc"" on Thursday, downing Russian planes and helicopters conducting aerial assaults on Ukraine's military installations and population centers.

One Ukrainian fighter pilot dubbed the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" has emerged as an unconfirmed hero after having allegedly single-handedly downed six Russian fighter jets.

TheBlaze previously reported that Ukraine claimed to have inflicted significant losses on the Russian military on the first day of fighting — including up to 80 tanks, as many as 516 armored combat vehicles, 10 aircraft, 7 helicopters, and 2,800 special staff.

Reportedly hell-bent on attacking Kyiv and overthrowing the Ukrainian government, Russian forces persisted through whatever resistance was offered. On Friday, they advanced into a northern district of the capital city, where residents were under direction to ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend the city.

Within Ukrainian cities, residents have vowed to take up arms against the encroaching enemy. Video posted to Twitter by security analyst Michael A. Horowitz Friday allegedly showed weapons being distributed en masse to Ukrainian civilians who had volunteered to fight.

Among the brave residents standing in the streets prepared to fight was former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The former leader reportedly took up a Kalashnikov rifle alongside civilian defense forces on Friday.

When asked by CNN's John Berman, ""How long do you think you can hold out?” Poroshenko defiantly answered, ""Forever.""

""Putin will never [overtake] Ukraine no matter how many soldiers he has, how many missiles he has, how many nuclear weapons he has — we, Ukrainians, are free people,"" he added.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother are also determined to defend their city and nation.

""It’s already a bloody war,"" Klitschko told ITV Thursday, according to the New York Post. ""I don’t have another choice. I have to do that. I would fight.""

What else?

Current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also remained in the capital despite facing serious danger. The leader reportedly claimed that he and his family are top targets in the offensive and that Russian kill squads are actively seeking to assassinate him.



""I'm staying with my people,"" he proclaimed.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday that Russia has ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance"" in Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's designs for the European continent won't stop there.

Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine earlier this week after Putin first announced the launch of a ""special military operation"" in his country.

Under that declaration, Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Rather, they are being encouraged to join the fight. Amazingly, those older than 60 are also reportedly getting in on the action.

Anything else?

A commander in Kyiv told CBS News that thousands of people had arrived to fight, many whom have little or no military experience. According to him, the greatest challenge has been finding guns for all the volunteers.

""This is my country. I have my family here, and I have a duty to protect my family and to protect my country. And this is the duty of each and every Ukrainian,"" one resident, a mapmaker by trade who had arrived in Kyiv to help defend it, said.

He added, ""We will fight as much as we can. We will fight because we have our families ... our country and our lifestyle that we are not ready to give up.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-fights-back-wreaking-havoc,2022-02-25
Ukraine fires back at Biden: ‘Americans are safer in Kyiv’ than in ‘crime-ridden’ US cities,"Ukrainian officials responded harshly to the Biden administration on Monday over its decision to urge the families of American diplomats to leave the country ahead of an anticipated invasion from Russia.

What are the details?

According to BuzzFeed News, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky countered the administration's claims of a coming Russian attack, saying Zelensky ""does not think there’s any remotely imminent threat to Kyiv.""

""The fact that the US was the first one to announce this is extremely disappointing and quite frankly these Americans are safer in Kyiv than they are in Los Angeles ... or any other crime-ridden city in the US,"" the source added.

The statement came as Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine in recent weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to deny that he is preparing for an attack. President Joe Biden, however, has said he thinks an invasion of some sort is more likely than not.

In anticipation of an imminent attack, Biden's State Department on Sunday ordered the evacuation of family members of diplomats and authorized the departure of some U.S. government employees, adding that ""military action by Russia could come at any time.""

The State Department also elevated its travel advisory to ""Level 4 — Do Not Travel"" due to the military threat and warned that it ""will not be in a position to evacuate U.S. citizens"" from Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion.

The stark warnings were characterized by Ukrainian officials as ""utterly ridiculous"" and symbolic of what it views as ""US inconsistency,"" BuzzFeed reported.

""On the one hand, [Washington tells Ukraine] how we should democratize. We stand with you. It's your right to determine to join the West. We will stand with you against Russian aggression,"" the source reportedly said, rehashing past messages from the U.S. ""Then Russia turns up the temperature and they’re the first to leave.""

On Monday, Biden also ordered the Pentagon to put 8,500 troops on heightened alert for potential deployment to Europe in response to Russia's fear mongering.

What else?

This was the second time in under a week that Ukrainian officials have criticized Biden over his messaging on the Ukraine-Russia situation.

In a press conference last week, Biden appeared to downplay the consequences of a ""minor incursion"" by Russia, sewing doubt as to whether the U.S. or NATO allies would respond with force should Russian invade its neighboring country.

Biden would go on to strangely predict that Putin ""will move in"" to Ukraine because ""he has to do something.""

Ukrainian officials were reportedly ""stunned"" by the president's comments, adding, ""It gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure.""

In a tweet, Zelensky said, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-fires-back-at-biden-kyiv-us-cities,2022-01-24
Ukraine hit with another massive cyber attack; one GOP senator warns Russian missile strikes could follow,"The Ukrainian government said it was hit with another critical cyber attack on Wednesday, this one taking down several government websites and banks in the Eastern European country.

What are the details?

The attack, called a mass distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, reportedly began around 4 p.m. local time, according to a post by Mykhailo Fedorov, head of Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, CNBC reported.

In a post on his Telegram, Fedorov reported that websites for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, and Verkhovna Rada, the country’s parliament, were among those affected by the attack.

The government websites were offline as of Wednesday morning as officials attempted to switch traffic to another provider in order to minimize damage.

CNBC noted that a DDoS attack is when a hacker floods a target's network or server with traffic so that others can't access it.

What's the background?

The sweeping cyber attack is the second in the course of a week. Though the source of the attack has not yet been confirmed, it comes as Russia becomes increasingly hostile toward its neighboring country, threatening a full-scale military invasion.

On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent ""peacekeeping"" troops to Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-speaking regions in southeastern Ukraine, promoting global backlash. President Biden considered the brazen move the start of an invasion and responded by ordering sanctions against the country.

The United States attributed last week's attack — which affected Ukraine's Defense Ministry, army, and state banks — to Russian agents, though Russia denied any involvement.

What else?

Over the weekend, reports surfaced indicating that the U.S. had obtained intelligence that Russia planned to invade Ukraine in the coming days.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said in a tweet Wednesday that massive cyber attacks on the Ukrainian government and the disruption of communications were part of Russia's plan.

He also warned that the cyber attacks would be ""followed by targeted missile strikes against air defense sites [and] ammunition/weapons depots.""

World Health Organization tells Ukraine to destroy dangerous pathogens to prevent 'potential spills' of disease from labs,"The World Health Organization advised Ukrainian officials to destroy dangerous pathogens stored in laboratories across the war-torn country to prevent a potential outbreak of disease, Reuters reported. Due to the Russian invasion, the WHO recommended public health labs protect against ""any potential spills"" in Ukraine that could lead to disease spreading to the general population.

""Biosecurity experts say Russia's movement of troops into Ukraine and bombardment of its cities have raised the risk of an escape of disease-causing pathogens, should any of those facilities be damaged,"" Reuters reported on Thursday.

The report noted that Ukraine has ""public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans including, most recently, COVID-19."" Reuters added that the Ukrainian labs have ""received support from the United States, the European Union, and the WHO.""

The WHO informed the outlet that it had collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to promote security practices that help prevent ""accidental or deliberate release of pathogens.""



""As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the Ministry of Health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,"" the WHO told Reuters in an email.

The WHO did not reveal when it made the recommendation to Ukrainian officials. The health agency also did not provide specifics as to what kinds of pathogens are housed in Ukraine's labs. The WHO also did not divulge whether or not Ukrainian health officials were heeding the advice to destroy the dangerous pathogens.

Reuters did not receive a response from Ukrainian officials regarding requests for comment on the WHO guidance.

On Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova reiterated a long-standing allegation that the United States operates biowarfare laboratories in Ukraine. Washington and Kyiv have both denied the accusations.

""We can already conclude that in Ukrainian biological laboratories in direct proximity to the territory of our country, development of components of biological weapons was being carried out,"" Zakharova claimed.

Reuters reported, ""Zakharova said Russia had documents showing that the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax, and other pathogens after Feb. 24.""

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby dismissed the accusations on Wednesday.



""The Russian accusations are absurd, they are laughable and you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" Kirby said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki described the accusations as ""conspiracy theories.""

""This is preposterous. It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" Psaki tweeted on Wednesday.

""The United States is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere,"" she continued.

""This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine,"" Psaki said. ""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.""

A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson proclaimed, ""Ukraine strictly denies any such allegation.""



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded, ""That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of.""

""I am a reasonable person. The president of a reasonable country and reasonable people. I am the father of two children,"" Zelenskyy added. ""And no chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.""

The United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting for Friday to discuss Russia's allegations of ""military biological activities of the U.S. on the territory of Ukraine,"" according to ABC News.



Olivia Dalton – spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations – called the claims ""disinformation.""

""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Dalton said on Thursday. ""We’re not going to let Russia gaslight the world or use the U.N. Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-labs-world-health-organization-disease,2022-03-11
"Ukraine offers Russian soldiers money and amnesty to surrender, or says they can 'die in an unjust war'","While war rages in Ukraine, the country is offering Russian soldiers money and a promise of amnesty should they lay down their arms and surrender, Ukraine's defense ministry said Monday.

“We offer Russian soldiers a choice: to die in an unjust war, or full amnesty and 5 million rubles of compensation if they put down their guns and voluntarily surrender to prison,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message to Facebook and Twitter.

While the value of the Russian Ruble is fluctuating because of severe economic sanctions imposed on Russia by western governments opposed to the war, the offer is worth about $46,000 as of publication time.

According to Defense One, the intention behind the offer is to further delay the Russian advance on Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, which American officials say has been delayed by logistics failures.

“They ended up having to rely on fuel and sustainment capabilities earlier in the process than what we believe they had planned to do,” a senior Pentagon official told reporters. “So on day four they're running out of gas, and they're having logistics problems.”

Ukraine's defense ministry has claimed that more than 5,300 Russian troops have been killed or captured since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country last Thursday. Reports of casualties by either side should be received with skepticism, as both the Ukrainian and Russian governments are actively promoting wartime propaganda to boost morale on their respective sides.

“A lot of them are very young. The Kremlin turns them into criminals, turns them into murderers. Some of them were deceived,” ministry officials said. “Ukraine is a civilized country. All prisoners are safe, they are being helped. They already communicate with loved ones.”

Ukraine's message to Russian soldiers is this: ""You have a chance to start a new life. Make a choice. Leave without a weapon with a white flag. Say a code word: ‘million.’ Live a life. Give your family a hug. For those who will continue to behave like an occupier — there will be no mercy.”

It's a message that comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ramped up tensions with the west by putting Russian nuclear forces on high alert Sunday. Putin pointed to ""aggressive statements"" by NATO members and the harsh sanctions against Moscow as justification for readying Russia's military to launch nuclear weapons.

U.S. officials are concerned Russia's failure to take Kyiv swiftly could result in Putin escalating further.

“The way he [Putin] characterized it, ‘special combat duty alert’—think he called it something like that—it's not a term … in what we understand to be Russian doctrine. So that's why we're still analyzing it and reviewing it to try to understand what exactly it means,” the senior defense official said.

So far, Russia has not changed the position of its nuclear forces nor have U.S. officials been able to reach their Russian counterparts for clarification on Putin's intentions.

“There's no ‘hotline’ established with respect to the crisis in Ukraine,” the official said, in apparent reference to the 1963 line of communication between the White House and the Kremlin to avert nuclear war.

Russia's forces are currently amassed fewer than 20 miles north of Kyiv, CNN reports. While Ukrainian forces are putting up stiff resistance, aided by the incompetence of the Russian army, it appears to only be a matter of time before the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians are overwhelmed.

Roughly one fourth of Russia's gathered troops have yet to enter Ukraine, a senior defense official told reporters Monday, and U.S. intelligence believes a ""second wave"" of troops is coming, along with increased Russian airstrikes, long-range missiles, and artillery fire.

""They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv, and one of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv,"" the official said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-offers-russian-soldiers-money-and-amnesty-to-surrender,2022-02-28
"Ukraine's parliament votes to allow citizens to carry guns, act in self-defense amid Russian invasion. Gun stores are already bustling.","As Russia continues to threaten a full-scale military invasion, the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday approved a draft law giving citizens permission to carry firearms and act in self-defense — and within hours, gun stores were bustling.

Reuters reported that the draft measure was approved on ""the first reading.""

Its authors reportedly stated in a note that ""the adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society,"" adding that the law is needed due to ""existing threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraine.""

The move comes only days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""peacekeeping"" troops to the Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in southeastern Ukraine. Onlookers, including President Joe Biden, called the brazen maneuver the beginning of an invasion.

Russia has been massing troops on its border with Ukraine for weeks and has recently begun threatening war while continually insisting there are no invasion plans. But as of Wednesday, as many as 80% of Russia's approximately 150,000 stationed troops now appear to be in ready position, a senior U.S. defense official warned, according to the Hill.

The imminent threat of a large-scale assault has prompted Ukraine's government to issue a 30-day state of emergency, under which the Eastern European country has begun calling up military reservists and has drafted the measure to allow ordinary civilians to carry firearms.

Ukrainians reportedly responded to the draft law by descending en masse on gun stores. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the threat of attack on Kyiv has caused ""an unprecedented rush to buy arms.""

Gun shops are reportedly experiencing long lines already as Ukrainian citizens bolt to purchase guns, ammunition, and sniper rifles. Some weapons, such as the AR-10 and AR-15, have already sold out in gun stores.

""Of course, I’m worried about the situation,"" one Ukrainian told the news outlet, speaking from the basement of a gun store in central Kyiv. ""I’m hoping for the best but preparing for everything.""

Another citizen said, ""I’ve bought two sniper complexes with good optics. I’ve also ordered a drone on Amazon. It hasn’t turned up yet.""

Armed up, he felt bullish about his country's chances against an occupying Russian force.

""We can win against Russia. This isn’t 2014,"" he said. ""We have heavy weapons, thanks to U.S. and U.K. If they come, we will shoot at them from every window.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-parliament-allows-citizens-to-carry-guns,2022-02-23
"Ukraine president offers weapons to any citizen 'who wants to defend the country,' says, 'Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities'","Hours after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of his country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Thursday morning issued a call to arms, publicly declaring that he would give weapons to any Ukrainian citizen who wished to defend their country.

What are the details?

As Russian troops poured into Ukraine and air assaults pummeled military installations, airports, and hospitals, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home or face violence.

But Zelenskyy was not willing to see his military or his people lie down and take the unprovoked assault without a fight. In a series of tweets, the president urged his fellow citizens to defend their country.

""We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities,"" Zelenskyy said.

He added: ""We will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

Zelenskyy's tweets echoed remarks he made a day prior.

In a passionate speech addressing Russian citizens who may be sympathetic to Ukraine's cause, Zelenskyy promised retaliation to any military advance.

""If we’ll be attacked by the [enemy] troops, if they try to take our country away from us, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. Not attack, but defend ourselves. And when you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces,"" he declared.

Days before, the Ukrainian parliament cleared the way for citizens to carry arms and act in self-defense — and within hours, gun stores in the country were being cleared of product.

What else?

Not all Ukrainian citizens have resolved to take up arms, and understandably so. Russia's initial air assault campaign brought devastation to parts of the country and aroused a great deal of fear and panic.

Highways were reportedly jammed up Thursday morning and afternoon as many sought to flee major population centers and head west.

Russia claimed Thursday evening that it had destroyed at least 74 military installations, including 11 airfields. Russian troops reportedly captured an airport in Hostomel, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Ukraine also reported that enemy troops had seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

But not everything was going the Kremlin's way. Russia's aggression came with a significant economic toll.

Russian stocks plummeted at least 33% Thursday and the country's currency, the ruble, hit an all-time low against the U.S. dollar, CNN reported.

The outlet noted the Moscow stock exchange had suspended trading earlier on Thursday amid news of the invasion. However, when dealing resumed, stocks went into free-fall. The crash reportedly wiped out about $70 billion in value from Russia's biggest companies.

Moreover, that downturn preceded the handing down of further severe sanctions from the U.S., U.K., European Union, and other allies.

The hope of government leaders in the West is that Russia's military campaign will be too economically devastating to continue on. It remains to be seen if sanctions alone will deter Putin or work quickly enough to defend Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-president-offers-weapons-to-anyone-who-wants-to-defend-their-country,2022-02-24
"Ukraine President Zelenskyy appears to blast Biden for watching 'from a distance' as Russia inflicts horror on Ukraine, says country has been 'left alone' to defend itself","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to hit out at President Joe Biden and others in an early Friday morning video, saying that the embattled country has been ""left alone"" to defend itself against invading Russian forces.

What are the details?

In recorded remarks, Zelenskyy said that Western allies are not doing enough to help Ukraine stop Russian aggression amid the deadly invasion.

“This morning, we are defending our country alone,” Zelenskyy lamented. “Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.”

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? ... Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: Now is an important moment — the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: Are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.""

He continued, ""Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.""

In the video, Zelenskyy also added that he and the Ukrainian citizens appreciate the outpouring of support from Russian citizens who took to St. Petersburg to protest against the country's invasion.

""To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who went out to protest, I want to say: We see you,” he said. “This means you heard us. This means you are starting to believe us. Fight for us, fight against the war.”



Elsewhere in his remarks, Zelenskyy said that Russia's attacks on civilians will not be forgiven.

""The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven.

What else?

Biden on Thursday said that U.S. troops would not be sent to Ukraine, but would instead defend NATO member states that may be impacted by the aggression.

""Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said in remarks on the ongoing invasion. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies.""

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday added that the bloc had no plans to send troops to engage in the conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-president-zelenskyy-appears-to-blast-biden-for-watching-from-a-distance-as-russia-inflicts-horror-on-ukraine,2022-02-25
Ukraine and Russia peace talks near Belarus,"Ukraine has agreed to hold peace talks with Russia ""without preconditions,"" according to multiple reports. Sunday's announcement of peace talks was reportedly made by the office of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the fourth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow will occur on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River, according to Sky News. A precise time for the meeting was not provided.

""The announcement came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks,"" the Associated Press reported.

The statement from Zelenskyy's office noted that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is involved with the peace talks.



“Alexander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters, and missiles stationed on Belarus territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return,” said the statement from Zelenskyy's office, according to the Financial Times.



Of the peace talks, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said it ""is already a victory for Ukraine"" that there are no preconditions for the meeting, according to Deborah Haynes – security and defense editor at Sky News.

""We go there to listen to what Russia wants to say,"" Kuleba said, according to Haynes.

Kuleba reportedly declared, ""There is nothing bad in talking, and if the outcome is peace that is to be welcomed. We will not surrender. We will not capitulate. We will not give up a single inch of our territory. This is not the goal of our fight.""

Previously, Zelenskyy had refused to attend peace talks in Belarus. The Ukrainian president argued that Belarus was not a neutral territory since Russia has a large contingent of troops in the country and it was one of the launch places for the Russian invasion.

Ukraine has surprised many by holding back much of Vladimir Putin's military forces at the beginning of the war.

"Ukraine-Russia war update: US sending $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, NATO providing weapons, Zelenskyy calls on nations to punish Putin","As Russian forces march closer to the capital city of Kyiv, the international community is sending military aid to Ukraine. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling on nations to inflect financial punishments on Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine.

US has sent over $1 billion to Ukraine in the past year

The United States is sending an ""unprecedented third payment of $350 million"" in military aid to Ukraine to help the country defend against Russia's advancing forces.

""I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the president, an unprecedented third presidential drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday. ""This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion.""

""This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing,"" Blinken continued. ""It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.""

Fox News reported, ""The defense aid will include anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, and body armor and related equipment, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Saturday.""

The $350 million will be allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act ""in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training, and to make the determinations required under such section to direct such a drawdown,"" according to the White House.

NATO sending weapons to Ukraine

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg revealed on Friday that the military alliance would be sending weapons to Ukraine – including air defenses.

Reuters reported, ""He said some of the 30 allies announced the type of weapons that they would supply Ukraine, including air defenses, without giving details. 'Allies are very committed to continue to provide support,' he said.""

Stoltenberg commented on Russia attempting to take out the Ukrainian government during a press conference, ""We see rhetoric, the messages, which is strongly indicating that the aim is to remove the democratically-elected government in Kyiv.""

NATO also activated its response force for the first time in its history. On Thursday, all 30 NATO members agreed to activate the multinational force of approximately 40,000 land, air, maritime, and special operations personnel.

Stoltenberg said activating the NATO Response Force (NRF) was necessary because ""the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine.""



""We are deploying [the NRF] to ... prevent any miscalculations, any misunderstandings that we are not ready to protect and defend all our allies,"" Stoltenberg declared. ""This is something that all allies have agreed to do.""

""We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense,"" he added.

Ukrainian president urges nations to take more measures against Putin

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed for Russia to be cut from the SWIFT international electronic bank payment system to punish Putin for the invasion of Ukraine.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a ""cooperative of financial institutions formed in 1973 with headquarters ... overseen by the National Bank of Belgium in partnership with other major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank,"" according to CBS News.

""The anti-war coalition is working. Defensive weapons and equipment are arriving to Ukraine. We have almost unanimous support from the EU on cutting Russia from SWIFT,"" Zelenskyy said, according to Euronews. ""I hope Germany and Hungary will find the courage to support this decision.""

On Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Russia shouldn't be cut off from SWIFT just yet because it is ""very important"" to keep such measures ""for a situation where it may be necessary.""

Barron's noted, ""Germany has been more cautious about excluding Russia from SWIFT. Russian gas makes up a higher share of energy supplies in Germany and other parts of Europe than in France, which backs the move.""

Regarding Hungary kicking Russia out of SWIFT, Fortune pointed out, ""Energy likely plays a part – Hungary signed a deal with Moscow just a few weeks ago that will allow it to buy Russian gas far below market prices.""

President Joe Biden deferred to Europe on whether to boot Russia from SWIFT.

""The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence – maybe more consequence than SWIFT – number one,"" Biden said on Thursday. ""Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.""

Zelensky also called on ""all civilized countries"" to ""impose an embargo on Russian oil products"" and ""ban Russian citizens from entering your territory,"" according to Fox News National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-update-nato-us-aid,2022-02-26
Ukraine Russia war update: Plane shot down over Kyiv,"Ukraine has claimed to have inflicted a significant blow on Vladimir Putin's forces.

The Financial Times reported on an update by Hanna Maliar, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, claiming losses that the Russian military had incurred.

Maliar reportedly wrote in a Facebook post: ""Since the beginning of the open large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, the troops of the invading country have suffered the following losses (approximately) as of 3pm Friday:

Tanks — up to 80

Armored combat vehicles of various types — 516

Aircraft — 10

Helicopters — 7

Special staff — 2,800

We are strong! Victory will be ours.""

On Thursday, at least 15 Russian T-72 tanks were ""destroyed or damaged by the Ukrainian forces using the Javelin PTRK, an American anti-tank missile, near Glukhov,"" according to the Daily Mail.

Ukraine has reportedly launched a counteroffensive and attacked a Russian military base approximately 10 miles from the border of the warring countries, Newsweek reported.

The Daily Mail added, ""Ukrainian forces claimed on Friday to have destroyed part of an airfield in Millerovo in southern Russia, destroying several of Moscow's fighter jets.""

The U.K. Ministry of Defense stated Thursday: ""It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned Day 1 military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia's advances.""



The British agency also acknowledged that Russian forces ""highly likely"" captured the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant. Ukrainian officials have since confirmed the report, adding that Russian forces have seized control of the now-defunct nuclear power plant and that the staff are being ""held hostage,"" according to CNN.

Ukraine lost one of its best fighter jets on early Friday morning. CNN reported that a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv shortly before dawn on Friday, according to Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin. Several videos capture the fiery scene above the country's capital city of nearly 3,000 residents as smoldering debris rains down on Kyiv.



Before the war started, Ukraine only had 34 Su-27 fighter jets, according to Forbes.

The destroyed plane caused a high-rise apartment to catch fire. Three people in the apartment building were injured, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

The New York Times reported that the United Nations released a statement on Friday claiming that they had received reports of at least 25 civilians have been killed and 127 injured in Ukraine due to ""shelling and airstrikes"" from the Russian invasion. The U.N. cautioned that the actual death toll was likely much higher.



The U.N. also estimates that roughly 100,000 Ukrainians have fled their homes, many traveling to neighboring countries for safety.

Ukraine stands up to Russia in powerful moment at emergency UN meeting: 'There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.',"Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations confronted Russia's U.N. ambassador in a tense exchange late Wednesday just as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What happened?

During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Wednesday, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya directly confronted Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, a rare moment at the U.N. that underscored its seriousness.

Less than an hour after Russia began its invasion, Kyslytsya called on the U.N. Security Council to remove Russia as president of the council (the council rotates the ""president"" role each month, and the Russian Federation just so happened to be president of the council in February) — and that is when things got tense.

""It’s too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation, too late,"" Kyslytsya said.

""The Russian president declared war. Should I play video of your president?"" Kyslytsya then asked Nebenzia directly, holding up his phone. ""Ambassador, should I do that right now, or can you confirm it?""

""Do not interrupt me, please — thank you,"" he continued.

""Then don't ask me questions when you are speaking,"" Nebenzia fired back. ""Proceed with your statement.""

""Anyway, you declared war. It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,"" Kyslytsya responded. ""So, I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war.""

Ukraine - Security Council, 8974th meeting | United Nations | UNTV Live (23 Feb 2022) - Official youtu.be

At the end of the meeting, after other countries had condemned Russia for the invasion, Kyslytsya blasted Russia with a powerful line of condemnation.

""As I said, relinquish your duties as chair. Call Putin, call [Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey] Lavrov to stop aggression,"" Kyslytsya said. ""And I welcome the decision of some members of this council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that you launch on my people.""

""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, ambassador,"" Kyslytsya continued.

Shockingly, just before adjourning the meeting, Nebenzia said that Russia is not being aggressive toward Ukraine because there is a ""junta in power in Kyiv."" The comment amounts to an outright rejection of Ukraine's sovereignty.

In the wake of Russia's invasion, calls are growing to remove Russia from the U.N. Security Council, or perhaps from the U.N. altogether. However, Russia holds a permanent spot on the Security Council, making its potential removal difficult.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-stands-up-to-russia-in-powerful-moment-at-emergency-un-meeting,2022-02-24
"Russia claims destruction of 74 Ukrainian military facilities as land assaults begin — citizens flee cities in fear, take shelter in subway stations","Russia's Defense Ministry claimed early Thursday that the Russian military had already destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities — including 11 airbases — only hours into the launch of its full-scale invasion of the neighboring country.

What are the details?

As of Thursday morning, Ukraine reported at least 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians had been killed in the shocking military advance, though those numbers are expected to rise in the coming hours and days.

Only hours before, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast aside global condemnation and threats of harsh economic sanctioning when he announced a ""special military operation"" had begun in southeastern Ukraine. The West called the maneuver what it actually was: a declaration of war.

Under the cover of darkness, the Russian military launched airstrikes on cities across Ukraine, from the Donbas region — where Putin falsely claims he is acting in defense of Russian separatists — to Kharkiv in the northeast just 30 miles from the Russian border, to Ukraine's capital in Kyiv.

On Thursday, Ukraine’s military chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, reportedly said Ukrainian troops were fighting the Russian army in the country's north and south.

According to the Associated Press, Zaluzhnyi said a battle was raging near the Hostomel airbase just under five miles northwest of the capital, Kyiv. The north-central location of the capital indicates that Russian troops had advanced significantly into Ukraine.

He added that in the south, more fighting was going on near Henichesk, Skadovsk, and Chaplynka. Putin has claimed Russia will only attack Ukrainian military facilities.

In Luhansk, in the southeast, video appeared to show Russian tanks traveling through emptied city streets. Meanwhile, Putin carried on as usual, reportedly maintaining his scheduled meeting in Moscow with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.

What else?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly said that Russian forces were trying to seize the area surrounding the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, near the Ukraine-Belarusian border.

""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,” Zelenskyy said in a statement, adding, ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe.""

The president previously severed diplomatic ties and declared martial law. In a tweet, he also pleaded with sympathetic Russian citizens to protest their government's warring.

Anything else?

Many Ukrainians have responded to the onslaught by attempting to withdraw cash and flee major urban centers, though reporters have noted that highways have quickly become jammed with traffic and ATMs have been emptied of cash. Grocery stores, too, are reportedly being rapidly cleared of products.

Others have taken shelter in subway stations, hoping they will serve as improvised bomb shelters.

""I heard noise and woke up. I realized it sounded like artillery,"" one Kyiv resident recounted to reporters. He jumped from the couch and ran to wake his mother as another explosion went off behind him.

Air raid sirens began to sound in the city.

Still others have remained defiant in the face of attack, the AP reported.

""I’m not afraid. I’m going to work. The only unusual thing is that you can’t find a taxi in Kyiv,"" another resident lamented early Thursday. Perspective may change as the day draws out.

That sentiment was offered by another, who said, ""I’m not scared at the moment. Maybe I’ll be scared later.""

War on the European content is unprecedented for this generation. The reality is perhaps taking longer to set in for some.

""I feel panic, scared and excited. I don’t know who I should ask for help,"" added another Kyiv resident. ""We didn’t believe this situation would come.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-destroys-74-facilities,2022-02-24
"Ukrainian beauty queen posts pic in fighting gear, warns Russian 'invaders will die'","Former Miss Grand Ukraine Anastasia Lenna has taken to social media to voice strong opposition to the Russian invasion of her home country.

Lenna, a beauty queen and Ukraine’s 2015 representative in the Miss Grand International beauty contest, posted multiple photos and videos on her Instagram account in recent days condemning the unprovoked attack and warning that Russian invaders will face fierce resistance from the Ukrainian people.

In one post, Lenna is seen wearing what appears to be fighting gear. In another post, this one a reel, she is seen practicing her aim with a rifle at a shooting range.

In the caption, she wrote, ""The invaders will die on our Ukrainian lands! Wait and see!"" adding, ""Please, share more information about this situation! Support Ukraine! Stop Russian aggression! You can help us!""

According to the New York Post, Lenna shared a message on her Instagram story over the weekend that said, ""Everyone who crosses the Ukrainian border with the intent to invade will be killed!""

The post, written in English, was reportedly accompanied by a photo of armed soldiers blocking a roadway.

In a subsequent post, she allegedly quipped, ""Our army is fighting in such a way that NATO should apply for entry into Ukraine.""

Multipleoutletsreported that Lenna had in fact joined the Ukrainian military to offer armed resistance against the Russian assault; however, that has not yet been confirmed.

Lenna, who is an avid airsoft player, shared another post on her Instagram on Monday, saying, ""I am not [sic] a military, just a woman, just normal human. Just a person, like all people of my country.""

""All pictures in my profile to inspire people,"" she continued. ""I had a normal life just on Wednesday, like millions [of] people. I don’t do any propaganda except showing that our women of Ukraine — strong, confident, and powerful.""



""I appreciate all attention and support to my country, all people in Ukraine we fight every day against Russian aggression,"" she added. ""We will win!""

Lenna's messages come as many Ukrainian civilians and notable figures — including current Ukrainian President Volodomor Zelenskyy, former President Petro Poroshenko, and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko — have joined the fight against Russia.

Since the start of the invasion, the government has urged male residents aged 18 to 60 to take up arms in defense of their country and offered weapons to anyone who would join the fight. Countless have responded to the call.

Despite being under-armed and outmanned, Ukrainian fighters have thus far been able to hold off Russian forces from reaching the capital and overthrowing the government — as they reportedly planned to do.

11 year old Ukrainian boy Hassan Pisetskaya escapes war,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, there have been more than 2.3 million refugees who fled the war-torn country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. One of the most astonishing Ukrainian refugees is an 11-year-old boy who escaped the nation by traveling over 600 miles to neighboring Slovakia.

Last Friday, Russian forces seized the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia – which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. During the Russian capture of the nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine, a fire broke out near one of the station's six reactors.

With war waging in Ukraine, Yulia Pisetskaya wanted to get her 11-year-old son to safety. However, Pisetskaya's mother is sick and is unable to move on her own, according to a video posted on Facebook. In an effort to get her son out of harm's way, Pisetskaya put her 11-year-old son Hassan on a train in Zaporizhzhia.

Pisetskaya – who is a widow – wrote the phone number of relatives who live in Slovakia on his hand. The young boy had his passport and a small red backpack.

The boy traveled by himself for approximately 620 miles by train to the Slovakian border.

Once he arrived at the border of Slovakia, kind volunteers provided Hassan with food and drink. Border officials were able to contact Hassan's relatives living in the Slovak capital Bratislava and reunite him.

Yulia Pisetskaya thanked everyone who assisted in her son's safe arrival in Slovakia, ""I am grateful you have saved my child’s life.""

""In your small country, there are people with big hearts ... Please save our Ukrainian children and give them a safe haven,"" the mother said, CBS News reported.

According to a Facebook post from the Slovak Embassy in the U.K., a Slovak interior ministry representative said of Hassan, ""He conquered everyone with his smile, fearlessness, and determination of a real hero.""

Roman Mikulec – Slovakia's interior minister – penned a touching tribute to the triumphant boy.

""Little Hassan is only 11 years old, but in his way he has shown huge determination, courage, and fearlessness that sometimes adults don't have,"" Mikulec wrote on Facebook. ""I am really very sorry for him and all the other children and their families who have to flee their country because of what is happening in Ukraine.""

Mikulec proclaimed that people in Slovakia are ""ready to help"" the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.

""You will find security with us and if you ask for temporary protection, you will be provided with health care, social security, food, accommodation, education, and job opportunities,"" he said on social media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-boy-escapes-russia-war,2022-03-10
"Ukrainian brewery joins war effort, switches to manufacturing Molotov cocktails: 'Putin is a d**khead'","A Ukrainian brewery has joined the war effort and has replaced the act of brewing its craft beer with manufacturing Molotov cocktails in an effort to stem the tide of Russian forces.

What are the details?

Pravda brewery in Lviv has begun manufacturing the makeshift bombs in anticipation of the possibility that Russian tanks will begin to roll into the city, according to reports.

Pravda brewery owner Yuriy Zastavny said that he would fight tooth and nail to ensure Ukraine's victory over Russian invaders.

""We do this because someone has to,"" he reasoned. ""We have the skills, we went through a street revolution in 2014. We had to make and use Molotov cocktails then.""

Zastavny vowed that he would do everything possible to help win the war.

""I have absolutely no doubt that we'll win,"" he told Fox News on Monday. ""We are already winning because we already disrupt[ed] the plans of the crazy dictator. And we will continue to do it, because they are not facing only the Ukrainian Army, but they are facing the army of 40 million people prepared to fight every step.""

He added that his employees gave him the idea to switch over to the manufacturing of firebombs.

""Once we understand what can come through beer -- because it’s no time for beer, we need to get other things sorted out – we decided to make Molotov cocktails because we can use bottles, we can use the people, and it was a grassroots idea.""

What else?

One employee described the perfect way to craft the cocktail, telling Agence France-Presse that in order to build a successful homemade firebomb, ""you have to wait for the cloth to be well soaked.""

""When it is, that means the Molotov cocktail is ready,"" the employee told the news agency as he stuffed a rag into the beer bottle, which was filled with oil and gasoline.

AFP reported that one of the brewery's favorite beers is called ""Putin khuylo"" — reportedly translated to ""Putin is a dickhead.""

Ukrainian forces reclaim the region containing Kyiv as Russian forces withdraw and regroup,"As of Saturday, the Ukrainian military has taken the entirety of the region containing the country’s capital city of Kyiv.

In a statement shared on Facebook, Hanna Maliar, the Ukrainian defense minister, said, “Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel, and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader.”

The Daily Mail reported that the towns of Irpin and Bucha — from which people would previously commute to and from Kyiv — were reclaimed by Ukrainian forces earlier this week. Both towns have reportedly suffered high civilian death tolls and experienced large-scale destruction.

The mayor of Bucha said that 280 people had been buried in a mass grave while corpses littered the city’s streets, while at least 200 people have been killed in Irpin — which is often considered a suburb of Kyiv.

There was also heavy fighting in Gostomel as both Russian and Ukrainian forces sought to gain control of the region’s airfield.

Ukrainian officials have said that Russia’s current process of withdrawing from the northern parts of Ukraine is strategic so that the Russian military can refocus its forces on the country’s eastern and southern regions.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to congratulate Ukraine’s “brave armed forces” for successfully pushing back the invading Russian army.

Ukraine’s apparent victory at retaking Kyiv comes as broken-down Russian artillery litter the highways that connect the city to the rest of the country.

The Daily Mail said, “As Ukrainian units advance, they’re met with burned-out tanks and heavily-armored personnel transport vehicles that line the roads once populated by commuters that would have been heading in or out of the capital.”

Despite the off-putting nature of abundant worn-down and broken machinery, the Ukrainian military apparently continues to discover gruesome relics of war, potentially indicating that the Russians continued to commit war crimes as they withdrew from Kyiv.

Reportedly, Ukrainian troops found the bodies of 20 men dressed in civilian clothing on a single street. Eyewitnesses said that one of the corpses had his hands tied.

The dead bodies were strewn across roads of residential areas and suburban towns.

Zelenskkyy warned that the withdrawing Russian forces were leaving behind “catastrophic” situations by placing land mines outside of residential areas, abandoning their broken-down equipment, and the “bodies of those killed.”

The Ukrainian forces were also successful in retaking control of the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant.

Ukrainian foreign minister smacks down suggestion that Russian incursion is 'minor': 'Invasion is an invasion',"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rebuffed any attempt to soften language of Russia's invasion into eastern Ukrainian provinces.

What is the background?

After Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk — two provinces in eastern Ukraine — and ordered Russian ""peacekeeping"" troops into those regions, the Biden administration initially refused to describe the incursion as an ""invasion.""

According to the Washington Post, the Biden administration on Monday wrestled over whether Russian troops entering Ukrainian provinces constituted an ""invasion."" One administration official even reportedly said the development was not an ""invasion"" because the territories have been disputed and not without some Russian troops, at least in part, since 2014.

President Joe Biden later described Russia's actions as an ""invasion"" worthy of the swift response he promised last month, which meant imposing harsh economic sanctions meant to deter Putin from further action.

What did Kuleba say?

During a joint press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Ukrainian foreign minister made it clear that Russia's actions could only be described as an ""invasion.""

Kuleba's remarks came in response to a question from Fox News reporter Ben Hall, who observed that ""there is a suggestion that what we’ve seen so far is a minor invasion,"" a reference to the Biden administration's initially soft response and potentially Biden's reference last month to a ""minor incursion.""

""First, there is no such thing as minor, middle, or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,"" Kuleba said.

LIVE: Secretary of State Blinken, Ukraine Foreign Minister Kuleba hold a press conference youtu.be

Kuleba then addressed sanctions the Biden administration enacted on Donetsk and Luhansk, criticizing the move, considering that Kyiv says each region remains part of Ukraine.

""I can say frankly that yesterday (Monday), when we learned about the first executive order to impose sanctions on — related to economic activities with Donetsk and Luhansk — we were puzzled, because we saw how the side that sought recognition from Russia is being punished, but we didn’t see how Russia, who granted its recognition, is punished,"" Kuleba said.

However, Kuleba also praised Biden for action taken on Tuesday with new sanctions against Russia. Kuleba said that Ukraine hopes Biden issues more sanctions as Russia aggression continues.

""We do appreciate today’s — the sanctions which were announced today. They target Russia. They’re very specific. They are painful,"" Kuleba said. ""And this strategy of imposing sanctions by waves, if I may put it this way, is something that can work if it continues in a sustainable way.""

"Ukrainian GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz passionately condemns Putin's 'genocide,' calls on Biden to 'get his act together and exercise some leadership'","Indiana Republican lawmaker Victoria Spartz, who was born in Ukraine and emigrated to the United States, gave an impassioned plea for more action from the United States government to stop the ""genocide"" of the Ukrainian people at the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading troops.

""This is not a war. This is a genocide of the Ukrainian people by a crazy man who cannot get over that Ukrainian people do not want socialism, Soviet Union, communism,"" Spartz said Tuesday at the House Republican leadership press conference. She wore the colors of Ukraine's flag to stand in solidarity with the people there, who have been attacked by Russia without provocation. ""They want to be with the United States of America. They want to be free people, they want to be with the West,"" she said.



Spartz shared a personal story about her Russian-born grandmother, who is 95 and is currently living in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine. The city has been hit by heavy shelling from Russian artillery, and the most recent news is that Belarusian forces have crossed the border and joined the siege.

""They are bombing civilians non-stop, day and night. The whole city,"" Spartz said, becoming emotional as she related what she's heard from her grandmother, who spoke with another relative living in a small village outside Chernihiv.

""Her daughter told her [the Russians] came into [the] village with heavy machine guns [and] killed almost every person in that village. And whatever people were left, women and children, they forced them to walk in front of the tanks as a human shield because they cannot take that city,"" the congresswoman told reporters, fighting tears.



She shared words from her grandmother, who said: ""No, don't cry. We are not crying here. We're going to fight, but just give us some guns so we don't just fight with sticks.""

The lawmaker told other stories of how Russian troops are allegedly shooting women and children and committing war crimes, including using illegal thermobaric weapons. Reports indicate that Russia has used ""vacuum bombs,"" also known as fuel-air explosives, which use one explosive charge to spread fuel in a cloud that sucks up oxygen and flows around objects. A second charge then detonates the cloud, causing a massive explosion that is particularly destructive inside closed spaces like buildings or foxholes.

""They are leveling the cities to the ground! Destroying the people, slaughtering them like animals. They are killing people — it is not a war, it's a genocide because we have a crazy man that believes he has the whole world hostage,"" Spartz said, speaking with righteous indignation.

She criticized President Joe Biden for not doing enough to support Ukraine, emphasizing that America is not being asked to go fight, but the Ukraine is asking for more help with defense and for ""serious"" sanctions.

The United States, European Union, and other allied nations have imposed severe economic sanctions against Russian financial institutions and government personnel, including Putin himself. Western governments have also pledged to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, a messaging service that connects financial institutions around the world, as punishment for Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

But Republicans have criticized Biden for not going further and sanctioning Russia's energy sector. While White House press secretary Jen Psaki told Fox News on Tuesday that energy sanctions are not ""off the table,"" she said the president is focused on ""minimizing the impact on the global markets and the American people.""

Economic sanctions on Russia's energy industry, while extremely punitive, would cause energy prices in countries that import oil from Russia to increase sharply, including in the U.S.

But for Spartz and others opposed to Russia's aggression, the sacrifice may be worth it to stop the war.



""I can tell you one thing. If we don't stop [Putin] there, he is not going to stop. He is going to go further. And then we'll have to send our children to die to fight this. So I think we have an obligation and duty to save this world, help Ukrainian people to survive,"" Spartz said.



""And this president needs to get his act together and exercise some leadership. What's happening under his watch is [an] atrocity. What he's doing to this country and to the world is unforgivable, but I think we'll get together as Republicans and Democrats, but act decisively fast or this blood of many millions of Ukrainans will be on his hands too,"" she warned.

"Ukrainian government official shreds Biden, Democrats: 'If Democrats weren’t such p***ies in foreign policy, this might not have happened'","An anonymous Ukrainian official hit out at President Joe Biden and U.S. Democrats, the Daily Wire reported Saturday, saying that if the Democrats ""weren't such pussies,"" the Russian invasion might never have happened.

What are the details?



The official told the outlet that the war-torn country is in dire need of assistance and said that ""[i]f Democrats weren't such pussies in foreign policy, this might not have happened.""

“The Obama-Biden administration has refused lethal aid to Ukraine for a long time,” the official told the Daily Wire under the condition of anonymity. “It was [former President Donald] Trump who was the first to provide some Javelins to Ukraine, then Biden started sending Javelins in mass just before invasion. But too little, too late.”

The official added that everything Biden has done thus far since being in office has been a day late and a dollar short.

“Biden’s first step in office was to lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Now he applies them heavily. Now it’s too late,” the official added. “If Democrats did not play into the weak policy of not sending weapons to Ukraine and lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Putin would probably think twice or three times. Also, we never understood why would Biden say that no U.S. troops would be involved. Even if he did not intend to, why say it when no one asked? At least [he] could have speculated on the possibility to deter an attack.”

The Biden administration previously offered to evacuate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to which the fiery president said that he needed ammunition — not a ride.

The message appears to be much the same: The official added that the country is in dire need of ""rifles, bullets, Javelins, Stingers.""

""[Freezing] all Russian USD and EUR assets"" would also be helpful, the official pointed out.

What else?

The official added that Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly believed that his troops would be met with ""flowers"" in some cities across Ukraine.

“Putin actually believed that he would be greeted with flowers at least in some [cities],” he said. “Instead, in every single city they were met with bullets.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-government-official-shreds-biden-democrats,2022-02-28
'False flag': Ukrainian kindergarten hit by military shells as US officials warn Russian invasion is 'imminent',"A kindergarten was struck by artillery shells in a town on the Ukrainian government-controlled side of the front line in eastern Ukraine Thursday, wounding three adult civilians, the Ukrainian military said.

In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation accused ""Russian occupation troops"" of shelling the town of Stanytsia in the Luhansk region, referring to Russian-backed separatist troops that have been causing violence in the area for eight years. The separatists in turn accused the Ukrainian government of opening fire on the territory four times over the past 24 hours, according to Reuters.



A spokesman for the Kremlin did not comment directly on Ukraine's allegation, but said there is ""an ongoing exchange of strikes"" near the border between Ukraine and Russia and that ""the first strike came from the Ukrainian side,"" the New York Times reported.



The breach of a tenuous cease-fire agreement in the region was received by western leaders as a possible ""false flag"" operation by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine.

U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Thursday, ""the picture is continuing to be very grim.""

""A kindergarten was shelled in what we are taking to be, what we know was a false flag operation designed to discredit the Ukrainians, designed to create a pre-text, a spurious provocation for Russian action,"" Johnson said.

""We fear very much that that is a thing we will see more of over the next few days,"" he added.

American officials have likewise warned that ""evidence on the ground"" suggests a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""imminent.""

""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" President Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.""

Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine and earlier this week claimed that troops deployed along the border had completed military exercises there and were returning to base.

But the United States and NATO allies have said there was no evidence to support Russia's claims. Satellite images reported by Axios show a military pontoon bridge has been established over the Pripyat River in Belarus, less than four miles from the Ukraine border. Moscow has actually increased troop presence on the border ""by as many as 7,000 troops,"" according to a senior administration official.



U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the reports of the shelling were ""troubling.""

“We’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we’ll be watching this very closely,” he said, speaking from Brussels.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba blamed Russia for a ""severe violation"" of the cease-fire agreement and President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a ""provocative shelling.""

Russia turned the accusations around and blamed Ukraine for a ""further escalation of tensions.""

“We have warned many times that excessive concentration of Ukrainian forces near the contact line, together with possible provocations, can pose terrible danger,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-kindergarten-hit-by-military-shells-us-officials-warn-russian-invasion-imminent,2022-02-17
Ukrainian lawmaker accuses Russian soldiers of raping a woman in front of her child,"A Ukrainian woman was raped by a Russian soldier in front of her child, according to a lawmaker who said Ukraine will ""not be silent"" about crimes committed during Russia's invasion of her country.



Member of Parliament Maria Mezentseva said in a TV interview that the alleged war crime took place in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, the Guardian reported. She told the U.K.'s Sky News that the victim's husband was shot dead in his house before the alleged assault.

“There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office, and we’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv,"" Mezentseva said.

“His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child.”

According to the Guardian, the Russian soldier is believed to have threatened the child after the attack.

Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has confirmed the alleged attack was reported to authorities and said Wednesday that an arrest warrant has been issued for the soldier.

Mezentseva, who serves as the head of Ukraine's permanent delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said that war crimes committed during the invasion must be recorded. ""Justice has to prevail,"" she said.

She added that sexual assault cases were being underreported.

“There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that.

“That’s why you know, when we’ve been talking to Boris Johnson, when we will be talking to your Home Office, when we’ve been talking to MPs of UK, we’ve also raised this issue that this aftermath, which we are dealing with right now, the aftermath of war, has to be taken very cautiously, very seriously, and to take into account the UK experience and experience of other countries, which can help us in dealing with psychologists, and how to help these people to actually live over these cases, to keep going afterwards, to keep living.”

""We will definitely not be silent,"" she added.



There have been previous reports of sexual assaults committed by Russian soldiers, which is considered a war crime and violation of international humanitarian law.

Earlier in March, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged there were ""numerous cases"" of Russian soldiers raping women in Ukraine. Another Ukrainian lawmaker, Lesia Vasylenko, said officials had reports of ""women being gang-raped,"" including ""senior citizens,"" and that ""most of these women have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives.""

While rape is common in times of war, sexual assaults are difficult to prove, and accusations of rape have been used as a powerful propaganda tool to rally opposition to the enemy.



The U.S. government determined last week that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, after a ""careful review"" of public and intelligence sources transmitting news from the war.

“We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-lawmaker-accuses-russian-soldiers-of-raping-a-woman-in-front-of-her-child,2022-03-28
Ukrainian leaders rule out a ceasefire and will not cede territory to Russia to end fighting,"Ukrainian leadership has ruled out the possibility of a ceasefire or granting any concessions of land or policy to Russia.

The decision not to grant either a ceasefire or concessions to end Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine came as Russian forces intensified their attack in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, and the Russian government decided to stop exports of gas to Finland, the New York Post reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, “The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult.” He made clear to his constituents that while the Russian army is trying to take the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, Ukrainian forces will dig in and work to hold off the Russian advance.

Russian forces were able to outlast the weekslong resistance by Ukrainian fighters in the southeastern city of Mariupol. Whoever controls Mariupol has strategic access to crucial waterways.

With full control of Mariupol, Russia will also have command of land routes linking the Crimean Peninsula with mainland Russia and other areas of eastern Ukraine that are of interest to the Russian government.

Russian forces are now waging a major offensive in Luhansk in the Donbas region. Russian-backed separatists already controlled large swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighboring Donetsk. Reportedly, the Russian government wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-controlled territories in Donbas and forcibly annex the region.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, ruled out the possibility of Ukrainian officials agreeing to a ceasefire with Russia and said that the Ukrainian government would not accept any deal with Russia that involves the transfer of territory. Podolyak theorized that making any concessions to Russia would result in Russia renewing attacks on Ukraine shortly after the fighting breaks.

In a recent interview, Podolyak said, “The war will not stop (after concessions). It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.”

Podolyak’s statements contradict calls for a ceasefire made by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

Heightening tensions with Western nations, Russia’s state-owned gas company said it would be halting all gas exports to Finland in response to the Finns refusing to pay for Russian oil with rubles.

Last Wednesday, Finland and Sweden applied for membership in the NATO military alliance which will likely exacerbate Russian frustrations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-leaders-rule-out-a-ceasefire-and-will-not-cede-territory-to-russia-to-end-fighting,2022-05-22
Ukrainian leadership says Russia has a 'multifaceted plan to destabilize' Ukraine,"Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is more likely to pursue a destabilization campaign than launch a large-scale invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top national security adviser, said, “The No. 1 task for Russia is to undermine us from the inside.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that in a recent interview, Danilov said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia, given the size of Ukraine’s army and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight. He also said that the West constantly pressuring Russia will cause the Russian leadership to pursue alternative forms of warfare instead of a conventional invasion.

Danilov believes that the Russians will pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and will apply economic pressure to foment discontent among the Ukrainian public. He said, “It will be very difficult for them to achieve their aims by military means. I think, impossible. They have a multifaceted plan to destabilize the domestic situation on the territory of our country. That’s the number one task for them.”

Russian leadership continues to deny that it has any plans to invade or cause harm to Ukraine. They argued that Western countries are ignoring their security concerns by working to integrate Russia’s neighboring countries into NATO and the European Union.

As NATO and the European Union continue to grow their ranks, Russia grows increasingly frustrated. Russian leadership perceives these growing coalitions as an explicit threat to their country’s sovereignty.

In early February, Putin said, “We didn’t see an adequate response to our key concerns.”

In 2014, Russia invaded parts of Ukraine and, according to the Wall Street Journal, has “employed a variety of tactics to try and sap the country’s resources and will to fight.”

Russia’s destabilization efforts in Ukraine over the past years have had mixed results. The Kremlin is in communication with and supports Russian nationalist, Ukrainian separatists in the eastern regions of Ukraine. It uses these proxies to disrupt the daily operations of the Ukrainian military and cause chaos in the daily lives of the region’s inhabitants.

It is theorized that Russia is sponsoring the separatists so that the country has pretext to send its military further into Ukraine. This strategy is similar to Russia’s antagonism of Georgia prior to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

Despite Ukrainian leadership’s skepticism about Russia’s intentions for outright war, Western nations are reducing their presence and encouraging citizens to leave Ukraine.

The U.S. State Department drastically reduced the American diplomatic presence in Ukraine and is working to funnel American citizens into Poland where they will be far away from any potential fighting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-leadership-says-russia-has-a-multifaceted-plan-to-destabilize-ukraine,2022-02-13
Video: Huge fireball erupts after Russian tank-landing ship explodes; Ukrainian navy says vessel was 'destroyed',"A massive fireball erupted from a Russian Navy amphibious ship while it was docked in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk in southern Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian navy asserted the tank-landing ship had been ""destroyed.""

Video shows a huge explosion and fire on the Project 1171 Alligator-class landing ship Orsk. A thick black plume of smoke billowed from the fiery ship and spread over the harbor.

БЕРДЯНСК: взрывы и пожар в порту 24 марта 2022 года www.youtube.com

""There have been claims made that the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an attack on the Orsk, potentially using one of their Tochka (SS-21 Scarab) short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), but there’s so far no evidence to confirm exactly what led to the inferno on the vessel,"" the Drive reported.



The Ukrainian navy claimed on Facebook, ""In the temporarily captured Russian port Berdyansk, a large paratrooper ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of occupiers was destroyed.""

Ukraine’s armed forces celebrated on social media by saying, ""The morning starts with good news! The large landing ship 'Orsk' of the Black Sea Fleet of the occupiers was destroyed in the captured Russian port of Berdyansk.""

""That’s only the beginning,” a Ukrainian military source told the Times.

The 370-foot ship can transport as many as 425 troops as well as 20 tanks or 40 armored vehicles and is beachable to unload vehicles on land.

Two Project 775 Ropucha-II class landing ships — Tsesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk — had burning debris on their decks, and the fires were quickly extinguished, according to military analyst H.I. Sutton.



""It marks the largest ship that Ukrainian forces have managed to strike so-far and represents another embarrassing loss for Vladimir Putin's beleaguered army,"" according to the Daily Mail.



A day before the strike, Russian state media was touting the ships supplying reinforcements at the captured port city on the Sea of Azov. The video shows armored personnel carriers being extracted from the Orsk.

""By land, air and now sea, Russian troops continue to advance and reinforce into Ukraine,"" RT reporter Murad Gazdiev said in the video. ""The Azov Sea, with its ports and towns, is now under Russian control...which has allowed Russia's Black Sea fleet to and the Orsk landing ship to stage this operation.""

Berdyansk was captured by Russian military forces on Feb. 27. The port city is roughly 50 miles southwest of the besieged city of Mariupol.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that approximately 100,000 people are enduring ""inhumane conditions"" in Mariupol.

""For more than a week now, we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror,"" Zelenskyy said during a televised address.

Zelenskyy said the people of Maiupol have ""no food, no water, no medicine.""

The local council in Mariupol said Russian airstrikes were turning the city into the ""ashes of a dead land.""

Drone footage released this week by Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs shows the devastation to Mariupol after weeks of heavy shelling by the Russian military. Russian bombardments from artillery, airstrikes, and naval vessels have turned the city into ruins.

Ukrainian officials believe Russia is planning a terrorist attack at Chernobyl,"Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is preparing to launch an attack at Chernobyl.

In a lengthy Facebook post, the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “stockpiling” the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers to justify a “false flag” attack on the power plant.

Business Insider reported that Ukrainian officials claim that Russian forces are using car refrigerators to collect the corpses of dead Ukrainian soldiers.

The Ukrainian officials warned that Russia is planning to stage a “man-made catastrophe” at the power plant and might use the dead Ukrainian soldiers as props. Ukrainian officials believe the Russian military will stage the corpses so that they appear to be “killed saboteurs.”

Shortly after Russian forces began the invasion of Ukraine, they seized control of the infamous Chernobyl power plant and 20 miles of surrounding land that serves as a buffer zone.

The facility continues to be operated by Ukrainian workers. The BBC reported that more than 100 Ukrainian citizens have been stuck living on-site since the Russian invasion.

Despite no longer functioning as nuclear power plant, the Chernobyl facilities still require constant management and employs a work force of more than 2,000 people including scientists, technicians, cooks, medics, and more.

The workers stuck on-site are forced to live in temporary dorms within the powerplant’s facilities and have refused deliveries of food from Russian personnel, believing it to be a propaganda stunt.

On Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it unexpectedly lost remote contact with the Chernobyl site. The IAEA’s announcement came one day after Russian forces damaged a power line connected to the facility.

Ukrainian officials warn that there is only a two-day supply of diesel fuel left on-site to power the Chernobyl facility’s emergency generators. They also said that Russian forces refuse to let the repairmen and engineers enter the facility.

The officials allege that the Russians are relying on “Belarusian specialists” and that the Russians are planning a terrorist attack while working undercover at the site.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has not provided evidence for these claims.

The allegations of a pending terrorist attack come as the United States sounded the alarm over the possibility of Russian forces using chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Last week, White House press secretary warned of a possible “false flag” attack by Russian forces. Psaki alleged that the Russians might use chemical or biological weapons in this attack.

She said that the proliferation of “disinformation” online might provide the Russian military a pretense for launching this attack.

Psaki said, “It’s the kind of disinformation operation we’ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-officials-believe-russia-is-planning-a-terrorist-attack-at-chernobyl,2022-03-12
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy seeks to meet with Putin to reach a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing crisis,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin so that they may find a resolution to the ongoing crisis and violence along their shared border, the Associated Press reported.

“I don’t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,” Zelenskyy said during the Munich Security Conference.

Zelenskyy affirmed that he is dedicated to finding a diplomatic solution to dissolve tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

He said, “Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

Zelenskyy made these statements just hours after separatist leaders in the eastern regions of Ukraine initiated a full military mobilization. Subsequently, leaders of Western nations emphasized to Russia that there would be “dire warnings” should they proceed with invading Ukraine.

Fearing for the safety of their citizens, Germany and Austria ordered their citizens to evacuate Ukraine and the German airline Lufthansa ceased to provide service to Kyiv and Odessa – both cities are at risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion.

The New York Times reported that despite not launching an invasion, Russian forces continue to launch shells into towns in eastern Ukraine. Residents of this area have subsequently fled.

Separatists in Ukraine’s eastern region asserted that Ukrainian leadership has been planning a large-scale offensive against them and their Russian allies.

The notion of a Ukrainian offensive has largely been dismissed by Western leaders as counterintuitive considering that Russian forces are currently surrounding the country.

At the Munich Security Conference, where Zelenskyy reaffirmed his dedication to diplomacy, Western leaders displayed a united front and repeated their calls for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.

Vice President Kamala Harris referred to the ongoing crisis as “a defining moment” for European security and the defense of democratic values.

Harris warned that if Russia were to invade Ukraine the United States and its allies would restrict Russia’s access to financial institutions, limit technology exports to the country, and target “those who are complicit and those who aid and direct this unprovoked invasion.”

She said, “Russia continues to claim it is ready for talks while at the same time it narrows the avenues for diplomacy. Their actions simply do not match their words.”

Despite many of the parties invested in the ongoing crisis insisting that diplomacy is the only way forward, the New York Times reported that President Joe Biden said that the United States has intelligence showing that Putin has made a final decision to reject diplomacy and invade Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-seeks-to-meet-with-putin-to-reach-a-diplomatic-resolution-to-the-ongoing-crisis,2022-02-19
Ukraine President Zelenskyy takes apparent shot at Biden over inaction in face of Russian aggression,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took an apparent shot at President Joe Biden on Saturday, telling members of Congress that inaction from the Biden administration in the face of Russian aggression enabled Russian President Vladimir Putin.

What are the details?

During a video conference attended by more than 280 members of the U.S. House and Senate, Zelenskyy claimed that Russia would not have invaded his country had the U.S. demonstrated its strength on the world stage.

""If you had started sanctions months ago, there would not have been war,"" Zelenskyy said.

Just days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion, the Biden administration defended its decision not to enact sanctions on Moscow despite clear warning signs of an impending invasion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed at the time that enacting sanctions would essentially mean the U.S. government was surrendering its leverage over Russia because sanctions are meant ""to try to deter Russia from going to war."" Obviously, withholding sanctions failed.

Still, in his call with American lawmakers, Zelenskyy urged the U.S. government to issue increasingly harsh sanctions against Moscow, including a ban on Russian oil, and pleaded the U.S. to help Ukraine secure more fighter jets for its air force.

""He said repeatedly that an embargo on Russia and particularly their oil and natural gas, was absolutely critical,"" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) later told Fox News.

According to the Washington Post, Zelenskyy stopped short of calling for an outright no-fly zone, but repeatedly said that victory for Ukraine would mean winning the air war.

""Ukraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelensky’s message is simple: ‘close the skies or give us planes,'"" Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement after the call.

How is the US responding?

The Biden administration has thus far refused to ban imports of Russian oil, citing domestic energy needs and skyrocketing gas prices.

However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support cutting off Russian oil. ""Ban it,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week, while Sen. Dick Durban, the No. 2 Senate Democrat said, ""It just infuriates me to think that we are dependent on Russian gas and oil.""

Blinken finally said on Sunday the Biden administration is considering banning Russian oil, just one day after Axios reported that Biden officials had pressured Senate Democrats not to support bipartisan legislation that would ban imports of Russian oil.

Meanwhile, Blinken revealed Sunday NATO has received the ""green light"" to send more fighter jets to Ukraine, but a no-fly zone remains out of the question over fears it would further escalate the war.

Putin has said that imposing a no-fly zone would be viewed by Moscow as participation in the war.

Ukrainian officials 'stunned' by Biden's weak response on Russia: He just gave Putin the 'green light to enter Ukraine at his pleasure',"President Joe Biden raised alarm bells in Ukraine Wednesday after he appeared to downplay a potential ""minor incursion"" by Russia in the coming days or weeks, sowing doubts as to whether the U.S. and NATO allies will respond with force if Russia were to invade the neighboring country.

""I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does, it's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,"" Biden told reporters during a long, rambling East Room news conference.

""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine,"" he added, though his passive words didn't inspire confidence.

Later in the news conference, the president strangely predicted that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will move in"" because ""he has to do something.""

Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine over the last several weeks but has repeatedly denied that it is planning to invade.

What was the reaction in Ukraine?

In response to Biden's remarks Wednesday, CNN senior intelligence correspondent Matthew Chance read directly from his prepared notes to relay that one Ukrainian official was ""shocked that President Biden would give a green light to Vladimir Putin in this way.""

That official reportedly added, “It gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,"" Chance told network anchor Jake Tapper.

According to Chance, another Ukrainian official remarked that Kyiv, referring to Ukraine's government, ""is stunned at what President Biden had to say.""

What else?

The two anonymous officials were soon joined in their rebuke of Biden by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

In a tweet Thursday morning, Zelensky said, ""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones. I say this as the President of a great power.""

USA Today called the statement a ""remarkable retort from a close U.S. ally that has received millions of dollars in military assistance.""

Kuleba similarly admonished Biden in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, arguing that the president's half-hearted warning leaves open a window for Putin.

“Speaking of minor and full incursions or full invasion, you cannot be half-aggressive. You’re either aggressive or you’re not aggressive,” Kuleba said. “We should not give Putin the slightest chance to play with quasi-aggression or small incursion operations. This aggression was there since 2014. This is the fact.”

Anything else?

The White House quickly tried to clean up the mess in a subsequent clarification of Biden's remarks.

""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Wednesday evening.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-response-biden-green-light-putin,2022-01-20
Ukrainian sailor partially sinks yacht owned by Russian oligarch boss before returning to Ukraine to fight for his country,"A Ukrainian sailor on the Spanish island of Majorca was arrested over the weekend after he tried to sink his Russian boss' yacht to carry out revenge against the Kremlin — now he plans to return to Ukraine to fight for his country.

What are the details?

Taras Ostapchuk, 55, allegedly caused severe damage to the oligarch's $7.7 million luxury vessel on Saturday by opening up its valves causing it to partially sink, according to local Spanish outlet Ultima Hora and English language newspaper the Majorca Daily Bulletin.

The 156-foot yacht, called Lady Anastasia, is reportedly owned by Alexander Mijeev, a Russian arms dealer who formerly led the Russian Helicopter Corporation before taking over Rostec, a Russian state-owned weapons supplier.

To carry out his revenge plan, Ostapchuk opened a large valve in the engine room and a second in another compartment where the crew resides before instructing three other crew members, all of who are Ukrainians, to abandon the ship.

When police arrived, the defiant sailor reportedly told them: ""My boss is a criminal who sells weapons that kill the Ukrainian people.""

The unrepentant mechanical engineer later told a judge, ""I don't regret anything I've done and I would do it again.""

Ostapchuk reportedly decided to sink the ship after watching a video of Russian forces attacking an apartment building in Ukraine, killing or injuring civilians, and that he only intended to inflict material damage.



He recalled that he lived ""in a very similar building"" as the one Russian forces targeted. ""From my window I see the parliament of Ukraine. I wondered what would happen to my house, because it is located in a similar position.""

What else?

Incensed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, Ostapchuk now plans to return to Ukraine to defend his homeland.

In an interview following his release, the engineer told Ultima Hora, ""As soon as I reach the first city in Ukraine, I will find a military commander and ask him if they need me.""

""I said to myself: Why do I need a job if I don't have my country?"" he continued. ""Yes, it's true, I had a good job as chief mechanic on the ship and a good salary, but I'm going to fight for my country. I've lost my job, but that's not a problem. I will not lose my country.""

Reflecting on his partially failed attempt to sink the Lady Anastasia, he said, ""I lost the first battle, which was to sink the Russian chief's ship, but I will win the next one.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-sailor-partially-sinks-russian-yacht,2022-02-28
Cheerful Ukrainian soldier's video message to Russians goes viral: 'We'll soon start kicking your ass',"A cheerful message from a Ukrainian soldier to Russian soldiers went viral as the invasion force came closer to attacking the capital city of Kyiv.

The unidentified soldier smiles and laughs as he casually threatens the Russians invading his country on the order of President Vladimir Putin.

""I'll record this in Russian to make it be f***ing clearer,"" says the soldier to the camera.

""Well guys, what's up? What, is the Ukrainian night quiet? As the great Ukrainian writer Gogol said? Is everything good with you kids? Do you like our Bayraktars?"" he said, referring to an unmanned aerial vehicle made by Turkey.

The video was widely circulated online in the original language:

""What do you think — what's flying above you right now? What do you think — what is rustling in the bushes, my guys? What thoughts do you have about that?"" he said, smiling.

""What the f*** could it be? Dudes, you are f***ed!"" he added.

""You've stopped for now. We're fine. We're pulling up our reserves. We have aviation and we have tanks! We've got everything! Your ass is ours, fellows!"" he continues.

""How about this... why don't you f***ing surrender while you still have that chance? Many of yours have already chosen that path, it's not that bad, really,"" says the soldier.

""It may be a mistake, but we treat prisoners of war fairly well. So you are stuck right now, and soon we'll start kicking your ass! And we'll start doing it right now!"" he says.

""Therefore, use your last chance!"" the soldier concludes.

The video was edited with subtitles translated into English, but with the expletives uncensored. The untranslated video garnered more than 350,000 views, while the subtitled video pulled in more than a million views in a few hours.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that it was likely Russian forces would try to take the capital city of Kyiv Saturday morning. The U.S. State Dept. said he was offered assistance to leave the country, but he refused.

"'F*** you, b***h': Ukrainian UFC fighter has pointed message for Vladimir Putin and his Russian regime for invading her country","A Ukrainian UFC fighter who has family facing down tanks and missiles amid Russia's invasion of her home country gave Vladimir Putin a pointed piece of her mind in an interview with TMZ Sports.

""F*** you, bitch,"" Maryna Moroz said when asked what she'd like to say to the Russian president and his regime. ""I love my country. Don't touch Ukraine.""

What are the details?

Moroz, 30, is scheduled to fight Mariya Agapova — an MMA fighter from Kazakhstan — Saturday night at UFC 272, TMZ Sports said.

While the event is to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, understandably much of Moroz's heart and mind is focused on what's happening in her home country.

""It's hard time for Ukraine,"" she said, adding, ""I want to support my country, my president, whole army in Ukraine, and I want to say we don't want war. ... I worry about my family right now in Ukraine.""

Moroz was born in Vilnohirsk, Ukraine, in September 1991, which TMZ Sports said is about the same time Ukraine gained its independence amid the collapse of the Soviet Union.

And with Ukraine's autonomy now threatened, Moroz is deeply concerned.

""Many people die right now,"" she said, lamenting the increasingly ""dangerous"" situation in Ukraine.

In fact, she said her father has been making homemade grenades for protection and to fight back against advancing Russian forces.

Moroz added to TMZ Sports that she tries to call home ""every couple of hours"" but that it's difficult to stay in touch.

What this fight means to her

Despite the hardships in Ukraine, Moroz also has a job to do Saturday — and that's to beat Agapova.

In a way, she knows she'll be fighting for her country.

""I want to show Ukraine girl strong"" and that we ""don't stand back."" She added that she'll be ""fighting"" to ""show that Ukraine people [are] strong, and my flag will be in [the] Octagon.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-ufc-fighter-pointed-message-for-putin-russian-regime,2022-03-01
'Nothing has changed': Ukrainian official says Russia has not withdrawn troops from border after talks with Biden,"There has been no change in the Russian buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine since U.S. President Joe Biden's much-hyped video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Ukrainian security official said Wednesday.

According to Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security and Defence Council, there are still 92,000 Russian troops at the border, but there's no indication that Russia has imminent plans to invade.

Danilov told Reuters in an interview that the Ukrainian government is still concerned about the military build-up and that there has been no big change since the Dec. 7 meeting between the U.S. and Russia, when Biden threatened severe retaliatory economic sanctions should Putin choose to start a war.

""Nothing has changed,"" Danilov said. ""There has been some [increase in troop numbers] but not critical enough for us to say: this is it, it [an invasion] is going to happen now.""

He estimated that Russia would need at least 500,000-600,000 soldiers at the border ""in order to keep the situation under control in the event of an offensive.""

Danilov also said that Russia could deploy additional troops very quickly at any time, but would need more than 24 hours to bring those troops to the border to mount an invasion.

In the event of war, Ukraine hopes that its Western allies, including the United States, will keep it supplied with weapons, he said.

The world is watching Russia, which for months now has built up troops on its border with Ukraine in what the country says are ""military exercises."" News reports have shown Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.

A U.S. intelligence report from earlier this month claimed that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine that could begin as early as next year and involve as many as 175,000 soldiers.

Russia previously annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine in 2014, though Moscow now denies having any intention of invading or seizing more territory, accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of engaging in destabilizing behavior.



Putin has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance. He has also called on the U.S. and other Western countries to cease military activity near Russia's border. European Union leaders in turn have threatened more economic sanctions against Russia if it attempts military expansion into Ukraine.

The eastern region of Ukraine is mired in civil war, where pro-Russian separatists supported by Moscow are fighting the pro-western Ukrainian government. Danilov said the government has no intention of escalating the conflict by sending more troops to retake control of the region.

Danilov also said Ukraine must be a party to any discussion of its membership in NATO.

""We will not take orders from anyone, we will not tolerate any tsar, we are a different kind of people,"" he said.

""Is compromise possible? Yes, it is possible, but not at the expense of our independence and our country.""

Following their Dec. 7 video conference, Biden and Putin have agreed to hold more talks to discuss tensions with Ukraine and other issues. The Kremlin said there continue to be very serious differences between Russia and the United States over Moscow's ""red lines"" which it says the West must not cross.

Putin expressed interest in meeting with Biden in person, though the Russian government has not said when such a meeting could take place, Reuters reports.

UN experts say the world will face a global famine of ‘biblical proportions’ due to COVID-19 pandemic,"The United Nations warns that the COVID-19 pandemic is on the cusp of causing global famines of ""biblical proportions.""

What are the details?

According to CNN, the famines will affect the world in a matter of months and will likely push an already coronavirus-struck population of 130 million people to the brink of starvation.

In a Tuesday address, David Beasley — the executive director of the World Food Programme — told the UN Security Council during a video conference that widespread famines could affect ""about three dozen countries"" in the coming months.

CNN reported that Beasley — a former Republican South Carolina governor — cited ""conflict, an economic recession, a decline in aid, and a collapse in oil prices"" as factors that could lead to massive food shortages.

""While dealing with a COVID-19 pandemic, we are also on the brink of a hunger pandemic,"" Beasley said. ""There is also a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of COVID-19 than from the virus itself.""

A report from the agency identified at least 55 countries around the world that are at elevated risk of famine due to the virus.

A portion of the report read, ""These countries may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods, or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger.""

What countries will most likely be impacted?

Those countries include:

Afghanistan

Democratic Republic of the Congo

Ethiopia

Haiti

Nigeria

South Sudan

Sudan

Syria

Venezuela

Yemen

CNN reported that while those countries have been mostly spared from the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic when compared to places like China, Italy, and North America, the countries' food supply was previously being impacted by locust swarms and crop failure.

""Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019,"" the outlet added. ""These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years, which further threatened the crop supply in the region.""

Beasley added that other measures — such as lockdowns and recessions — will also lead to a ""major loss of income among the working poor"" around the world.

""The loss of tourism receipts will damage countries such as Ethiopia [and] the collapsing oil prices in lower-income countries like South Sudan will have an impact significantly,"" he pointed out.

""There are no famines yet. But I must warn you that if we don't prepare and act now — to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls, and disruptions to trade — we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a few short months,"" he added.

""The truth is,"" he concluded, ""we do not have time on our side, so let's act wisely — and let's act fast. I do believe that with our expertise and partnerships, we can bring together the terms and the programs necessary to make certain the COVID-19 pandemic does not become a humanitarian and food crisis catastrophe.""

Anything else?

Beasley told the Guardian that famine is more than just hunger.

""We are not talking about people going to bed hungry,"" he said. ""We are talking about extreme conditions, emergency status – people literally marching to the brink of starvation. If we don't get food to people, people will die.""

He added, ""This is truly more than just a pandemic — it is creating a hunger pandemic. This is a humanitarian and food catastrophe.""

UN tells staff to avoid using terms 'war' and 'invasion' to describe Putin's war in Ukraine,"The words ""war"" and ""invasion"" are apparently too politically incorrect for the United Nations, which has instructed staff to avoid using those terms in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Instead, the U.N. communications department would like staff to use terms such as ""conflict"" or ""military offensive"" to describe the nearly universally condemned war of aggression waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin against his country's smaller neighbor. Employees were also asked to refrain from describing the conflict as a war and from adding the Ukrainian flag to their personal or official social media accounts or websites.

“[USE] ‘conflict’ or ‘military offensive’ and NOT ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ when referring to the situation in Ukraine,” an email reported by the Irish Times stated. “Do NOT add the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites.""



The instructions were given to avoid harming the international body's reputation by offending Russia, which has killed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and forced 2 million people to flee the country.

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email stated. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

Teachta Dala Neale Richmond, spokesman on European affairs for Ireland's Fine Gael party, blasted the ""illegal war of aggression"" and called on the U.N. to condemn Russia in a statement to the Irish Times.

“The fact is just because Russia is a big country that has an essential role in the UN, they’re influencing policy in a direction that’s simply false,” he said, referring to how Russia holds one of five permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.

""Quite clearly this is not just any war, but an illegal war of aggression, that should be condemned from a height by all members of the U.N. and the U.N. itself,"" he added.

Russian officials refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation,"" using Putin's preferred euphemism for the war. Putin's government has severely restricted what Russian media outlets are allowed to report about the war with a new law enacted Friday that could put journalists in prison for up to 15 years if they publish any stories the government considers ""fake.""

Thousands of Russian anti-war protesters have also been arrested, two local independent broadcasters were closed down, and international media websites have been blocked in the country.

US accuses Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda. Website fires back at 'hit piece.',"U.S. intelligence officials have accused the libertarian-leaning financial website Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda, though the website vigorously denies the accusation.

Anonymous officials who spoke with the Associated Press on Tuesday alleged that Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million readers, published articles created by Moscow-controlled media. The officials pointed to multiple articles that criticized U.S. warnings about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Some of those articles were authored by people affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation, a group sanctioned by the Biden administration last year for allegedly participating in Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. election, according to the AP. The officials said the foundation's leadership takes direction from the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service.

Recent Zero Hedge articles cited by the AP include the headlines: “NATO Sliding Towards War Against Russia In Ukraine,” “Americans Need A Conspiracy Theory They Can All Agree On,” and “Theater Of Absurd... Pentagon Demands Russia Explain Troops On Russian Soil.”



In a written response published Tuesday, Zero Hedge called the AP article a ""hit piece"" and said it has ""been singled out for pursuing non-establishment groupthink.""

""Well, now we've done it — we've angered the CIA, and for what? For publishing views that challenge the conventional narrative,"" Zero Hedge wrote.

The post noted that there is ""no actual accusation that Zero Hedge works directly with anyone tied to Russia or its intelligence apparatus."" The officials quoted by the AP did not say whether they believed Zero Hedge knew of any alleged links to spy agencies and they did not allege a direct link between the website and Russia.



Zero Hedge told the AP it seeks to “publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.”



""[T]his website has never worked, collaborated or cooperated with Russia, nor are there any links to spy (or any other) agencies,"" Zero Hedge emphasized in its response.

Zero Hedge said that the Strategic Culture Foundation ""periodically guest posts on its website along with hundreds of other sources of alternative information."" The website added that one of the main writers for the foundation, Alastair Crooke, is ""a former high ranking MI6 figure and UK diplomat, i.e., a former British spook.""



""Perhaps he is now a double agent working for Putin after spending decades spying for the UK?” Zero Hedge wrote.

Zero Hedge told the AP the Strategic Culture Foundation is ""one of our hundreds of contributors — unlike Mainstream Media, we try to publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.""

The intelligence officials said three other websites have ties to the FSB, Russia's federal security service.

“These sites enable the Russian government to secure support among the Russian and Ukrainian populations,” one official said. “This is the primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-accuses-zero-hedge-of-spreading-russian-propaganda,2022-02-15
US airports hit with cyberattacks; Russian hacker group suspected culprit,"Over a dozen major national airports reported cyberattacks on Monday that caused public-facing websites to go offline. According to a senior official briefed on the situation, a Russian hacker group is believed to be behind the incident.



The attacks did not impact any internal communications or transportation security. The source told ABC News, ""It's an inconvenience.""

Websites for Des Moines International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport were impacted on Monday morning.

The ""denial of service"" attack meant that customers could not view wait times and congestion information on the airports' public-facing web domains.

""Early this morning, the FlyLAX.com website was partially disrupted,"" LAX told ABC News. ""The service interruption was limited to portions of the public facing FlyLAX.com website only. No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions.""

""We noticed this morning that the external website was down, and our IT and security people are in the process of investigating,"" Andrew Gobeil, a spokesman for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, told WAGA-TV. ""There has been no impact on operations.""

All of the impacted airports reported that the websites have since been restored.

John Hultquist, head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told ABC News that over a dozen airport websites were targeted. The attackers were able to cause a ""denial of public access"" error by overloading the websites with artificial users.

Hultquist said the pro-Russian hacker group ""Killnet"" was believed to be behind the attacks. The group has been active since the invasion of Ukraine and is focused on targeting Ukraine's allies.

Recently, the pro-Russian group Killnet took credit for taking down U.S. government websites in Kentucky, Florida, Alabama, and Indiana. The group was previously confirmed to have hacked a U.S. Congress website and organizations in Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Italy, and Estonia.

Hultquist noted that groups similar to Killnet have turned out to be fronts for state-backed actors but explained that there was no evidence to suggest the Russian government was involved in the Monday cyberattacks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-airports-hit-with-cyberattacks-russian-hacker-group-suspected-culprit,2022-10-10
"While Ukraine fights to defend itself from one of the world's largest armies, the US Army is training its officers on gender identity","While much of Ukraine fights for its continued freedom, some U.S. soldiers are being made to learn about gender identity and preferred pronouns, the Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

An official Army presentation on the subject, purportedly obtained by the outlet through a military whistleblower, was titled ""Policy on the Military Service of Transgender Persons and Persons with Gender Dysphoria"" and aimed to help train officers on how to teach subordinates materials related to gender dysphoria and transgenderism in the U.S. Army.

The unnamed whistleblower, the outlet reported, was a ""high-ranking officer in the Army Special Forces.""

The outlet reported the mandatory program ""offers several hypothetical scenarios for how soldiers should be treated if they are transgender or in some stage of transitioning to another gender.""

Under one scenario contained in the training guide, a ""soldier who was assigned male at birth says he identifies as a female,"" ""lives as a female in his off-duty hours,"" and ""is not requesting to be treated as a female while on duty.""

In such a case, according to the slides, the outlet reports that the soldier ought to be ""treated with dignity and respect and no further action is required.""

If the soldier in question, however, requests at any point to be identified as female during duty hours or appears to be experiencing ""increased distress"" relating to gender dysphoria, the commanding officer is required to ""inform [the] soldier of the Army's transgender policy and recommend that he sees a military medical provider.""

""Gender transition in the Army,"" the presentation added, ""begins when a soldier receives a diagnosis from a military medical provider indicating that gender transition is medically necessary.""

Another scenario addresses a female service member who tells her first sergeant that she identifies as male and would prefer to be treated as such. The soldier in the scenario has not yet seen a military medical provider for the condition.

At that point, Army leaders are required to inform the soldier that the U.S. military ""recognizes a soldier's gender by the soldier's gender marking in DEERs,"" or the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, a massive database that tracks military members.

""The soldier, according to the presentation, will be expected to meet the uniform, grooming, and physical readiness standards associated with their recognized gender,"" the outlet added, and noted that the soldier in question would then be sent to a military medical provider who is able to determine whether ""gender transition is medically necessary"" at that point.

What else?

A spokesperson for the Army told the outlet that the slides in question are part of a required training and are taken from a program ""used to train Army personnel on the recent changes to the DoD and Army transgender service policy.""

The spokesperson added that all Army personnel are required to participate in the training by Sept. 30, 2022.

""We remain committed to treating all soldiers with dignity and respect while ensuring good order and discipline,"" the spokesperson added. ""Soldiers who meet those standards can serve openly in their self-identified gender.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-army-is-training-its-officers-on-gender-identity,2022-03-01
US citizens across the country are receiving mysterious packets of seeds from unknown Chinese mailers: report,"Residents across several U.S. states have reportedly been receiving seeds of unknown origin from unidentified Chinese senders.

What are the details?

States impacted by the mysterious seeds include Arizona, Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana, Virginia, Washington, Utah, and more.

Fox News and other outlets report that many of the packages appear to contain jewelry — but there is no jewelry inside the parcel.

On Friday, the Virginia Department of Agriculture tweeted, ""Public Asked To Report Receipt of any Unsolicited Packages of Seeds.""

The Virginia Department of Agriculture added, ""The types of seeds in the packages are unknown at this time and may be invasive plant species. The packages were sent by mail and may have Chinese writing on them.""

Further, the department noted, ""The seeds are sent in packages usually stating that the contents are jewelry. Unsolicited seeds could be invasive, introduce diseases to local plants, or be harmful to livestock.""

The Washington State Department of Agriculture issued a similar warning, writing, ""We have received reports of people receiving seeds from China that they did not order. If you receive them - don't plant them.""

The department added, ""Invasive species wreak havoc on the environment, displace or destroy native plants and insects and severely damage crops. Taking steps to prevent their introduction is the most effective method of reducing both the risk of invasive species infestations and the cost to control and mitigate those infestations.""

'It's kind of scary'

In Utah, Department of Agriculture is investigating the incidents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Jane Rupp, president of BBB's Utah chapter, told KSTU-TV that the seeds could be part of what's called a ""brushing"" scam.

""That is rather random. I don't think I've heard of seeds before,"" Rupp said. ""The first thing to do is Google your address and see what's out there… Numerous things will come up when you Google your address. It's kind of scary sometimes.""

The Kansas Department of Agriculture as well as the Arizona Department of Agriculture released statements about the seeds.

""Unsolicited packages of seeds have been received by people in several other states across the United States over the last several days,"" Kansas agricultural officials wrote in a statement.

Mike Strain, Commissioner of Louisiana's Agriculture and Forestry Department, also warned of the possibility of invasive species.

""Right now, we are uncertain what types of seeds are in the package,"" Strain said. ""Out of caution, we are urging anyone who receives a package that was not ordered by the recipient, to please call the LDAF immediately. We need to identify the seeds to ensure they do not pose a risk to Louisiana's agricultural industry or the environment.""

The Daily Mail also reports that similar instances have taken place across the U.K. over the last week.

Officials are at a loss, but speculate that the seeds may be of an invasive plant species and advise residents not to use them.

US Marine killed in Ukraine fighting Russian invasion,"U.S. citizen Willy Joseph Cancel was killed in Ukraine on Monday while fighting alongside Ukrainian troops against invading Russian forces, family members confirm. ""He appears to be the first U.S. citizen to die while fighting alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine,"" Fox News reported.

Cancel – a 22-year-old former U.S. Marine – leaves behind a wife and a 7-month-old baby.

""He went there wanting to help people, he had always felt that that was his main mission in life,"" Brittany Cancel – the widow of the American citizen who died in Ukraine – told Fox News.

""My husband was very brave and a hero,"" Cancel stated. ""I did not expect to be a widow at 23 years old or for our son to be without a father.""

Cancel's mother – Rebecca Cabrera – told CNN, ""He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it.""

""It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,"" Cabrera added. ""He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.""

Devin Tietze Jr. – Cancel's brother-in-law – told CNN, ""He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine.""

Cancel was a correctional officer before going to Ukraine to help fight against the Russian invasion.

""Prior to wanting to help the effort in Ukraine, he was a detention officer in Kentucky,"" the widow told Fox News. ""He had dreams and aspirations of being a police officer or joining FDNY. Naturally, when he found out about what was happening in Ukraine he was eager to volunteer.""

Cancel was hired by a private military contracting company to fight against Russians in Ukraine.

Cancel flew to Poland on March 12 and arrived in Ukraine the next day, according to Cabrera. His mother said Cancel was fighting alongside soldiers from ""all different countries.""



Cabrera said, ""They haven't found his body. They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.""

Cancel's widow pleaded, ""All I want is for him to come home, and to give him the proper burial he deserves.""



How Cancel was killed in Ukraine is not clear at this time.

An official with the U.S. Department of State told NBC News on Friday that officials ""are aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation.""



""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,"" the official said. ""We once again reiterate U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.""

Cabrera said of her son, ""He was just a really thoughtful person. He always put everybody ahead of himself even when situations were so stressful. He always kept everybody laughing and calm. He was the man that stood up when everybody else stood back.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry created a special unit consisting of foreign fighters known as the ""International Legion."" Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov – commander of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry – claimed that more than 20,000 volunteers and veterans from 52 countries have expressed interest in joining the unit, CNN reported on March 7.

US Marshals track down man wanted for torturing his ex-girlfriend only to find suspect riddled with bullets,"Authorities have been looking for Dekenta Parchman since late July for having allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted his ex-girlfriend at her Van Buren Township apartment in Michigan. When U.S. Marshals ultimately tracked him down on August 9, they found the 30-year-old suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.

""I got shot seven times Sunday and I still got bullets in me that they're supposed to get out. ... My leg's broke,"" he told the court in Wayne County.

Police attribute Parchman's seven wounds to a shootout in Inkster, though indicated they have not yet identified the person or persons responsible.

Parchman survived his wounds to face nine felony charges including assault with a dangerous weapon, unlawful possession of a firearm, aggravated domestic violence, and torture. He is due back in court on August 11. His bail has been set at $250,000.

Man charged with torture, sex assaults found shot 7 times a week later Fox 2 - YouTube





Approximately a week prior to his latest arrest, Parchman is said to have shown up, intoxicated, at his ex-girlfriend's house. Once inside, he immediately began to punch her in the face. Fox 2 reported that he proceeded to hammer her over the head with ashtrays and then violate her with a hot hair straightener. He allegedly continued to beat her for hours, before the victim managed to escape and call police at a neighbor's house.



Before police arrived on the scene, Parchman allegedly stole the victim's car and took off.

The victim reportedly spent several days in hospital and is still recovering.

In 2012, Parchman was convicted of first-degree home invasion and unlawful imprisonment, for which he was sentenced to five and a half to 20 years' imprisonment and four to 15 years' imprisonment, respectively. Granted his recent alleged crimes, it appears that he served no more than the minimum amount of jail time demanded by the court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-marshals-find-suspected-torturer-riddled-with-bullets,2022-08-10
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declines US evacuation offer,"The U.S. government reportedly made Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy an offer that most politicians wouldn't refuse. However, Zelenskyy allegedly showed that he isn't like most world leaders.

As Russian military forces invaded Ukraine this week, the U.S. government offered to evacuate Zelenskyy out of harm's way. Despite understanding that his defense was severely outgunned by Russia – one of the strongest militaries in the world – and Vladimir Putin intent on ""decapitating"" the current Ukraine government, Zelenskyy refused to desert his fellow countrymen.

Zelenskyy declined the offer to flee.

""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" an ""upbeat"" Zelenskyy said, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, the Associated Press reported.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday that Zelenskyy remains a ""prime target for Russian aggression.""

Zelenskyy – who traded in his suits for green military fatigues and kevlar – has stayed in Ukraine's capital city as the Russian forces march towards Kyiv.

According to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, ""the bulk"" of Russian forces are roughly 20 miles from the heart of Kyiv as of Saturday morning.

In a video posted on Saturday morning, Zelenskyy delivered a defiant message to the people of Ukraine as the Russian invasion wages on.

""I am here. We are not putting down arms. We will be defending our country, because our weapon is truth, and our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will defend all of this,"" Zelenskyy said in the video captioned: ""Do not believe the fakes.""



""That is it. That's all I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine,"" the actor-turned-leader concluded.



Also on Saturday, Zelenskyy issued a press briefing that the Ukrainians will prevail in the war against Russia.

""Our military, our national guard, our national police, our territory defense, special service, nationals of Ukraine, please carry on. We will win. Glory to Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said.

""The occupiers wanted to set up their puppet in our capital. They didn’t succeed,"" he continued. ""On our streets, there was a proper fight going on.""

""The enemy was using all its weapons, artillery, paratroops, all its weapons. They are hitting residential areas, they are trying to destroy energy infrastructure, and everyone should help us to stop this occupation,"" Zelenskyy declared.



The 44-year-old Ukrainian president also called on ""friends"" of Ukraine to help them defeat the Russians.

""Everyone who can defend Ukraine abroad please do it directly in a united way,"" he said, according to Sky News. ""Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country please come over, we will give you weapons.""

On Saturday afternoon, Zelenskyy thanked Germany for sending military aid to Ukraine.

""The Russian attack marks a turning point. It is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of [Vladimir] Putin,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Saturday.

Germany will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles, which bypasses the nation's long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones.

On Saturday, the United States pledged to send $350 million in military aid to Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-offers-to-evacuate-ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-he-responds-i-need-ammunition-not-a-ride,2022-02-26
"US Senate predicted to approve Finland and Sweden’s request to join NATO – Sen. Hawley says ‘I intend to vote no,’ receives backlash from Sen. Cruz and Sen. Rubio","The U.S. Senate voted today on a resolution to ratify Finland and Sweden's applications to join NATO. The request has largely received bi-partisan support and was expected to pass through the Senate easily.



Finland and Sweden requested to join following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Putin reportedly stated that the two countries could ""join whatever they want."" However, Putin also warned that ""if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, [Russia] would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for [them.]""

After applying for membership, the Nordic countries were met with resistance from Turkey, which alleged that Finland and Sweden supported groups Turkey had designated as terrorists. Since then, the three countries came to an agreement and signed an accord to allow the application to move forward.

Referring to today's vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, ""The NATO vote is a very important vote for American security around the world. Finland's and Sweden's membership will strengthen NATO even further, and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression.""



While most senators have voiced support for the two countries joining NATO, Senator Josh Hawley recently wrote an op-ed explaining why he would not be voting for the ratification. Hawley explained that if the vote passed, ""According to the terms of NATO's founding treaty, that means the United States would be obliged to defend both countries in the event of a military attack. I intend to vote no.""

Hawley expressed concern that America is not in a position to commit to protecting another country. He wrote, ""When it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.""

The Missouri senator mentioned that European countries are not paying their fair share regarding defense responsibilities. He called on them to invest more in national defense to alleviate costs for the United States. ""All the way back in 2006, NATO member states pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on national defense. It should be higher. The United States spends far more than that on defense. But many NATO members still haven't met even this minimal commitment,"" Hawley noted.

In an interview with Politico, Senator Ted Cruz disagreed with Hawley's points. Cruz argued, ""We don't beat China by retreating from the rest of the world. We beat China by standing with our allies against our enemies.""

Yesterday, Senator Marco Rubio wrote an op-ed in reply to Hawley's. In it, Rubio claimed, ""NATO would be stronger with Finland and Sweden. And while President Joe Biden's record is proof that weakness invites aggression and breeds chaos, the converse is also true. As Ronald Reagan would say, peace comes through strength.""

Rubio argued that by adding Finland and Sweden to NATO, America would have more resources to defend itself against the People's Republic of China.

On July 5, all 30 NATO members signed an accession protocol, granting Sweden and Finland the ability to join the alliance. Since the accession was signed, the two Nordic countries have been allowed to participate in some meetings.

However, the decision must first be ratified by all 30 parliaments before the two countries can become official members. The ratification process could take up to a year, at which point, the defense clause will protect them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-senate-predicted-to-approve-finland-and-sweden-s-request-to-join-nato-sen-hawley-says-i-intend-to-vote-no-receives-backlash-from-sen-cruz-and-sen-rubio,2022-08-03
"Amid roaring inflation, US spends big bucks to help Ukraine","As Americans endure the painful financial consequences of raging inflation, the U.S. continues spending massive sums of money to help Ukraine defend itself against a brutal Russian invasion.

""President Biden has been clear we will support the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted in a Thursday statement.

""Pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our twenty-first drawdown of U.S. arms and equipment for Ukraine since September 2021. This $600 million drawdown includes additional arms, munitions, and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories. This drawdown will bring the total U.S. military assistance for Ukraine to approximately $15.8 billion since the beginning of this Administration,"" Blinken said.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a consumer price index report that showed inflation remains quite hot in the U.S. ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller figure than the 8.5- percent increase for the period ending July,"" the BLS noted.

In a tweet on Sunday, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia noted that she has not spoken to anyone advocating for the U.S. to shell out billions more for Ukraine. ""I have not talked to a single person asking to send more billions to Ukraine. Not one,"" she tweeted.

GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky responded by noting, ""All calls and conversations I've had are with people who want us to stop sending their money to Ukraine.""

""No country is entitled to receive tax dollars from hard working Americans,"" Massie tweeted on Monday. ""But what about country _______ ? Send them your own money.""

Some lawmakers have been pushing for the U.S. to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who along with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced a measure to do just that, has called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a terrorist."" Currently, the only nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism include Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-spends-billons-assist-ukraine,2022-09-16
"US tourist slips into crater at Mount Vesuvius after taking selfie, lives to tell the tale","Philip Carroll, 23, of Maryland is one lucky guy. He slipped and fell into the crater at Mt. Vesuvius after taking a selfie and walked away with just some scratches and bruises.

According to reports, Carroll and two family members were vacationing in Italy last Saturday when they decided to hike Mt. Vesuvius, the infamous volcano that leveled the city of Pompeii back in 79 A.D. The three began their hike at the nearby town of Ottaviano and elected to take a trail closed to tourists and clearly marked with a gate and ""no access"" signs.

Once they reached the summit of the crater, which is about 4,000 feet high and 1,500 feet in diameter, Carroll accidentally dropped his phone after taking a selfie, and the phone fell a few meters into the crater. When he went to retrieve it, he slid ""a few meters"" himself and could not climb back out.

“He tried to recover it, but slipped and slid a few meters into the crater,"" said Paolo Cappelli, the president of the Presidio Permanente Vesuvio based at the top of the crater. ""He managed to stop his fall, but at that point he was stuck.

""He was very lucky. If he kept going, he would have plunged 300 meters into the crater,” Cappelli added.

Fortunately, some guides on the other side of the crater witnessed Carroll's fall through binoculars and raced over to help. They managed to rescue him by throwing him a rope and pulling him up and out of the hole.

According to NBC News, someone who appears to be Carroll's brother posted a video from the summit on Instagram on Sunday. On the video, a person off camera can be heard yelling, ""We hiked to the top of a literal f------ volcano!""

After Carroll was treated for his injuries, he was taken into police custody at Carabinieri. The charges he faces remain unclear; however, MSN reports that he may be charged with ""invasion of public land"" for accessing a trail that had been closed off to the public.

Vesuvius is still an active volcano and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted in the last one hundred years. There was a major eruption in March 1944, which destroyed many villages. However, major eruptions occur only once every few thousand years, and the area around Vesuvius is now heavily populated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-tourist-slips-vesuvius-selfie,2022-07-12
US: Russia is compiling lists of Ukrainians 'to be killed or sent to camps' following invasion,"Russian forces are now compiling lists of identiable Ukrainian citizens that they plan to kill or send to prison camps following an impending military invasion, the United States government warned in a letter to the United Nations on Sunday.

What are the details?

In the letter, addressed to the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, the U.S. warned it has ""credible information"" that Moscow plans to carry out widespread and preplanned targeted killings, forced disappearances, and torture in the Eastern European country — abuses that would amount to a ""human rights catastrophe.""

The Washington Post first obtained and reported on the letter. It has reportedly been verified by at least three high-ranking U.S. government officials.

""I would like to bring to your attention disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned,"" wrote Bathsheba Nell Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in the letter.

Crocker went on to say the violence would likely be directed at those who oppose Russia's actions, such as Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists, activists, and other ""vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons.""

""Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation,"" she said. ""We also have credible information that Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations.""



The letter did not divulge the nature of the intelligence reportedly obtained.

What else?

Speaking with reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov vehemently denied the letter's claims.

""Do you realize that this is an absolute canard, a lie? It is absolute fiction. There is no such list. It’s a fake,"" Peskov fumed, according to the Washington Post.

But the contents of the letter come as no surprise to experts. Russia's violent intimidation campaigns and human rights abuses are well understood, and Foreign Policy reported on Friday that U.S. agencies had recently become aware that Russia was planning to launch an aggressive arrest and assassination campaign.

Biden said last week he was ""convinced"" Russia had made a final decision to invade Ukraine, alleging the assault could happen in the ""coming days"" and would likely include an attack on the capital, Kyiv.

Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops along its border with Ukraine in recent months and has been threatening military action with increasing intensity of late.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-warns-of-russia-kill-lists-ukraine,2022-02-21
US will not target Russia energy sector with sanctions,"The U.S. and its allies will impose severe new economic sanctions on Russia Thursday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine — but a major sector of Russia's economy will be exempt from the punishing measures.

Politico first reported that the major government-owned Russian energy corporation Rosneft is not expected to be targeted in the new sanctions package. The Biden administration is reportedly concerned about global energy markets, as the price of crude oil reached its highest level since 2014 on Thursday because of Russia's war in Ukraine.

One senior administration official told Politico ""no option is off the table,"" but cautioned ""starting out with energy could actually benefit Putin and pad his pockets. Given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas will drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. And as we have said repeatedly on the record, on background [and] off the record, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not ours.”

President Joe Biden addressed the nation Thursday afternoon and announced the next round of sanctions against Russia, following actions the U.S. government took on Tuesday to target Russian financial institutions and members of the country's elite.

The president said new sanctions will target more Russian elites, top banks, and technology exports and will impose a ""severe cost"" to the Russian economy, ""both immediately and over time.""

“We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize a long-term impact on Russia and to minimize impact on the United States and our allies,"" Biden said.

But he added that the sanctions package is ""specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue"" and said his administration was ""closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption."" The president promised to release additional barrels of oil from U.S. reserves to head off surging energy prices.



Early Thursday, Putin sent troops into Ukraine from the north, east, and south and began attacking Ukrainian cities with airstrikes and precision-guided cruise missiles. A senior defense official told reporters that Russia plans to ""decapitate"" the Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, Politico reported.

Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with G-7 officials Thursday morning to negotiate the sanctions package.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine was condemned by U.S. lawmakers of both parties, who supported the president's use of sanctions against Russia.

“It is important Congress unite to punish and crush Putin and his cronies,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted. He said there is bipartisan support for sending emergency aid to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian military. He also called for a ""task force to aggressively pursue Putin and his inner circle regarding the extravagant lifestyle they have become accustomed to after stealing Russia blind.""

""If we do not treat Putin and his cronies as the war criminals they are, we will be making a huge mistake and sending the wrong message to other bad actors around the world,"" Graham said.



Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) said in a statement that Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine ""has brought into sharp focus the need to expel the current Kremlin leadership from the international community.""

But others called on Biden to go further. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said Biden ""must act now to hit Vladimir Putin where it hurts, beginning with Russia's energy sector.""

""The Biden administration should sanction Russian energy production to a halt, and help arm the Ukrainians to defend themselves. At the same time, the White House should reopen American energy production in full,"" said Hawley. ""This is the time to show Russia and the world that America will not reward aggression and it will not be dependent on its enemies.""

Vandals burn a 'General Lee' statue — and perhaps make a really big and embarrassing mistake in the process,"Vandals have egg on their face after defacing a statue of a World War II general — and not Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

What are the details?

A statue honoring Maj. Gen. William C. Lee, a World War II general who has been described as ""the father of the U.S. Army's airborne infantry,"" was set aflame last Thursday. The perpetrators are believed to have confused him with Gen. Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.

Gen. William Lee also helped to plan the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France.

""This is not a Civil War museum and this is not Robert E. Lee,"" Mark Johnson, who is the curator for the Maj. Gen. William C. Lee Airborne Museum, told WNCN-TV. ""This is General William C. Lee from United States Army Airborne from World War II.""

The attack on Lee's statue came at the museum honoring the WWII hero, which is situated outside the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, region.

In a Feb. 15 Facebook update, the museum detailed the incident, which took place on Feb. 14.

The post read:



The United States owes so much to our military forces and all five military branches are what has kept this country safe and free for all these years. The U.S. Army Airborne soldier is highly respected world wide. Then comes along some jerk punk (s) and he tries to burn the statue of WWII Major General William C. Lee ... the Father of the United States Airborne Army. Thursday evening about 2200 hours someone poured a flammable liquid over the white marble statue of Lee and set it on fire. The local fire department put out the flames but the damage is done. It scorched the statue mostly on the left side. You can see the burn marks in the marble where the jerk placed the remainder of the fuel container on the platform. The cleaning and repair possibilities process will begin soon. Local security cameras will be reviewed.

Johnson, who also spoke to the Daily Record about the incident, warned others from making the same foolhardy mistake.



""Just an alert to people who may be thinking about such things, this is the wrong general,"" he said. ""Complete different generation, complete different war, complete different everything. Everything is different.""

The Dunn Police Department is investigating the incident, and offering up to $1,000 to anyone with information on the crime.

Elderly veteran thwarts alleged home invasion with the help of his rescue dog and his gun,"A Vietnam veteran is especially thankful for his rescue dog after she alarmed him about an intruder to his home in Temple City, a suburb of Los Angeles.

James Hardan, 69, said that his 3-year-old dog, a Maltese named Angel, alerted him when she changed from her usual calm demeanor and woke him up about 5 a.m. Monday by jumping on his chest and running to the kitchen.

""Within about 30 seconds, she'd come back, jumped up on the bed, put her paws on my chest and started tapping and growling,"" Hardan told KCBS-TV.

He said that he realized she was growling at an intruder who was standing at the doorway of his bedroom. Hardan's wife was still sleeping in the bed next to him.

When the intruder walked into the bathroom, Hardan said that he rushed to go get his gun.

Hardan said he pushed the door open, pointed his gun at the man and said, ""Do not move. I will blow you away.""

He said that the intruder told him, ""I'm your son's friend,"" but Hardan kept him at gunpoint until police arrived. They arrested the 32-year-old on suspicion of burglary.

Hardan said that his time serving in the U.S. Army Special Forces kept him from pulling the trigger.

""The only thing that stopped me from pulling the trigger was the fact that I said, 'That could be somebody's daddy.' And I didn't want to leave a child homeless,"" he explained.



Hardan credits his dog for helping him thwart the intruder's plans.

""I protect her, and she protects me,"" Hardan said. ""She took care of the ones who loved her. She's got a special place in my heart, and she's done a great job. I was very proud of her.""

VIDEO: 6-foot-long monitor lizard invades 7-Eleven as shocked customers give it plenty of room to shop,"Customers at a 7-Eleven just outside Bangkok, Thailand, put their shopping for Snickers bars and Slurpees on hold while a 6-foot-long monitor lizard more or less took over the store Tuesday.

What are the details?

Metro reported that the giant reptile came from a nearby canal and made its way into the convenience store.

Cellphone video of the jaw-dropping invasion showed the lizard at first attempting to open a door in the refrigerated section:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Nothing doing.

But the creature was undeterred and proceeded to scale a nearby shelf, displaying its massive size in the process:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

This was no gecko.

But believe it or not, there wasn't much screaming from customers — in fact, the most prominent reactions sounded like oohs and aahs with smatterings of laughter as the lizard climbed all the way to the top of the shelf and flicked its tongue:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The lizard reportedly stayed atop the shelf next to the soft-drink machine for an hour, Metro noted.

How did the store handle its surprise visitor?

A store employee called police, the outlet said, and officers arrived with reptile handlers to snare the lizard after lunchtime.

""The rescue team arrived and chased it away,"" an employee noted to Metro. ""But they didn't catch it; it just ran away into the bushes. I've never seen a monitor lizard that big in my life, so it was a surprise for one to come in the shop. There's a forest behind the store, so we think it came from there.""

Drink denied!

Narumpa Tangsin recorded video of the lizard, the outlet said.

""I only stopped at the shop to buy some food and then saw the huge monitor lizard inside,"" Tangsin told Metro. ""I wanted to buy a drink, but the animal was too close to the drinks aisle. They're dangerous animals, especially when they're angry, so I stayed back and recorded it on my phone.""

The outlet said the lizard didn't take any food from the store and that it may have been struggling to find meals outside after months of dry weather with little rain.

Metro said Asian water monitor lizards live in canals and ponds in large cities in Thailand, where they feed on fish, snakes, frogs, and scraps of food from humans.

Monitors can be aggressive when threatened and have a mildly venomous bite that sometimes carries harmful bacteria, the outlet added, but do not tend to attack humans. Metro noted that some types of monitor lizards are kept as pets and are calm around humans.

The Honolulu Zoo said monitors — even small ones — can lash out with their tails upon the ""slightest provocation."" The zoo added that the reptiles ""will devour anything they are capable of dismembering and gulping down.""

Video: CBS reporter and crew dive for cover during live report as humongous explosion rattles Kyiv,"Several huge explosions rocked Kyiv during the dark early hours Thursday morning, and the moments were captured on a live CBS News broadcast.



What are the details?

CBS international correspondent Charlie D’Agata was finishing his live report from Kyiv when the sky behind him lit up a bright orange, illuminating the buildings and skyline.

""What the hell was that?"" he asked in shock as a second flash quickly drove him and the rest of the crew backward and out of the frame. ""It was almost like lightning, there was this big flash.""

A thunderous explosion could be heard shortly after, apparently stunning D'Agata and the rest of the CBS crew into silence.

""That was close,"" a D'Agata remarked after several moments of quiet. ""Close enough to see the flash.""

CBS News tweeted video of the explosions, captioning it, ""Just as CBS News' Charlie D'Agata was coming off the air tonight in #Kyiv Ukraine, the sky lit up behind him 'almost like lightning' and booming explosions shook the city.""

What else?

The Washington Post reported Thursday that an area west of Kyiv was rocked by a massive explosion, but it remains unknown at the time of this reporting whether the blast was the same caught on CBS' video report.

The report noted that the blast, captured by video cameras in the city's southeastern neighborhoods, ""took place in a region to the west of Kyiv and appeared to have struck an area far from the city center.""

""Between late Wednesday night and Thursday morning, air raid sirens have sounded at least six times, urging residents to take shelter, according to messages in the official municipal government Telegram channel,"" the outlet added. ""Russian forces remain stalled on the outskirts of the capital. Unable to substantially push through Kyiv’s defense in the north, they have moved westward to further encircle the city. But a senior U.S. defense official warned that these troops also have accelerated the pace of missile and artillery attacks targeting the capital.""

Following the explosions, D'Agata took to Twitter to describe what he had seen and heard during the stunning moments.



He wrote, ""Two of the largest explosions I’ve ever experienced just went off in #kyiv.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-cbs-reporter-and-crew-dive-for-cover-during-live-report-as-humongous-explosion-rattles-kyiv,2022-03-03
Video: Hero Ukrainian soldier sacrifices himself to blow up bridge and stop advancing Russian troops,"A Ukrainian service member reportedly sacrificed his life to detonate explosives on a bridge before Russian forces could cross it into Ukraine.

What are the details?

According to reports, Vitaly Skakun Volodymyrovych blew up the bridge — sacrificing himself — to prevent Russian tanks from advancing over a bridge from Russian-occupied Crimea into mainland Ukraine.

Volodymyrovych was said to have mined the bridge with explosives before making the decision to detonate it.

In a Facebook post, the general staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that Volodymyrovych positioned himself at the bridge as Russian tanks began their advance. When he realized that he would not be able to get out in time, he detonated the bridge while still on it.

In video obtained from social media, a vehicle believe to be driven by Volodymyrovych can be seen entering the bridge. Just moments later, the screen is filled with blinding light from the huge explosion's fireball.

The apparent aftermath of the blast can be seen in a second video, which shows the remainder of the structure rutted with deep cracks and covered with broken rocks and other debris.

What else is there to know about this?

In a lengthy statement on Volodymyrovych's bravery and sacrifice, Ukraine's general staff said, “The bridge was mined, but he didn’t manage to get away from there. According to his brothers in arms, Vitaly got in touch [with them] and said he was going to blow up the bridge. Immediately after an explosion rang out.”

A Friday report from the Sun noted that his comrades are now hailing him as a hero for ""significantly slowing down the advancement of the enemy"" — a move that also afforded the Ukrainian force time to ""regroup and redeploy its defenses.""

The statement added that the Marine Command plans to ""apply to the High Command to award the state award to sailor Skakun Vitaliy Volodymyrovych.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-hero-ukrainian-soldier-sacrifices-himself-to-blow-up-bridge-and-stop-advancing-russian-troops,2022-02-25
Video shows enormous line of Teslas waiting to charge in Louisiana,"A video showing a massive line of Tesla electric cars waiting their turn at a charging station in Louisiana is making the rounds on the internet this week.

What are the details?

The video, posted on Facebook by Texas resident Candace Metz on Sunday, appears to show more than a dozen Tesla vehicles wrapped around a parking lot near Interstate 10 in Louisiana, just off Prien Lake, Road in Lake Charles.

""Yesterday I was in Louisiana along I-10. I stopped to get gas when I noticed a line of cars all waiting,"" Metz wrote in the video's caption. ""Come to find out — it was a line of Teslas waiting their turn to charge up.""

""Curious, I pulled over and asked the guy how long it took to charge — he said normally 30 min[utes] but these stations are running slow due to demand so it’s over an hour per car,"" she continued, adding, ""Take a look at this line ... Each car is over an hour to charge.""

""Hope those people have food and clothes — they may not make dinner,"" she quipped.

A Google Maps search of the area showed that the drivers were crowded near a 120kW Tesla Supercharger station. According to the auto manufacturer's support page, Supercharger stations allow for ""up to 200 miles in 15 minutes of charge.""

The next closest Supercharger station is more than 100 miles away in Alexandria, though a few less-efficient Destination Charging stations are available nearby. However, Destination chargers only provide for ""up to 44 miles of range per hour charged.""

Why does it matter?



The video quickly garnered attention online as commenters debated whether traditional gas-powered vehicles remain more efficient than newer electric vehicles even as gas prices skyrocket across the U.S. amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The cost of gas spiked to historic highs in recent weeks as private companies boycotted Russian energy and the Biden administration later placed an embargo on Russian oil as a way to penalize the Kremlin for its unprovoked assault.

Yet as gas prices soared, hurting America's middle class, Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg responded to the crisis by gleefully pushing electric vehicles, boasting about the country's vast network of charging stations.

However, with the average cost of a new electric vehicle at more than $55,000 and videos like this one cropping up, that may be a tough sell.

""No thanks, I'll keep to my $5 a gallon gas!"" Metz exclaimed in the video.

Several commenters agreed with her sentiment, adding, ""Welcome to the future of [Democrat] Green energy"" and ""This is what the New Green Deal Hippies want us to do!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-line-of-teslas-wait-to-charge,2022-03-16
"Video: Man holds cowering home intruders at gunpoint, orders them to ground while calling police","Stephen Routh took matters into his own hands after spotting a trio who'd broken into his parents' North Carolina home Sunday — and then put his feelings about the incident quite bluntly to WGHP-TV: ""People are not taking this mess anymore.""

Image source: WGHP-TV video screenshot

Indeed people aren't — and criminals continue to miss the loud-and-clear message.

What happened?

Routh watches over his parents' home in Asheboro, and he got a call about some unusual people on the property, the station said — so he went over to check things out.

Upon his arrival, WGHP reported, he saw three individuals trying to exit the back door.

And Routh greeted them — with a friend in hand to help him do the honors.

""As soon as they saw the big gun pointed at them, their hands went up,"" he told the station, which noted the moment was captured on cellphone video.

Image source: WGHP-TV video screenshot

Routh held the trio at gunpoint and ordered them to the ground while he spoke to 911 dispatchers, WGHP said.

'Thought they would just go in there and look around'



The suspects ransacked the inside of the home leaving glass shattered everywhere, the station said.

""It is a terrible mess,"" Routh added to WGHP, ""all the drawers are screwed, cabinets drawers have been open, stuff thrown out, papers everywhere.""

Image source: WGHP-TV video screenshot

The suspects took nothing of value before attempting to flee the scene, the station said, which confounded Routh regarding their intentions.

""They know this is not their home,"" he told WGHP. ""They know they had no business in here, and they mentioned they just thought they would just go in there and look around.""

Routh added to the station that things could've turned out worse but hopes criminals think twice, knowing there are armed people out there who won't hesitate to pull the trigger when necessary.

""There have been too many instances lately of home invasions ... where they get caught,"" he told WGHP. ""And some people have been shot and killed, especially those home invasions … People are not taking this mess anymore.""

"Video shows Russian tank run down, flatten civilian vehicle driven by elderly man — and man miraculously survives","Video captured the moment a Russian tank crashed into and drove over a civilian car driven by an elderly man in Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv.

What are the details?

Videos shared to social media shows the massive armored vehicle driving down what appeared to be a suburban residential road before driving into the path of a sedan — and then directly over the vehicle, appearing to flatten it altogether.

After a moment, the tank can be seen reversing off of the sedan, pulverizing its frame a second time, likely prompting bystanders to assume the worst for the car's occupant.

In the videos, bystanders can be heard screaming and crying as the tank rolls over the vehicle and its occupant inside.

What else?

Later footage shared to social media shows the aftermath of the crash and the dramatic rescue.

According to various reports, the unnamed elderly passenger lived — and was able to extricate himself from the crushed vehicle with the help of several nearby civilians, who pried him out of the wreck using various tools.

Video saw the unidentified group of men attempting to force open the door on the dazed-looking elderly man's vehicle in order to free him from the twisted wreckage.

What else?

Witness Viktor Berbash told the Sun that he couldn't believe his eyes and described the scene as he recalled it unfolding.

""I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire,"" he told the outlet. ""And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here ...

Video of Ukrainian woman confronting Russian soldier goes viral: Put sunflower seeds in your pocket 'so at least [flowers] will grow' when you're killed,"A fiery Ukrainian women went viral for her reaction to a Russian soldier patrolling a Ukrainian street earlier this week.

What are the details?

The unnamed woman — dressed in nearly all black and wearing a white winter hat — was seen in a video shared to social media telling off a Russian soldier and suggesting he carry sunflower seeds in his pockets — so that when he is killed on foreign soil, flowers will sprout from his decomposing body.

“Put them in your pockets,” she stoically told the soldier during one point of the interaction, “so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here.”

The sunflower, which is Ukraine's national flower, is often said to represent power, strength, warmth, and more.

Elsewhere in the video, the woman could be heard telling the soldier, ""You're occupants, you're fascists! What the f*** are you doing on our land with all these guns?""

She added, ""From this moment, you are cursed. I'm telling you. You f***ing came here uninvited.""

""Pieces of s**t,"" she concluded.

The original video, shared by Twitter account UkraineWorld, was captioned, ""Ukrainian woman confronts Russian soldiers in Henychesk, Kherson region. Asks them why they came to our land and urges to put sunflower seeds in their pockets [so that flowers would grow when they die on the Ukrainian land].""

The video has been viewed more than 5.3 million times at the time of this reporting.

What else?

Author Thomas Rid tweeted about the interaction and provided a translation.

He wrote, ""One of most formidable images I've ever come across, and I study war for a living: a Ukrainian woman handing sunflower seeds to a Russian soldier, asking him to pocket the seeds, twice, so that 'at least' sunflowers will grow when he will be killed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-ukrainian-woman-confronts-russian-soldier-sunflower-seeds,2022-02-25
Video: Veteran interpreter breaks into tears while translating Zelenskyy’s speech as Ukraine survives another night,"A veteran video interpreter who was translating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Sunday speech broke into tears while detailing Ukraine's resolve against attacking Russian forces.

What are the details?

Video shared to social media showed the interpreter — a woman who remains unidentified at the time of this post and working for a German news outlet — pausing, choking up, and finally breaking into tears while translating Zeleskyy's speech while on the air.

Zelenskyy in the speech was describing how the war-torn country had sustained another day of Russian attacks.

""Russia is on the path of evil,"" Zelenskyy said in the speech. ""The world must deprive Russia of the right to vote on the U.N. Security Council.""



The interpreter then paused and began to choke up while delivering Zelenskyy's following lines.

""Ukrainians,"" the country's president continued, ""we know exactly what we are defending. We will definitely win. Last night was brutal in Ukraine. Again, the shelling, again the bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure.""

As she continued speaking, she broke once more and took a breath, reportedly saying ""sorry"" before going off the air.

Zelenskyy added that the country is set to fight for as long as it takes to ""liberate the country"" and that Russian forces would only come in heavier and in a more vicious way.

“The night was hard,” he added. “The people rose to defend their state, and they showed their true faces. This is terror. They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed.”

He added, ""If children are born in shelters, even when the shelling continues, then the enemy has no chance in this — undoubtedly — people's war. To victory!

Videos: Ukrainians reportedly take joyride on captured Russian tank as other vehicles are set ablaze or hauled away with tractors,"A group of Ukrainian men allegedly took a captured Russian tank for a joyride through snow-covered fields this week while others set fire to the vehicles or hauled them away using tractors, according to video clips shared online in recent days.

In the first video clip — which has now gone viral online — a group of men are seen cheering and laughing as they ride atop a T-80BVM armored battle tank in a field in Kharkiv, Ukraine, the Daily Mail reported.

The man filming the scene on his cellphone reportedly shouts, ""We did it!"" and ""Glory to Ukraine!"" while his compatriots laugh and yell along with him.

The video, purportedly first uploaded to Telegram, has since been shared online by several different social media accounts, including a Twitter account operated by Barstool Sports called ""Zero Blog Thirty.""

It wasn't immediately clear how the men commandeered the vehicle, however, reports of Russian troops abandoning tanks and other weaponry amid fighting in Ukraine have become widespread.

Newsweek reported Tuesday that a barrage of recent social media posts show Russian forces within the occupied country leaving military vehicles behind and fleeing combat.

Open-source intelligence monitor, OSINT Defender, tweeted a video earlier this week reporting that Russian troops fled a depot in the Sumy region, ""leaving behind BMPs, BTR-80s, MT-LBs and Infantry Transport Vehicles.""

Other abandoned vehicles reportedly included ""a 152mm Msta-S self-propelled howitzer, 1V13 command vehicle, T-80U tank, and logistical trucks,"" according to the Twitter account, ""Ukraine Weapons Tracker.""

Belarusian media outlet, NEXTA, posted a video on Thursday purportedly showing a line of Russian tanks being set ablaze near Nikolaev, now known as Mykolaiv.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmers have gained some notoriety on social media for allegedly hauling away abandoned Russian tanks using tractors, according to a report from British magazine, Farmers Weekly.

In one video, a tank is pulled down a street as someone chases after it.

The magazine quoted an anonymous source who said, ""A Russian solider got lost and got out of his armored personal carrier. He wandered off and the farmer came and took the tractor. The armored personnel carrier had been left unattended, so the farmer decided to nick it.""

In a separate video, an alleged Ukrainian farmer appears to tow away another Russian vehicle as bystanders wave and cheer.

TheBlaze cannot independently verify the accuracy of the videos included in this report.

82-year-old Vietnam vet beats armed intruder to death: 'That guy picked the wrong house',"An 82-year-old Vietnam veteran defended himself, his wife, and his property after an armed intruder entered his home over the weekend, killing the intruder by bludgeoning him to death.

What are the details?

According to a report from Newsweek, 82-year-old Herbert Parrish and his wife, 79-year-old Lois Parrish, were inside their South Carolina home Sunday when they heard an unexpected knock on the door.

When Lois opened the door, she saw a man — later identified as 61-year-old Harold Runnels — who said he was looking for his dog.

""I opened the door and he said he was looking for his little white chihuahua and wanted to know if I saw it,"" she recalled. ""I told him no, I hadn't.""

At that point, Runnels reportedly forced his way into the home, brandished a knife, and slashed Lois' forehead.

During the melee, Herbert grabbed a shotgun hanging on a nearby wall and repeatedly struck Runnels with the barrel of the weapon until he fell unconscious.

Parrish — who said he pummeled Runnels at least 10 times in the face — said, ""I felt, we're gone. He's going to kill us and take what he can take. He was not going to go out the door and leave us alive. That's the way I felt. That's why I said 'I've got to do something quick and get the edge on him. Get the advantage on him.'""

Parrish said that he hit Runnels ""just as hard as I could hit him.""

When authorities arrived on the scene, Runnels was unresponsive on the floor. He was taken to a nearby medical center where he died of his injuries, according to Fox News.

What did the sheriff's office say?

In a statement, Aiken County Sheriff's Office Capt. Eric Abdullah confirmed that Parrish ""was able to strike Mr. Runnels enough to the point where he fell to the floor still being conscious but unresponsive.""

Neighbor Jessica Clark said that Runnels made a grave error in choosing the Parrish home.

""This street is normally not that crazy or anything, and we all know each other and everything,"" Clark recalled. ""I never would have expected it to happen here. And so I kinda feel like it puts a stain on this neighborhood in a way.""



Clark added, ""[W]hen I heard they were able to fend off the suspect, I was so proud of them, and I was like, 'OK, so that guy picked the wrong house.'""

Abdullah added, ""[F]olks have the right to defend themselves if their lives are in danger, but the best thing to do is call for help. Every situation is going to be different. It may be a similar crime in nature, but every situation is going to be different. There's no way to accurately predict exactly what actions that any person should take if somebody is trying to invade their home. The best recourse is to think smartly and get help on the way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/vietnam-vet-beats-intruder-to-death,2021-02-18
Visa and Mastercard suspend operations in Russia,"Visa and Mastercard are cutting ties with Russia as Western sanctions continue to ravage the Russian economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Independent reported that Visa and Mastercard are suspending operations in Russia “over the coming days.” Visa said that once its ban is in place Visa bank and credit cards issued in Russia will not work abroad and cards issued to people outside of Russia will not work inside the country.

Al Kelly, the CEO of Visa, said, “We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed.”

Mastercard issued a statement expressing a similar view calling the Russian invasion of Ukraine “shocking and devastating.”

The company said, “With this action, cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by the Mastercard network. And, any Mastercard issued outside of the country will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs.”

“These have been and will continue to be very difficult days – most of all for our employees and their families in Ukraine; for our colleagues with relatives and friends in the region; for our colleagues in Russia; and for the rest of us who are watching from afar,” Mastercard added.

Previously, the Ukrainian government called on international financial institutions to cut ties with Russia to apply maximum pressure to Russian leadership.

In late February, shortly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Western nations issued a series of thoroughgoing sanctions on the Russian economy.

Notably, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States locked arms in a joint statement calling for Russian banks to be removed from the SWIFT telecommunications network.

They said, “We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion. Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

The European Commission took further steps against Russia and banned all Russian planes from European airspace.

In response to Western sanctions, corporations took steps to sever their relationships with Russia as they try to exhaust the Russian economy.

The British Petroleum Company (BP) announced that it would liquidate its holdings in Russian state-owned energy companies. BP owns a nearly 20% stake in Rosneft; the British company intends to end its partnership with Russian energy companies which it hopes will put strain on Russia’s ability to export fossil fuels and natural gas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/visa-and-mastercard-suspend-operations-in-russia,2022-03-06
Vladimir Putin has ordered his military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert,"Vladimir Putin has ordered his military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert on Sunday as tensions with the West escalate over the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin blamed ""aggressive statements"" by NATO members and hard-hitting economic sanctions against Moscow as the reason for increasing Russia's preparedness to launch nuclear weapons.



""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,"" Putin said on state television, according to the Associated Press.

""Senior officials of the leading Nato countries also allow aggressive statements against our country, therefore I order the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty,"" Putin added in the appearance with top Russian military officials.



The order came at a meeting between the president, the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia, Valery Gerasimov, the Guardian reported.



At the meeting, Putin ordered his top military command to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a ""special regime of combat duty.""

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned the decision as a ""totally unacceptable"" escalation.

""President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable, and we have to continue to condemn his actions in the strongest possible way,"" Thomas-Greenfield said during an appearance on ""Face the Nation.""

Thomas-Greenfield declared that the U.S. will ""continue here at the United Nations and around the world to use every possible lever we have at our disposal to expose his actions.""

Time magazine reported, ""The practical meaning of Putin's order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have the land- and submarine-based segments of their strategic nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.""

Putin's decision to place Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert comes after several Western countries have pledged military aid to Ukraine.

WA state homeowner shoots and kills home intruder: 'I have the right to carry and I have the right to protect myself',"A homeowner shot and killed one of two intruders in Spanaway, Washington, on Thursday morning.

Pierce County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Darren Moss said that police received a call at about 4:20 a.m. from the homeowner about an attempted burglary.

The homeowner told the dispatcher that two men kicked down his back door trying to get into his home. He told them that he had fired at the two suspects.

When police arrived at the home they found a 24-year-old man deceased on the homeowner's front yard from a gunshot wound.

The homeowner, Jeremy Smith, spoke to KING-TV about the incident.

""I took action upon that, which was, unfortunately taking one life, and the other one ran,"" said Smith.

""You get to talk about it a lot with your friends, or you get to talk about it with your family, and go, yeah we all carry, but you know, or this is what I would do, or this is what you would do, but it's way different when it actually happens,"" he explained.

Officials are investigating the incident as a homicide, but may find that the homeowner was acting in self-defense. No arrests have been made yet, and they are seeking the second suspect in the incident.

Smith says he was justified in defending himself and his family.

""I have the right to carry, and I have the right to protect myself, and I have the right to protect my property,"" he added. ""I don't know what they wanted out of this house, I don't know what they were doing, but I don't care.""

"'As empty gestures go, impressive': WaPo's Jennifer Rubin mocks Pope Francis' visit to Russian embassy over Ukraine invasion — and gets torched for it","Pope Francis visited the Russian embassy to the Holy See on Friday to express concern over Russia's invasion of Ukraine — a move that Reuters characterized as an ""unprecedented departure from diplomatic protocol.""

The outlet said Moscow's ambassador, Aleksandr Avdeyev, told the RIA Novosti news agency that during the 40-minute meeting, Francis expressed ""great concern"" about Ukraine's humanitarian situation and quoted the pontiff as calling ""for the protection of children, the protection of the sick and suffering, and the protection of people.""

But formerly conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wasn't impressed.

What did she say?

Replying to a tweet from NBC News' chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel on the pope's appeal, Rubin remarked, ""As empty gestures go, impressive.""

How are folks reacting?

As you might imagine, a number of Twitter users who caught wind of Rubin's five-word dismissal of Pope Francis' rare act were equally dismissive of Rubin and her words:

""Yeah Jen, there definitely aren’t over a billion Catholics to be spoken for, and the Holy Father has never played a role in liberating Eastern Europe, definitely not a thing that happened 30-40 years ago,"" one commenter noted.

""Like changing your Twitter name to 'I stand with Ukraine.' What does that even mean?"" another user wondered. ""Did you fly to the Ukraine, take up arms, and are right now helping them defend their country?""

""She's literally saved 40 billion lives by changing her Twitter name to include 'I stand with Ukraine,'"" another user mocked in reference to Rubin.

""God you are an awful human being,"" another commenter declared. ""What has your god, Joe Biden, done for the people of Ukraine other than get them killed? Burn in hell, witch.""

""Really Jennifer?!! An empty gesture!! Pope Francis and his words, thoughts, and actions, have significant influence around the world!"" another user said. ""His words have way more significance than yours! So why don’t you take your empty gesture words and go to Kyiv and stand with Ukraine and fight!""

Anything else?

Reuters noted that a pope visiting an embassy to talk to an ambassador in a time of conflict ""is unprecedented in living memory,"" adding that the Vatican's secretary of state usually summons foreign envoys to meet with the pope in the Apostolic Palace.

The outlet also said that prior to Russia's invasion, Andriy Yurash — Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican — told Reuters that Kyiv would be open to a Vatican mediation of the conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wapos-jennifer-rubin-mocks-pope-francis-visit-to-russian-embassy-over-ukraine-invasion-and-gets-torched-for-it,2022-02-25
WATCH: Defendant flips out on judge with obscenity-laced rant after sentencing. Then judge teaches him a brutal lesson.,"Manson Bryant, 32, has been sent to prison at least three times, and Judge Eugene Lucci has presided over at least eight of his cases, WOIO-TV reported.

The most recent one involved a July 2018 home invasion for which Bryant was found guilty of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and abduction, the station said.

But Bryant stood before Lucci in a Painesville, Ohio, courtroom prior to his sentencing earlier this month and sounded contrite.

""I've made a lifetime of bad decisions,"" he told the judge at the March 1 hearing, WOIO said. ""I respect you, and I respect your decision.""

That was, until Lucci read Bryant his sentence: 22 years in prison.

Contrite no longer



Bryant stood up and let his feelings be known.

""Twenty-two years? Man, f*** your courtroom, you racist ass b***h!"" Bryant shouted at Lucci, WOIO reported, while officers restrained him. ""F*** your courtroom, man! You racist as f***! Twenty-two f***ing years? Racist ass b***h! You ain't s**t!""

Image source: WOIO-TV video screenshot

Bryant was facing close to three decades in prison, the station said, but Lucci had determined that Bryant demonstrated some remorse.

Brutal lesson

While Bryant was still shouting obscenities at Lucci, the judge decided the defendant wasn't so remorseful after all and gave him some more time behind bars to think things over.

Image source: WOIO-TV video screenshot

""Actually, actually ... you know what,"" Lucci was heard saying on video released Tuesday, WOIO noted. ""Remember when I said that you had some remorse? When I said that you had a certain amount of remorse, I was mistaken. The court determines that maximum imprisonment is needed. So that's 28 years.""

Lucci noted that Bryant ""was just feeding me a line of bull,"" the station said.

Bryant's attorney Daniel J. Williams, Esq., told WOIO his client will appeal his verdict and sentence.

""Sentencing hearings can be emotional for all involved,"" Williams told the station. ""Mr. Bryant received a significant sentence and had an emotional and regrettable reaction to it. He was otherwise very composed throughout the course of his trial, even when the verdict was rendered. He intends to appeal the verdict and sentence, and continues to remain hopeful.""

WATCH: Four armed men bust down door in home invasion — then suddenly change their minds when homeowner opens fire,"Once again, a homeowner's gun made home invaders change their minds — and fast.

What happened?

Video captured the moment when a Bowling Green, Kentucky, homeowner's front door was kicked in just before midnight Wednesday, and four men entered the residence.

And they were armed with handguns, WLKY-TV reported.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The problem for them, however, was that the homeowner — who told police he was asleep at the time of the break in — also had a gun, the station said.

And he used it.

Video shows a sudden barrage of bullets directed at the foursome before they turn tail and run out the just-kicked in front door.

But the homeowner wasn't the only one shooting — the intruders fired as well, and the homeowner got shot in his right hand and was taken to a hospital, WLKY added.

What happened to the intruders?

It isn't clear if any of the intruders were hit by gunfire, but investigators said they face attempted murder and burglary charges, the station reported.

What did a sheriff have to say?

Warren County Sheriff Brett Hightower told WDRB-TV he's hopeful the video will help officials find the intruders.

""It kind of plays into ... the mindset of those individuals ... when they forcibly made entry into somebody's home, came in there armed and attempting to locate somebody and exchanging gunfire with them and shooting somebody,"" Hightower told WDRB. ""It's invaluable to have that type of video footage.""

"Watch: Intruder caught on video entering home, grabbing 11-year-old girl before being chased off by the child's father","A terrifying home invasion attempt in Florida was caught on surveillance video on Christmas Eve, when a suspect grabbed an 11-year-old girl and followed her inside her house while attempting to quiet the child.

The girl is safe, and a suspect has been nabbed after the child's father chased the alleged burglar out of the home.

What are the details?

Ava Kloepfer, 11, stepped out on the back porch of her home on Tuesday, when she was startled by an intruder who can be seen on video grabbing the child by the arm, and pushing her back inside the house while he followed. Moments later, the suspect can be seen fleeing as Ava's father, Derek Kloepfer, ran to confront the intruder.

Kloepfer told WOFL-TV the suspect had ""a scared look in his eye and automatically turned around and ran.""

He added, ""If I would have grabbed him, I'm sure there would have been some consequences.""

Kloepfer called 911 and said police responded in roughly five minutes, and were able to apprehend the suspect about an hour later.

Authorities say Steven Hasugulgum, 21, is the man who grabbed Ava. After the attack, a woman who lived nearby called authorities saying a suspect matching Hasugulgum's description tried to burglarize her home, and described the intruder as ""acting erratic and holding a hammer.""

The neighbor said that after she relocked her door, the suspect ran to the woman's SUV and tried to open it, but she set off the vehicle's panic alarm and scared him off. Deputies surrounded the area and used a K-9 unit to assist in tracking the perpetrator.

Hasugulgum is being held on $20,000 bond on charges of battery and attempted burglary. He is a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia. The suspect's status with Immigration and Customs Enforcement is unknown at the time of this writing.

As for the Kloepfer family, they are relieved the alleged intruder has been detained but will take extra precautions in the future. ""My daughter is feeling safer now, so I'm happy,"" Kloepfer told WOFL, adding that from now on, ""the back door will be locked and the kid will have to stay inside.""

Western nations isolate Russia's economy by kicking them out of SWIFT,"In a drastic move to sanction Russia for invading Ukraine, the leadership of several Western nations agreed to exclude Russian banks from the SWIFT communication network.

In a joint statement, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to removing specific Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

“We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion,” the statement proclaimed, “Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

“As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities,” the statement continued, “We are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.”

The Western leaders committed to:

“Ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system.”

“Imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

“Acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine” and to “limit the sale of citizenship … that let wealthy Russians connected to the government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.”

“Launching this coming week a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions.”

The Western leaders made clear that it would work with governments across the globe to “detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains” and would “deny” prominent Russian figures the ability to launder their wealth abroad.

By preventing Russia from utilizing the SWIFT communication network, Western leaders will effectively isolate them and inhibit them from conducting trade with many of its largest trade partners. This move will also interfere with Russia’s ability to export natural gas and oil, which makes up more than half of the country’s GDP.

The statement ended with a declaration of solidarity with the Ukrainian people “in this dark hour” and affirmed that the West is prepared to launch stricter sanctions against Russia should it become necessary to do so.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/western-nations-isolate-russia-s-economy-by-kicking-them-out-of-swift,2022-02-26
"White House enraged, not by 2.37 million illegal aliens who stole into US in 2022, but by the 130 illegal aliens Texas just bused to Kamala Harris' house","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration allegedly sent three buses full of criminal noncitizens to Vice President Kamala Harris' residence over the weekend. This small reminder of the ongoing crisis faced by Americans in border towns beleaguered by multitudes of illegal aliens was not well received.

The White House denounced the move, suggesting that it served only to ""put lives in danger.""

Not in Kamala Harris' backyard

Three buses containing approximately 130 of the 465,034 criminal noncitizens who have illegally entered the country so far in fiscal year 2023 rolled up to Harris' Washington residence at the Naval Observatory on Christmas Eve.

The passengers reportedly hailed from Ecuador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru, and Colombia.

Harris, who previously stressed the need to be ""welcoming"" of illegal aliens, apparently did not invite the criminal noncitizens inside, despite the 15-degree weather.

CNN reported that two busloads were taken to local shelters. Other illegal aliens were given blankets and put on another bus headed to a local church.

White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan stated, ""Governor Abbott abandoned children on the side of the road in below-freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve without coordinating with any federal or local authorities.""



Hasan characterized this latest effort to transport illegal aliens to a sanctuary city and others like it as ""political games [that] accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger.""



The White House spokesman further claimed that the Biden administration, which has seen over 5 million illegal aliens enter into the country under its watch, is ""willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions, like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office.""

Notwithstanding the Biden administration's alleged commitment to work on ""real solutions,"" TheBlaze previously noted that Biden has provided foreign nationals with incentives to illegally enter the country, such as health care, an end to detentions of illegal border crossers, an end to deportations, and amnesty, extra to seeking to lift the Trump-era Title 42 policy.

Bringing the border to Biden

Reuters noted that Abbott has not yet claimed responsibility for sending the buses to Harris' doorstep; however, the governor did reiterate on Dec. 20 that the Lone Star State will ""continue busing migrants to sanctuary cities.""

According to Newsweek, the governor's spokesperson Renae Eze appeared to confirm that Abbott was behind the Christmastime delivery, noting that the illegal aliens ""willingly"" chose to go to Washington on Saturday.

""The White House is full of a bunch of hypocrites, led by the Hypocrite-in-Chief, who has been flying planeloads of migrants across the country and oftentimes in the cover of night,"" said Eze.

As for the criminal noncitizens who turned up at Harris' house, Eze noted they had ""signed a voluntary consent waiver available in multiple languages upon boarding that they agreed on the destination. And they were processed and released by the federal government, who are dumping them at historic levels in Texas border towns like El Paso, which recently declared a state of emergency because of the Biden-made crisis.""

""Instead of their hypocritical complaints about Texas providing much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities, President Biden and Border Czar Harris need to step up and do their jobs to secure the border—something they continue failing to do,"" added Eze.

Despite the White House's accusation of cruelty, Abbott has underscored that the responsibility for this humanitarian crisis lies with Biden and his administration.



Abbott sent a letter to Biden on Dec. 20, demanding that he deploy federal assets to ""address the dire border crisis ... as a dangerously cold polar vortex moves into Texas.""

""This terrible crisis for border communities in Texas is a catastrophe of your own making,” wrote Abbott. “These communities and the state are ill-equipped to do the job assigned to the federal government—house the thousands of migrants flooding into the country every day. With perilous temperatures moving into the area, many of these migrants are at risk of freezing to death on city streets. The need to address this crisis is not the job of border states like Texas.""

Abbott added, ""You must execute the duties that the U.S. Constitution mandates you perform and secure the southern border before more innocent lives are lost.""

In the meantime, one nonprofit that aids illegal aliens has indicated that busing is not the worst way forward.

Tatiana Laborde, the managing director of SAMU First Response, told CNN that if done properly, busing criminal noncitizens to sanctuary cities could help ease tensions at the southern border.



""What they’re seeing is much worse than what we see here. The three buses are just a small portion of what they experience on a day-to-day,"" said Laborde. ""If things like this are done in a coordinated and humane manner, it could really be a good option for those border towns that are struggling.""

Although criminal noncitizens briefly suffered the cold in Washington, those whom Biden told to come suffer worse fates when attempting to steal into the country.

White House physician who served under Obama calls for Biden's immediate resignation,"A former White House Physician, who served in both the Obama and Trump administrations, said that President Joe Biden is not mentally fit to serve as president and ought to immediately resign.

On Friday, the physician in question, Ronny Jackson, said, “Biden doesn’t know what’s going on with Ukraine. He Doesn’t know what’s going on with ANYTHING! He’s not cognitively capable of leading. He needs to RESIGN before our country suffers anymore.”

The doctor’s comments are in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine which continues to disrupt the geopolitical balance of power.

Jackson, a Republican, currently represents Texas’s 13th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives and has raised questions about Biden’s cognitive ability in the past.

In late February, Rep. Jackson called for Biden to take a cognitive test and said that he is “not fit to be our president right now.”

Fox News reported that Jackson said, “The whole country is seeing his mental cognitive issues on display for over a year now, and there’s really no question in most people’s minds that there’s something going on with him, that he’s not cognitively the same as he used to be and, in my mind, not fit to be our president right now.”

The congressman continued, “Every time he gets up and talks to the American people, it’s not just the American people that are watching him speak, it’s the whole world, and that’s part of what the problem is here. He looks tired, he looks weak, he looks confused, he’s incoherent, and it sends a message of weakness all over the world, and they’re seizing up on that.”

Last July, he predicted that Biden would eventually resign from the presidency due to his declining cognitive abilities.

He said, “There’s something seriously going on with this man right now, and, you know, I think that he’s either going to resign, they’re going to convince him to resign from office at some point in the near future for medical issues or they’re going to have to use the 25th Amendment to get rid of this man right now.”

Last January, Jackson slammed Biden for ignoring a question about his mental health and suggested that him doing so was an indication that something was “wrong” with the president.

Biden ignoring this question led Jackson to demand he sit for a cognitive examination.

Jackson said, “I am demanding he have a cognitive test NOW. There’s too much on the line, we need to know!”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-physician-who-served-under-obama-calls-for-biden-s-immediate-resignation,2022-03-12
White House reviews military plans that would include massive troop deployment to Middle East,"Amid escalating tensions with Iran, President Donald Trump's top national security advisers reviewed military plans last week that would send more 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East ""should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons,"" The New York Times reported Monday.

What are the details?

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented the plan last Thursday, which was requested by national security adviser John Bolton, The Times reported.

The plan was presented during a meeting among top national security officials — including CIA chief Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford — that focused on the administration's Iran policy.



Officials who spoke to The Times anonymously said the plans did not include projections for a land invasion of Iran, which would require vastly more ground forces.

Although it's not clear if Trump has personally reviewed the plans, senior American officials told The Times the fact that the military plans were drawn up underscores how serious of a threat Iran has become to U.S. interests in the region.

""We'll see what happens with Iran. If they do anything, it would be a very bad mistake,"" Trump told The Times.

What's the background?

Bolton and other top U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have been warning of Iran's desire to escalate tensions in the region.

In fact, after Israel passed an intelligence report to U.S. officials that warned of Iranian plans to attack U.S. interests in the region either directly or by proxy forces, Bolton announced additional deployments of U.S. forces to the region, including the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and B-52 bomber strike groups, according to the Military Times.

However, the deployment of U.S. power has not deterred Iranian forces. The Associated Press reported Monday that U.S. officials believe Iranian forces or Iranian-backed proxies are responsible for damaging four ships in the Persian Gulf over the weekend, including two Saudi oil tankers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-plans-iran-deployment,2019-05-14
White House press secretary Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration is not monitoring the stock market amid Wall Street's longest losing streak in 99 years,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the Biden administration is not monitoring the stock market on a regular basis as the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its longest losing streak in 99 years.

While speaking to reporters, Jean-Pierre said that “nothing has changed on how we see the stock market,” which is “not something we keep an eye on every day, so I’m not gonna comment on that from here,” the Epoch Times reported.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 5%, while the Dow Jones shrank by 4% last Wednesday. On Thursday, the Dow Jones dropped more than 440 points during the morning trading hours.

Earlier in 2022, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Joe Biden “does not look at the stock market as a means by which to judge the economy.”

The stock market’s historic plunge was triggered, in part, by selloffs of major corporate retailers like Target and Walmart. Target lost nearly 25% of its value after it reported earnings fell short of forecasts made by analysts largely due to shipping costs that high fuel prices and inflation have exacerbated. Other major retailers also saw significant losses in recent days.

Rising interest rates, spiraling inflation, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and a slowdown in China’s economy have reportedly caused investors to reconsider the prices they’re willing to pay for a wide range of stocks.

The rampant selloffs lasted for eight consecutive days marking the longest weekly losing streak on Wallstreet since 1923, CNN reported.

The S&P 500 — a much broader index than the Dow Jones — posted its seventh-straight weekly loss marking the index’s longest slump since March 2001. The S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on Friday after recording a 20% loss from the all-time high that it reached this past January.

The last bear market occurred two years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recent market conditions will mark the first time since then that new investors could experience true economic shrinkage.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said, “From inflation to a hawkish Fed, to war, to supply chain issues, to China on lockdown, to a slowing economy, there are many reasons stocks have done as poorly as they have recently.”

Detrick suggested that a “bounce back” is likely, however.

He said, “If we get any good news, a big bounce-back rally is likely.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-press-secretary-jean-pierre-said-that-the-biden-administration-is-not-monitoring-the-stock-market-amid-wallstreet-s-longest-losing-streak-in-99-years,2022-05-21
"White House briefing on Ukraine invasion to TikTok influencers, claims Russia hacked 2016 election","The White House welcomed popular personalities from the Chinese social media platform TikTok to deliver a briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the influencers. During the briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed a claim that the 2016 election was ""hacked"" by Russians.

The White House spoke to 30 ""top TikTok stars"" on a Zoom call on Thursday, according to the Washington Post.

The White House has been closely watching TikTok's rise as a dominant news source, leading to its decision to approach a select group of the platform's most influential names. This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States' role in it.

Psaki told the influencers, ""Thank you all for everything you're doing. I mean, use of your platforms to educate, to inform, to debunk, to demystify, during what is a very tumultuous, heartbreaking time in the world is remarkable, and we recognize and value all of your platforms.""

The platform the influencers use is the Beijing-based short-form video app TikTok – which has been scrutinized for potentially having security risks. The Department of Defense stated that the social media app features ""potential security risks associated with its use."" In 2020, the U.S. Army, and Navy prohibited TikTok from being used on government-issued phones. Last July, the massively popular social media app gave itself permission to collect biometric data of U.S. users – which includes faceprints and voiceprints.

Jules Suzdaltsev – a TikTok personality who was born in Ukraine – claimed the officials at the meeting dodged hard questions and said, ""The energy of the call felt like a press briefing for kindergarteners.""

One of the influencers at the briefing on the war in Ukraine is Ellie Zeiler – an 18-year-old with over 10.5 million followers on TikTok where she typically does dances and makeup tutorials.

""I’m here to relay the information in a more digestible manner to my followers,"" Zeiler told the Washington Post. ""I would consider myself a White House correspondent for Gen Z.""

During the call with the TikTok influencers, Psaki claimed that Russia ""hacked"" the 2016 election in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.

""If you look back at 2014, and frankly even 2016, when Russia invaded Ukraine and then in 2016, when they, you know, of course, hacked our election here, we did not do that, we did not declassify information,"" Psaki told the group of TikTok stars.

Fox News notes, ""While Russian hackers were behind the stealing of emails from Democratic officials like John Podesta, there is no evidence that they tampered with election results as part of the 2016 hacking spree.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence investigated possible Russian influence on the 2016 election and released a report in 2017.

""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,"" the DNI investigation found.

""Russian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards,"" the report stated. ""Since early 2014, Russian intelligence has researched US electoral processes and related technology and equipment.""

""DHS assesses that the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying,"" the report declared.

Coincidentally, Russia is also using high-profile TikTok influencers to push its narrative regarding the invasion of Ukraine, according to a report from Vice News.

The outlet reports that there is a ""coordinated campaign to pay Russian TikTok influencers to post videos pushing pro-Kremlin narratives about the war in Ukraine."" Vice News also claims that there is a secret Telegram channel run by the Russian government that ""gave potential contributors a step-by-step guide on how to circumvent TikTok's ban on uploads from Russian accounts.""

This isn't the first time the Biden administration has turned to TikTok influencers.

In December, President Joe Biden appeared in a TikTok video with the Jonas Brothers to promote Americans getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was widely panned as being ""cringe.""

Last August, the White House enlisted ""Gen Z"" social media influencer Benny Drama to be Psaki's ""intern"" to help spread awareness about COVID-19 vaccines with a viral TikTok video.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-tiktok-russia-election,2022-03-12
Wife of Russian prisoner and WNBA star Brittney Griner speaks out as fears grow that Putin will use the former Olympian as a 'high-profile hostage',"The wife of WNBA star and Russian captive Brittney Griner says that she and Griner's team are tirelessly working to get the basketball star home after the celebrated Olympian was detained at a Russian airport at least three weeks ago for reportedly having a cannabis-filled vape pen on her person.

The longer Griner spends incarcerated in Russia, the longer fears continue to grow over the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin will use the WNBA star as a ""high-profile hostage,"" the Daily Mail reported on Sunday.

What are the details?

Wife Cherelle Griner on Saturday night shared an update on Instagram, writing, ""I love my wife wholeheartedly, so this message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life. I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details. Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.""

""Your prayers, and support,"" she added, ""are greatly appreciated.""

According to the report, Eveyln Farkas, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, said that she fears Russia may use Griner as a ""high-profile hostage,"" and noted that if the U.S. wants Griner out of jail, ""Russia is going to have some terms.""

""It could be a prisoner swap,"" she added. ""They could also use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.""

What else?

Griner's agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told the outlet that the basketball star's team is in ""close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her fears, and the WNBA and NBA.""

""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern,"" Colas added in the statement.

During a Saturday press conference, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said that she is working hard to return Griner to the U.S.



""Brittney Griner is a United States citizen, she was a guest in Russia ... and I will be demanding her release,"" she said. ""I don't want to disregard a sovereign nation, but Putin has disregarded sovereign nations his entire service in this world and anyone that is killing and attacking and destroying Ukraine, their neighboring country — that does not bother them has no right to hold Ms. Griner. Period. If there is challenges and concerns about her actions, it should be dealt with diplomatically and she should be released.""

She continued, ""I believe that at this time, in the midst of war, how dangerous being Moscow, how dangerous it is to be in Moscow prisons ... it is no place for her. I would call upon Russia at this time to really stop harassing U.S. citizens, but more importantly to release those that are there and to not claim any upper hand or any sense of character in the pillage of murder and terroristic actions against the Ukrainians.""

A timeline

The Daily Mail reported that Griner played for UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia before the WNBA took a two-week hiatus in early February for the FIBA World Cup qualifying tournaments. Griner was said to have ""made her last communication"" in posting a photo to Instagram on Feb. 5.

On Feb. 11, President Joe Biden called on all Americans to evacuate the region. It is believed she was taken into custody around that time, and by Feb. 24, Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

On March 5, the Russian Federal Customs Service announced that it detained a ""two-time Olympic basketball champion"" on suspicion of drugs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wife-of-russian-prisoner-and-wnba-star-brittney-griner-pleads-for-russia-to-return-star-home-as-fears-grow-that-putin-will-use-her-as-a-high-profile-hostage,2022-03-06
VIDEO: Three armed burglars target Houston homeowner for brazen robbery — but his wife has a gun too,"A surveillance video caught the harrowing robbery attempt by three armed men who targeted a Houston homeowner, but his wife shooed them away with her own gun.

The homeowner was working outside of his home the day before Thanksgiving, according to law enforcement authorities, when he noticed a black four-door car drive by slowly.

It made a sharp U-turn and two men rushed toward him.

The video shows one man with a mask and another man grab the homeowner while threatening him with a gun. A third man races in after pulling their car into the driveway.

Police say they dragged him into the house and demanded money. That's when his wife grabbed their gun after hearing the commotion.



She threatened to shoot the three men, who ran away when they saw her. They also fired shots at her but narrowly missed as they escaped.

Police say the three suspects are three black men between 30 and 32 years old, and between 5-foot-9 and 5-foot-11 in height. There is a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspects.

Here's the video of the startling altercation:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wife-with-a-gun-thwarts-home-invasion-in-houston,2019-12-18
Germany dismantles wind farm for coal mine expansion,"A wind farm in Germany is being demolished to make room for a coal mine expansion.

German energy giant RWE is tearing down wind turbines to expand a neighboring coal mine in an effort to deal with the country's energy crisis. The area of the wind farm near the small town of Lützerath will be used to expand the Garzweiler open pit mine in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The wind farm features eight wind turbines. One wind turbine was dismantled last week, two more are scheduled to be deconstructed some time next year, and the final five will be taken down by the end of 2023.

RWE officials admit that the move appears to be ""paradoxical.""

""We realize this comes across as paradoxical, but that is as matters stand,"" RWE spokesperson Guido Steffen said in a statement.

The Ministry of Economy of North Rhine-Westphalia added, “If Lützerath were to be preserved, the production volume required to maintain the security of supply over the next eight years could not be achieved, the stability of the opencast mine could not be guaranteed and the necessary recultivation could not be carried out.""

In addition, RWE will reactivate three lignite-fired coal units that were previously on standby.

""The three lignite units each have a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW). With their deployment, they contribute to strengthening the security of supply in Germany during the energy crisis and to saving natural gas in electricity generation,"" RWE said in September. ""Originally, it was planned that the three reserve power plant units affected would be permanently shut down on September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2023, respectively.""

Germany’s cabinet approved the decision to revive the unused coal units after energy prices skyrocketed because of the sanctions issued due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

North Rhine-Westphalia and RWE had previously declared they would stop using fossil fuels by 2030.

Climate change activists are furious about the transition from wind power to fossil fuels.

Last week, there were thousands of demonstrators who participated in protests against high energy prices in six German cities: Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Hanover, and Dresden.

As of September 2021, 60% of Germany's gas came from Russia, but last month it was down to zero.

Reuters reported, ""Germany imported 37.6% of gas from Norway in September compared with 19.2% in the same month last year, while Dutch deliveries climbed to 29.6% of imports from 13.7%, data from utility industry group BDEW showed.""

Last week, BASF – the world’s largest chemicals group by revenue – announced that the company will ""permanently"" downsize in Europe because high energy costs have made the region increasingly uncompetitive.

""The European chemical market has been growing only weakly for about a decade [and] the significant increase in natural gas and power prices over the course of this year is putting pressure on chemical value chains,” BASF chief executive Martin Brudermüller said on Wednesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wind-farm-germany-coal-mine,2022-10-31

Woman grabs gun after discovering intruder in her home late at night. Then he approaches her — and it's his final mistake.,"A woman told deputies she was asleep in her Lucerne Valley, California, home overnight Tuesday when she her dog started barking, which woke her up, KTVU-TV reported.

She entered a bedroom where she saw a man hiding, after which she told San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies she became frightened and yelled at the man that he didn't belong inside her home, the station said.

The homeowner then went to her living room and armed herself with a gun, deputies told KTVU.

Fearing for her safety



Authorities said the intruder approached her, and — fearing for her safety — she fired once and hit the suspect, the station reported.

Deputies responded to the residence just before 12:30 a.m. and found the shot suspect, later identified as 32-year-old Shea Manigult, KTVU said. Deputies and emergency medical personnel tried life-saving measures, but the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene, the station reported.

Detectives determined that Manigult had forced entry into the home prior to the victim finding him in the bedroom, KTVU said.

The victim has not been arrested, the station said, adding that the case will be given to the District Attorney's Office for review.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-grabs-gun-after-discovering-intruder-in-her-home-late-at-night-then-he-approaches-her-and-its-his-final-mistake,2019-06-27
"'I don't want to shoot him, but I'm going to have to!': Woman on 911 call repeatedly warns burglar to leave her home before firing gun","A Florida woman shot a burglar who broke into her Deltona home early Tuesday morning after warning him repeatedly to leave while on a 911 call, Volusia County Sheriff's officials told the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

Joseph Roberts, 32, can be seen shattering one of the home's windows just before 5:45 a.m. in a video surveillance recording released by the sheriff's office, the paper said, after which he climbed into the house.

Soon after, the 42-year-old homeowner confronted Roberts, the News-Journal said.

""I don't want to shoot him, but I'm going to have to!"" the homeowner was heard hollering to a dispatcher, according to the News-Journal. ""Get out of my window! Get out of my window!""

The woman fired one shot and hit Roberts in the arm, after which she then escaped to the back yard with her three children and three of their friends, the paper said.

Roberts remained in the house where responding deputies found him, Sheriff's spokesman Andrew Gant told the News-Journal.

What happened afterward?

Roberts was airlifted to a hospital with injuries that weren't life threatening, sheriff's deputies told the paper, adding that he's charged with four counts of burglary of an occupied dwelling and four counts of criminal mischief.

"Woman, 69, shoots home intruder dead after warning him multiple times to leave, stop moving toward her: 'I had to do what I had to do'","A 69-year-old woman fatally shot a man who entered her home near Orlando, Florida, on Sunday afternoon after warning him several times to leave and — at the very end — to stop advancing toward her, WKMG-TV reported.

What happened?

A man in his 30s entered the home in the 6500 block of Bentwood Street around 12:30 p.m. and startled homeowner Virginia Morrison, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office told WKMG.

She told the station in an interview that she told the man to leave, but he didn't respond to her commands. In fact, Morrison said the man — whom she had never seen before — didn't made a sound or ""bat an eyelash"" the entire time.

“Something wasn’t right with the man,” she told WKMG. “He had a blank look on his face.”

Morrison added that she even hit the intruder in the face with the straw end of her broom, threw her cellphone at him, and her fiance even fired a shot at his feet — and the man never moved.

“I said, ‘I’m getting my damn gun.’ So I went to my bedroom and got my gun, and I went out the back door, and I came to the fence, and he sees me, and he starts toward me,” Morrison told the station. “I fired a shot above him then said, ‘Back off, dude. I’ll shoot you.’ And he kept coming toward me, so I shot him.”

The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, deputies told WKMG, which added that his name has not been released.

“I feel sorry for his family, but I had to do what I had to do,” Morrison added in her interview with the station.

She also told WKMG it was the first time she ever had used her gun and added a warning for other homeowners: “Keep your doors locked. Anybody can walk into your house now. I killed a man. I didn’t intend to do that. I’m trying to protect me and [my fiance].”

Morrison added to the station that her door — which she typically locks — was open because she thought her fiance was outside.

What happened next?

The man was hospitalized for a shot to his right side, the paper said, adding that police contacted the woman who voluntarily came to the police station for questioning.

Sgt. Chris Copeland told the Herald & Review the woman had several injuries to her face from the man battering her.

The man was arrested and is facing preliminary charges of domestic battery and unlawful vehicular invasion, the paper said, adding that he posted $10,000 bond.

But the woman — who's not facing charges for the shooting — is facing a preliminary charge of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon for lack of a concealed carry license, the Herald & Review reported. She was being held in lieu of $75,000, the paper added.

"'I just shot him out of the house': Woman who never fired her gun before wounds burglar who's now behind bars — and she tells other women to get armed, too","A North Carolina woman who had never fired her gun before took aim and pulled the trigger Tuesday morning, wounding a burglar who busted into her home — and now the crook is behind bars.

What are the details?

Tarika McAllister, 29, woke up before 6 a.m. to her dog barking and a loud bang at the back of her home on Bear Lane in Dunn, WRAL-TV reported.



Then she saw a man taking some of her belongings and trying to steal her dog — and she was all by herself, the station said.

McAllister hollered at the man to get out, to no avail, WRAL said. So she opted to let her gun do the talking.

McAllister told WRAL she had never before used the gun she stores — but that was about to change.



“All I did was turn around and grab the gun,"" McAllister told the station. ""I was fumbling with it. It’s my first time using it.”

Despite the terror of it all, WRAL said McAllister had the presence of mind to turn off the safety and take control of the ordeal.

""I just lifted it up, and I started shooting at him, wherever he was moving to, I just shot him out of the house,” she told the station.



WRAL said Malihk Giles was found about 200 yards from the home with a gunshot wound to his right lower leg and a superficial gunshot wound to his right side.

Giles was taken into custody, the station said, and after his wounds were treated at a hospital, he was taken to Harnett County Detention Center under a $75,000 secured bond on charges of first-degree burglary and possession of stolen property. Giles, 20, was still in jail Friday morning.

McAllister and Giles do not know each other, WRAL said.

She says women should arm themselves for protection

McAllister added to the station that women should arm themselves for protection.

“I know a lot of women are scared of guns,"" she told WRAL. ""I feel those are the best protectors for us because we can’t fight a man. We can’t fight an intruder off.”



McAllister said three weeks ago a man tried to steal from her house, but she was able to scare him away, the station said.

Although she admitted that she's ""still shook up"" and it's difficult to be by herself right now, McAllister told WRAL she feels ""stronger"" now — and better prepared if another home invasion occurs.

""I took action, and I'm very proud of myself that I stood up for myself, as a woman,"" she told the station, adding that ""I did what I had to do, and I’m glad I did what I did.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-wounds-burglar-whos-now-behind-bars,2022-10-07
Women file lawsuit claiming hospital secretly filmed them during childbirth and other gynecological procedures,"More than 80 women have filed a lawsuit against a California hospital for allegedly recording them without their knowledge during childbirth or while undergoing surgery.

What happened?

According to the lawsuit filed Friday in a California Supreme Court, 81 women claimed that their privacy was invaded — without their knowledge — when they were secretly recorded during procedures at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa between July 2012 and June 2013, the New York Post reported.

The lawsuit accused the hospital of filming the women while they were ""undergoing operations of a very personal private nature.""

The hospital said motion-activated laptop cameras were installed in the gynecology department's operating rooms after drugs went missing from anesthesia carts.

The cameras reportedly captured more than 15,000 videos and allegedly recorded about 1,800 women over the nearly yearlong surveillance period.

What did the hospital say?

The cameras were intended to catch those who were stealing medications, Sharp Healthcare said in a statement Monday.

Between July 2012 and June 2013, a computer monitor with a motion-activated camera was installed in each of Sharp Grossmont Hospital's three Women's Center operating rooms, where it was previously detected that powerful drugs were missing from the anesthesia carts,"" the company wrote. The three cameras were installed and operated to ensure patient safety by identifying the person or persons responsible for the removal of the drugs.

Woman says Wordle saved her life after home invader broke in and held her hostage for 17 hours,"An elderly woman from Chicago, Illinois, is crediting local law enforcement and the popular online game, Wordle, for playing key parts in saving her life after a disturbed man broke into her home and held her hostage for 17 hours.

What happened?

Denyse Holt, 80, recounted the harrowing experience to WBBM-TV this week. She had reportedly been lying asleep in bed when a strange naked man shattered a window and entered her Lincolnwood home on Monday, Feb. 6.

The intruder, later identified as 32-year-old James H. Davis III, approached Holt and got into bed with her. Then he ordered her to take a shower with him, and then a bath.

After that, the troubled kidnapper led Holt around her own home, grabbing knives, disconnecting phones, and leaving trails of blood from the open wounds he suffered while breaking in. Holt said she just tried to remain calm.

""I was trying to survive that’s all,"" Holt said. ""He said, ‘I won’t harm you or molest you.'""

Eventually, he shut her in the basement bathroom and barricaded the door. For the next several hours, Holt remained in the darkness of the bathroom. She said marched and stretched as much as she could, nervously passing the time.

""I didn’t think I was going to live,"" Holt recalled.

Then what?

Meanwhile, her family was beginning to suspect that something was off.

Her oldest daughter, Meredith Holt-Caldwell, who lives in Seattle, saw that her mother was not reading her texts and also hadn't sent her an update that morning about Wordle. The online word game generates a new five-letter word every day for users to guess using clues and the process of elimination.

""I didn’t send my older daughter a Wordle in the morning, and that was disconcerting to her,"" Holt explained to WBBM.

Convinced that something was wrong, friends and family called Lincolnwood police and asked them to perform a welfare check.

When police arrived at the home at approximately 9:40 p.m. Monday night, they realized that an intruder had entered. An hours-long standoff ensued, but eventually, the SWAT team charged into the home and subdued Davis.

What else?

Davis is now reportedly in custody under felony charges of home invasion with a dangerous weapon, aggravated kidnapping while armed with a dangerous weapon, and aggravated assault against a peace officer.

Holt's daughter told the news outlet, ""I never thought in a million years this is what was happening, but it was.""

Holt added, ""I’m very lucky,"" but wanted to make sure to thank the law enforcement officers who rescued her.

""I can’t say enough good things. They were beyond wonderful,"" she said.

Xi Jinping sends a message to Kim Jong-Un seeking to promote friendly relations and build 'a new situation' that changes the global pecking order,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has reached out to the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, seeking to promote friendly relations.

Xi sent a message to Kim saying that the Chinese government was ready to come to a “common understanding” with North Korean leadership as the two nations work to build supportive and friendly relations under “a new situation,” Fox News reported.

Xi’s message to his North Korean counterpart was in response to Kim congratulating Chinese leadership at the close of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, “In the message, the respected Comrade Kim Jong-Un extended heartfelt warm congratulations to General Secretary Xi Jinping upon the splendid proceeding of the Beijing Winter Olympics as a novel and special grand sports festival.”

Despite enthusiastically applauding the Chinese Olympics, North Korea was prohibited from participating by the International Olympic Committee over the country refusal to participate in last Summer’s Tokyo Olympic Games over COVID-19 concerns.

Kim said that North Korea and China are “frustrating the undisguised hostile policy and military threat of the U.S. and its satellite forces by strengthening the bilateral strategic cooperation and unity.”

The North Korean leader said he was committed to “more firmly consolidate the [North Korea]-China relationship into the invincible one.”

The message of friendship between the two communist countries came just one day after Xi offered his “support” to Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

During the Beijing Winter Olympics, Xi and Putin had an in-person meeting where the two leaders agreed to cooperate and potentially advance each other’s goals.

They issued a joint statement that said, “Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.”

This agreement between China and Russia marks the most detailed and aggressive statement the two countries have made as they collaborate to unseat the United States as the global hegemon.

In recent days, North Korea has allegedly resumed development and testing ballistic missiles as it continues developing nuclear weapons.

Business Insider reported that Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said, “frequent launches” have been coming from North Korea since the outset of 2022. The minister believes that North Korean leadership resumed testing its missiles this winter because the international community was more focused on the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine.

He said, “If North Korea deliberately carried out the missile launch while the international community is distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, such an act is absolutely unforgivable.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/xi-jinping-sends-a-message-to-kim-jong-un-seeking-to-promote-friendly-relations-and-build-a-new-situation-that-changes-the-global-pecking-order,2022-02-27
"Yahoo rejects political ad that features the phrase 'Let's Go Brandon,' because the expression 'would be considered overly inflammatory and offensive'","Yahoo is rejecting U.S. Senate hopeful Jim Lamon's advertisement that includes the phrase ""Let's Go Brandon.""

Fox News reported that it obtained an email exchange in which Yahoo turned down the ad.

""We would not be able to approve this ad due to the use of 'Let's Go Brandon,' which would be considered overly inflammatory and offensive. If that is excluded we would be able to approve it,"" a Yahoo manager informed TAG Strategies on Wednesday, according to Fox News, ""If that is excluded we would be able to approve.""

The ""Let's Go Brandon"" political meme, which is a euphemism for the profane phrase ""F*** Joe Biden,"" rapidly achieved popularity on the political right last year.

The veiled jab at the president had its genesis when a reporter was interviewing NASCAR driver Brandon Brown after Brown had just won a race.

As the reporter was speaking, the crowd was chanting, ""F*** Joe Biden.""

But the reporter remarked, ""you can hear the chants from the, the crowd — let's go Brandon.""

""If you are pissed off about the direction of our country, let's go. If you're ready to secure the border and stop the invasion, let's go,"" Lamon says in the video. ""Let's take the fight to Joe Biden and show him we the people put America first. The time is now. Let's go Brandon.""

Fire erupts at Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine during Russian shelling; firefighters are under gunfire,"Editor's note: The original version of this story, based on reporting at the time, said that a projectile struck a non-operational reactor at the plant. Subsequent reports have clarified that only non-reactor buildings were struck. There is no indication at this time that there was ever a risk of radiation leak due to the attack.



A fire has broken out at Europe's largest nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine, and firefighters are reportedly unable to reach the site because they're being shot at by the Russian military.

Officials are worried that if the facility is damaged, it could result in a nuclear disaster. The plant supplies about 25% of the country's energy.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said that a Ukrainian regulator reported no elevated radiation levels yet at the plant.



Tuz went on to say that firefighters have been unable to reach the fire site because they are being fired upon.

""We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,"" Tuz warned. ""There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.""

Video from a livestream at the plant appeared to show explosions and a fire but it was too blurry and grainy to see much detail. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted that Russian soldiers had breached the main building at the plant but he later said that there were conflicting reports.

The claim that the firefighters were being shot at was made in a Facebook post by Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Energodar where the plant is located.

Ukraine was also the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history at the Chernobyl nuclear energy plant in 1986 when the country was under control of the Soviet Union. That site was captured by the Russians earlier in the invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky decries NATO's refusal to establish no-fly zone,"As Ukraine strives to defend itself against a Russian invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared that NATO will have blood on its hands for declining to establish a no-fly zone.

While the quotes, which appear to be translated, vary in different reports, CNN reported that Zelenskyy said, ""All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity."" The outlet also reported that Zelenskyy said the leadership of NATO has given ""the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages, refusing to make a no-fly zone.""

Zelenskyy's pointed remarks come as Ukrainians bravely fight to defend their nation in the face of a destructive and deadly Russian onslaught.



During a news conference following a meeting of foreign ministers, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that ""allies agree"" there should not be NATO aircraft flying in Ukraine's airspace or NATO troops in Ukraine.

"Zelenskyy addresses Congress, calls for 'no-fly zone' amid Ukraine's 'darkest time'","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Congress Wednesday morning. In his speech, Zelenskyy pleaded with the American leadership to ""do more"" to support Ukraine as the West locks arms in defiance of Russia's ongoing invasion.

Choosing to remain in his country's capital city of Kyiv, Zelenskyy addressed American lawmakers via teleconference.

Zelenskyy thanked the United States for its ""sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine"" but insisted that American leadership could still do more.

He said, ""However, now it is true in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more.""

In his speech, Zelenskyy called on the United States to implement and enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, provide additional aircraft and military defense systems to the country, and create a new security alliance that would reshape the global balance of power.

Zelenskyy also appealed to President Biden, as his American counterpart, and insisted that he take up the mantle of ""leader of the world"" and defend other nations that wish to be free.

""I'm addressing President Biden,"" he said, ""You, the leader of your nation, I wish you to be the leader of the world.""

""Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace,"" Zelenskyy added.

The Ukrainian president called on American lawmakers to recall September 11, 2001, when ""independent territories"" became ""battlefields"" and ""when innocent people were attacked – attacked from the air.""

He asked them to reflect on the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor that dragged the United States into the Second World War, saying that ""in [America's] great history you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians understand us right now when we need you right now.""

Zelenskyy said, ""Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it.""

Zelenskyy used these events to connect the United States' past suffering to the ongoing bombardment that Ukrainian cities currently endue.

""You could not stop it,"" he continued, ""Our country experiences the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now, various Ukrainian cities.""

Zelenskyy proceeded to implore the United States to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace. He said that Russian forces ""use drones to kill us with precision.""

He asked Congress, ""Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?""

""You know that they exist, and you have them, but … not in Ukraine, not in Ukrainian sky,"" Zelenskyy added, ""They do not defend our people.""

Zelenskyy's calls for a no-fly zone appear to have had some effect, as prominent members of Congress prepare to pressure Biden to implement one.

"Zelenskyy headline US military conference, ask defense contractors for more weapons for Ukraine","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address the most important U.S. defense contractors at a significant military conference in the United States later this month. Zelenskyy will be a keynote speaker at the military conference in Austin, Texas.

Zelenskyy and H.E. Oleksii Reznikov – Ukraine’s Minister of Defense – will speak virtually at the National Defense Industrial Association's annual Future Force Capabilities Conference and Exhibition on Sept. 21.

Reuters said Zelenskyy is ""expected to make an appeal for more weapons for his country's defense against Russia.""

Zelenskyy will speak during the Future Force Capabilities Conference and Exhibition as ""he rallies international support for his country's fight against the Russian invasion,"" according to the press release.

""Zelenskyy is expected to discuss Ukrainian defense needs and the critical primacy of the United States in advanced technology and hardware for the fight,"" NDIA added. ""His speech marks a rare moment for the Eastern European leader, as he directly addresses American military leaders and the defense industrial base.""

Zelenskyy will have an opportunity to speak directly to some of the most important American military manufacturers. NDIA's has board members from defense industry behemoths such as Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and L3Harris Technologies.

Raytheon and Lockheed Martin jointly produce Javelin antitank weapons that have been used by Ukraine against invading Russian forces.

The Hon. David L. Norquist – NDIA’s president and CEO – said of Zelenskyy, ""NDIA commends the inspiring and courageous stand that President Zelenskyy, H.E. Roznikov, and all of Ukraine have taken against Russia’s invasion. Together with the administration, Congress, allies, and partners, we will continue to support Ukrainians in their efforts to secure lasting freedom.""

On the organization's website, the National Defense Industrial Association said it ""drives strategic dialogue in national security by identifying key issues and leveraging the knowledge and experience of its military, government, industry, and academic members to address them.""

""For more than 100 years, NDIA has provided a platform through which leaders in government, industry, and academia can collaborate and provide solutions to advance the national security and defense needs of the nation,"" the NDIA website stated.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the U.S. was sending $2.8 billion more in aid for Ukraine and other European countries threatened by Russia.

Also on Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the U.S. was sending $675 million in heavy weaponry, ammunition, armored vehicles, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine.

The U.S. government has approved over $53 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, according to The Hill.

Reuters reported on Saturday, ""Ukraine is negotiating for a $1.5 billion loan tranche from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to purchase natural gas, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Telegram on Saturday in a summary of a call with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-defense-industry-conference-weapons-aid-ukraine,2022-09-10
Ukraine says kill squad sent to assassinate president has been 'destroyed',"A Ukrainian defense official announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces, according to a Telegram post from Ukrainian authorities.

Oleksiy Danilov, chief of the country's National Security and Defense Council, reportedly said during a briefing on Tuesday that Ukrainian officials had recently been made aware of a ""special operation"" that was to be carried out against Zelenskyy by an elite Chechen special forces unit, known as the Kadyrovites.

The Kadyrovites are a highly-skilled paramilitary organization in Chechnya, a semiautonomous republic in Russia, that often carry out violence at Russian President Vladimir Putin's request. According to National Review, they are accused of a number of human rights violations and abuses.

Danilov said Ukrainian leaders were tipped off about the assassination plot by a group of sympathetic Russian agents with the enemy country's Federal Security Service.

""We are well aware of the special operation that was to take place directly by the Kadyrovites to eliminate our president. And I can say that we have received information from the FSB, who today do not want to take part in this bloody war. And thanks to this, I can say that Kadyrov's elite group was destroyed directly, which came here to eliminate our president,"" Danilov said, according to a Google translation of the Telegram.

The Ukrainian leader went on to say that the Kadyrovite group had been divided in two, with one being destroyed in Gostomel, near Kyiv, while the other was ""under fire.""

The Washington Post reported that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov confirmed on Monday in a Telegram post that two of his servicemen had died while six others were injured during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, neither the Chechens nor the Kremlin has attributed the losses to a foiled assassination attempt.

Since the launch of the invasion, Zelenskyy has claimed that Russian forces designated him and his family as top targets in the offensive and that Russian kill squads were actively seeking to assassinate him. Nevertheless, he vowed to remain in the capital, Kyiv, and stand alongside his people.

Even when the U.S. government reportedly offered to evacuate Zelenskyy out of harm's way, the president stood by his decision to stay.

Zelenskyy rejects the possibility of a Ukrainian ceasefire despite Putin's openness as grain supply issues threaten global food shortages,"This weekend, the leaders of France and Germany pleaded with Russian President Vladimir Putin for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine to no avail as Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy each refused to make concessions to their counterparts and end the fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pleaded with Putin to begin “serious direct negotiations” with Zelenskyy to reach a “diplomatic solution to the conflict,” the New York Post reported.

In response, Putin said that the West is complicit in perpetuating the violence because of its “dangerous” efforts to supply Ukraine with munitions, military equipment, and financial support. Putin warned Macron and Scholz that the West’s continued support for Ukraine risks “aggravation of the humanitarian crisis.”

Scholz and Macron also sought the release of 2,500 prisoners of war captured by Russian forces and an end to the Russian blockade of the port of Odessa. Ending the blockade of this port is crucial to normalizing global agricultural supply chains as it normally handles millions of tons of grain each year.

Despite Putin’s insistence of “the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue” with Ukraine, the Russian president moved forward with efforts to expand the size of his military and signed new legislation that will eliminate the upper age limit of the men recruited by the Russian military.

The new law passed the Russian Duma on Wednesday and will allow Russian citizens over the age of 40 to enlist. It also removes restrictions that previously limited the Kremlin’s hiring of foreign mercenary fighters.

Zelenskyy, who spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently, said that the ongoing invasion of Ukraine could cause a global food crisis.

Zelenskyy said, “We must work together to prevent a food crisis and unblock [Ukrainian] ports.”

Nearly 22 million tons of grains are stranded in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to blockade Odessa and other ports, Zelenskyy confirmed.

As fighting continues in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Russia has claimed victory over Ukrainian cities and continues to advance forces throughout the region, Zelenskyy refused to accept any possible ceasefire that would forefit lands previsouly belonging to Ukraine. Echoing previous statements, Zelenskyy promised that Donbas would be “Ukrainian again.”

Zelenskyy said, “We have to increase our defense, increase our resistance, and Donbas will be Ukrainian again. Even if Russia will bring all suffering and ruination to Donbas, we will rebuild every town, every community. There’s no real alternative.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-rejects-the-possibility-of-a-ukrainian-ceasefire-despite-putin-s-openness-as-grain-supply-issues-threaten-global-food-shortages,2022-05-28

The foundation said Zelenskyy is the eleventh recipient of the honor, which it described as its ""highest recognition.""

Zelenskyy is being recognized ""for his courageous fight against tyranny and for his indomitable stance for freedom and democracy,"" according to the foundation.

Zelenskyy says he will continue pursuing peace despite atrocities committed by Russian forces,"Despite the potential war crimes carried out by the Russian military on the people of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he would continue to push for peace.

The New York Post reported that Zelenskyy said, “No one wants to negotiate with a person or people who tortured this nation. It’s all understandable. And as a man, as a father, I understand this very well.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensely condemned for possible war crimes carried out by the Russian military that were uncovered as its forces withdrew from the areas around Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.

As they regained ground in the areas surrounding Kyiv, Ukrainian forces uncovered mass graves filled with civilians in the suburbs surrounding the city. They also found surface streets littered with the corpses of civilians.

Many of the slaughtered civilians bore marks of torture and execution. Civilian bodies were found with their hands tied behind their backs, and many had seemingly fatal gunshot wounds at the base of their skulls.

Russian forces have also bombed civilian gathering places such as train stations and medical facilities.

Zelenskyy said, “We don’t want to lose opportunities, if we have them, for a diplomatic solution.”

He added, “We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war.”

The Russian forces that withdrew from Kyiv are currently believed to be regathering in preparation for an attack on Donbas in Ukraine’s eastern region.

Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces currently fighting their Russian counterparts in the eastern regions of Ukraine are in “the heart of the war.”

He said, “It’s beating. We’re fighting. We’re strong. And if it stops beating, we will be in a weaker position.”

Zelenskyy is reportedly frustrated with the lack of military equipment being supplied to Ukraine by the U.S. and its allies in Western Europe. He indicated that he was grateful for what had been done for his country but suggested that much more needed to be done by the wealthy nations allied with Ukraine.

He said, “Of course, it’s not enough,” when asked whether the supplies his country had been given up to this point was enough to turn the tide of the war in Ukraine’s favor.

Despite Zelenskyy’s insistence that he is actively working to make peace with his Russian adversaries, when presented with the opportunity to make peace in mid-March he rejected the offer.

Israeli leadership, serving as diplomatic emissaries, conveyed to Zelenskyy that if Ukraine were to alter its constitution in a way that permanently committed the country from joining NATO, recognized Crimea as Russian territory, and recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, then Russia would end its invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-says-he-will-continue-pursuing-peace-despite-atrocities-committed-by-russian-forces,2022-04-10
"Zelenskyy vows revenge after Russian forces murder fleeing mother, 2 children: 'We will find every bastard' who attacked our people","In an impassioned address following the death of a mother and her two children who were attempting to flee a battle zone, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to hunt down ""every bastard"" who has attacked his people during Russia's unprovoked invasion.

What are the details?

News of the Ukrainian family's tragic death spread online over the weekend as snapshots poured in depicting Russia's assault on civilians attempting to cross a damaged bridge near the Irpin River as the fighting moved closer to their homes.

Photos and video obtained by the New York Times and others showed mortar fire hit the bridge as families ran across, killing four people: A mother, her teenage son and 8-year-old daughter, and a male family member.

Zelenskyy raged against the heinous attack on Sunday.

""A family was killed in Irpin today. A man, a woman, and two children. Right on the road, when they were just trying to get out of town, to escape,"" the president said, according to the Guardian. ""The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget.""

""We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed 'start,'"" Zelenskyy continued.

""There will be no quiet place on this Earth for you, except for the grave,"" he threatened.

What else?

Elsewhere in the broadcast, Zelenskyy reportedly called on the west to do more to aid Ukraine as his people suffer under Russian atrocities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has continued to deny reports that his military is targeting civilian populations, but reports showing otherwise have surfaced frequently since the start of the invasion.

That latest attack on the damaged bridge connecting Irpin to Kyiv constituted an obvious murder, according to the Ukrainian leader. For days, families in Irpin and surrounding towns have been milling around the bridge, which has served as a last line of escape from areas where Russian troops are pressing in on the capital.

Multiple outlets reported that an attack on the bridge could not have been anything other than a targeted civilian attack.

""This is murder. Deliberate murder. And I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today,"" Zelenskyy said during the Sunday broadcast, the New York Post reported.

He added that the ""audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal that sanctions against Russia are not enough.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-vows-revenge-after-russian-forces-murder-fleeing-mother-2-children,2022-03-07
Zelenskyy warns of a 'third World War' if peace talks with Putin don't succeed,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin fail, it will mark the beginning of “a third World War.”

While speaking with CNN host Fareed Zakaria, Zelenskyy said that he is “ready for negotiations” with Putin to try to end the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I’m ready for negotiations with him,” Zelenskyy said through a translator. “I was ready for the last two years.”

“I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,” he added.

Zelenskyy went on to say that he would try any method of negotiation that would bring about an end to the conflict. He suggested that if it didn’t come to an end through negotiation, the conflict would lead to greater calamity.

He said, “We have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin, but if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.”

Noting that diplomatic dialogue does not always yield immediate results that please public appetites, Zelensky said, “All the people that think this dialogue is shallow, that is not going to resolve anything, they just don’t understand that this is very valuable.”

He added, “If there is just [a] one percent chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance. We need to do that.”

During the interview with Zakaria, Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian military is digging its heels in and fighting back against Russian forces, dealing a “powerful blow” to the invading army.

Zelenskyy also lamented the ongoing loss of life being caused by the conflict.

He said, “In any case we are losing people on a daily basis, innocent people on the ground. Russian forces have come to exterminate us, and to kill us.”

“We have demonstrated the dignity of our people and our arm that we are able to deal a powerful blow,” he continued, “We are able to strike back, but unfortunately our dignity is not going to preserve the lives.”

It is likely that the bloodshed will continue as neither side appears willing to give in to the demands of their counterparts.

Previously, Russian leadership offered to end its invasion of Ukraine if Ukraine agreed to cease military actions, change its constitution to ensure its neutrality on the geopolitical stage, recognize Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize the currently Russian-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy rejected this offer.

The soldiers were defending the small island of Zmiinyi located in the Black Sea. A Russian warship ordered them to lay down their arms and surrender peacefully.

""This is a Russian military ship. I suggest you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise we will open fire on you,"" the Russians reportedly told them via radio.

""Russian warship, go f*** yourself!"" was the reply.

The Russians opened fire on the island and killed all 13 soldiers.

""All the defenders of the island of Zmiinyi died, but did not surrender,"" the president later confirmed.

""All of them will be named Heroes of Ukraine,"" he said.

A reported recording of the exchange was posted to social media and was widely circulated.

The incident was compared by some to that of the 300 Spartans in antiquity who died defending their homeland against invading hoards of Persia. Zmiinyi island translated to English means Snake island, inspiring some to draw parallels to America's own Gadsden flag.

""May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever,"" said Zelenskyy.

Putin is fighting a battle on his home front as well as anti-invasion protests have roared to life on Russian soil. Some reports say as many as 17,000 people have already been arrested in the demonstrations flaring up across Russia.

'Creepy technology': Zoom reportedly may develop AI tool that detects user emotions on video calls. Human rights groups call it invasion of privacy.,"Video-conferencing outfit Zoom reportedly may develop an artificial intelligence tool that detects users' emotions by scanning facial expressions and examining vocal tones — but human rights groups are saying such technology would be invasion of privacy, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported.

The outlet said tech publication Protocol reported on the subject last month.

What are the details?

But more than 25 groups — including Access Now, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Muslim Justice League — on Wednesday sent a joint letter to Zoom chief executive Eric Yuan against the idea, the Thomson Reuters Foundation said.

""If Zoom advances with these plans, this feature will discriminate against people of certain ethnicities and people with disabilities, hardcoding stereotypes into millions of devices,"" Caitlin Seeley George — director of campaign and operations at Fight for the Future, a digital rights group — said, according to TRF. ""Beyond mining users for profit and allowing businesses to capitalize on them, this technology could take on far more sinister and punitive uses.""

The Thomson Reuters Foundation said Zoom didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

More from TRF:

Zoom Video Communications Inc emerged as a major video conferencing platform around the world during COVID-19 lockdowns as education and work shifted online, reporting more than 200 million daily users at the height of the pandemic in 2020.



The company has already built tools that purport to analyze the sentiment of meetings based on text transcripts of video calls, and according to Protocol it also plans to explore more advanced emotion reading tools across its products.

Zoom in a blog post said sentiment analysis technology can measure the ""emotional tone of the conversations"" to help salespeople do a better job, TRF reported.

However, the letter from the human rights groups said detection of users' emotions ""is a violation of privacy and human rights"" and that ""Zoom needs to halt plans to advance this feature,"" TRF added.

'Creepy technology'

The outlet said emotional recognition tools are increasingly common even though critics compare it to facial recognition tools, which have high error rates on non-white faces and have resulted in wrongful arrests.

Esha Bhandari — deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project — called emotion detection AI ""junk science,"" TRF said.

""There is no good reason for Zoom to mine its users' facial expressions, vocal tones, and eye movements to develop this creepy technology,"" Bhandari told the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zoom-ai-emotion-detection-tool,2022-05-18
WTF MSM!? NY Times stops pretending it’s an unbiased source of news,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Narrative-setting …

Conservatives have known for decades that The New York Times is not an unbiased source of news. As TheBlaze's Chris Enloe reported on Saturday, freshly leaked transcripts of a Times editorial meeting show how NY Times executive editor Dean Baquet is openly directing biased coverage of President Trump.

Now that the Russian collusion narrative the Times and the rest of the MSM have pushed for years has been busted, Baquet said that the Times needs to ""regroup, and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story."" That new story is painting Trump and the ""forces that led to the election of Donald Trump"" as racist.

Baquet explained the new focus to his team.

As Audra Burch said when I talked to her this weekend, this one is a story about what it means to be an American in 2019. It is a story that requires deep investigation into people who peddle hatred, but it is also a story that requires imaginative use of all our muscles to write about race and class in a deeper way than we have in years. In the coming weeks, we'll be assigning some new people to politics who can offer different ways of looking at the world. We'll also ask reporters to write more deeply about the country, race, and other divisions. I really want your help in navigating this story.

Before any other news happens, the Times has given its team a new framework for covering President Trump, and that's through the lens of racism and division.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) slammed the Times after this revelation. Cruz said, ""There was a time when journalists covered 'news.' The NYT has given up on even pretending anymore. Today, they are Pravda, a propaganda outlet by liberals, for liberals.""

It's not just coverage of Trump. The Times recently launched the ""1619"" project to argue that America was founded on slavery. It also gave Obama a pass on his handling of Iran while attacking Trump's response to the protests in Hong Kong.

Media Research Center President Brent Bozell appeared on Fox Business Monday to argue that the Times has thrown up its hands and stopped reporting news. He's absolutely right.

8 practical steps to stop the border surge,"The situation along the southwestern border has long surpassed unsustainable or emergency levels and has ventured into uncharted, untenable waters. Looking back, the situation at the border that led to the five-week partial government shutdown now appears to be child's play.

What started out, around this time last year, as confusion over radical court rulings regarding prosecutions at the border and children being separated from parents has morphed into a full-scale invasion and the breakdown of our duly passed immigration laws.

Now is not the time for blame, half-truth, or half-measures. It's the time to decisively act! Nibbling around the edges on peripheral aspects of this issue might have worked to stem the greater tide a year ago, but the present situation calls for a complete shutoff at the border.

On Monday, the White House announced a new directive for the Department of Homeland Security and the attorney general to establish fees for asylum requests, to end work permits for those coming in at the border, and to establish regulations to adjudicate claims within 180 days. These measures are either vague, long overdue, and/or deal with the tangential aspects of the invasion and further accede to the premise that we can adjudicate our way out of this invasion.

The DHS not only releasing hundreds of thousands of aliens, but providing them with work permits was an egregious policy of the Obama administration and was never even promulgated in a formal regulation. It should never have been continued by this administration. Yet the Trump administration handed out 750,000 work permits to bogus asylum-seekers or those presumed to have a credible fear. And that was just through last September, before the large numbers began coming over.

Even now, the president is calling on DHS to ""propose regulations"" barring work permits rather than immediately terminating Obama's policy today. And while getting rid of this horrible policy is certainly a welcome move, it merely removes one gratuitous act of fanning the flames; it doesn't extinguish the flames by flatly denying all credible fear at the border, as is within the president's power.

Charging fees for applications could theoretically deter many of those migrants who lack any funds (after spending it all on cartel smugglers), but few of them are actually applying for asylum anyway and are still being released rather than returned or detained. Also, absent a directive to place all these people in expedited removal and dispose of their credible fear claims with a rocket docket in tent cities, it's unlikely enforcement personnel will deport those who simply lack the funds to pay the fee, although that point is still unclear.

As for adjudicating the cases within 180 days, again, the president is not required to adjudicate bogus claims. In fact, he has the full power to immediately turn them down at the border, and immigration law requires that any appeal be dispensed with ideally within 24 hours and at most within seven days. That is current law. A mix of empowering Border Patrol to immediately deny credible fear claims, the creation of tent cities and a rocket docket for appeals, use of expedited removal, and the discretion to rewrite Flores and implement the changes would solve this problem within seven days. Absent those reforms, nothing will change, and claimants won't be deported even within 180 days.

Nothing in this directive explicitly excludes these measures, and they might very well be a part of the plan, but the wording provides us with no new insight. It's possible the administration might be biding time to implement something more robust but didn't want anything definitive on paper so that the American Civil Liberties Union can't get a head start crafting lawsuits.

Either way, these are all debates about how to plow ahead with the asylum process in the long run. What we need is a complete shutoff of all immigration requests at our border, a power the president holds absolutely and unconditionally, in order to deal with the catastrophe now.

In addition, we need several backup plans both to enforce the shutoff and as alternatives if the administration chooses to abide by the inevitable illegal universal injunction from the next California judge.

Below are recommendations made within the framework of current statutes in the Immigration and Nationality Act to implement my ideas to deter, defend, and demagnetize.

No. 1: When Congress gave the president power (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)) to shut off all or any form of immigration for any amount of time at will when he believes it's ""detrimental to the interests of the United States,"" it certainly never envisioned anything near this obvious and severe. Between empowering our enemies in the cartels, flooding the country with drugs and gangs, creating strategic diversions, the public charge, the birthright citizenship, the diseases, the sex trafficking and stash houses, and the money-making for evil-doers, we have overshot the criterion of ""detrimental"" by a factor of one thousand. It's time for the president to immediately announce, in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), the closing of the country (southwestern border, northern border, both coasts, and interior ports of entry) to any and all aliens who do not already possess a U.S. immigrant or nonimmigrant visa (or who are from a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) country) and a passport, and who are not inadmissible per the section, as determined by CBP. This means no new defensive asylum applications will be accepted, as was the case with the Haitians in 1993 when the Supreme Court upheld this power in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council Inc.

No. 2: Advertise No. 1 on radio, in print ads, handbills, and billboards in the Northern Triangle. This is what the Obama administration did to shut down the flow of UACs from Central America in 2014.

No. 3: Return any alien entering illegally from a contiguous country to that country using the Alien Exit Transfer Program and those from non-contiguous ones to their country of origin. For aliens who return to the U.S. in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) or 1326 or in the event of legal challenges to No. 1, return to 100 percent zero-tolerance prosecutions. Use military lawyers to prosecute these cases to free up Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys to represent the government in asylum and removal proceedings. To insure there are no 2018-style repeats of lost or misplaced children, perhaps assign family members shared alien registration numbers with a dash and suffix for children apprehended with an accompanying adult. Use hospital-style bands for both adults and children with their names and AR numbers on them during processing.

The DHS should work with the U.S. marshals to incarcerate adults geographically proximate to children for prompt reunification after criminal proceedings.

Consider turning over the confirmed children of aliens who engaged in dangerous behavior to amenable state Child Protective Services and reimbursing them for the costs of caring for those children. This will make it clear to the country that illegal alien criminals are certainly no better than American criminals whose children are brought into the custody of Child Protective Services.

No. 4: In preparation for a rocket docket and airlift deportation of the next group of Central Americans in the pipeline, the DHS and Department of Defense should establish tent cities right near Air Force bases along the southwest border and within easy transportation distance to the bases' flight lines. Examples include Goodfellow, Lackland, and Laughlin in Texas; Holloman and Kirtland in New Mexico; Luke and Davis-Monthan in Arizona; and as a last resort, anything in California. Provide tents for court proceedings, areas for consulting with counsel, sleeping, eating, medical care, and schooling for children, plus bath and toilet facilities.

No. 5: Detain aliens in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1222(a) for health screenings and observations. The Flores Settlement Agreement should not be seen as trumping the statute, and while the government obtained an exemption to the five-day release requirement to process family units per Flores v. Lynch, the agreement only specifies release must be to the ""least restrictive setting."" Additionally, defensive ""asylum seekers"" are, by their very nature, inadmissible aliens subject to expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(C) for misrepresentation or (a)(7), lacking required immigration documents. They are also subject to mandatory detention per 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) and (b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) respectively at a minimum, until such time as they've received a favorable credible fear determination.

Additionally, as the aliens are technically also inadmissible public charges per 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) and flight risks, they should remain detained through the duration of their proceedings, until either being granted asylum or removed from the U.S.

If for whatever reason release should be necessary, do not allow catch-and-release of any alien who has received a favorable credible fear determination who has not completed an I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal, and assign them a court summons to the immigration court nearest to where they entered the U.S. illegally or the port of entry where they were deemed inadmissible. They should not be allowed to venture over to the interior court of their choosing.

No. 6: Prosecute false or misleading claims of fear, statements made relative to the asylum application, etc. per 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Also, inform all aliens that if their applications are found to be frivolous, they will be permanently barred from any relief from deportation, per 8 U.S.C. §1158(d)(6).

No. 7: Have the attorney general establish by regulations additional limitations and conditions, consistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(C), under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under paragraph (b)(1). That could include a regulation stating that anyone who uses criminal smuggling or cartel groups or caravans to come here is ineligible for asylum.

No. 8: Use already withheld foreign aid as a carrot to get Northern Triangle countries to agree to become each other's safe-third country as required by § 1158(a)(2)(A), e.g., Guatemala and Honduras for El Salvador; El Salvador and Honduras for Guatemala; and El Salvador and Guatemala for Honduras. In other words, promise to restore and possibly even increase aid if they agree to such an arrangement, which would instantly shut down any asylum claims. They could also get extra points for cooperating logistically with the air lifts.

The bottom line is that we need a plan to deter, defend, and demagnetize our porous border, and these are some of the statutes that can be used to prepare such a plan. Throwing more money at a ""humanitarian crisis"" to further treat, process, and incentivize this invasion with a supplemental funding bill is not the answer. Applying current law is the answer.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/8-practical-steps-to-stop-the-border-surge,2019-05-02
Alaska: The Most Important State of the 21st Century,"In March of 2021, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Anchorage, Alaska, where they participated in a series of high-level and highly contentious talks with their Chinese counterparts, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi.

Six months later, the US Coast Guard unexpectedly encountered four Chinese warships off the coast of Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, inside the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Chinese vessels were reportedly conducting military and surveillance operations.

While Alaska is often an afterthought to most Americans, these events taken in tandem highlight the state’s growing strategic importance and should be cause for everyone to reevaluate how they think about The Last Frontier.

On March 30, 1867, The United States reached a deal with Russia to purchase the Alaska territory for a cool $7.2M, roughly the equivalent of $111M today. The treaty, negotiated by Secretary of State William Seward, was originally dubbed “Seward’s Folly” due to the Alaskan landmass’ reputation as an icy wasteland. However, perception quickly changed in 1898 following the discovery of gold in the territory. Alaska became the 49th state admitted into the Union in 1959.

Alaska is only the 48th most populous state, being home to just under 740,000 people, and in terms of GDP, it ranks slightly lower at 49th. This plus the fact that for long periods of the year a portion of the state is bathed in total sunlight or shrouded in 24-hour darkness might make it difficult to understand exactly how such a place could logically be described as “The Most Important State of the 21st Century.”

The explanation is quite simple: location, location, location.

To understand the geostrategic importance of Alaska one need look no further than a map.

Situated at the crossroads of the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, the Bering Strait off Alaska’s west coast plays host to two of the world’s most potentially lucrative shipping routes. The Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.

Currently, both routes are largely unnavigable because they are frozen for most of the year. However, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Arctic Ocean is likely to be ice-free in the summers by 2050.

In fact, temperature increase in the region has already allowed for periodic shipping. In 2013, a Danish coal ship became the first-ever commercial freighter to navigate the Northwest Passage en route from Vancouver to Finland. By opting for the Northwest Passage over the traditional route, which would have taken it through the Panama Canal, the Danish freighter was able to shorten the journey by 1,000 nautical miles, transport 15,000 more tons of coal, and save $80,000 in fuel costs.

The thawing of the Arctic will connect North America with Europe’s largest port, Rotterdam, via the Northwest Passage. It will also connect Rotterdam to Yokohama via the Northern Sea Route.

These routes, being much shorter and cost-efficient than the ones that currently exist, will see a massive influx in shipping traffic over the next century, and by necessity, put Alaska, and the United States, at the choke point of two vital shipping lanes.

It's not just sea traffic, either. Alaska already plays a crucial role in air shipping. Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage serves as the 4th-busiest cargo airport in the world. And with tensions between Russia and Western nations increasing, Airlines may opt or be forced to avoid Russian airspace on international routes. This opens Anchorage as a prime layover destination, a mantle which it occupied for much of the Cold War.

Alaska also holds the potential to be a massive player in the energy market.

As Western nations have levied a bevy of sanctions on Russian energy, Russia has responded in kind, especially towards Europe, by manipulating their exports of liquified natural gas (LNG). As Russia has traditionally been Europe’s largest supplier of LNG, the Europeans are set up for a rough winter.

To curtail demand, EU member nations have agreed to cut gas usage by 15% over the next seven months. A cold winter could cut into Europe’s LNG storage and seriously threaten the ability of normal Europeans to stay warm.

As Europe and other countries like Japan work to wean themselves off Russian energy, Alaska presents itself as a golden goose.

The National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska has approximately 2.4 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, and it’s estimated that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is sitting on 10.4 billion barrels of oil. For reference, the European Union uses about 18.3 million barrels of oil per day. Alaska is also home to about 37 trillion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. Europe used about 400 billion cubic meters in 2021.

Of course, Alaska alone can’t make up for the exit of Russian energy, and there are plenty of issues when it comes to exporting LNG from the state, including a lack of pipelines. However, increased production in Alaska would immediately lower global prices and allow for other producers in the United States to export their own supply. This, however, is all dependent on the US government actually allowing exploration of Alaska’s reserves, which the Biden administration seems to have no interest in doing.

Alaska plays a major part in the United States’ ability to be energy secure and alleviate the burden of our allies having to rely on murderous and rogue dictatorships. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a premium case study.

Militarily, Alaska may prove even more important. In a 1935 address to Congress, General Billy Mitchell, widely regarded as the father of the air force, said, “I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.""

Today, America’s biggest strategic rival is undoubtedly China. The remainder of the century will be shaped based on the outcome of the power struggle between Washington and Beijing. That’s just the reality of the world we live in.

Alaska is by far the closest US state to East Asia. In fact, Anchorage is more than 1,000 miles closer to Beijing than Honolulu and more than 2,000 miles closer than San Diego. This kind of proximity could prove crucial if China was to make advances on Taiwan or other hot areas in the Pacific, like the Senkaku Islands.

Alaska can also be considered the northernmost edge of the First Island Chain. This string of islands runs from Borneo in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north. This chain serves as the first line of defense against China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) projecting power into the Western Pacific.

It should come as no surprise then that the United States has nine military bases in the state, including three Air Force bases located in Anchorage, The North Pole, and Denali. Clear Space Force Station in Denali is one of the US military’s most strategically important bases as it serves a vital role in defense monitoring for the west coast. It also serves as the first in a series of detection outposts that monitor enemy ballistic missiles and inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Fort Greeley near Fairbanks is also one of America’s most important bases as it’s home to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System. These interceptors are capable of detecting, tracking, and destroying ballistic missile threats before they reach larger population centers on the US mainland.

Given China’s growing interest in the arctic and its surveillance activities near Alaska, it should be clear that China understands the geostrategic importance of America’s largest state. Leaders in Washington should do the same and increase investment in, and development of, Alaska.

Alaska is a priceless gift that was acquired for pennies on the dollar. When this kind of fortune befalls you, it’s wise not to squander it.

Commentary: AOC is dangerously uninformed about what US forces did in Afghanistan,"“Men… Dec. 7, 1941, was the 'Day of Infamy' for our fathers and grandfathers. The world will come to know that Sept. 11, 2001, is OUR 'Day of Infamy.' The homeland has been attacked on OUR watch. Now it's OUR turn to to respond like so many have before us.""

Those words were spoken by my commander on board a U.S. Navy ship just off the coast of Australia on the night of Sept. 11, 2001. I was a young Marine on my first deployment. None of us could have expected that this deployment would be anything different or special, but the world forever changed that fateful night. The captain put the pedal to the metal in an all-out seaborne sprint to the coast of Pakistan. I was a United States Marine, and I was now going to war.

No memory is more vivid in my mind than this one. I think about it often. This was our Pearl Harbor, and I was right in the middle of it. We all wanted revenge for the fallen. We all wanted justice. We all wanted to ensure that this would never happen again. If you've ever served in a combat unit, you're fully accustomed to the complaining and boredom of typical Marine/soldier life.

You're probably chuckling right now to yourself. We had a saying in the Corps, “If a Marine's not complaining, he isn't happy."" But no one was complaining during those early days leading up to the invasion of Afghanistan. No one was bored. Everyone was locked in laser focus. We had been attacked, the Taliban was protecting our attackers, and nothing could be more justified than to bring these people to justice.

Last night, I read remarks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that truly made my blood boil.

In a Twitter fight — of course — with Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), Ocasio-Cortez stated, “I remember a time when it was 'unacceptable' to question the Iraq War. All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret.""

She later corrected her remark, stating that she actually meant to say the war in Afghanistan, adding, “honestly we shouldn't have been in either.""

I truly hope this article reaches Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. I hope she reaches out to me to hear what we all felt, went through, and discovered in the days following 9/11. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and hope that she might change her skewed world outlook if she had just a little information on what she's talking about.

This kind of ill-informed rhetoric is dangerous. It's a rewriting of history, spoken through a social media megaphone to a young audience that has no memory of what actually happened. Six years before George Orwell's ""1984,"" he wrote in an essay titled, “Looking Back on the Spanish War"":

Nazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as ""the truth"" exists. ... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, ""It never happened"" — well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five — well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs.

Indeed. And what's going on today from actual elected officials is frightening.

Gallup found in a recent poll that Americans ages 18 to 29 have a stronger view of socialism over capitalism. Every other age bracket, from 30 years old to 65-plus, doesn't share this sentiment. Why? Because they saw the horrors of socialism first hand. They saw millions die and nations collapse, and it was all at the altar of the socialist experiment. Our youth have no tangible connection to this history, and people like Ocasio-Cortez are taking advantage of it. And her remarks on the war in Afghanistan have hit a little too close to home for me.

To question the validity of the initial Afghanistan invasion goes completely against the facts, and — in dangerously Orwellian fashion — is a blatant attempt at re-writing history. I truly hope the congresswoman reads this. She, and everyone too young to remember the past couple of decades (she was 12 at the time), need to know our history.

Everything I'm about to reveal has been declassified by now, but in the weeks following 9/11, all this information was coming at us like a 747. My unit was about to embark on the furthest seaborne assault in history. Special Forces units were already on the ground in the North, but we were dropping deep in Southern Afghanistan.

The intelligence reports were shocking. Everyone back home knew, by now, that al-Qaeda was responsible and that the Taliban was harboring them, but what they didn't know was how sophisticated the operation was. Iranian weapons were being found in both Taliban and Al-Qaeda hands. The Iranians were also using their country to provide a safe travel corridor for al-Qaeda operatives to move inside and out of Afghanistan.

Osama bin Laden had gone deeper underground, but he was still training his operatives for additional foreign operations on the West. His vast financial resources were supplemented by Afghanistan's leading terrorist cash crop — opium. Our task force's first target was an opium manufacturing and transit hub in the South. After destroying that hub, we then used that facility as our base of operations. Cutting off that stream of money to jihadis being trained and sent to the West was paramount. A ground assault was the absolute only way to do it.

As al-Qaeda moved to the mountains their capabilities lessened, but our casualties elevated. Every day I'd listen to the reports. It was heartbreaking, but we knew that our lives were being put at risk so that never again would bin Laden and al-Qaeda accomplish another 9/11.

If not for the Afghanistan invasion, the opium financing would have continued, the terror camps would have resumed from the mountains, and al-Qaeda fighters would still be using Iran as a safe haven to move terror cells into the West.

Was everything perfect? Nothing in war and conflict ever is. Was every goal accomplished? Not in the slightest. You can intelligently make a case for discontinuing the current operations in Afghanistan, but what you can never do is delegitimize what we did in those early months after 9/11. You can't deny what we accomplished, and — more importantly — what we prevented in the future.

There's always room for debate and questions on foreign policy. It's essential. But the troubling theme here is that people like Ocasio-Cortez aren't engaging in any kind of real and honest debate. They're attempting to rewrite history, and that's something we must fight with every ounce of energy. Perhaps that war, for those of us who lived it, is our new ""day of infamy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-aoc-uninformed-about-afghanistan,2019-03-05
Commentary: The grand jury made the right decision in Breonna Taylor’s death. And that’s the problem.,"Protesters predictably took to the streets in anger after Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced the charges against former Louisville Metropolitan Police Department Sgt. Brett Hankison on Wednesday.

Hankison was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment. It's a felony charge, but it has nothing to do with the fact that the officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her home during an overnight raid. Hankison was charged because he recklessly shot into the building and surrounding apartments. The two other officers involved were not charged at all.

Legally, it was probably the right call. And that's the problem. That's why it's so frustrating.

Taylor was suspected to be connected to her ex-boyfriend's drug trafficking activity. So the police had a warrant that legally allowed them to break into Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. The warrant didn't require them to knock, although Cameron claims they did.

Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, was also in the apartment. He was a legal gun owner. When men, not in uniform, broke in the apartment in the middle of the night, he did what almost anyone with a gun might do — he used that gun to defend himself, his loved one, and their property from aggressors.

He didn't know he was shooting at cops. He thought it was a home invasion. Which is, by the way, an exceedingly reasonable thought to have when someone suddenly begins beating down your door in the middle of the night.

So in the heat of the moment, Walker fired one shot, which hit one of the officers in the leg. The officers then sprayed roughly two dozen bullets into and around the apartment, with six of them hitting Taylor. Walker was left inside to call 911, sobbing inconsolably, as he called for help for his dying girlfriend and tried to make sense of what had just happened.

AUDIO: 911 call from Kenneth Walker night Breonna Taylor died youtu.be

Once Walker fired that shot, the officers were legally enabled to use deadly force against Taylor and Walker. Every one of those 20+ bullets was legally justified because of Walker's one shot.



Breonna Taylor was not a violent criminal. At this point, there's no proof that she's a criminal at all. Police didn't find any drugs, drug money, or illegal weapons in her apartment after they killed her. The problem isn't the charge against Hankison; the problem is the decisions that led to that violent confrontation in the first place.

If police are going to be protected in situations where they have to use deadly force against suspects — which they must be in order to do their jobs — then they have a responsibility to avoid creating unnecessary situations in which that deadly force must be used, like those LMPD officers did the night Taylor was killed.

Police should not have gotten a no-knock warrant in this situation. Police should not have been sent to break down her door overnight in a surprise raid on the off chance she had some illegal items in her home. She was a 26-year-old emergency medical technician. She wouldn't have been difficult to find or arrest any number of other ways, if an arrest was even justified.

But because a potential nonviolent drug offender was treated with such aggression, she was killed, her boyfriend was put in an impossible and traumatic situation, a police officer was shot, another was fired and charged with three felony counts, and public trust for law enforcement took another hit.

And in the end, taxpayers with no role or responsibility in the situation footed the bill for the $12 million settlement the city paid Taylor's family in a civil lawsuit.

A citizen was killed in her home by the state, and while an officer was held accountable for bullets that went through apartment walls, no officers were held accountable for the bullets that pierced Breonna Taylor's body and ended her life.

We need to focus on making sure police are made to carry out their duties in a way that maximizes public safety and doesn't violate people's rights. We have to make sure people like Breonna Taylor don't get treated as expendable because of their proximity to drugs. We have to fight for the change that prevents these encounters from occurring, so we don't have to wait for a charging decision in fleeting hope for some form of justice after someone has been wrongly killed.

Regardless of what you think of Breonna Taylor, or what you think of police, we should all be able to agree that a system that produces this outcome when it works as intended needs to be altered and improved.

Breonna Taylor's life can't be restored, and the pain and trauma felt by her loved ones will last a lifetime. I just pray that the lessons learned from this tragedy can be used to save lives like hers in the future.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-grand-jury-breonna-taylor-problem,2020-09-25
Commentary: Diplomacy — if we can keep it,"Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) foreign policy beliefs have been ruffling feathers on the left and the right since he took office in 2011.

Like his father before him, Rand is no stranger to criticism from both sides of the aisle when it comes to his cautious and conservative foreign policy views.

For decades, politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties have beat the war drums against the Middle East and pretty much any other nation that dares to differ from the U.S. culturally or politically. While there are certainly times when military conflict is warranted, the United States has abandoned the restrained and cautious foreign policy of George Washington.

Since 9/11, the United States has sent tens of thousands of troops to fight wars in the Middle East, with many soldiers being younger than the wars they fight in. Too many of our men and women in uniform have left the United States to fight the “War on Terror,"" a war that has largely undefined goals and an ambiguous end date.

While President Barack Obama promised to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he failed to do so, instead expanding the United States' involvement in the conflicts and authorizing use of U.S. forces in Syria as well, all the while spending trillions of dollars in the process. Thousands of American troops remain actively engaged in these conflicts.

With regard to Russia, Obama pretended to adopt “tough guy"" rhetoric and policy positions against Russia, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hoping to follow in his footsteps with her own run for office, but during their tenures both failed to bring about any significant change from the Bush administration. In fact, they made things worse — making illicit deals with the Kremlin with promises of “more flexibility"" after the 2012 election.

In Sen. Rand Paul, America has an alternative.

Perhaps the most memorable example in recent history of an American politician engaging Russia directly with firm dialogue was when President Ronald Reagan successfully negotiated with Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in the '80s.

It was under Reagan that “peace through strength"" was exemplified in the modern era, and for arguably the first time, the country saw that a nation does not have to dominate its foes on the battlefield in order to triumph.

Today, the United States and Russia possess about 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads.

Like Reagan, Paul knows that peace talks with Russia are vital if Americans want to avoid a foreign war that neither nation would win.

“We should have more dialogue with Russia ... we need better dialogue so we won't have an accidental nuclear engagement,"" the senator, who has consistently lobbied for an end to expensive foreign wars, said.

Paul's views have seemingly steered U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump toward a new direction.

Trump has adopted a new tone that will surely resonate with the American people, arguing that it is time to “bring the troops home"" and end the useless foreign wars that the U.S. is currently involved in.

Since the budding friendship began, Trump has called for the withdrawal of American troops in Afghanistan and Syria.

After Trump announced that U.S. troops would be removed from Syria, Paul was one of the few who praised Trump's decision.

Trump noticed, and doubled down on his decision to bring the troops home, tweeting a quote from Paul:

It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he's right...The generals still don't get the mistake.

Paul also defended President Trump's attendance at the controversial Helsinki Summit last year, maintaining that dialogue and diplomacy with Russia can help combat Islamic terrorism and potentially end the war in Syria.

“Russia doesn't need to be considered our friend. But we certainly have overlapping interests — Syria, Islamic terrorism and energy — that require us to have an open dialogue and relationship,"" Paul wrote in a recent op-ed for Politico.

While Paul hopes the United States will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Kremlin, he comes from a position of strength when criticizing Russia as well, authoring an op-ed in 2014 that slammed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a “gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community.""

In this regard, Paul shows the world that peace can be obtained without sacrificing or diminishing the democratic values America holds dear.

“Politicizing international affairs is a dangerous game, but that hasn't stopped far too many in Washington, who seem to have forgotten that a vital part of keeping America safe and secure is avoiding war through strong and consistent diplomacy, from playing politics,"" Paul said.

In calling for an end to the foreign wars the United States seemingly finds itself ever-immersed in, Paul embodies the “real patriot"" George Washington referred to in his farewell address, steering President Trump's foreign policy toward a cautious neutrality with other nations while distancing American troops and resources from endless conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-rand-paul-diplomacy-ideas,2019-02-11
Commentary: Trump is in danger of turning coronavirus into his Iraq,"President Bush once inspired me that it was possible for America to be not just a beacon for liberty but a vector. That we could transmit freedom to an Islamic World that had been mostly devoid of it for a millennia.

But after watching him languish under the constant Democrat media onslaught defining Iraq as a ""quagmire,"" one of two things had become obvious. He either was ill-equipped to counter that narrative and defend our military and its mission, or he no longer believed his own mission statement. Regardless of which one it was, the result ultimately sunk his presidency.

He had plummeted from the president that heroically rallied America post-9/11, to leaving the White House with the lowest final approval rating in the history of the Gallup Poll.

On April 16, President Trump also inspired me with the unveiling of his three-phase plan to reopen America in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. I said so on every public platform at my disposal, and also let people I know privately within the administration know how I impressed I was, too. He and his team cast a vision, and had the answers we needed to the questions we had.

Which is why what I'm about to say next is incredibly ironic. And I'm saying it now, because I don't want to see history repeat itself. I'd prefer to see Trump appoint Ruth Bader Ginsburg's replacement, and not whomever turns out to be the Democrats' nominee. I'd like to see President Trump continue to defend my religious freedom from the Democrats as well. I don't want to the turn the country over to a political party that now acts as if Barack Hussein Obama was some kind of throwback blue dog Democrat, and Thomas Jefferson is no longer woke enough. Thus, I hope this is taken in the spirit it's intended.

Trump and coronavirus is starting to look/sound eerily similar to Bush and Iraq.

While their personas couldn't be much different, the milquetoast pabulum tastes the same. The same tepidness, qualifiers, and mixed messages. Are we winning in Iraq or not? Are we reopening or not? Does the president think the Iraqis want freedom? Does the president think America is ready to reopen? When Bush speaks is that the president, or is the president merely a mouthpiece for State Department bureaucrats? When Trump speaks is that the president, or is the president merely a mouthpiece for Fauci-Birx?

Just like back then with Bush and Iraq, I often find myself on the air each day defending what I think is Trump's conviction/position more than he is. I'm also not alone in this frustration. My inbox is overrun with the types of voters Trump must have all of to win in November. Ours is not necessarily a MAGA show, but we do find ourselves frequently supporting him given the way he's often governed up until this moment. The vast majority of our audience are conservatives that would never show up at a rally, but would love to rally to him come November. They also own many of the small businesses going under, and work many of the jobs being lost.

But they are bewildered by the president still tweeting about ventilator capacity like it's mid-March and not early May, lashing out at Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's attempt to make the Peach State great again, and blasting Sweden for not risking cultural suicide over a virus that so far has killed just .03% of its population (and .02% of the U.S.).

At best, the president's behavior on reopening since April 16 has been erratic. At worst, he is actively in the way of his own voters getting their country back.

President Trump rose to political prominence in part by pestering the Bush dynasty, and its latest scion, Jeb, into political irrelevance. He rightly pointed to the disastrous outcome of the invasion of Iraq, and all its wasted resources — both human and capital. He made his candidacy a vessel for venting years of frustration at ineffective Republicans, several of them Bushes, who didn't have it what it takes to win against the hardball tactics of the Left. And it took him all the way to the presidency.

He has lost that mojo in recent weeks, determined to defend every morsel of public policy beyond what the American people demand. Plenty of folks made mistakes here, or at the very least were compelled to make snap judgments based on little data with potentially hundreds of thousands of lives at stake. No one that would even think of voting for Trump this fall would hold the lockdown decisions made in March against him.

However, given what we now know, the likelihood of dying from this virus if you're under 70 or not in a nursing home is remote. It is time, then, to focus on those at-risk populations and reopen the country before further imperiling our food supply, constitutional liberties, and economy — while causing needless death later by denying other medical care today.

On March 16, the president announced a 15-day effort to flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming our health care system due to the coronavirus. That effort was successful, maybe too much so. We're now closing rural medical care and doing mass health care industry layoffs due to a lack of demand.

It's time for Trump to rise above the understandable myopia of the tragedy that uniquely struck his native New York City, and move on to the larger task of American renewal. His task force kept its March 16 vow to thwart what happened to Italy's health care system from ever happening here, and the American people did their part to make it so. Now the people and his presidency must join together once more to restore our way of life.

That's the message Trump's voters/potential voters want to hear and see. All the polling that shows him losing to Biden, including his own internal polling, confirms it. But just like we learned from Bush, you can't want a politician to be successful more than they do.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-trump-coronavirus-response-iraq,2020-05-06
Commentary: These five insane provisions in the amnesty omnibus bill show why Trump should veto this ‘compromise’,"Before getting into the details of this crazy omnibus bill, it's important to recognize that we don't understand all the details. The worst provisions are written in vague language ensconced in an 1,169-page bill, which has already been posted online in two different versions (the first was 10 pages shorter). That is exactly why Democrats are salivating to vote on this within a few hours of passage, which is exactly why Trump has a responsibility to oppose it immediately and demand at least a short-term clean continuing resolution so that he can digest the consequences of this bill. If he cannot make that simple demand, which would not even trigger a phony shutdown, then his presidency is worthless.

The process is indefensible: It is immoral, from any ideological perspective, to vote on an 1,169-page omnibus with new provisions on immigration amid a border crisis. We are already 4 1/2 months into this fiscal year and have been operating on stopgap bills. There is no rush to vote on something like this, which will fund seven departments for the remainder of the year, within a few hours when we should have another stopgap bill while we debate, and even discover, the contents of this long-term bill that makes important statutory changes. The only reason one would pursue this process is to hide things from the American people.

Here are the immediate issues to flag:

1) Less of a wall than even what Democrats already agreed to: Trump originally demanded $25 billion for the wall. Then he negotiated himself down to $5.6 billion. Democrats balked and only agreed to $1.6 billion. This bill calls it a day at $1.375 billion, enough to construct 55 miles. But it's worse than that. This bill limits the president's ability to construct “barriers"" to just the Rio Grande Valley sector and only bollard fencing, not concrete walls of any kind. There's no ability to adapt. Furthermore, section 231 prohibits construction even within the RGV in five locations that are either federal or state lands. Remember, the challenge with building a wall in Texas is that, unlike in other states, the feds need to navigate issues with private lands. The first place you'd construct fencing is on public lands, which are now prohibited. The national parks along the border have gotten so bad that park rangers are scared to travel alone in them.

2) Liberal local officials have veto power over wall: Actually, on second thought, it's likely that not a single mile of fence will be built. Section 232(a) of this bill states that “prior to use of any funds made available by this Act for the construction of physical barriers"" the Department of Homeland Security “shall confer and seek to reach mutual agreement regarding the design and alignment of physical barriers within that city."" With whom must the feds consult? “The local elected officials."" Now you can understand the brilliance of limiting the wall to the Rio Grande Valley. These are the most liberal counties on the border (thanks to demographics of open borders itself!), and there is practically no local official who supports the wall in these counties.

What are the consequences? This bill stipulates that “Such consultations shall continue until Sept. 30, 2019, (or until agreement is reached, if earlier) and may be extended beyond that date by agreement of the parties, and no funds made available in this Act shall be used for such construction while consultations are continuing."" Thus, all the Beto O'Rourke type of politicians in that region have de facto veto power. There's a reason why they didn't authorize fencing in conservative counties like Cochise and Yuma in Arizona.

3) This bill contains a blatant amnesty for the worst cartel smugglers: Section 224(a) prohibits the deportation of anyone who is sponsoring an “unaccompanied"" minor illegal alien – or who says they might sponsor a UAC, or lives in a household with a UAC, or a household that potentially might sponsor a UAC. It's truly difficult to understate the betrayal behind this provision. One of the driving factors of the invasion is the misinterpretation of the UAC law. Under current law, Central American teenagers are only treated as refugees if they are A) a victim of “a severe form of trafficking"" and B) have no relatives in the country. Yet almost all of them are self-trafficked by these very illegal relatives who are indeed present in the country. Rather than clamping down on this fleecing of the American people, the bill gives amnesty to the very people paying the cartels to invade us!

“We can call this the MS-13 Household Protection Act of 2019,"" said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies. “We know that 80 percent of the UAC sponsors are in the country illegally. The number of people this would protect would reach into the hundreds of thousands, if all of the household or potential household members are counted. ICE has estimated that 30-40 percent of the MS-13 members it has arrested in the last two years arrived as UACs. There is no reason to shield any of these individuals from deportation. After all, if the minor is living with family, they should no longer be considered unaccompanied anyway. If there are illegal aliens here who do not yet have a child here to serve as a deportation shield, this certainly is an incentive for them to make the arrangements to bring one.""

4) More funding to manage and induce the invasion rather than to deter it: While offering no new funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation agents or immigration judges to speed up asylum claims, as the president requested, this bill adds another $40 million for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which moves asylum-seekers to facilities in the interior of the country, where they are usually released. Vaughan, who has studied interior immigration enforcement for decades, warned that “this bill will further expand and institutionalize the catch-and-release policies for those arriving illegally at the border from all over the world.""

What are the effects of the ATD program? “Most of these people have no intention of asking for asylum and know they don't qualify for it, but are simply joining the illegal population, knowing it's unlikely that they will be deported. The bill funds 'case management' staff to keep tabs on those who don't abscond immediately, but no money for ICE officers to find and remove them. This is going to saddle the communities that have been forced to absorb these new arrivals with billions of dollars of future costs for schooling, health care, and other welfare services.""

At the same time, this bill reduces border detention beds from 49,060 to 40,520 rather than expanding them as Trump demanded. It contains no funding for more border agents. It offers $3.4 billion for refugee resettlement, more than last year's record levels. Remember, much of the refugee program has been used not just for bringing in traditional refugees from overseas but to resettle the aforementioned Central American teenagers being self-trafficked through the border, empowering cartels, and taking advantage of us.

5) Doubling low-skilled workers: This bill (p. 1,161) doubles the number of H-2B non-agricultural, unskilled seasonal workers who will continue to be a public charge on America. This gives you a glimpse of what is driving this amnesty bill on the Republican side.

This is just a cursory glance through the bill. Taken together, these provisions will aggravate the criminal conspiracy of the cartels and continue the invasion. Just this week, 1,800 family units came in during one 24-hour period, a new record. The message of this bill is to come here and seek bogus asylum or to grab a kid and you and others will get amnesty. Plus, there are no wall or policy changes to mitigate these effects.

Moreover, this bill will likely override Trump's executive powers because of the sneaky limitations on wall construction. This is the sort of omnibus bill that ensnared former President Ronald Reagan in Iran-Contra. Signing this bill will undermine his case for an emergency at the border both legally and politically.

If Trump signs this bill instead of vetoing it and firing the people in the White House promoting it, he deserves to lose re-election.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-trump-should-veto-omnibus-bill,2019-02-14
Commentary: 12 astounding numbers that show the whole invasion of our border,"After the media lied to the public throughout the border debate — when we actually had a chance to fix things in the budget — now the media suddenly admits we have a crisis at the border. A Washington Post reporter conceded that the numbers were ""bonkers."" The New York Times put in a headline the Customs and Border Patrol chief's warning that the border is at a ""breaking point.""

Here are 12 facts about the border apprehension numbers and the trends that demonstrate why the Trump administration should immediately shut down all asylum requests. Now is the president's opportunity to make a new case to the American people and go beyond simply addressing a few billion in border funding.

● 76,325 – The number of total illegal aliens and inadmissible aliens apprehended at and between points of entry in the month of February. That is the highest number for a single month since April 2008, but very likely one of the highest months of all time for unique (non-repeating) illegal aliens, given that many of the apprehensions from last decade were multiple crossings of the same individual within hours or days. Today, according to Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, ""We rarely arrest the same person twice in one year, much less in the same work shift.""

● 916,000 – The annual pace of February's border flow if this continues. But Customs and Border Patrol predicts that with the weather getting warmer over the next few months and the incentives for illegal immigration unaddressed, the numbers will grow larger.

● 40,325 – A record number of family unit apprehensions (number of people apprehended with family members) in February. That beats the record we just set in December 2018 by a whopping 26 percent.

● 136,150 – The number of family unit apprehensions between points of entry for the first five months of fiscal year 2019. This far surpasses the numbers for any previous full year.

● 165,568 – The number of family unit apprehensions between points of entry since Judge Dana Sabraw ruled last July that all parents or adults brought with children must be released with the children. During that last seven months, as many family units have been apprehended as in the previous 23 months.

● 2,023%– The percentage increase in monthly family unit apprehensions since the low of the ""Trump effect"" in April 2017 through February 2019. Yes: 2,023 percent increase.

● 311%– The percentage increase in family unit apprehensions by Border Patrol for the first five months of this fiscal year over the first five months of last fiscal year.

● 97%– The total percentage increase in all illegal alien apprehensions for the first five months of this fiscal year over the first five months of last fiscal year.

● 1,689%– The increase in family unit apprehensions in the El Paso sector for the first five months of fiscal year 2019 over the same period last year. El Paso saw its highest apprehensions in February since April 2006. And many of those in 2006 were the same people coming back after being deported immediately, and they were deported again. Almost all of these coming in currently remain here indefinitely.

● 70 – Number of large groups, defined as 100 or more, coming in at once to surrender to border agents and shutting down their resources. There were 13 such groups in FY 2018, mainly in the latter part of the year when this phenomenon began. It was almost unheard of in previous years.

● 31,000 – The number of projected aliens taken to American hospitals by the end of the year if the current pace holds, as compared to 12,000 last year.

● 57,000 – The number of man-hours Border Patrol had to spend with aliens in our hospitals just since Dec. 22. According to Brian Hastings, chief of Border Patrol operations, 25 percent to 45 percent of Border Patrol resources are now diverted to the processing and humanitarian functions rather than patrolling the border.

During the press conference when Trump announced his emergency declaration on Feb. 15, the media demanded from the president a set of data to demonstrate the problem. Well, here is the data that shows the most evident indicators of an emergency — a skyrocketing trajectory on all fronts.

The question for us all is how bad things need to get before we finally respect our own national sovereignty and stop allowing the courts to encourage illegal aliens to come here?

Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct ""family units apprehended"" in several places to ""family unit apprehensions,"" meaning individuals apprehended with family members, for clarity.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-12-astounding-numbers-that-show-the-whole-invasion-of-our-border,2019-03-07
Horowitz: 8 steps states should take to stop Biden’s border invasion,"In the eyes of the Biden administration, there is still enough of a public health emergency to criminalize the breathing of 2-year-olds and disabled seniors on planes, but not enough of an emergent matter to prevent millions of illegal aliens from all corners of the globe from invading our border.

At present, the rate of illegal alien apprehensions at the border is averaging 7,000 a day, which is an annualized pace of 2.5 million. I’ve covered the border issue for 15 years and could never have fathomed these numbers. Some border sectors are now apprehending in one month what they did in the past during an entire year. Oh, and that doesn’t include the hundreds of thousands of gotaways, who are likely the most dangerous element of this invasion.

Yet as we are still trying to conceptualize the consequences of admitting a population roughly the size of the city of Chicago every year, the administration has announced that the flow is not big enough. On Friday, the DHS announced it is suspending the Title 42 public health provision that turns back certain single adults at the border. Given the bottleneck of single adults waiting in Mexico, a CBP source told Fox Business last week that the removal of Title 42 could lead to the invasion of 500,000 people a month.

In other words, we’d be letting in a population greater than the size of two Chicagos every year.

This would be the first time in history that the government of a country itself orchestrated an invasion against its own population. So, what do we do about it? Fortunately, our founders decentralized the governing powers by retaining the sovereignty of the states. We cannot allow the federal government to vitiate the social compact with the states and violate every aspect of immigration law, but then scrupulously apply the laws against the states by suggesting they have no authority to deal with the invasion. This is no longer immigration, but an orchestrated invasion.

Republicans in Washington already ceded their leverage by passing the budget bill for the remainder of the fiscal year. The leverage now resides in the states. Here is a blueprint of action items for red states to pursue in a united front to protect their sovereignty:

1) Texas and Arizona replace the feds on the border: Texas and Arizona must take the lead at the border itself, given their front-line status in this invasion. The governors and legislatures of those states should authorize state troopers to return any alien they catch to Mexico, regardless of federal policy. One can debate the threshold of an emergency and at what point they can no longer remain subservient to the capricious whims of federal enforcement, but clearly we have crossed that line.

2) Interior removals of criminal aliens: States should create new categories of crime through which to hold criminal aliens so that they are not released or given over to the feds. The degree of criminality from criminal aliens is unfathomable. Last month, a Daytona Beach couple was brutally murdered allegedly by a Haitian illegal alien who had already been released after committing previous crimes, in what the police chief described as the most brutal murders he’d seen in 20 years in law enforcement.

3) Publish illegal alien crimes: Every GOP-run state should publish weekly data on how many illegal aliens were arrested by criminal offense category. Unfortunately, cases like the Daytona Beach murder are not rare. This is an information war, and if the public knew the extent of the illegal alien criminality in this country and in their communities, they would raise hell with their elected officials. That is why the feds have made it so hard over the years to verify the legal status of those who commit heinous crimes. There is no reason why states can’t gather that information. They must require all local law enforcement to ascertain the nationality of anyone arrested for a crime.

4) Stop busloads of illegals at state borders: Let’s not forget that states engaged in travel bans on fellow Americans during the pandemic. If they suddenly had the power to keep out American citizens, then during a crisis of this magnitude they have the power to keep out illegal aliens. Gov. Greg Abbott stationed state troopers on highways leading into Texas from Louisiana in April 2020 to enforce quarantine rules. That should be the model to deter this invasion. States should activate their respective National Guards to interdict buses traveling to their states and reroute them to blue states.

5) Verify legal status for all state benefits: State agencies should be instructed to use the federal databases to check the legal status of anyone who applies for any state benefit, license, or official legal status.

6) Mandatory E-Verify: From the inception of this crisis, cutting off the magnet of jobs was always the most effective way to deter illegal immigration. All red states adopting this provision would, at a minimum, route the flow of illegal aliens to the blue states.

7) Prosecute identity theft: Most illegal aliens are only able to reside in this country because of identity theft, which in itself is devastating to many American citizens. States should immediately toughen penalties for identity theft and embark on a massive effort to prosecute those who engage in stolen identity.

8) Taxing remittances to Latin America: States that have income taxes should block remittances to Mexico or Central America by illegal aliens or place a prohibitive tax on them.

Taken together, these efforts will send the message to a population that works off incentives that these particular states are closed for business. At best, it will deter the invasion. At worst, it will reroute the invaders to the states that want them.

“But can a state do this?” you might ask. Well, Article I, § 10, cl. 3 allows states to even go a step further. The Compact Clause bars states from raising an army and engaging in war, but makes an exception when “actually invaded or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.” In other words, when they are in imminent danger of an invasion, they can raise an army and actually engage in war. We are merely advocating a more passive and defensive measure of just keeping out the invaders.

At the Virginia Ratifying Convention, James Madison explained this clause plainly: States “are restrained from making war, unless invaded, or in imminent danger. When in such danger, they are not restrained.”



Given that during the time of our founding, the main concern was violence from neighboring Indian tribes, this authority was not just limited to deterring invasions of nation-states. In Federalist No. 43, Madison reasoned that the “latitude of the expression used” in the right to protect against invasion includes “not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors.” The cartels are most certainly ambitious and vindictive enterprises.

When it came to crushing the basic liberties of Americans, we were told by nearly every federal court that the “police powers” of the state were unlimited. After having gone through the horrors of the past two years, we are not going to accept a sudden limitation on state powers to deal with an invasion orchestrated by the federal government’s unconstitutional abrogation of immigration laws.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-8-steps-states-should-take-to-stop-bidens-border-invasion,2022-04-05
Horowitz: Are the Ukraine biolabs connected to the coronavirus gain-of-function research?,"This is not about your feelings toward Putin or Ukraine. It’s about the ethics, morality, and trust of our own government. Last Tuesday, undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ""Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.""

Now the World Health Organization is calling on Ukrainian officials to “destroy high-threat pathogens to prevent any potential spills,” due the ongoing risk of explosions during the war.

Given that millions of Americans have been killed or injured long-term by a virus that was likely created by gain-of-function research in a similar lab in Wuhan, isn’t it important that we have a full accounting of how many other gain-of-function labs our government holds, in which countries, and what exactly they are doing with them? This is not about justifying Putin’s invasion as somehow the savior of humanity against biowarfare. It’s about understanding the origin of the virus that clearly was not natural and destroyed our lives and how to ensure this won’t happen again.

It’s now clear that, at a minimum, the U.S. was heavily involved in developing and managing these biolabs in Ukraine. NewsPunch has recovered about a dozen documents deleted by the U.S. embassy in Kiev detailing the U.S. funding of multiple biolabs throughout the country.

A deleted web article from BioPrepWatch.com on June 18, 2010, which was recovered by National Pulse, titled, “Biolab Opens in Ukraine” explains how Obama, while serving as an Illinois senator, along with Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, helped negotiate a deal to build a level-3 bio-safety lab in Odessa, Ukraine, in 2005. The article was included in Issue No. 818 of the U.S. Air Force Counterproliferation Center’s Outreach Journal.

What was being done there? A 2011report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences’ Committee on Anticipating Biosecurity Challenges of the Global Expansion of High-Containment Biological Laboratories explained it was a project between the United States Department of Defense and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine focused on “preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens, and knowledge that can be used in the development of biological weapons.” It had a permit, according to the report, “to work with both bacteria and viruses of the first and second pathogenic groups.”

A separate document detailing Ukraine’s biolab network from the BioWeapons Prevention Project explains they were studying Ebola and “viruses of pathogencity group II by using of virology, molecular, serologica and express methods.” Additionally, the lab provided “special training for specialists on biosafety and biosecurity issues during handling of dangerous biological pathogenic agents.”

So, who runs these labs? Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, a Bulgarian journalist, identified biotech company Metabiota Inc., which is heavily supported by Google, in an extremely detailed article back in 2019 as the main player in the Ukrainian labs. It’s a company that tracks the trajectory of outbreaks and sells pandemic insurance, but also seems to have its hand in the actual labs that, as we painfully learned the past two years, might be the source of some of these outbreaks.

The US Company Metabiota Inc. has been awarded $18.4 million federal contracts under the Pentagon’s DTRA program in Georgia and Ukraine for scientific and technical consulting services. Metabiota services include global field-based biological threat research, pathogen discovery, outbreak response and clinical trials. Metabiota Inc. had been contracted by the Pentagon to perform work for DTRA before and during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and was awarded $3.1 million (2012-2015) for work in Sierra Leone – one of the countries at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak.

Indeed, in August 2018, Metabiota, which was created in 2008, announced it had been awarded a subcontract from Black & Veatch (B&V) to support the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency’s (DTRA) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) in Iraq. Black and Veatch is the Kansas City-based engineering firm that is listed as the contractor on one of the DOD-funded veterinarian biolabs tasked with working on “pathogens,” among the documents recovered by NewsPunch from the U.S. embassy in Kiev.

How does this all come back to our concern of COVID 2.0 and another lab leak? Last year, the San Francisco-based Metabiota predicted a 47%-57% chance that there will be another pandemic that will kill even more people than COVID. What do they know that we don’t?

A 2016 investigation by CBS found that World Health Organization officials believe Metabiota screwed up the Ebola response in Africa and that there was ""absolutely no control on what is being done."" U.S. health official Austin Demby, who was dispatched to the Metabiota shared lab in Sierra Leone by the CDC, reported that ""the cross contamination potential is huge and quite frankly unacceptable,"" after allegedly witnessing used needles littering the floor, the lack of an ultraviolet light for decontamination, and not enough space to process blood samples safely. CBS also quotes a representative of Doctors Without Borders who claims she saw cross-contamination and lack of proper hygiene and protective gear as workers moved from the lab to houses.

Do you still feel comfortable with a company like this involved with DOD-made biolabs in Ukraine? Well, what if I told you their leadership was tied into the central players in the Wuhan coronavirus gain-of-function research and funded by ... Hunter Biden?!

The CEO of Metabiota is Dr. Nathan Wolfe, a virologist who has been a member of the official journal of EcoHealth Alliance, the company at the center of the gain-of-function research on coronavirus spike protein binding from day one. According to his LinkedIn profile, Wolfe “has been honored with a Fulbright fellowship, the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award, [and] a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader.” Like a quote from a horror film, Wolfe explained his enterprise in an interview with the Edge in 2009 as follows:

If you want to think about my work, one way to think of me is as a curator of microbial collections. I have these massive repositories. I have sites all around the world that are aimed at collecting interesting microorganisms, and then I enter into collaborations with different groups. Instead of coming to look at my beetle collections, I send them specimens that I think they are likely to find of interest, and they study them for novel agents. Really it's sort of a microbial museum. As a consequence, I have a very low footprint in the USA. I have an office not much bigger than your suite. It's not huge. Even though my enterprise is very costly to sustain, it is very easy for me to move around.

Years ago, none of us would have thought much of this. But given the suspicion that EcoHealth Alliance created SARS-CoV-2 out of a similar repository and “microbial museum,” not in the United States but as an “enterprise” around the world, we should probably be suspicious of what Metabiota is doing in Ukraine.

Then, of course, there is Hunter Biden. The National Pulse has found financial reports revealing that the investment firm of the “first son,” Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners, led Metabiota’s first round of funding, which amounted to $30 million, and that “Former Managing Director and co-founder of RSTP Neil Callahan – a name that appears many times on Hunter Biden’s hard drive – also sits on Metabiota’s Board of Advisors.” Callahan is also the co-founder of Pilot Growth Management, which is Metabiota’s current top investor.

In EcoHealth’s 2014 annual report, Metabiota is listed as a partner on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) “PREDICT” project, which seeks to “predict and prevent global emerging disease threats.” This included the infectious disease research in Wuhan together with “bat lady” Shi Zhengli.

The National Pulse also reveals that “Researchers from Metabiota have also been listed alongside EcoHealth Alliance personnel on a 2014 study on henipavirus spillover, 2014 study on Ebola monitoring, 2015 study focusing on herpes, and 2015 study on viral diversity.”

So, Peter Daszak, EcoHealth, Nathan Wolfe, Metabiota, Hunter Biden, Wuhan lab, and Ukraine all tie together in some way. And now U.S. and WHO officials are warning of clearly some very potent pathogens floating around in these U.S.-run Ukrainian facilities. What is the average American supposed to think of our government in this case?

In the past, we would have understood that our government was perhaps working on important viral research or perhaps working on bioweapons to deter our enemies. But now that we know our lives were destroyed because of a leaked virus that most likely came from a similar cast of characters in similar Chinese labs, if not some of the same players, how are we supposed to trust our government in Ukraine? This question should bother us independent of what Russia and China say and regardless of the invasion. What is our government doing in Ukraine, and likely in many other countries, and how do we know these places are not ticking time bombs like the Wuhan lab?



Ironically, our government used Ukraine to distract from the atrocities committed at home with the creation of COVID and the response to it. However, it appears that the focus on Ukraine might very well bring attention right back to the origins of the last catalyzing global event they seek to erase from our memory. They might just get exactly what they wanted – a little too much. Regardless of what happens with the war, we need to know if Ukraine is the new Wuhan.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-are-the-ukraine-biolabs-connected-to-the-coronavirus-gain-of-function-research,2022-03-14
"Horowitz: As murder skyrockets and criminals are released in Chicago, mayor threatens political dissenters with arrest","This juxtaposition of perversion is probably the most powerful display of the America we knew and loved being turned upside down beyond the worst nightmares of our early founders.

""We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you,"" announced Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a public address on Saturday. ""Don't make us treat you like a criminal, but if you act like a criminal and you violate the law and you refuse to do what is necessary to save lives in the city in the middle of a pandemic, we will take you to jail. Period.""

How many of us have longed for the moment when big-city mayors would finally get tough on crime again and restore ordered liberty in our communities! But this errant mayor is finally discovering her ""law and order"" moxie to support unconstitutional edicts that violate the Bill of Rights and interstate commerce.



As you review the unprecedented words of this wayward mayor, now ponder the following reality. Illinois has released 4,000 prisoners, including 64 murderers and child sex offenders, under the faulty science of stopping a viral spread. Chicago is also notorious for releasing the worst criminal aliens imaginable and infamous for releasing gang-bangers and gun felons who violate their parole. Yet that same faulty science is leading to policies of arresting political dissenters who are fighting unconstitutional house arrest edicts.

Murderers released, everyday Americans placed under house arrest and threatened with jail time!

What are the results? In one of the most unreported stories in the country right now, murders have skyrocketed in Chicago even though everything is shut down. While some places are experiencing almost no crime (as one would expect with a panicked lockdown), Chicago murders are tracking ahead of this time last year, and there have been 73 more shooting victims than last year. Again, that is simply astounding given that almost a quarter of the year so far has been spent on lockdown.

So, what it is going to be, Mayor Lightfoot? If you rob someone with a mask, you are free to go, but if you take off the mask, then it's OK to arrest the dangerous criminal? Perhaps he is not a danger to the community so long as he pulls his gun out six feet away from the victim?

It's funny how these same blue-city politicians are justifying violating the Constitution under the premise of ""if it only saves one life,"" it's worth it. For example, the police department of Elizabeth, New Jersey, comically produced drone footage of spying on the city while at the same time saying they are not spying on the city, yet ultimately justifying it as being worthwhile ""if this plan saves one life.""

Well, what about the lives lost because of coronavirus jailbreak, which in itself was supposedly orchestrated to save lives? In Boston, the police commissioner believes these criminal releases are sending the message to criminals that it's open season on our streets.



""Just last week, a known gang member, carrying a firearm, firing a firearm, home invasion — released. When you do things like that, it sets a mentality on these streets that people can do what they want,"" said Boston Police Commissioner William Gross after a weekend of violence. ""This is unacceptable. People who have been locked up for violent offenses and carrying a firearm should not be released on personals, and I could care less if they get sick in jail or not.""

In Cincinnati, murder is up 115% and robbery is up 31% relative to this time last year. That's a lot of lives lost due to the jailbreak and misallocation of police resources to ""save lives"" from coronavirus.

The criminals know that the politicians are only focused on clamping down on peaceful, law-abiding Americans and their civil rights. As such, just how nonexistent is the deterrent?

Last Tuesday, one career criminal in Orange County, California, was arrested three times for theft and was released each time … all within 12 hours!

Last month, Orange County Court Commissioner Joseph Dane released seven high-risk sex offenders, including Rudy William Grajeda Magdaleno, 39. According to Breitbart, he had been previously convicted for sexually assaulting a special-needs woman, masturbating in public at a Santa Ana law firm, and breaking into the home of an 11-year-old girl while he was naked. Just three weeks later, he was arrested again for indecent exposure.

In March, Matthew Parris, a teaching assistant in Raynham, Massachusetts, was charged with raping two children in the schools where he worked. He was deemed so dangerous by the judge that he was held without bond. He has since been released under coronavirus jailbreak, even though, at age 29, he is more likely to be struck by lightening than to die of the virus.

In Philadelphia, after city officials publicly announced they wouldn't arrest burglars during the shutdown, merchants who are crushed by the shutdown are dealing with a rash of shoplifting. ""People are coming in the store, they're loading their bag and they're actually telling us the law, that they're not gonna get locked up,"" said one merchant to ABC6. ""It's a lawless city, it's the Wild West. That's what's happening here,"" said another.

The message has gone out loud and clear to criminals that the only ""high-level"" crime in the eyes of our government at this point is defying illegal orders restricting civil liberty and opening a business. If you loot the business, you are good to go, especially if you were wearing a mask during the act.

Governments are instituted to protect the rights of the citizens through ordered liberty. Protecting us against criminals is the core reason we have government. Now that government has released these people and turned their guns on us, this is no longer a legitimate government. The inmates are running the asylum; the criminals are running the government.

Perhaps it's time to end the lockdown of our society, lock up the real criminals, and throw out the criminal politicians.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-as-murder-skyrockets-and-criminals-are-released-in-chicago-mayor-threatens-political-dissenters-with-arrest,2020-05-04
"Horowitz: Caravans of young men head toward our border, as military is dispatched … against the American people","We owe the Guatemalan government gratitude for caring about our border security more than our own government does. Guatemala's effort to halt the coming caravan invasion aimed at our border will give us at least a few weeks to ponder and plan for our future.

James Madison explained in Federalist #45 that the powers of the federal government are ""few and defined,"" applied ""principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce."" He warned: ""The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular States.""

Well, because we now have a government that not only fails to block external invasion but actively invites it, it is no surprise that that government is using the military domestically rather than to repel an invasion. In the same way, it is using a border wall around the Capitol to keep out Americans while opposing a wall to keep drug cartels and previously deported sex offenders from returning. In other words, per Madison's warning, a government that fails to protect our border controls our life, liberty, property, and free speech.

Even before the formation of the latest caravan, individual illegal aliens have been increasing their presence at our border. In December, Customs and Border Protection apprehended 73,513 individuals, the highest number in 17 months. The border flow for the first three months of this fiscal year is 69% greater than over the same period in FY 2020. The Biden/Harris welcome mat is not lost on the world.

A caravan formed in Honduras consisting of at least 6,000 individuals who appear to be mainly young males was stopped at the Guatemalan border on Sunday, thanks to a multi-layered security apparatus. There are reportedly still about 2,000 of them camped out near the border of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In the long run, there is no way those countries have the ability to stave off the stampede of people coming for the promise of amnesty.





They know that the only security our government cares about is building a wall and using the military against its own people. In August, Joe Biden promised, ""There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration."" Now with an East Berlin-style wall erected around the Capitol, perhaps we can see they were saving resources for a different type of wall. One Democrat Congressman even has a bill to direct the architect of the Capitol to build a permanent security fence around the entire complex.



Imagine if the wall and the military were deployed in full at our border as the caravans came up. Our border would look as quiet as D.C is this week. During the border crisis of 2018-19, when Trump deployed the military to the border, we heard endless cries of Trump violating posse comitatus. Even the Trump administration refused to use the military for anything beyond a humanitarian mission and for observation. Mexican soldiers even snuck up on our military on our own soil and jumped two of our soldiers because they weren't deployed for combat. A Marine was attacked in El Centro, California, in May while sitting unarmed in one of these blacked-out Mobile Surveillance Camera vehicles.

So even the Trump administration felt that somehow our military couldn't be used for the quintessential purpose of repelling an invasion on our soil. Yet now that 30,000 troops are being paraded all over D.C. with no violence in sight, we are to believe this doesn't run afoul of the law against using the military to enforce domestic laws.



In November 2019, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) accused Trump of ""using the military as his own private militia"" simply for securing our border against foreign invaders during the worst border crisis ever. Where is she now that Biden is holding a Stalin-style inauguration backed by more troops than are still in our last three war theaters combined? It sure looks like a private military junta to me.

Sadly, anything and everything is being justified under the guise of protecting Biden's inauguration, just like everything was justified to combat a virus. Which is perhaps why they won't justify using the military at the border, for that would block the entry of Biden's most prominent inaugural parade.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-caravans-of-young-men-head-toward-our-border-as-military-dispatched-against-the-american-people,2021-01-19
Horowitz: Court orders NY hospital to administer ivermectin to COVID patient who began breathing on his own after one dose,"Americans woke up to the shocking news today that the CDC is recommending a pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to blood clotting issues, a decision that will undoubtedly make the public nervous about the other two experimental vaccines in use. Now is the time for the government to tell the public the truth that there is a safe and effective treatment for this virus from a cheap drug that has been safely used for years. No experimentation needed.

The same international and national health agencies that continue to panic about COVID-19 are refusing to allow early and preventive treatment of ivermectin or even further study of its efficacy. The more studies and real-world experience show that it works marvelously against the virus, the more they stall, censor, or obfuscate information. At this point, almost nobody should be dying from COVID if everyone were given ivermectin among other proven early treatments. Why is there no effort to promote these early treatments — to the point that desperate patients are forced to go to court to access treatment?

John Swanson, 81, of Genesee County, New York, like so many elderly Americans, was given no legitimate preventive or early treatment options for this now very predictable inflammatory response to COVID-19. He wound up on a ventilator at the United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia and, according to the court affidavit, was ""on death's doorstep."" The Buffalo News reports that, according to attorney Ralph C. Lorigo, Swanson was given one dose of ivermectin and began breathing on his own, was then taken off the ventilator, and began to show great progress. However, the hospital, with no other legitimate treatment options to offer, refused to give him follow-up doses.

On April 2, state Supreme Court Justice Frederick J. Marshall ordered the hospital to administer the follow-up doses at the request of Swanson's wife.

As of late Friday afternoon, his attorneys described Swanson as ""stable.""



""I definitely think the Ivermectin is helping him,"" Sandra Swanson told The Buffalo News, but she said she is upset and frustrated that hospital officials would not allow her to visit with her husband.



""They held the phone to his ear, and I read him a long list of people who are praying for him every day, about 20 people,"" she said. ""But I need to see him.""

There have been at least two other instances where New York judges had to force local hospitals to administer lifesaving treatment to those who appeared on their way to death.

It is shocking how 13 months into this pandemic, the medical profession has nothing to offer but a ventilator, keeping loved ones away from seeing the patient, and blocking the only known lifesaving treatments.

What is even more bewildering is the fact that the World Health Organization's own data show that early-use ivermectin is even more effective, reducing mortality by 81%. Were every vulnerable person to use it preventively, one can only speculate that the results would be even better, because the key to fighting the inflammatory response is to pre-empt it from getting off the ground.

Despite 50 studies, 26 of them randomized controlled trials , showing the amazing efficacy of this cheap and safe drug, the NIH refuses to recommend its use. As late as January, health officials continued to say that ""there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19."" But three months later, why have they not aggressively studied ivermectin to at least confirm or refute the wealth of existing studies they evidently don't want to rely upon?

On Feb. 15, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the World Health Organization's technical response team to COVID-19, promised that within the ""next six weeks or so"" they would be coming out with guidance on use of ivermectin for COVID. She hinted at the fact that they felt some of the positive studies had too small a sample size and were looking to pool and synthesize the data. At the same forum, Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases Department at the World Health Organization, admitted that ivermectin induced ""broad spectrum activity"" against viruses and looked promising and that studies were ongoing.

Two months later, with panic abounding about variants despite all the vaccines, why is there still radio silence? Why was there such a rush to make experimental gene therapy approved as a vaccine under emergency use for hundreds of millions of people at the same time they drag their feet on a drug that has been proven safe for years?

Dr. Fauci is telling people that it's still not OK for vaccinated Americans to eat and drink indoors. He and his colleagues in the various health agencies keep spreading fear about variants of the virus escaping the utility of the vaccine. According to a recent YouGov poll , 54% of those vaccinated in America say they still fear getting the virus. Why wouldn't we tell everyone the good news that there is a safe, non-invasive drug they can take at the first sign of COVID (and even preemptively) that will almost certainly ward off serious or even mild illness without any unknown long-term effects like the vaccines?

""The bottom line is that ivermectin works. I've seen that in my patients as well as treating my own family in Italy,"" Yale University professor and renowned cancer researcher Dr. Alessandro Santin said in an interview with TrialSite News last month . ""We must find a way to administer it on a large scale to a lot of people.""

Aside from ivermectin's ability to treat COVID and its inflammatory response in the immune system at all stages of the virus, Dr. Santin notes that it seems to work effectively to quell long-term symptoms in those who take a while to recover.



Even if one is not sold on hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, just think of any hypothetical cheap and safe de facto cure to the virus. With the political class and their corporate allies obtaining so much money, power, and social transformation from keeping people fearful and controlled, would they really allow any such cure to come to become ubiquitous in public health?

The lie told by public health officials about the lack of early treatments is perhaps the most dastardly and revealing of all the COVID lies, manipulation, censorship, and panic-mongering. It demonstrates that they don't really want to cure — with the least risk — a disease that, according to their own sentiments, is the greatest threat to mankind.

Horowitz: DHS released nearly 100K illegal aliens in just one month: Tip of the invasion iceberg,"In one respect, when DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Rep. Chip Roy at a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing that the DHS has operational control over the border, he wasn’t lying. His department is now releasing close to 100,000 illegal aliens per month into the interior of the country. Thus, this is actually a controlled and purposeful mass migration, although there are many more gotaways that funnel through our border during the chaos. Either way, our country can’t last with such a volume of invaders until there is a new president in 2025. Arizona and Texas, buttressed by the other red states, must take action now.

Fox News’ Bill Melugin is reporting that the DHS acknowledged in a recent court document that CBP and ICE released or paroled 95,318 illegal aliens just in the month of May. They are all coming to a city near you. And this has been going on for a year and a half and will likely continue for another two and a half years if Texas and Arizona Republicans don’t secure their own border. In April, 118,000 were released. In other words, there will likely be more than one million invaders released into every corner of this country in one year.

Oh, and those are the “good ones.” What about the gotaways – the ones who pay the cartels larger sums to cross over surreptitiously because they likely have criminal records? According to Melugin, 445,837 gotaways are estimated to have gotten away from agents during the first eight months of fiscal year 2022, and over 800,000 since the beginning of FY 2021.

So, in total, there have been 3 million apprehensions of illegal aliens since Biden took office, nearly half were likely deposited into the country, and there were 800,000 known gotaways. Just in one weekend in one border sector, Border Patrol arrested a murderer, a rapist, and nine gang members. You can imagine that most of them are not caught and are among those 800,000 gotaways. However, those numbers are likely much higher.

Typically, gotaways are counted from a mix of Aerostat blimps equipped with sensors and from agents counting footprints in the ground and adding them to the hits they get on all the cameras and sensors. Then they compare those suspected infiltrations against the apprehension numbers. However, one veteran agent in the Rio Grande Valley told TheBlaze that he knows for a fact that the numbers are lowballed and they are not counting all the gotaways. “To begin with, ‘cutting sign,’ which means counting the footprints of the gotaways, is often difficult, because the guides will often brush out the signs, walk in hard-packed areas, or travel in thick brush, caliche [hard rock], or on hard-paved roads.”

Thus, those cases represent the number of unknown gotaways. The agent also explained that there are known gotaways that are simply not recorded. “There are thousands that are known but are either NOT recorded or placed in a different category in order to lower the number of gotaways, i.e. non-violations, no arrest, and unresolved detection. This may be a surprise, however: Since the Trump administration we have been fudging our numbers in the Rio Grande Valley and literally erasing foot sign.”

Also, keep in mind that the morale of the agents is very low, and now the higher-ups are taking actions against agents over the false blood libel accusing them of whipping Haitians in Del Rio last summer. So needless to say, agents are not exactly motivated to assiduously count every last sign of a gotaway that they know our government will do nothing about.

Indeed, according to the DHS’ Border Security Metrics Report from 2019, “While USBP has reliable administrative data on apprehensions, the Department does not have an exact count of unlawful entry attempts since an unknown number of illegal border crossers evade detection. As a result of this so-called ‘denominator problem,’ the Department must estimate the apprehension rate.”

In other words, there are likely more than 50,000 or so gotaways every month, especially given the chaos and free rein that the cartels enjoy now at the border, knowing that this administration is on their side. One cannot fathom the amount of crime that will plague our cities for decades to come as a result of this incalculable influx of criminals into the country.

Which is why Texas and Arizona must lead the way in deporting illegal aliens and patrolling for gotaways. As Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Kelly Ward suggested, Arizona should follow Florida’s lead and create a state guard. Texas already has one, but it needs to be used for the border – and not just to babysit, but to interdict and deport. Texas and Arizona citizens would sign up in droves to serve their state and, by extension, the entire country by working to actually defend our own border rather than other countries’ borders, as most of our national guardsmen have been forced to do for the past two decades.

The Florida governor has explicitly called upon the border states to repatriate the invaders on their own. “What Texas needs to do is just send them [illegal immigrants] back across the border,” Gov. DeSantis said at a press conference last week. “Who cares what the Feds are saying? They aren’t doing their job.



“Texas shouldn’t let them come across the border to begin with. They just walk right across the river,” he added. “No one is stopping them.” DeSantis also offered to send help to the border states if they request it.

The Arizona constitution (§ 26-174) authorizes the governor to establish a new state guard “for the safety and protection of the lives and property of the citizens of the state.” At this point, if the cartel war on Arizona doesn’t justify such protection of life and property, than nothing ever will.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-dhs-releases-illegal-aliens,2022-06-21
Horowitz: FDA warns about blood clots from Big Pharma COVID treatment. Hospitals use it anyway.,"Well, the good news is that hospitals are finally using another drug to treat COVID aside from the failed remdesivir. The bad news is that this drug comes with a rare FDA ""black box"" warning of causing blood clots and also costs a fortune. Why is it that our government trashes every cheap, safe outpatient therapeutic that has been used for decades without problems, but only approves expensive therapeutics that cause blood clots or renal failure (in the case of remdesivir)? This is the ultimate case of therapeutic nihilism.

Last November the FDA quietly gamed emergency authorization use to baricitinib, a drug used for acute rheumatoid arthritis, which is produced by Eli Lilly under the brand name Olumiant. The specific authorization is for COVID patients requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Unlike remdesivir, baricitinib is an anti-inflammatory Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, which helps ratchet down pro-inflammatory cytokines. As such, it's very likely that it does have more efficacy during the inflammatory stage than the worthless remdesivir. The problem is that it comes with an FDA black box warning about causing blood clots, the very condition you are trying to treat at the critical stages of COVID illness. Here is the warning on blood clots:



Thrombosis: Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with Olumiant compared to placebo. In addition, there were cases of arterial thrombosis. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated.

Pulmonary embolism is literally the most delicate condition intensivists must deal with when treating COVID patients in the ICU. It's liking fighting a fire with a blowtorch!

At the beginning of the month, the FDA announced it was updating its warnings because drugs like ""Olumiant and Rinvoq have not been studied in trials similar to the large safety clinical trial with Xeljanz, so the risks have not been adequately evaluated."" However, because it has the same mechanism of action, it is suspected to have the same side effects as Xeljanz.

Black box warnings are rare and unlike the common disclaimers that are placed on any drug label. As noted by Drug Watch, ""A black box warning is the FDA's most stringent warning for drugs and medical devices on the market. ""

Yet baricitinib takes its place along with remdesivir as the only standard of care for inpatient COVID treatment from the NIH.

Contrast this to ivermectin, which won a Nobel Prize by proxy, is one of the safest drugs, and has been dispensed billions of times in Africa for parasitic infections and millions of times for COVID in India without incident. Yet the very same hospitals that have zero problem using a black box drug, particularly for blood clots, on a COVID patient in danger of thrombosis will go to court to fight the use of ivermectin, even for a patient with no other option.

Several weeks ago, I had Buffalo-based attorney Ralph Lorigo on my podcast to discuss his legal fight against hospitals denying ivermectin treatment. All but one of the patients on ventilators for whom he legally secured a right to ivermectin treatment recovered when they almost assuredly would have died. So visceral is their desire to block this treatment that hospital doctors have even fought in court to stop ivermectin for patients they already planned to take off life support! Here is what he told listeners of my podcast:

I had a doctor on the stand and I asked him the obvious question: why won't you provide the ivermectin? … You've got a patient with less than 20% chance of survival, you are done with the protocol and it hasn't worked, and you won't give ivermectin? And the robot answer is it's not FDA-approved. It's been so bad, I've had doctors actually say to my client you should consider removing life support, and the client said, ""No, I want to try ivermectin,"" and the response was: ""I don't know, that could have negative effects.""

Isn't it interesting that the only treatments they will use either cause blood clots (Olumiant and the vaccines) or renal and liver failure (remdesivir)? Even the WHO recommends against using remdesivir. How could they be so cautious against common, safe, cheap drugs but liberally use the most dangerous, ineffective, and expensive therapeutics?

The answer lies in political science, not life science. Olumiant is an on-patent drug made by the cool kids with a lot of lobbyists and former employees who work at the relevant HHS agencies. There's a lot of money to be made.

Just remember, the same political science that governs the approval of therapeutics also determines the policies behind the COVID shots.

Horowitz: How about ‘red flagging’ those who have ALREADY committed gun crimes?,"Here's a simple proposition a sane and dedicated Republican Party would promote among all its candidates next year: locking up every convicted violent gun felon in America. Doing so would end not only nearly all gun crimes, but most other violent crimes as well. Yet, in the world we live in today, leftists are promoting ""red flag"" laws to take away guns from people without criminal records and without due process while refusing to incarcerate repeat violent felons who either illegally possess guns or commit violence with guns, thus ignoring the ultimate red flags.

Fourteen-year-old Jupiter Paulsen was skateboarding to her mother's home last Friday in what most would consider a safe part of Fargo, North Dakota, when she was suddenly and randomly attacked for 25 minutes. She was allegedly stabbed to death 25 times by 23-year-old Arthur Prince Kollie. The suspect claims to have been high on meth during the attack.

To state the obvious, this wasn't Kollie's first brush with violent crime. According to court records, Kollie was on probation for a 2017 conviction for assault on a peace officer. Yet he violated his probation in one of the worst ways imaginable. He was arrested last December 18 for illegally possessing a firearm as a felon, discharging the firearm within city limits, and possession of drugs.

Now, in a sane world of gun control – where politicians seem so concerned about target pistol braces of those engaged in sports and target practice – they would treat felony possession and discharge of a firearm during probation as a cardinal sin leading to 10-20 years in prison, right? In fact, just a month before the grisly June 4 attack on the girl, Kollie was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation and just 27 days in jail, which he had already served.



In other words, had we constructed a criminal justice system focused on locking up violent gun felons, Kollie would have been behind bars and Jupiter Paulsen would still have most of her life ahead of her. But now that we focus on the gun while letting out the gun felon, Kollie was able to end her life at 14 years with a knife! The Kollie case plays out in every major city every single day – where gun felons are released to please the idols of the de-incarceration agenda, and they then proceed to murder using any other weapon or their bare hands. It's the ultimate proof that criminals, especially gun felons, kill, not guns.

Every day, I see numerous stories of high-profile murders and heinous crimes, and almost every one of them is committed by a known felon who was not fully punished for gun crimes. Whether it's refusing to sentence gun felons to their maximum prison time, refusing to re-incarcerate those who violate their parole with felony possession, or releasing those who commit crimes with guns on no or low bail, the very leftists who push gun control on law-abiding citizens are the ones releasing the ultimate red flags back on the streets.

These are just the stories I've seen over the past two days:

Bronx gang member Alberto Ramirez was arrested on his third gun felony earlier this year after he had a history of being involved in shootings. Even on the third charge, he was only initially held on $75,000 bail. Then, on March 2, acting Supreme Court Justice Denis Boyle lowered the amount to $10,000 cash or $25,000 bond. Fast-forward to this past Monday, and Ramirez is accused of randomly shooting into a crowd during a turf war (in what is called ""spinning the block"") and killing Eric Velasquez, a father of two.

Everyone in Minnesota has heard of George Floyd and Daunte Wright, but nobody has heard of 28-year-old Todd Lorne Banks Jr. who was found dead in Rochester, allegedly shot by two gun felons, Derrick Timothy Days and Nautica Delshaun Cox. Days was released from prison in December 2020 after serving a federal prison sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm and was placed on worthless supervised release for another three years. Cox, who had a history of armed robbery and assault, was convicted of felony possession of a gun last September, but was placed on probation.

Another Minnesota homicide victim who will never obtain George Floyd-level acclaim is 14-year-old Demaris Hobbs-Ekdahl. He was gunned down at a graduation party in suburban Maplewood, and police believe his stepfather, Keith Dawson, started the drive-by shooting that led to his death. It turns out that Dawson had 36 prior convictions, including, you guessed it, a drive-by shooting and several felony possessions.

And speaking of Daunte Wright, the political elites are crying over his accidental killing by cops at a traffic stop, but let's not forget that he was a gun felon who should have been locked up. Not only was he previously arrested for choking and robbing a woman at gun point, but this week a second family filed a civil lawsuit against his estate for carjacking. Another lawsuit alleges that Wright shot a teenager in 2019, leaving him permanently disabled.

Tony Hampton, a career Chicago criminal, was arrested on May 1 for felony possession, but was released without any bail despite his record. Just three days later he was arrested for robbing a phone store. He posted just $10,000 bond and was released, only to rob another phone store three weeks later! This is the story of Chicago.

Last weekend, 6-year-old Coby Daniel went to retrieve his bike, which was parked in front of his neighbor's home in Washtenaw County, Michigan. That neighbor, Ryan Le-Nguyen, allegedly charged at the boy with a sledgehammer, and when he couldn't catch him, shot the boy in the arm, missing his heart by about an inch. That sounds like a pretty bad gun crime, right? Well, a judge released him on just $10,000 cash bond, where he can now go back and threaten the boy who will testify against him.

Isaiah G. ""Zeek"" Gardenhire has racked up a 20-year criminal history in central Michigan, which includes multiple assaults, home invasion, and felony possession of firearms. After being released from prison for his last sentence in October 2020, he was arrested again last month for criminal sexual conduct with a child under 13. How much do you think bail should be set for such a criminal? $1 million? $2 million? Well, he was released on May 27 after posting just $7,500 cash bond. Just one week later, Gardenhire allegedly went on a 40-hour crime spree in Mt. Pleasant that includes killing 13-year-old girl Adre Dembowske, taking hostages, carjacking, robbing people, and sexually assaulting two women, one of whom was a stranger to him. Nobody can say we didn't see this one coming. Adre Dembowske is just another name that will never be known to the public whose memory will fall into the ash heap of ""criminal justice reform.""

I can go on and on, because these stories are essentially what is driving all sorts of violence, including gun violence, in every major city every day. Philadelphia police are averaging over nine gun arrests per day! But almost all of them result in parole, not meaningful jail time, especially if the perpetrator is a juvenile.

You might be wondering by now – isn't possession of firearms considered a felony under federal law? Why then is the Department of Justice not aggressively prosecuting gun felons in cities like Chicago, instead leaving them to local prosecutors and judges to release on parole? The answer is that the feds have no interest in pursuing people who actually harm others with guns because they don't want to add to the prison population. The federal prison population is down 30% over the past eight years, even as the general population grows, and the Biden administration wants to keep it that way.

Imagine if the DOJ worked with every city prosecutor to take the gun felons off the streets through federal prosecutions. They'd prevent most violent crime, not just gun crime. Chicago's justice system has released 534 people charged as felons in possession of a weapon and 569 individuals who have been accused of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon all on ankle monitors. Where are the federal prosecutors taking them off the streets? If they are really concerned about red flags with guns, they'd go after the people who are so obviously red, their hands are dripping with blood in plain sight.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-about-red-flagging-those-who-have-already-committed-gun-crimes,2021-06-11
Horowitz: How GOP governors must stop the OSHA clot-shot mandate in its tracks,"It's not shocking that many blue-state voters swept Democrats out of power in favor of Republicans in parts of the country previously untouchable by the GOP. Nor is it shocking that Biden responded to the election drubbing by doubling down on his tyrannical policies. What is shocking, however, is the lack of GOP resolve to completely neutralize the needle rape mandate even in red states, other than crying to the courts for help.

It was for this very moment that our founders created a layered federalist system. If one entity seized the federal power, the states would remain a check and balance on unconstitutional behavior. Governors would be wise to meet at a conference and declare that any mandate on the people or businesses of their states is null and void. That is exactly what our founders would have done.

Too many people erroneously interpret Article VI's Supremacy Clause as a green light for any action taken by the federal government to supersede state law. However, they are forgetting one phrase of that clause. Article VI, Clause 2 states, ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof … shall be the supreme Law of the Land."" In other words, something that is clearly out of the bounds of federal powers enumerated in Art. I Sec. 8, even if passed by Congress, much less a rogue federal agency like OSHA, is not supreme over state law.

It's not that our founders never envisioned that a president might want to act like a tyrant; it's that they never saw states and the people rolling over and being obsequious to every tyrannical executive edict. Even Alexander Hamilton, the greatest proponent of a robust federal government, made it very clear that unconstitutional edicts would be ignored by the states without having to cry to the federal courts, which the founders feared might also be in cahoots with the federal executive. ""It will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land,"" wrote Hamilton in Federalist #33. ""These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.""

Hamilton reiterated this point in Federalist #78: ""There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid."" Again, he said this about a legislative act – imagine what he would think of a bureaucratic act affecting bodily integrity.

Madison even went so far as to suggest that people would take up arms. In Federalist #46, he stated that in the event of the federal government clamping down on individual rights even with a military (much less career OSHA bureaucrats), ""the State governments with the people on their side would be able to repel the danger"" via the power of ""citizens with arms in their hands""who would be fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by [state] governments possessing their affections and confidence.""

During the North Carolina ratification convention, many delegates were particularly skeptical of ceding power to the federal government and were concerned about the creation of a dictatorship that would crush the state. James Iredell, the lead federalist in the state, who eventually became an original member of the Supreme Court, laughed off the notion that the federal government could succeed when the state and the majority of the people unify behind opposing it. In a speech before the convention on July 29, 1788, he conceded that with the creation of any new government you run the risk of abuse, but that should not cause concern because ""the only resource against usurpation is the inherent right of the people to prevent its exercise. This is the case in all free governments in the world."" He predicted, ""The people will resist if the government usurp powers not delegated to it.""

Commenting on the Guarantee Clause of Art. IV, Section 4, whereby the federal government must guarantee the states ""a republican form of government,"" Tench Coxe made it clear that any usurpation of republicanism would be treated as treason by those who perpetrate it. ""From thence it follows, that any man or body of men, however rich or powerful, who shall make an alteration in the form of government of any state, whereby the powers thereof shall be attempted to be taken out of the hands of the people at large, will stand guilty of high treason,"" declared the Pennsylvania delegate to the Constitutional Convention.

Well, here we are today, with an unelected federal agency proclaiming a mandate on the businesses and bodies of citizens in all 50 states with power that clearly could never have been vested in any government, much less the national government. The Biden administration is mandating that we place something into our bodies that has already proven unsafe and 100% ineffective for its stated purpose of stopping transmission of COVID-19. If our founders' vision of states serving as a check on federal tyranny is not actualized here, especially in light of 19 months of executive edicts without a legislative process, then we should cease calling ourselves a free society.

How is it that governors in states with supermajorities in the legislature and where Biden has a dismally low approval rating are scared to simply say NO? Merely filing a lawsuit and exempting just state government employees from the mandate is not good enough. They need to counterbalance the federal mandate on business with an even stronger mandate to overrule it.



Here is a way they can effectively push back against the feds with a united front, beginning with the convening of special sessions of their respective state legislatures:

Not only ban business mandates in state law, but offer employees a cause of action in state court to sue for damages (with no caps) for vaccine injury or injury from mask-wearing. That will outweigh the magnitude of federal fines on the other side.

Force businesses, with the threat of fines, that decide to listen to the feds to at least apply federal workplace injury law that OSHA is blatantly ignoring. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1904, employers are required to record side effects of workers who are vaccinated by mandate. OSHA publicly admitted that in order to ""encourage COVID-19 vaccinations"" and because the agency does not ""wish to have any appearance of discouraging workers from receiving COVID-19 vaccination,"" it is suspending this requirement through May 2022. States must promise to enforce this law.

While threatening companies with the stick of lawsuits, states should offer the carrot of paying for any potential federal fines levied against the businesses by OSHA.

Make it a felony for anyone to share information about vaccination status with the federal government. This is similar to what New York did with its ""Green Light"" law, making it a felony to share information with ICE. If blue states could do this for illegal alien sex offenders, in violation of legitimate federal immigration powers, then most certainly states can do this to protect American rights in the face of immoral and illegal human rights violations. Page 135 of the OSHA edict ""requires that employers provide employees and their designated representatives access to relevant exposure and medical records"" of other employees. Such an act needs to be punishable with 10 years in prison.

Martin Luther King Jr. famously wrote in his letter from the Birmingham jail, ""One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."" It's that simple. We are sick of these Republican governors stating that something is immoral and unlawful but then countenancing even the most immoral and unconstitutional executive edicts as if they are constitutional statutes. It's to match their rhetoric with deeds.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-gop-governors-must-stop-the-osha-clot-shot-mandate-in-its-tracks,2021-11-08
Horowitz: Idaho church singer & Ohio woman arrested for not wearing masks OUTDOORS,"We've endured nearly four months of endless looting, arson, blocking of roads, violent menacing of motorists, assaults against cops, and vandalism against public property. What percentage of those people do you think have been arrested? Well, judging by the size of the riot crowds, not too many. But in case you thought law enforcement has taken a hands-off approach and is hiding under a rock, think again. They evidently find their moxie when it comes to arresting church singers and a woman who didn't wear a mask at an outdoor football game. The unfortunate message they are conveying to us is that real crime pays and that violence is the only way to get what we want.

Take a look at this video of Seattle cops being assaulted by a mob that essentially set up its own roadblock, occupying public streets.

Twitter twitter.com

How many of them were arrested? There's no way to know, but we sure haven't seen a swift reaction from cops in places like Seattle and Portland. This is happening in dozens of cities every day to some degree. Because of their sheer numbers and the degree of violence they are willing to employ, they tend not to get arrested unless the assault on the cop results in bodily injury. With few exceptions, they are deterring the cops rather than the cops deterring them.



With that in mind, watch the following video of a woman being tased and wrestled to the ground for not wearing a mask at an outdoormiddle school football game in Logan, Ohio.

Woman arrested for not wearing a mask. www.youtube.com

She was not presenting a threat to others, like so many of these people beating civilians at BLM riots. Yes, she was resisting arrest, but if these cops who are cowering from BLM suddenly find their courage against small women who are just passively not wearing a mask outdoors, which is permitted when social distancing is possible, then perhaps we should abolish the police. Really, if that's all they will accomplish, then who needs them?



I've written hundreds of articles over the past decade in support of all forms of local and federal law enforcement. Most of them are terrific and brave people. I understand if they have chosen to take a hands-off approach against violent mobs out of fear of being arrested themselves for simply enforcing critical laws. But it is unforgivable for them to then become sticklers for unconstitutional royal edicts like mask-wearing and find easy targets for enforcement who are white so they can feel good about themselves without facing the backlash of the mob. We all know that had this individual been black, the tasering would not have gone over well.

There's no easier target than a church choir. We've seen police retreat several times and allow their own stations to get burned down or attacked in several cities, but if they see people gathering with social distance to sing hymns, it's a different story. We thought this could only happen in Australia, or perhaps that if it happened in America, it would only occur in a deep blue city. But local police in Moscow, Idaho, arrested Gabriel Rench, a candidate for Latah county commissioner, during a Psalm Sing service held by members of the local Christ Church. His crime? Not identifying himself to the police when they arrested or cited him and four others for either not ""social distancing"" or not wearing a mask … outdoors.



This might look like a scene out of Moscow, Russia, but it's really northern Idaho. Ohio and Idaho are red states. Yes, the city of Moscow is more Democrat because of the presence of the University of Idaho, but there is no reason any county in this state with GOP supermajorities in the legislature and a Republican governor should have an outdoor mask mandate. Why is it that red counties in blue states are completely obsequious to tyranny, but when the shoe is on the other foot, suddenly the Republican governor gets gun-shy?

Hocking County, Ohio, where the woman was tased for resisting arrest after not wearing a mask outdoors, was carried by Trump by a 31-point margin. How can it be that you can no longer breathe free air outdoors in red states?! As conservatives, we clearly are not focusing properly and are not doing enough to fight for liberty.

This is also why it's so important that we get answers about the constitutionality of these draconian restrictions from whoever is chosen to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. Given our body of case law creating novel rights that stop governments from doing much less invasive things to us, it's very hard to see how forcing someone to cover her face to merely remain outdoors passes muster with the principle established in NFIB v. Sebelius about the Obamacare mandate to purchase insurance. The restriction of church gatherings most certainly does not pass the First Amendment smell test.

There is a very chilling and disquieting point that emerges from these troubling stories. We are seeing that the people who are most likely to support the police are getting arrested, while those who exhibit the most belligerence and violence often deter the police from enforcing the law rather than the other way around. The lesson seems clear: that when you act more antagonistically and in greater numbers, you are more likely to get your way. While proactive violence is something any patriot should abhor, perhaps we do need to stand together in greater numbers.

A blueprint for how to deter the police in these instances is what some men in Spain did when police tried to detain a female for not wearing a mask. They all threw down their masks and, without directly attacking the police, grabbed the woman back.

That is the difference between anarchy and liberty. Patriots firmly resist arbitrary and unconstitutional edicts against individual liberties while limiting their resistance to the issue at hand. Anarchists use their grievances as pretext to proactively attack others indiscriminately.



As for the police, if they will not deter anarchy but instead infringe upon liberty, perhaps they need to be abolished after all.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-idaho-ohio-mask-arrests,2020-09-24
Horowitz: It’s time for state constitutional amendments against bio-fascist government mandates,"""No earthly king or president or public health official or billionaire technocrat gets to dictate what we must put into our bodies.” ~Rev. Ed Meeks, Towson, Maryland

Outside a few states, no Republican-controlled government has even repudiated the current iteration of COVID fascism, much less immunized the population from future usurpations. Over the past 20 months, the governing elites have successfully established a premise that they can shout “public health emergency” and mandate any form of restriction or action against your body, property, or movement without any due process, transparency, evidentiary standards, oversight, or democratic process. The lesson of the past year is that no such morality or science could ever necessitate such an outcome.

Undoubtedly, Republicans can run Mickey Mouse on the ballot in every state and win big in next year’s midterm elections. But on which principles are they running? Absent an effort to direct the national election towards the raging fire consuming liberty and medical freedom, we will elect the same Republicans who not only fail to put out this fire, but actually add their own lighter fluid against liberty, as most of them agree with Anthony Fauci and company and most aspects of public health tyranny. What if we pursued a national strategy of state constitutional amendments placed on the ballot in as many red states as possible prohibiting bio-medical tyranny and immunizing us from any future attempt to resurrect it?

While it’s nearly impossible to add amendments to the national Constitution, many state constitutions can be amended by some quorum of legislators, a ballot initiative, or a mixture of both. If Republicans in deep red states (and even some swing states) were forced to take a stand, it is quite achievable to successfully get an amendment on the ballot in many states affirming the right to bodily integrity, property, and freedom of movement. It’s time for voters to finally have their say on the most consequential question of our time, if not the entire existence of this country.

One great example of such an effort is Pennsylvania HB 2013, authored by Rep. Russ Diamond. The proposed state constitutional amendment, which is sponsored by 20 Republicans and already passed the relevant House committee, creates a right to medical freedom with the following language:

The right of an individual to refuse any medical procedure, treatment, injection, vaccine or prophylactic may not be questioned or interfered with in any manner. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged to any person in this Commonwealth because of the exercise of the right under this section.

This is a simple proposition we should all agree upon as a free country and indeed never had to contemplate until now. But absent an effort to promote this in as many states as possible, we literally are no longer a free people.

To be clear, this is not about creating a right to a treatment or services (such as an abortion), but freedom from government action taken against our bodies. As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his famous Obergefell dissent: “In the American legal tradition, liberty has long been understood as individual freedom from governmental action, not as a right to a particular governmental entitlement.”

The freedom to breathe and move without government requiring injections or that we cover our breathing holes is the most basic expression of liberty. If Republicans running for office this election cannot rally behind this simple proposition, then all their platitudes about “limited government” are meaningless. Placing such an amendment on the ballot in as many states as possible will make it hard for weaselly Republicans to dodge COVID fascism as a campaign issue and make this issue front and center in every campaign.

In Pennsylvania itself, it is not possible to get the amendment on the ballot for this election because state law requires any amendment proposal pass in two successive legislative sessions. However, Republicans control both houses in 32 states, many of them with supermajorities, that can easily be harnessed to get these amendments on the ballot for the upcoming election. Moreover, a number of states give voters the power to initiate constitutional amendment ballot questions by gathering signatures and completely bypassing the legislature. According to Ballotpedia, the list includes:

Arizona

Arkansas

California

Colorado

Florida

Illinois

Massachusetts

Michigan

Mississippi

Missouri

Montana

Nebraska

Nevada

North Dakota

Ohio

Oklahoma

Oregon

South Dakota

Also, even in the states where there is no viable path to a legislative or initiative-based constitutional amendment to be placed on the ballot, several states do allow a right to initiate a ballot question that is a statutory change. They include Alaska, Idaho, and Maine. It’s still important to codify into statute that no government can take away your life, liberty, and property or freedom of movement for a declared emergency.

The Pennsylvania legislature will convene for three days in December, and it’s important for House majority leader Kerry Benninghoff to schedule a vote on this matter immediately. This is the most effective way to bypass the Democrat governor, take the issue directly to the people, and define the election around the most meaningful messaging and policy.

It is shocking that 20 months into the most deadly and devastating form of fascism ever in American history, numerous Republican states still have not lifted a finger to fight COVID fascism, despite enjoying supermajorities. With 39-11 and 71-29 majorities in the Senate and House respectively, Indiana Republicans couldn’t even end the unlawful emergency declaration from RINO Gov. Eric Holcomb, much less pass any protections against mandates, during last week’s special session.

Sadly, we should not even need constitutional amendments to affirm bare-bones human rights during a time of a declared emergency. As the great Justice Robert Jackson said in the landmark Youngstown case of 1952, “Aside from suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in time of rebellion or invasion, when the public safety may require it, they made no express provision for exercise of extraordinary authority because of a crisis.”



“They knew what emergencies were, knew the pressures they engender for authoritative action, knew, too, how they afford a ready pretext for usurpation,” wrote Jackson. “We may also suspect that they suspected that emergency powers would tend to kindle emergencies.”

Justice Jackson, aside from being the lead dissenter in the Japanese internment case, was the lead prosecutor at the Nuremberg trial. The time has come for a political party and movement to arise that will rekindle the liberty, due process, and anti-fascism that successfully punished the perpetrators of bio-medical experimentation at Nuremberg and harness them once again in our time.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-its-time-for-state-constitutional-amendments-against-bio-fascist-governmental-mandates,2021-12-02
Horowitz: It’s time Republicans call Biden’s bluff on American energy before it’s too late,"The obsession and virtue-signaling over Ukraine has become such an orgy of emotional indulgence that it now rivals COVID, BLM, and Jan. 6 – the three most recent catalyzing moments in geo-politics – in its bipartisan intensity. The same players behind the over-indulgence of the aforementioned three events seem to have been too prepared to cherish this moment well beyond what any spontaneous human reaction to the invasion should have induced. Given that we now understand the motivations behind those three events, we should be very wary as to where the Ukrainian obsession is coming from and where it is headed – before it’s too late.

Let’s face it: Corrupt Western governments, the media, Big Tech, and all the other masters of Western civilization don’t suddenly have an affinity for an all-white, retro culture, and anti-vax country like Ukraine. The nation is not exactly the paradigm of social media wokeness. On the other hand, there has never been a greater obsession with glorifying a civilization with heroism, bravery, and altruism as there has been with promoting Ukrainian gallantry memes – to the point that most of the stories are fake. At the same time, even as Western leaders dote upon Ukraine as the most virtuous cause of mankind – to the point that they think this is the WWII Hitler/Poland moment – none of the Western countries have banded together to meaningfully fight on the ground with Ukraine.

After all, if we are to believe that Putin is the greatest threat to mankind and Ukrainians are already on their way to crushing Russia (but just need a little help), why do the actions of the European leaders not match their rhetoric? Never has there been such unanimity of opinion behind supporting one nation; never have they so praised that nation’s ability to fight off the enemy; yet never have they done so little to join the fight in a way that actually matters. This observation should concern us all, given that we now know COVID, January 6. and George Floyd/BLM were all given the same orgy-like media indulgence and led to a much broader harmful agenda. What is that agenda behind the Ukrainian fetish?

Perhaps the answer to these questions is that despite the virtue-signaling, the fight is not really on the ground in Ukraine. After all, if that were true, and the Ukrainians were as effective as they are made out to be, England, France, Germany, and a coalition of central European countries could easily unite and isolate Russia militarily. Clearly, they are trying to use Ukraine to manipulate their own citizens in Western countries to make “sacrifices” – similar to what they did with COVID. In order to prepare us for such sacrifices and make it the “moral thing to do,” they must first play up the Putin situation as they did COVID.

So, what is that sacrifice?

On Wednesday, the House passed H. Res. 956 – “Supporting the People of Ukraine,” which resolves, among other things, to “pledge to support working with Europe and international partners to bolster Europe’s energy security and reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports.” Notice it doesn’t pledge to ramp up energy production, just to reduce dependence on Russian imports. There are two ways of doing that. You can either increase your own supply – but Biden already inhibited energy growth – or you could decrease your consumption.

Remember, for years the globalists have been trying to institute a “green new deal” and destroy our freedom and productivity by replacing energy that works with “green” energy. They used global warming, and then climate change, to scare people into supporting the agenda, but as much as polls show people respond to it, in the deep recesses of their hearts they do not fear the climate.

What COVID taught these same Western oligarchs is that if you make people truly fear something, they will give up all their liberties, including even bodily autonomy. If you make something so virtuous with emotional indulgence on social media and bully and shame people into “protecting the other person,” they will be willing to unquestionably and immediately follow your every whim. What if they are making Putin the new WWII to immediately cut off Russian oil and gas without concurrently ramping up our own production, thereby forcing Western citizens to “make sacrifices” for the greater good? If they locked us down for a few months and successfully got us to cover our breathing holes and take all these shots, who’s to say they couldn’t get us to limit our driving and consumption of other products? And what if they used the carrot and stick – made energy so prohibitively expensive but had all the cronies lined up to incentivize a transition to “green” energy?

It’s not lost on the oligarchs that CO2 levels dropped 26% during the lockdowns. In 2020, fossil fuel consumption was the lowest in 30 years. Don’t you think the Bill Gateses of the world wish to repeat that pleasurable experience? Plus, through the advent of COVID fascism, they remade life with Zoom and acclimated us to living such a new normal without travel, connectivity, and human gatherings. If you don’t think they can’t make Putin such an emergency that would engender another version of this dystopia, you must have slept under a rock since 2020. I’m seeing so many conservatives get swept into the lynch-mob media feeding frenzy over Ukraine – even those who didn’t buy into the COVID lockdown narrative.

I’m not saying this is necessarily the play, but we better make sure it is not. And we certainly can’t assume people will not fall into the trap again. We already have a society now groomed to do what they are told for the “greater good” in a time of “emergency.”

When pondering the mistakes of the past two years, consider the following:

Putin is the new COVID.

Zelenskyy is the new Fauci.

Ukrainian soldiers are the new heroic health care workers.

Cutting off oil from Russia is the new social distancing.

Not using products that consume more energy is the new mask and public shaming.

Green energy is the new vaccine, and their companies are the new Pfizer.

But you know what the new hydroxychloroquine/ivermectin/early treatment is? Ramping up our own energy productivity so we can live in liberty without Russian and Iranian oil, not locking us down in order to fight Russia.

It’s time for Republicans to rectify this mistake they made with COVID. They should have called the bluff of the Western oligarchs from day one. “Well, if defeating COVID is the highest order of man,” Republicans should have asked, “then why not promote, rather than deter, early treatment options?”

With the White House pushing for $10 billion in funding for a tenuous and corrupt Ukrainian regime with no long-term strategic plan or objective, why not ask the following simple question: If we are going to place this funding in the budget, why not also insert provisions in the budget approving pipelines, permitting drilling, and ending the onerous freeze Biden has placed on coal-fired plants, fracking, oil refineries, and nuclear power plants? Why not work with friendly Alberta to get clean oil down the Keystone pipeline?

Republicans have already made it clear they don’t give a hoot about fighting our own border invasion in the budget or rectifying the mistakes they made with COVID fascism. Americans don’t matter. Ukraine is where it’s at. But if Putin is really the number one threat such that they are willing to give it their all, why not demand the GOP energy policy be placed in that same budget or supplemental emergency spending bill on Ukraine?



Why not make American energy production to be the “vaccine” for the “Putin virus” and regulate it with the light touch that we used to regulate Pfizer, not the intensity with which we stifle hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin? What about emergency regulations to approve permitting, drilling, and pipelines without the red tape? At least the oil, unlike the Pfizer shots, doesn’t go into our bodies.

The minute Republicans agree to pass the budget bill next week with the Ukraine funding – without any effort to secure true energy independence and end Biden’s war on American oil and gas – is the day they consign us to whatever plot the oligarchs have hatched.

Horowitz: It’s time to end the great American COVID-19 police state,"We now have the most severe, widespread, and protracted form of martial law in our nation's history … except as it applies to dangerous criminals who are undeterred and released. How much worse will we allow this to get until we call a foul on these gross constitutional violations?

As I observed last week, states have wide latitude to forcibly quarantine individuals or groups of people from the general population. But they don't have the power to shut down the entire general population. Also, as the Supreme Court has said many times, there are times when life, liberty, and property can be infringed upon, but it must be narrowly tailored to the least invasive means needed to achieve the compelling state interest. What is happening now is anything but narrow.

Consider the following:

At what point will we the people stand up to this capricious nonsense, especially as these same politicians release criminals and illegal aliens, while lying to us about the math and science behind their unilateral edicts? Why is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the only leader who recognizes that ""we can't start ripping up the Constitution?""

The same states that couldn't set their conditions for early voting or regulate abortion clinic health standards without a federal judge intervening are now free to crush our life, liberty, and property at their most basic level – free of any due process, time constraints, or judicial oversight. The only judicial review now is for abortion clinics, criminals, and illegal aliens.

Remember, if we don't rise up now, these tyrants are just getting started. If you are wondering what is in store for us in the coming days, just look at what some other countries that were less free than we to begin with have been doing. Panama now requires men and women to go out for essential services only on alternating, days and nobody is allowed out on Sunday. Some eastern European countries are clamping down on freedom of speech.

If you think this won't happen in America, just step back and take stock of how much power has been seized in just three weeks.

It's one thing to declare a lockdown for 24 hours based on concern of an existential threat. But we are into the fourth week of this, and all the models that guided leaders were proven wrong from day one. Are we going to remain like frogs in boiling water?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-its-time-to-end-the-great-american-covid-19-police-state,2020-04-07
Horowitz: Martha’s Vineyard affair shows how easily states could fight the border invasion,"We’ve been told for decades that America is different from every other country in human history in that it has no right to jurisdictional sovereignty. Anyone can trespass the country, unilaterally assert domicile in a given locality against the will of the people and its governing authority, and force the people to pay for their medical bills, K-12 education (Plyler v. Doe), make their children citizens, and be counted in the census – and there’s not a darn thing you can do about it. That was until Martha’s Vineyard.



Conservatives often observe the appalling hypocrisy of the left-wing virtue-signalers who publicly advocate for illegal immigration but then refuse to live with the consequences. But rather than just scoring a political talking point, conservatives would be wise to secure political outcomes based on the Martha’s Vineyard affair. If the residents of the opulent island were able to marshal the National Guard to remove 50 illegal aliens within a day, why shouldn’t the red states follow suit immediately?

What we’ve learned from the virtue-signaling at Martha’s Vineyard is that indeed, illegal aliens simply landing on their island doesn’t make them entitled to endless use of the community’s services. Residents, while claiming to have compassion and posting photo ops offering them food and shelter, made it clear that they lack the resources to house them — and therefore it is the compassionate thing, from anyone’s vantage point, to move them somewhere else. Why then should other poorer parts of the country be saddled with a burden on their schools and hospitals that is incalculable?

Consider the plight of Arizona, for a moment. As many as 11% of all school children have at least one parent who is in the country illegally. According to a 2012 study by the Federation for Immigration Reform, “The total education, medical, and incarceration costs in Arizona due to illegal immigration are $2.6 billion a year.” And that is for an entire state. You can imagine that the costs are even more acute in some local cities and towns, many of which are quite poor, such as Yuma. Some estimate that the lifetime cost of just the illegal aliens who have come under Biden so far is upwards of $100 billion. And those numbers are growing every day.

Martha’s Vineyard currently has 165 children in the local public school. Applying the same ratio as Arizona, they could easily afford these families because they likely don’t yet have 18 children among the group of 50 (11% of their native enrollment). If even that is too absurd for them, why should Texas, Arizona, and every other state cater to the invasion instead?

Thus, rather than merely observing the double standard of the left, isn’t it time for red states to begin promoting their own self-survival? Federal courts have forced these states to educate the world’s children, but Martha’s Vineyard wouldn’t be caught dead enrolling them in their schools. And they most certainly wouldn’t put up with the crime.

In 2018, John Lott conducted an analysis of Arizona’s incarcerated population and found that illegal immigrants in Arizona are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of crime than other Arizonans. He also found that they are 45.4% more likely to have been gang members, and “they are 133% more likely to receive sentencing enhancements for being classified as dangerous, and they tend to be released from prison at a younger age despite more serious crimes because they initially go to jail at a younger age.”

The point being that if Martha’s Vineyard could request removal of illegal aliens with no record of their island being overrun with gangs, drugs, and the rampant fiscal cost, then most certainly, those areas suffering its effects for two generations should have the right to use their respective national guards to remove illegal aliens. Ironically, Martha’s Vineyard residents were acting upon their own heritage. In 1700, Massachusetts passed a law denying admission to those deemed a public charge or who forced shipmasters to guarantee their economic security. They forced the ships to transport the inadmissible aliens at their own cost.









Red states have the ability to end this charade tomorrow. They can declare an invasion and invoke Art. I Sec. 10 to repel the invasion by coordinating their respective national guards to remove all large groups of illegal aliens the feds send into their states and return them to Mexico. If Martha’s Vineyard can’t afford them, most others can’t either. The federal government has violated its commitment to the states and the states have the right to step in and end this invasion. The amount of illegal immigration, pursuant to law, that states should tolerate is zero. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires the DHS to achieve full operational control over the border, defined as “the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.”

So why haven’t the states stepped up to the plate? Sadly, most Republicans still support the cheap labor-driven open borders agenda. Sure, now, more than ever, they will use the chaos at the border as a cudgel against Biden headed into an election, but do they really want to shut off the flow of illegal aliens? Idaho Republicans Mike Crapo and Mike Simpson are strongly pushing legislation to grant amnesty and a path to citizenship for illegal aliens working in agriculture so they can further drive down wages and bring some of the problems associated with big cities to America’s rural areas.

HR 1603 has 13 Republican House co-sponsors. The bill grants amnesty to every illegal alien in this country who claims to have worked at least part-time for agriculture and creates an unlimited agriculture guest worker program for the future to bring in millions of low-skilled workers. The cultural and fiscal costs are never factored in. It permanently tethers green cards for people coming in on these H-2 visas to the condition of working in agriculture for 10 years, creating an indentured servant model that will prevent farms from ever modernizing and mechanizing their processes because of the boundless flow of cheap labor.

“This is not amnesty,” said Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, using the age-old trick to redefine amnesty. “This is earned citizenship, earned legality in the country, to be able to provide the jobs and do the jobs that are necessary.” The comments were made at the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives in Washington where the American Business Immigration Coalition promised to spend $8 million promoting the amnesty bill.

This, despite the flood of illegals at an unimaginable level.

Just know it doesn’t have to be this way. States can take charge of their own destinies. The problem is that Ron DeSantis is the only GOP governor espousing the view that immigration should be driven by a cost-benefit analysis to the whole of the people, not just to special interests. Most Republicans, as much as they don’t like the chaos at the border, continue to espouse a belief in the corporate cartel’s monopoly on our country in their desire to bring in boundless cheap labor.

“But corporatism is not the same as free enterprise. Too many Republicans have viewed limited government to basically mean whatever is best for corporate America is how we want to do the economy. And my view is, obviously free enterprise is the best economic system,” said DeSantis at a recent National Conservatism Conference.

Focusing on policy both for illegal and legal immigration, DeSantis framed his thought process as follows: “So the issue is, how does immigration serve the people of the United States and the national interest?” he said, adding, “We’re not globalists who believe that foreigners have a right to come into our country whenever they want to.”

At least as it relates to limousine liberals, when they are mugged by reality they will come to their senses. Not so for the globalist “business community” which Republicans slavishly serve. No amount of border chaos will ever move them from their dogmatic support for endless cheap labor.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-marthas-vineyard-affair-shows-how-easy-states-could-fight-the-border-invasion,2022-09-20
Horowitz: Massive Danish study found that recommendation to wear masks did not provide statistically significant reduction in infection rates among mask wearers,"Editor's note: This article has been corrected. The study's authors did not find a statistically significant reduction in infection rates between people who received a recommendation to wear a mask, and people who did not receive a recommendation to wear a mask. However, the study did not purport to measure the efficacy of masks in preventing people who are already infected from spreading SARS-CoV-2, or the larger question of whether mask wearing overall is effective at preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Please follow all local regulations and laws.



Most Western elites are telegraphing the message that we will be forced to cover our humanity with cheap Chinese face burkas indefinitely. They are mandating that even two-year-olds must wear masks. The long-term effects on the lungs, emotional and behavioral problems, and development of infants and toddlers is enormous. For such an unconstitutional invasion of personal liberty, they are responsible to show us some amazing degree of effectiveness of this cultish ritual.

The much-vaunted Danish mask study was finally published today in the prestigious Annals of Internal Medicine. Now we know why three medical journals were so averse to publishing its findings. The study examined the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among people who did not receive a recommendation to wear a mask, compared to people who did receive a recommendation to wear a mask. The results of this massive real-life controlled experiment show that the group that received a recommendation to wear surgical masks in April experienced a 0.38% lower infection rate than the control group that did not wear masks. That is about one-third of one percent, which is so low that it could just be statistically random variances that demonstrate no definitive efficacy even to that infinitesimal level.

""The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use,"" concluded the authors. ""The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.""

There was a total of roughly 3,000 people in each group of the study, which would make this the largest study ever conducted on the efficacy of a mask recommendation. In October, Berlingske, Denmark's oldest operating daily newspaper, reported that three major journals – JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine, and Lancet – refused to publish the study.

It appears that the study's authors had to twist their tongues in order to get this study published by noting that ""the estimates were imprecise and statistically compatible with an effect ranging from a 46% decrease to a 23% increase in infection."" They of course had to concede that their study doesn't definitely rule out the idea that masks could be effective!

It's important to note that several studies have theorized that the virus might have gotten more contagious in recent months than it was in the spring. Assuming there is validity to that theory, this Danish study, which was conducted in April and May, would demonstrate that masks are ineffective even against the less contagious version of the virus.



Then again, there is nothing new about mask-wearing to anyone paying attention. It has long been the policy of OSHA that respirators, such as an N-95s, are the minimum standard for personal protective equipment. We have always known that surgical masks, which have pores about 30 times larger than virus particles and are not form-fitted around the edges, cannot protect against airborne viruses such as the flu. Plus, most people, especially those who are indoors for a long period of time, such as in school and business settings, will tend to wear more comfortable cloth masks, which are even less effective and risk spreading the virus even more.

The authors of the study say that masks might still be an effective method to prevent spread of the virus because it might prevent people who are already infected from transmitting the virus:

The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the study period, authorities did not recommend face mask use outside hospital settings and mask use was rare in community settings. This means that study participants' exposure was overwhelmingly to persons not wearing masks.

This is a fair point – that at the time, most other people outside of the study group in Denmark were not wearing masks. The problem is we've seen the virus spread to everyone in the ensuing months, including in places with 100% mask compliance. In a recent CDC study, 85% of those convalescent COVID patients surveyed reported that they wore masks always or most of the time during the lead-up to their infection period. Thus, the Danish study results clearly corroborate what we see with our own eyes in all environments.

We have seen this result from over six months of real-life experience in the world and even in the military with 100% compliance. My son was yelled at for slipping his mask down in a dentist's office for a few seconds when the doctor and hygienist would literally be in his mouth for a much longer period of time. Have we ever experienced something this destructive and illogical in our lifetimes?

Horowitz: McConnell’s omnibus betrayal demonstrates the Senate was lost from day one,"For those feeling bad that Republicans didn’t win the Senate, you will now understand that Democrats already enjoyed supermajority control of the chamber, including command of the GOP leader himself. Every GOP Senate leader from McConnell on down has agreed to codify nearly every one of Biden’s spending priorities and affirm every single unconstitutional, harmful, and tyrannical policy for the entire remainder of the fiscal year, thereby sabotaging the leverage of the incoming GOP House majority.



What is scary about the past couple of weeks of budgetary negotiations is that even as Republicans and Democrats disagreed, they really agreed on 99% of the budget and 100% of the policies. They merely fake-jousted over $26 billion in broad generalized spending out of a $1.7 trillion budget. Essentially, both sides agreed to write the military a blank check of $858 billion for its woke and aimless policies. The only disagreement was that Republicans wanted to spend the same level as Biden on non-defense spending – $787 billion, while Democrats wanted to spend $813 billion. In other words, they were arguing over 1.5% of the discretionary spending budget.

So how did they solve the “impasse”? Democrat Pat Leahy and Republican Richard Shelby – both senators who will no longer be in the chamber for the remainder of the fiscal year – announced they would drop an omnibus bill in the coming days, while passing a seven-day stopgap bill so they can pass the omnibus next week. The top-line non-defense spending numbers will be somewhere in between $787 billion and $813, but they are keeping them quiet so members can’t complain!

This is the great suspense – the exact decimal point of a spending increase. Republicans like Biden’s budget top-line, which is 8% above last year’s levels for non-defense spending; Democrats wanted slightly more, and they split the baby. This perfectly encapsulates the uniparty.

Here we have a government that is spying on the American people, criminalizing political opposition and free speech, mutilating our kids, funding pharma’s biomedical security state on our bodies, working with the cartels to invade our country, handing our inheritance to Ukraine, and choking off our energy during an energy crisis. Republicans are content with all of that and are even fine with blocking Republicans in the House from dealing with these crises until next year. For example, our government is paying Pfizer yet another $2 billion for its COVID drug, for which there is no independent study showing it’s safe and effective. All they are fighting over is a few billion in extra general spending, when the malfeasance agencies being funded are already flush with cash even under the Republican proposal.

Hearings in the House can be meaningful if they serve as the hammer driving into the anvil of a budget deadline in which Republicans will defund the policies that are found to be harmful and unlawful in the hearings. Senate Republicans have taken that off the table for a full year. Just consider the border invasion issue alone. The Biden administration is preparing for up to 14,000 illegal aliens a day, which is an annualized flow of 5.1 million! The president will have no budget bill hanging over his neck to keep him in check.

On Wednesday, Rep. Chip Roy asked the Rules Committee to consider his stopgap bill that would fund government until Feb. 3. It was rejected. That should have triggered automatic Senate GOP opposition to the budget deal, but of course Senate Republicans have a lot more in common with their Democrat colleagues than they do with their voters.

The final bill will contain extra Ukraine funding because both sides agree to this insanity. McConnell said on Tuesday, unfortunately with merit, that “continuing support for Ukraine is the popular mainstream view that stretches across the ideological spectrum.” This is on top of the $60 billion – all without any oversight whatsoever despite everything we now know about the money pit. This, at a time when the public share of the debt is almost 100% of GDP, up from 35% in 2007, when we thought George W. Bush was a big spender.

Republicans balked at extra spending on COVID (beyond the unfathomable amounts already baked into the base budget), but only because they felt there were existing accounts that were unspent, not because the COVID agenda is killing us and needs to be banned.



Thus, the entire funding for this fiscal year and all the policies it encompasses were set in motion by a number of retiring senators, led by Richard Shelby (RINO-Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee.

Interestingly enough, Democrats only have a two-vote majority in the House, due to recent vacancies. Yet nobody seems concerned that they will lose a single vote on a contentious issue like the omnibus. Why is it that only one “side” of the uniparty is always united?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-omnibus-betrayal-demonstrates-the-senate-was-lost-from-day-one,2022-12-15
Horowitz: McConnell’s shocking betrayal of the midterm mandate,"Americans could literally be drowning in a morass of a physical, cultural, and economic flood, but McConnell and the GOP elites would toss the last remaining lifeline to Ukraine. Not only are Americans placed last, they simply don’t matter to American politicians in both parties.



We are facing the nightmare scenario in which our own government is an enemy of the people. Our government officials orchestrate a cartel invasion of the country with millions crossing our border. They induce one life-altering catastrophic policy after another from COVID, attack our energy and food, groom a generation of children with gender-bending, and genetically engineer Americans like pieces of software. To top it off, they are unleashing 87,000 IRS agents upon us and sending the FBI to persecute political opponents. Yet not only won’t Senate Republicans hold up the budget bill until these grievances are redressed through defunding mechanisms and policy changes, they are actually adding new funding for Ukraine – the catalyst for the energy crisis – and more resettlement of unvetted Afghan refugees.

In other words, the only anomalous policy provisions added to what was supposed to be a stopgap bill pertain to spending money on foreigners, not Americans. To add insult to injury, they are strategically timing the expiration of the CR for Dec.16 during the lame-duck session, so that the defeated members can lock in an entire year of spending and possibly tack on transformational policies, undercutting the leverage of a future Republican Congress.

Typically, a stopgap bill places spending levels on autopilot unless it is peppered with “anomalies” to address specific expenditures. It appears that the only anomalies in this bill are for foreign entities. The bill provides an additional $12.3 billion in spending for Ukraine, with no understanding of what we are getting for our investment aside from an energy crisis. American taxpayers have become Zelenskyy’s private piggy bank. And Congress is doing this at a time when the Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged. Don’t our leaders want any answers as to who was involved before we send a blank check to that part of the world?

Then there are the Afghan refugees. The bill allows a $3 billion transfer for the State Department to resettle more Afghans. Both the DOD and DHS inspector generals have identified known terrorists who have been evacuated to the U.S. When questioned by the IG’s office, CBP officials rebuffed the request to “immediately” identify all the Afghans in the U.S., provide proper proof of vetting, and then develop a contingency plan for vetting in future emergency evacuations.

Specifically, the DOD IG’s report stated that they “could not locate some Afghan evacuees when attempting to report derogatory information to the DoD and U.S. government agencies supporting CONUS [Continental United States] safe havens.""



How could Republicans sign off on even more funding for refugees without demanding policy changes on security? Sure, the bill does throw $15 million at the FBI for vetting, but fails to specify a plan to do that. One has to wonder if that funding will go toward surveilling political enemies.

Here is the list of the 22 Republicans, including McConnell, who voted for cloture on Tuesday:

Blunt, Roy (Mo.)

Boozman (Ark.)

Capito (W. Va.)

Cassidy (La.)

Collins, S. (Maine)

Cornyn (Texas)

Cotton (Ark.)

Ernst (Iowa)

Graham (S.C.)

Grassley (Iowa)

Hyde-Smith (Miss.)

Kennedy (La.)

McConnell (Ky.)

Moran (Kan.)

Murkowski (Alaska)

Portman (Ohio)

Romney (Utah)

Shelby (Ala.)

Sullivan (Alaska)

Tillis (N.C.)

Wicker (Miss.)

Young, T. (Ind.)

What is shocking is how Republicans wouldn’t even fight against the hiring of IRS agents, which is probably the most unpopular policy of the Biden administration. They are instead touting a stand-alone bill they plan to introduce next year that will transfer funding from the new IRS agents to border security. But absent a plan to fight for this in the actual budget bill, it is nothing but a distraction. Kevin McCarthy hasn’t even joined the Freedom Caucus in calling for the budget bill to expire early next year so that a House GOP majority can rewrite the budget for the remainder of the fiscal year.

So, what will change next year? Perhaps someone can convince Mitch McConnell to send the IRS and FBI agents to Ukraine and spare us the persecution. After all, if he won’t do it for the sake of American rights, maybe the allure of fighting for Ukraine will make him do the right thing for the wrong reason.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-shocking-betrayal-of-the-midterm-mandate,2022-09-29
"Horowitz: Merck rejects ivermectin for COVID treatment after getting $1.2 billion gov’t contract for expensive, unproven drug","For those trying to follow the science and the law, it's been impossible to ascertain a modicum of consistency in the government's COVID response. However, when you follow the money, everything officials are doing (as well as what they are not doing) makes perfect sense.

The same government that has the power to use COVID to shut down our lives and our breathing also has the power to determine to which pharmaceutical company it will send billions of taxpayer dollars, a decision that is governed 100% by money and politics, not by sound medicine. We already understand why the vaccine companies have been funding a war against cheap, effective therapeutics such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, but many have wondered why Merck would oppose a drug that the company itself has made for many years.

On Feb. 4, Merck came out with a shocking statement warning against the use of ivermectin to treat COVID. The statement claimed there was ""no scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies"" and that there was ""a concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.""

This was quite a bizarre assertion given that 59 studies, including 30 randomized controlled trials, have shown the drug to be extremely effective at all stages of the virus. The statement regarding safety concerns was even more ludicrous given that nearly 4 billion doses of this drug have been dispensed for parasitic ailments, it won the Nobel prize, and it is listed among the WHO's most essential drugs. There is no logical reason why someone would somehow begin experiencing dangerous side effects if he happens to use ivermectin for COVID instead of for scabies or river blindness.

Nonetheless, Merck's statement served as a strong blow to the use of ivermectin, because Merck was a large dispenser of this drug. After all, why would the company dump on its own drug?

Well, now we have an answer. On June 9, Merck announced that it had entered into a procurement agreement. Merck will receive approximately $1.2 billion to supply approximately 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir to the United States government. Molnupiravir is a new drug Merck is currently evaluating in a Phase 3 clinical trials to serve as the wonder drug to treat COVID. The estimated cost of the drug per treatment is $700!



So now we can understand why the company would swap out its own drug that has already been proven safe and effective for something new and experimental. Without the government sending a penny to Merck, I can buy a lifesaving dose of ivermectin for just $26 through GoodRX.

Well, that's if the pharmacy would actually dispense it to me and a doctor would prescribe it to me. We can now understand why Big Pharma has colluded with big government to pressure doctors and pharmacists away from prescribing and dispensing ivermectin. This historic business deal would be moot.



Also, let us not forget that expedited approval of experimental new drugs runs into the same problem as the experimental vaccines. Approval for ""Emergency Use Authorization"" can be granted by the FDA only if there is ""no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing or treating"" a disease. That's why already-approved drugs like ivermectin have to vanish from discussion. Can you imagine how much ivermectin the feds could have dispensed for a fraction of the cost of expensive experimental drugs and mRNA shots?

What is particularly disturbing is that it appears that molnupiravir contains some of the same molecular qualities as ivermectin, which makes you wonder if Merck knows that ivermectin is effective and just sought a more expensive drug that could be marketed as exclusive and new for COVID, thereby justifying another budget blowout by Washington policymakers.

One of several antiviral qualities to ivermectin is that it disrupts viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzymes. Two Italian doctors in a study published in Nature described the process as follows:

The RdRP residing in nsp12 is the centerpiece of the coronavirus replication and transcription complex and has been suggested as a promising drug target as it is a crucial enzyme in the virus life cycle both for replication of the viral genome but also for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs) [34]. Ivermectin binds to the viral rdrp and disrupts it. The highly efficient binding of ivermectin to nsp14 confirms its role in inhibiting viral replication and assembly. It is well known that nsp14 is essential in transcription and replication.

Dr. Pierre Kory, the president ofFrontline Covid19 Critical Care Alliance and one of the most prominent advocates of ivermectin, believes that the new drug developed by Merck acts in a similar way.

Dr. Syed Mobeen, who hosts a daily medical show and often hosts Dr. Kory for discussions about COVID treatment, told me that ""it seems that molnupiravir is a copy of one of Ivermectin's mechanisms.""



""This mechanism is to disrupt the SARS-COV-2 virus' RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme,"" said Dr. Mobeen, who runs a medical education center. ""Copying this mechanism will give Merck a way to earn from an existing cheap drug's action by relabeling it; however, I believe that molnupiravir will continue to be less effective as studies show that ivermectin has more mechanisms to disrupt the SARS-COV-2 replication and spread. Hence, ivermectin will continue to be a superior choice over molnupirivir or other RdRp disrupters.""

Aside from disrupting the viral RdRp, ivermectin supporters believe the cheap drug inhibits the spike protein from binding to the ACE2 enzyme and disrupts the importin alpha and beta.

Merck has yet to explain why its new drug would be more cost effective and score better in a risk-benefit analysis than ivermectin. Just over the weekend, a Cochrane-standard (the highest level review) meta-analysis of ivermectin against COVID-19 by Bryant-Lawrie, which has been published in the American Journal of Therapeutics, concluded that the ""apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally.""

Thus, with a non-invasive, cheap, and safe drug that doesn't require one to lock down or wear a mask, we could largely solve the problem. Why would the medical establishment not take yes for an answer? As the study concludes:

Ivermectin is not a new and experimental drug with an unknown safety profile. It is a WHO ""Essential Medicine"" already used in several different indications, in colossal cumulative volumes. Corticosteroids have become an accepted standard of care in COVID-19, based on a single RCT of dexamethasone.1 If a single RCT is sufficient for the adoption of dexamethasone, then a fortiori the evidence of 2 dozen RCTs supports the adoption of ivermectin.

Now we know, in the case of Merck, there are 1.2 billion reasons why not. For some of the larger special interests, that number is exponentially higher and is all backed by the Fed's printing press and guaranteed by the media they have paid and influenced.

Horowitz: Minnesota business owner sitting in solitary confinement for violating Walz’s edict while violent criminals are released,"A remarkable thing about this spirit of government tyranny and control over our bodies is that it is coinciding with the era of the laxest enforcement of basic criminal statutes of all time. Violent crime is rampant, and the border is wide open. In this sense, what we have is not only tyranny, but anarcho-tyranny, which is now being used as a means toward fascism – picking winners and losers in society based on obedience to the national agenda. Our government is now selecting for the people and behaviors it desires, even if that means making a criminal of a victim and a victim of a criminal and contorting fundamental rights upside down.

As thousands of BLM rioters who burned down half of Minneapolis remain out of jail, and as a record number of criminals remain on the streets, a business owner is now sitting in de facto solitary confinement for 90 days for the crime of having her restaurant open during the illegal lockdowns. Despite 400 studies showing the interventions never worked to stop the spread of the virus, and even though even blue states have moved on from them, Freeborn County Judge Joseph Bueltel sentenced Lisa Hanson to 90 days in jail for keeping her now-defunct Interchange Wine and Coffee Bistro open last year.

A political show trial against the right to earn a living

According to Kevin Haskell of the National Action Task Force, a legal assistance group that helped Hanson throughout the case, Lisa is now locked in a single cell for 23 hours a day and can only come out for one hour to make phone calls and take a shower. They have essentially locked her in solitary confinement and are blaming it on COVID isolation rules. But remember, concerns of COVID in jails actually led to the release of thousands of violent career criminals. Yet an American businesswoman is not only being placed in jail because of COVID, but the concern of spread is making her suffer a more severe punishment while the same pretext is used to let criminals off the hook entirely!

In the Hanson case, the prosecutor only asked for 10 days, yet Judge Bueltel gave her 90. In 2019, out of 17,355 felony convictions in Minnesota, only 3,612 were fully sentenced in accordance with the sentencing guidelines. Yet a woman who violates an unconstitutional executive order that was made under false scientific pretense and violates human rights was sentenced to more than what the prosecutor asked for.

Haskell told TheBlaze that he was not allowed to sit at the table with Hanson, who opted to represent herself. “Judge Buetel reiterated several times that Hanson was not a lawyer and was therefore not allowed to present or interpret law or Constitution and that the judge would be the one instructing the jury as to ‘The Law.’” As such, according to Haskell’s account of the trial, Hanson was not allowed to suggest in court that “the governor’s mandates or executive orders were unconstitutional or against the law."" Worse, she was not allowed to pass out a copy of the relevant statute to the jury members.



“On day two, Hanson asked the judge if he was going to be giving photocopies of the statutes to the jury for deliberation,” claimed Haskell, “and the judge indicated the jurors were too stupid to understand and that he would be giving any instruction to the jury about what the law is so they don’t get confused as it was ‘too complex’ for them.”

Is this even America? “So Lisa was accused of breaking the law, challenged immediately its constitutionality, compelled the court to answer to the law, but not allowed to use, say, cite, quote, nor display in writing the law she was challenging in the court trying to convict her,” summed up Haskell.

Violent criminals and left-wing attacks on government are totally fine

Now we know why they have emptied the jails and prisons in Minnesota. It was to make room for business owners like Lisa Hanson. Just two days before the Hanson ruling, the state dismissed charges against Mike Forcia, the man who admitted organizing the riot to topple the Christopher Columbus statue at the state Capitol last June. As Alpha News reports, “The Ramsey County Attorney’s Office supported a dismissal, citing a Minnesota policy that favors ‘alternatives to conviction and confinement for people who have not previously been convicted of a crime.’”

Guess who was never convicted of a crime and never engaged in public vandalism either? Lisa Hanson. In her case, Judge Bueltel waxed poetic about the need to make an example of people who try to lead political movements against the government. Yet the leader of a violent mob that damaged public property, rather than Lisa who was merely utilizing her own property against the wishes of an illegal executive order, was deemed unsuited for jail. “There was context for this unlawful act that was committed out of civil disobedience that we should seek to understand and reckon with in determining the legal system’s response to this act,” prosecutors said in one court document from Forcia’s case.

Perhaps you can forgive the state for dismissing the Forcia case, because, after all, it was only property that was damaged. It’s not like he smashed property in the U.S. Capitol, only in the state Capitol. Well, Alpha New is reporting that Brayshaun Gibson, a man accused of knocking out a Minneapolis cop during a riot last August, will only serve a year of home confinement without having to go to prison. A viral video of Gibson hitting the officer with a metal trash can lid has been circulating since the time of the incident.

Police Officer Hit By Trash Can Lid During Minneapolis Unrest www.youtube.com

As part of the plea deal, charges against Gibson were dismissed for allegedly throwing large rocks at a police car in an earlier incident and for stealing from Home Depot at least 10 times. First-time “offenders” are only locked up if they are leaders of a cause not so popular with the judges of Sodom.

It’s not just violent criminals who commit crimes in the name of BLM who are let off the hook. In general, the deterrent against crime has disappeared to the point that carjackings are now rampant and spilling over into the suburbs of the Twin Cities. According to local police, carjackings are so common that they are now advising people not to exit their cars after a fender-bender. They say there has been a 300% increase in carjackings since 2019, and “there have been a total of 3879 cars taken.” Police are also warning citizens about being followed by car to their homes, where the criminals will rob them and gain access to their homes.

Wouldn’t the prosecutors and judges want to make an example of the carjackers by sentencing them above the guidelines? Well, considering that Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea just voted to commute the sentence of a woman who drowned her newborn baby, it is quite evident that no amount of violence is enough to keep someone locked up in a Minnesota prison.

It’s a new form of “Minnesota nice.” No, it doesn’t stem from a philosophical aversion to incarceration. It’s all about persecuting We the People with punitive punishment if we exercise our constitutional rights, while accommodating those who endanger the public with violent crime.

Horowitz: Most open borders POTUS has worse approval among Hispanics than whites,"It was the blood-letting ritual equivalent of electoral politics. After each election, every GOP consultant for two generations lectured in hushed tones about the need to support some form of amnesty for illegal aliens in order to attract the Hispanic vote. We are suffering from an invasion to this day because of this maniacally false read of the American electorate, which induced Republicans to refrain from shutting down illegal immigration when they were in power. Well, Biden’s presidency has laid waste to this entire narrative which Republicans stupidly adhered to forever.



Following the GOP loss of the presidential election in 2012, the RNC wrote a 100-page ""autopsy"" report attempting to reconstruct the cause of the party's loss in that year's election cycle. Among the many pearls of wisdom was an immortal warning that ""we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" which is swamp-speak for amnesty, otherwise ""our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.""

Dick Armey, the GOP House majority leader in the 1990s, was quoted in the autopsy as saying, ""You can't call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.""

Well, following that line of thinking, that open borders are the love language of Hispanic voters, Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has been telling them they are the most beautiful people of all time, begging them out to the prom. The response from Hispanic voters? Open borders can’t buy you love.

The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Biden has a dangerously negative 33% - 55% job approval rating among Americans. But that’s not the headline number we should focus on. The man who opened the doors to millions of illegal aliens from Latin America and essentially suspended ICE’s operations has garnered just 24% approval among Hispanics, lower than the 32% approval he commands among whites!

This is simply an unprecedented and astounding political transformation for any Democrat to have less support among Hispanics than among whites, especially when his approval is quite dismal among whites as well. Only 11% of Hispanics “strongly” approve of Biden, again, an astounding finding, given that we were told open borders are the key to their hearts. Even more stunning is the fact that when asked which party they would vote for in the midterm elections, slightly more Hispanics chose the Republican Party!

Even the open border GOP consultants of yesteryear only contended that supporting open borders was merely a way to minimize the losses among Hispanics. Yet with Republicans speaking out stronger than ever against illegal immigration and Democrats inviting them more than ever, these voters are practically moving over to the Republican Party.

Take Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, who has been consistently stronger on the issue than Trump. He has constantly called for blocking illegal aliens from the state and punishing those who employ them. Yet even as a Republican governor, polls have shown him above water with Hispanic voters.

One Washington Post columnist warned after Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, ""Donald Trump's 'Mexican rapists' rhetoric will keep the Republican Party out of the White House."" Well, it looks like it is open borders Biden who will keep Democrats out of the White House, particularly as it relates to the Hispanic vote.

Thus, any honest autopsy of GOP failures would note that not only is the open borders agenda a disaster for our country, the ""Hispandering"" of that agenda simply does not elicit love among Hispanic voters. Pandering never works. Voters of all backgrounds want strong leadership on the fundamental issues that affect their lives, not symbolic checkboxes that white liberals artificially draft for them.









More broadly, we see how unpopular Joe Biden and the Democrats are as they are starring down the barrel of historic losses during the midterms. As such, why can’t we actually enjoy a party that boldly and aggressively counters them on every policy?

For years, Republicans allowed themselves to be lied to about the politics of immigration. In recent years, they were convinced that being soft on crime would endear them to black voters. They have been brainwashed into abandoning the fight against licentious sexual values. They refuse to take a bold stance on COVID fascism for fear of appearing to be “anti-vax.” They refuse to fight back against the Jan. 6 political persecution because they don’t want to be labeled “insurrectionists.”

In other words, Republicans are consistently being run over by a parked car. They fear a scarecrow. Voters are clamoring for a strong alternative on every hot button issue, but it is precisely those issues Republicans avoid at all costs or which they downright cater to Democrat premises and policies.

For example, Republicans should embrace a budget battle precisely before the election with this deeply unpopular president. They should craft their own budget bill, cutting funding for all vaccines, banning mask and shot mandates (especially in the military), defunding the Jan. 6 persecutions, thwarting Biden’s restrictions on energy exploration and production, and blocking any resettling or dumping of illegal aliens into the interior of the country. Then they should refuse to supply the votes in the Senate for cloture in order to pass the Democrat budget unless some of those items are included. Now is precisely the time to pick a fight, these are the issues that matter, and this is the president with which to engage such a battle.

If they fail to fight for us now, they sure won’t do so after the election. Biden will still be president and Mitch McConnell will fear a government shutdown even more, so will eschew any brinkmanship over budgets or “must-pass” legislation. We’ll be dead by the term of the next president in 2025, and even then, we still won’t have a trifecta governance with 60 votes in the Senate.

How much longer will we allow Republicans to turn winning issues of the upmost importance into losing battles?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-most-open-borders-potus-has-worse-approval-among-hispanics-than-whites,2022-06-10
Horowitz: 4.9 million reasons we no longer need a federal government,"With the federal government not only failing to do its job but being complicit in the war on national sovereignty, why then should we suffer the internal tyranny it is imposing upon us? At this point, isn’t the federal government all pain and no gain?

Our founders never envisioned the federal government would have so many policing entities with the technology, resources, and manpower it has today. Because the police power was left to the states, Madison actually feared the states would be the more likely culprit in usurpations than the federal government, which is why he originally wanted to give Congress veto power over state legislatures. Now, we not only have the DHS, FBI, ATF, and DEA, which are larger than the standing army the founders envisioned, but even the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Labor, and Department of Education have tactical response teams.

According to a 2015 CRS report, out of the (only) 13 agencies that responded to their questionnaire, there were a total of 271 federal tactical teams across the different offices and departments. There are now 200,000 federal employees (outside the Department of Defense) with firearms along with their badges, larger than the size of the U.S. Marines.

Almost none of it is used upon enemies of the country and to protect our liberties. It is all used to monitor, record, surveil, and now apprehend political dissidents. Thus, if we have given up our freedom to such a behemoth, what have we gotten in return?

At its core, the most important job of the federal government is to protect us against external enemies. That begins at our border. There have now been a total of 4.9 million known border incursions since Biden took office, nearly the population of Ireland. These comprise roughly 3.9 million apprehensionsand close to a million gotaways (which is probably lowballing it). Our government has not only abrogated its most important responsibility to the states – protecting against invasion – but it has been complicit in the smuggling and criminal conspiracy that has brought over sex trafficking, drugs, and dangerous criminals.

Our founders didn’t fear this degree of federal government not only because it was not supposed to have all these federal police agencies, statutes, and executive authority over every aspect of our lives (including breathing without masks!), but because it was supposed to be busy working on external affairs. In one of the most important descriptions of the federalist arrangement, Madison laid out the design in Federalist #45 as follows:

The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.

The operations of the Federal Government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State Governments, in times of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the State Governments will here enjoy another advantage over the Federal Government.

So why did he not fear federal tyranny so long as his design was followed?

The more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defence, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favour their ascendency over the governments of the particular States.

Well, given that we now have record numbers of DHS and DOJ law enforcement agents with zero regard for protecting our national border, they have all the resources imaginable to focus on you and me.

Perhaps we need the federal government for the military, you might say. Really? A woke and broke military that only exists for critical race theory, transgenderism, and nation-building for every other border but our own? Again, once a federal force is no longer used for its proper purpose, it can only serve as a menace to our liberties in the long run.

So now that we have uniform weights, measures, and currency, why exactly do we need a federal government to abrogate its core defense responsibilities just to prevent the states from securing the border? All other activities were supposed to be done by the states. Founder Tench Coxe, a Pennsylvania delegate to the Continental Congress, listed in a 1788 essay the following as off-limits to the federal government:

They cannot interfere with the opening of rivers and canals; the making or regulation of roads, except post roads; building bridges; erecting ferries; establishment of state seminaries of learning; libraries; literary, religious, trading or manufacturing societies; erecting or regulating the police of cities, towns or boroughs; creating new state offices; building light houses, public wharves, county gaols, markets, or other public buildings; making sale of state lands, and other state property; receiving or appropriating the incomes of state buildings and property; executing the state laws; altering the criminal law; nor can they do any other matter or thing appertaining to the internal affairs of any state, whether legislative, executive or judicial, civil or ecclesiastical.

Rather than just railing against the FBI and making this all about Trump, conservatives must compel a broader discussion in red-state legislatures and among the governors about how we return to this original design. They need to cut off the spigot of federal funding for all of the aforementioned functions, along with its accompanying officious litany of regulations, and with it, the police power to capriciously enforce nebulous (or even phantom) laws against political opponents.

Contrary to Mike Pence’s sentiments, dismantling these agencies is not akin to abolishing the police. Our founders envisioned state and local police and a national military – not dozens of national police forces larger than a military. Police power is the bluntest instrument of government, and it needs the scrutiny of local politics inherent in elections for sheriff, mayor, and county legislative and executive positions. When Madison warned during the Constitutional Convention, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty,” he certainly never envisioned this degree of an executive branch with this number of paramilitary organizations.

The purpose of forming a federal union was to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” for things that states were inherently incapable of doing. Yet what we have today is a government that engages in the antithesis of justice by fanning and fomenting true violence and framing its opponents, gutting our military, empowering the cartels to control our border, and creating monopolies for transhumanist World Economic Forum types at the expense of the general welfare and liberties of the people.



Rather than protecting the ideals spelled out in the preamble of the Constitution, the federal government abrogates every one of them and prevents others from upholding them. Nowhere is this more evident than at the border. If you simply abolished the federal government, then the states could have a fighting chance to secure the border. Yet now, Fox’s Bill Melugin is reporting that while the Texas Guardsmen close the gates to illegal aliens, Border Patrol comes and opens them!

Which leads us back to the original question: At this juncture in time, if our desideratum as a civilization is justice, tranquility, the common defense, general welfare, and securing the blessings of liberty, why even have a federal government? I can sure think of a lot of revolting activities of the federal government we can live without. Now, can you think of one we must live with?

Horowitz: North Dakota legislators introduce bill to block Biden’s illegal executive edicts,"""All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the protection, security and benefit of the people, and they have a right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require."" ~Sec. 2, North Dakota Declaration of Rights

A group of North Dakota legislators have taken up the call for states to reassert control over the Constitution, as the Biden regime continues to rule by executive fiat, often promulgating unconstitutional orders infringing upon civil rights. This is the key to thwarting a wholesale slide into national despotism and ensuring that there are some places for Americans to go and enjoy the blessings of liberty. The question is whether leaders in those legislative chambers as well as Gov. Doug Burgum will pick up the mantle, not to mention Republicans in other states.

Recently, Rep. Tom Kading and eight other Republicans in the North Dakota House introduced HB 1164, which would task the attorney general with reviewing the constitutionality of the president's executive orders. If any of his orders are deemed to be unlawful, this bill would prohibit any state or county agency or publicly funded organization from enforcing the edict.

The list of issues covered under the bill are:

Pandemics or other health emergencies. The regulation of natural resources, including coal and oil. The regulation of the agriculture industry. The use of land. The regulation of the financial sector as it relates to environmental, social, or governance standards. The regulation of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

Thus, an easy first candidate for such legislation is Biden's recent mask mandate, which unconstitutionally prohibits humans breathing without cloths on their mouths and noses inside any public transportation, including in-state ride-shares and taxis. The CDC created an entire criminal offense for something that never passed Congress.

What if Congress decides to pass a bill that is unconstitutional? HB 1282, introduced by Rep. Sebastian Ertelt, would take this a step farther by proposing a ""Committee on Neutralization of Federal Laws"" to recommend whether a given law or regulation is unconstitutional. Upon the recommendation of this committee, consisting of state legislative leadership and their appointees, the legislature would pass a concurrent resolution on whether to nullify the law or edict. Until the resolution is passed, state and county agencies would be prohibited from enforcing the law or regulation at issue.

These bills should serve as a model for all 31 GOP-controlled legislatures, especially in the 23 states where there are also Republican governors. I hear so many conservatives acting despondent and either resigned to tyranny or calling for secession or even a civil war. But the solution implied in these bills would keep the union loosely intact while peacefully maintaining a constitutional sanctuary for those who still value constitutional freedoms. This is the best way to peacefully and gradually separate blue and red America into their respective cultural, economic, and governing choices so we can live together more agreeably as a federal union.

North Dakota Republicans control the Senate 40-7 and the House 80-14. If this were a Democrat state passing a sanctuary bill for illegal aliens, the bill would pass in a day. Given that the rights of American citizens are on the line, Senate leaders Randy Burckhard and Rich Wardner should bring this bill to the Senate floor, and Speaker Kim Koppelman should bring the bill to the House floor immediately. North Dakota has an opportunity to lead the nation in liberty, if only all the Republicans in the state would govern the way they campaign.

Madison predicted in Federalist #46 that a federal encroachment would easily be mitigated by state action, because ""the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand."" What is the winning formula?

The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.

In other words, public outrage, state and local officials refusing to enforce it, and correspondence with counterparts in other states together in unison would prevail over federal tyranny.

South Dakota already has a similar bill to HB 1164 targeting Biden's executive lawmaking. Rep. Aaron Aylward of Harrisburg, South Dakota, introduced HB 1194, which would set up an executive board to review the constitutionality of executive orders pertaining to the six issues laid out in the North Dakota legislation. With a 32-3 majority in the Senate and a 62-8 majority in the House, South Dakota Republicans have the strongest majorities since the Eisenhower era. The Dakotas, as well as many other parts of the country, can easily become constitutional sanctuaries.

Additionally, county commissions, prosecutors, and sheriffs should also seek to criminalize enforcement of unconstitutional edicts at the county level.



Let's be very clear: The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution subordinates states to follow only laws that are pursuant to the Constitution on issues that were given over to the federal government to determine. However, if the federal government blatantly violates the Constitution, especially in a way that harms individual liberty, even Alexander Hamilton, the great supporter of a powerful national government, said that states should ignore it. ""It will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land,"" wrote Hamilton in Federalist #33. ""These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.""

Well, if it was good enough for Hamilton, it should be good enough for states with strong Republican majorities in the legislature.

There is no doubt that Biden's presidency will take a bite out of our economy, especially with his cancelation of the international pipeline going through North Dakota. But if tyranny itself takes root and grows within the boundaries of these solid red states, then we as conservatives have nobody to blame but ourselves and our own complacency.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-north-dakota-legislators-introduce-bill-to-block-bidens-illegal-executive-edicts,2021-02-03
Horowitz: Our border crisis leaves states with only one choice,"At what point does our federal government lose all legitimacy by inducing an invasion against the state? At its core, the social contract established in our Constitution created a federal government to, among other things, protect us from external threats that states were incapable of contending with. Yet with over 1 million illegal aliens streaming across our border just in the past six months, along with a shocking number of criminals and horrifying amount of drugs, our federal government has forfeited all legitimate rights to govern.

When we thought the border couldn’t get any worse, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced that it apprehended an unfathomable 221,303 illegal aliens in March, the most in modern times. This was the 14th consecutive month with more than 100,000 apprehensions, a never-ending invasion we’ve never experienced before. Just in the first half of fiscal year 2022, there have been over 1 million apprehensions (excluding several hundred thousand gotaways), and over 2.7 million since Biden took office. That is the size of the city of Philadelphia.

The overwhelming majority of those caught are single adults, roughly half of them from Mexico. However, whereas in previous years the northern triangle countries in Central America composed the remainder of the flow, there are now record numbers of people from Cuba, Colombia, and Nicaragua, as well as from majority Muslim countries. This means that even after we empty out the traditional illegal alien-sending countries of those who desire to cross, we will continue to open up new fronts. There is no limit to how many people would come if we allow them, and the Biden administration is hell-bent on testing that limit.

Although some of the trespassers are still being turned back under Title 42 for the time being, ICE is preparing to release 600,000 by September. Deane Dougherty, ICE’s juvenile coordinator, wrote in a court filing that he expects a “historic border surge, with projections forecasted to triple current arrivals” and expects to release 3,000 a day into our communities “for a population of up to 600,000 by the end of the fiscal year.” According to the Washington Times, the document revealed that about half of those caught in March were expelled under Title 42, but CBP released more than 65,000 people on its own just last month. The agency is planning to up that number to 100,000 per month.

It is unfathomable how many criminals, public charges, and gang members are being brought in every day, not to mention the drugs. ICE already had 3.6 million people on its non-detained docket as of last September, including more than 400,000 convicted criminals and at least 600,000 fugitives who are defying deportation orders. Again, those are just the known criminals and those with outstanding deportation orders. Since then, we’ve imported hundreds of thousands more who were caught and released or were surreptitiously smuggled into the country as a result of the agents being tied up with processing.

In other words, our government has become the first in history to telegraph to the world that it will enable anyone from anywhere to come and invade and it will help resettle them into our communities. This is no longer just about the issue of illegal immigration, but a full-scale invasion that assaults our culture, economy, jobs, communities, security, and safety.

Can you imagine the amount of drugs that are pouring over the border?

According to the CDC, there were 107,000 drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending November 2021, and the numbers are growing every month. Not only do these illegal aliens bring over drugs, but they empower the cartels by delivering them billions in revenue from human smuggling fees. Also, they often serve as drug smugglers and distributers on the interior of the country in order to pay off their debt to the cartel.

According to the DEA, the distributors for the cartels in our major cities are either cartel associates themselves or Mexican transnational gangs such as MS-13, Nine Trey Gangsters, Mexican Mafia, Norteños, Sureños, and Latin Kings, or, in the Northeast, the Dominican gangs. These networks, according to the DEA, are “overseen by Mexican nationals or U.S. citizens of Mexican origin.” They “enter the United States legally and illegally and often seek to conceal themselves within densely populated Mexican-American communities.”

It’s true that at lower levels, Americans also work for the cartels, but most of the primary trafficking is done by criminal alien networks, which could be disrupted if we enforced our immigration laws. In 2019, the Louisville Courier-Journal published a long piece on how the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación has created a network of illegal alien farm workers to penetrate America’s rural and small towns with drugs. “In cases in which immigrants resist the cartel's offer, CJNG members often threatened violence — to them or their loved ones back in Mexico, according to court cases and law enforcement officials,” wrote Beth Warren in the well-researched expose.

A classic example of this dynamic was reported last week in Sterling Heights, Michigan, when two illegal aliens were pulled over in a traffic stop and police discovered they were peddling 20,000 fentanyl pills and 500 grams of powered fentanyl on behalf of a Mexican cartel. That is enough fentanyl to kill tens of thousands of people. And what is particularly scary is that these are counterfeit oxycontin pills, so people who purchase them believe they are getting a prescription opioid, not a bioweapon.

We locked down Americans because of the prospect of a pandemic from a virus, yet our government invites record numbers of drug traffickers at a time when we are losing millions of life-years from teenagers and young adults due to drug poisoning.

Then there are terrorism concerns. In response to an inquiry from Rep. Chip Roy, CBP released information on 42 individuals on the terror watch list who have been caught at the border since Jan. 2021. Given how much money they pay the cartels to cross over undetected, you have to believe that the number of suspected terrorists we don’t apprehend is exponentially higher.

Thankfully, the 26 GOP governors finally got together to form a “Border Strike Force” to collaborate efforts and share information and intelligence on border and cartel related issues. In a memorandum released this week, the objectives announced were as follows:



Target cartel finances that fund criminal activity in the border regions to seize the tools used to assist the cartels.

Monitor cybersecurity issues that may increase vulnerability along the Southern Border, such as criminal networks that operate on social media to recruit traffickers.

Review state criminal statutes regarding human trafficking, drug trafficking, and transnational criminal organizations to ensure the laws deter, disrupt, and dismantle criminal activity.

Review state criminal justice statistics and information to determine crimes that can be traced to the Southern Border.

Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps or identified inconsistencies in existing plans to address border crime.

This is a good first step and would have been a terrific idea several years ago, but ultimately this has gotten so bad that nothing short of state deportation agreements will stem the tide of this invasion.

For over a generation, Republicans have badly misgauged the public mood on this issue. For years, we were told Hispanic voters want open borders and that Republicans would have to adopt a pro-amnesty message to attract those voters. Well, Biden is the most rabidly pro-open-borders president in history, yet he has approval of just 26% of Hispanic voters, while a staggering 41% “strongly disapprove” of him, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll.

Horowitz: Politicians indicating that flu season is the new threshold for emergency powers & panic,"The notion that we would lock down our society until a vaccine is introduced to counter a virus with a 0.3% infection fatality rate and near-zero risk for non-immunocompromised individuals was shockingly insane. Then we were told that even after a vaccine is in place, the social control will not end because the vaccine will not fully work against COVID-19 for all people. Now, we are beginning to see that because indeed COVID-19 is not that much different from a pandemic flu, the flu itself will now constitute the new threshold for social control and panic in perpetuity. In other words, the totalitarianism that we blissfully accepted in March is here to stay forever, unless we reclaim our sovereignty.

The Arizona paper was reporting on a press conference held by liberal Republican Governor Doug Ducey and Arizona health department director Dr. Cara Christ, when they warned about ""a perfect storm"" of lingering COVID-19 mixing with the flu season in the coming months. They warned about mask-wearing and shutting down businesses that don't participate in their unproven social control rituals. They also revealed that indeed hospitals get overwhelmed to a degree during the flu season and now that fact, which we always lived with every year, will be used to control our lives.

Folks, we have come full-circle. When this all began in early March, we were warned by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 was the worst epidemic in generations, with an infection fatality rate of 3.4% and a hospitalization rate exponentially higher that was going to swamp all of our big-city hospitals. As such, there was no way to compare it to the flu. Anyone who did was treated almost like a Holocaust denier.

Now, those same control freaks are comparing COVID to the flu! See, if they were right about the threat level of this virus, the contrast between it and the flu would be black and white. Talking about the perfect storm between COVID-19 and the flu would be tantamount to tethering the health care concerns of cancer to those of a cold. But now the truth comes out that this virus really is not that much different from a pandemic flu and that hospitals are always crowded at the peak of even a seasonal flu, much less a pandemic flu.

In July, Justin Hart, founder of RationalGround.com, which promotes a rational approach to the virus, posted on Twitter a series of articles describing emergency measures in various ERs throughout the nation during the 2018 pandemic flu. Yet the media coverage at the time wasn't incessant, it never became political, and the politicians never gave any thought to shutting down our lives. We lived with it, and few people ever heard of the 2018 pandemic flu.

That is all about to change. Now the flu is the new threshold for perpetual mask-wearing, draconian regulations on businesses and houses of worship, and government mandates of every facet of our lives.

Those who said the fatality rate of COVID-19 was much lower than the WHO claimed were right all along. This week, Icelandic researchers came out with a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine pegging the fatality rate at 0.3%. Lest you think that this might be the result of luck in Iceland, an analysis of COVID-19 in Indiana published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Wednesday estimates the IFR in that state at 0.26%, right around what Stanford epidemiologist and leading lockdown skeptic John Ioannidis predicted long ago.

But even that number is extremely lopsided and almost exclusively weighted toward people with several known immunocompromising conditions. According to the CDC, 94% of those who have died from the virus had at least one serious underlying condition. For healthy people, especially those under 65, the fatality rate is really no greater than the flu.

Hence, the politicians have gone from ""Don't you dare compare this to the flu"" to ""We should be doing this for the flu as well."" In other words, there's a reason why politicians and the media warn about a ""new normal."" It's not because COVID-19 will necessarily be with us forever; it's because the tyranny of the government response had nothing to do with COVID-19. That was simply the perfect pretext because so much was unknown about it earlier this year. Now that everyone is conditioned to go along with the suspension of democracy for ""public health,"" it's not even a political leap to use the flu as the next excuse.

Consider how low the threshold is to continue the current quasi-martial law policies and invasion of personal privacy and bodily integrity. One university after another is discovering hundreds of ""cases"" of COVID with zero hospitalizations. This happens every flu season, and the students usually get sicker with more disruptive symptoms than they have now, when most of them only know they are ""sick"" because of mandatory testing. Yet this is the new threshold to turn colleges into prisons.

As my friend Kyle Lamb observes, according to the Kessel-Cohen-Milgroom study that PCR tests have a median false positive rate of 2.3%, in places like New York where the entire positive rate is under 2.3%, that could mean the number of real cases may be close to zero – or at least low enough that nobody would notice without this testing regime and dashboard obsession.

As far back as October 2019, according to the CDC, at least 1% of emergency room visitors exhibited COVID-like symptoms (CLI), even before the virus was known in the U.S. A certain number of people always come in with fever, coughing, sore throats, and trouble breathing all year round every year, and most certainly during the late fall and winter. Those numbers existed before the discovery of this particular virus and will continue to persist forever.

At present, we are at the point in this COVID ""epidemic"" where the flu season, which is driven more by symptoms and not testing, more definitely disrupts people's daily schedules with illness. As Lamb notes, ""By this logic, the virus would never go away and emergency powers will be indefinite.""

And indeed, that is exactly the point. That is their plan … if we let them get away with it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-politicians-indicating-flu-season-threshold-emergency-powers,2020-09-04
Horowitz: Red-state governors must make ivermectin available over the counter,"Every tool of COVID control has failed. The vaccines were pushed because the lockdowns and masks failed. Now the CDC is threatening to bring back the masks even for vaccinated people because the virus continues to spread despite roughly 80% of seniors being fully vaccinated and 90% having had at least one dose. Why would a government so obsessed with COVID fail to try the one thing it never pursued: known, effective, and cheap early treatments? Well, red-state governments don't have to wait for Fauci and the CDC to follow the science. They should make ivermectin available over the counter in their respective states and overhaul their inpatient and outpatient guidance.

No matter what one feels about the vaccines on the market, it has become quite clear that they offer little resistance against the spread of the new strain of the virus. It's also clear that there are still vaccinated and unvaccinated people who can get seriously ill from this virus, particularly those who are immunocompromised — even as we continue to debate the exact numbers. Further, it is clear that natural infection provides much broader and longer-lasting immunity.

Perforce, if everyone is bound to get this virus anyway in some mutated form, why not make sure that everyone has in their medicine cabinet the least invasive and most effective safe outpatient treatment we have so far to combat this virus? For most people, it takes a number of days — and even weeks — for the virus to turn serious. There is ample warning for anyone who tests positive, particularly those vulnerable to complications, to be treated immediately with ivermectin to prevent the dangerous pulmonary inflammatory response.

Yet outside of a handful of people who actually follow the science, the public is in the dark about the great results of this extremely safe drug. It is simply unacceptable to tell a 70-year-old man with diabetes (who got vaccinated too) that if he gets the virus to just wait until he can't breathe before receiving any treatment, then offer him nothing but a $3,000 dose of the ineffective remdesivir.

Here's the bottom line: According to the European Medicines Agency, which has a much better vaccine surveillance database than our CDC, there were over 12,000 suspected deaths and 1.2 million adverse reactions, half of them serious, just through May 22. Yes, there were hundreds of millions of doses dispensed, but that is still a much higher numerator than we ever tolerate, and we still have no data on long-term effects. Typically, such a product would have been pulled from use and most certainly not forced upon people. On the other hand, ivermectin has been dispensed nearly 4 billion times over 40 years and has a better track record than Tylenol, with just 426 adverse events. The vaccines are not only made available, they are essentially mandated for many people to live a functioning life. Why then is ivermectin not made available to everyone in the world?

Almost all the few rare side effects reported from ivermectin were minor and transient, and it has very few known interactions with other drugs. Just consider the fact that according to Pfizer's own trial data, even putting aside the serious reactions, most of the kids incurred mild reactions that are much rarer with ivermectin. Within a few days after the second injections, 66% of the 12- to 15-year-olds developed fatigue, 65% developed headaches, and 42% developed chills.

The state of play with COVID in the country now is that the South is experiencing the same wave it got last summer (known as the ""Hope-Simpson curve""), although because of built-up immunity and likely attenuation of the virus, the deaths will be lower than last year. The media is going to pound away at the southern states for having lower vaccination rates as the culprit, all the while dishonestly ignoring the fact that the South was COVID-free for months during late winter and early spring when it was still percolating through the Northeast and upper Midwest states that had much higher vaccination rates, not to mention impervious mask mandates and capacity restrictions (as of April/May).

The moral of the story is that ""the virus is gonna virus"" until everyone is exposed to it. Yet Republican governors in those states will continue to play defense and follow the left's failed playbook just like they did with mask mandates. As such, they are lashing out at their people for not getting the vaccine, never mind the fact that senior vaccination rates are high even in those states.



The current Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, lambasted his constituents for not vaccinating at a high enough rate. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the leading contender to replace him next year, wrote an op-ed urging everyone to get the ""Trump vaccine."" She asserted categorically that ""the benefits of getting vaccinated extend beyond protection from covid,"" a statement that is categorically false for younger people and still unknown even for older people based on the waning efficacy and the still unknown long-term side effects.

She also stated, ""I believe the Trump vaccine will help keep our state open for business and our economy growing."" That implies that vaccines are the only way to keep the state open. Aside from tacitly acceding to the left's outrageous point that lockdowns are legitimate under any circumstance, she is creating a false dichotomy. There is another option. As she warns about hospitals filling up, she misses the point that almost all these people can be treated immediately, outpatient, without filling up the hospitals. And unlike other treatments that have been used throughout the pandemic, such as Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin is even better because it is so cheap and non-invasive.

Republican-controlled legislatures, particularly in those states experiencing the Hope-Simpson curve, need to immediately convene and make drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine available over the counter. We sell Tylenol over the counter despite so many people committing suicide by overdosing on it. There are an estimated 78,000 emergency department visits every year because of overdoses of acetaminophen-containing products, leading to as many as 980 deaths in a year. Thus, ivermectin is likely safer.

If they are not bold enough to do this, they should at least have their respective departments of health recommend it for treatment and change the protocol of inpatient treatment to more effective things than the failed remdesivir. It is simply unacceptable that 17 months into this pandemic, we have turned over every rock in search for a solution — at a painful cost — yet have refused to make cheap and effective early treatments available to the public. Rather than just promoting vaccines that increasingly wane in efficacy and place needless risk on too many people, President Trump should encourage the red states to use ivermectin and adopt an alternative treatment protocol.



Where I live in Baltimore, there are open-air drug markets all over the streets and people know they can access and even sell this poison with impunity. This is true in almost every major city these days. Yet someone afraid of complications from COVID-19 cannot access a single treatment that has proven effective against this virus unless they have a rare, brave, and broad-thinking doctor on their side.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-red-state-governors-must-make-ivermectin-available-over-the-counter,2021-07-27
Horowitz: Republicans embracing refugee resettlement completely misunderstand 9/11 and Afghanistan,"Invade the world, invite the world.

As I've been reflecting on our odious response to COVID-19, it's hard to ignore the parallels with our counterproductive response to 9/11. The core solution to the virus was always to pursue early and even pre-emptive treatment of the actual virus. Instead, we destroyed ourselves with endless voodoo control measures that flattened our society and economy, not the curve of the virus. Pondering our Afghanistan policy, it appears that our policy from day one was essentially doing everything to make the Islamic threat worse while wasting time overseas on endeavors that not only failed to stop the threat but actually brought it closer to home.

At present, by my count, GOP governors from states including Iowa, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Georgia, South Carolina, Maryland, Utah, and Massachusetts are requesting the resettlement of thousands of unvetted Afghans in their states. Many of these same GOP politicians are hand-wringing about leaving Afghanistan and feigning concern over terrorism — all while missing the simple point that Afghans can only hurt us here if we bring them here!

Afghanistan never did and never will have an army or air force that is capable of attacking our homeland. To concern ourselves with Afghanistan in light of the threat from China is ludicrous. 9/11 was not about a military threat that required a military invasion. It was all rooted in the problems with our immigration and visa system. Rather than locking that bad system down, our government went overseas to referee a 1,000-year civil war, then proceeded to admit thousands of people from both sides of the civil war — coming full-circle on the impetus for the 9/11 attacks.

On Sept. 11, 2001, a ragtag terrorist organization attacked us through our immigration system, killing nearly 3,000 Americans. We simply let in people we should not have admitted and allowed them to work with networks in this country of other people who should not have been let in. We responded by making the problem worse and increasing migration from those countries without any system to vet incoming immigrants.

We have clearly not learned our lesson, or we are just willing to allow the false gods of mass migration to overshadow safety concerns. We have issued roughly 2.2 million green cards to nationals of predominantly Muslim countries from 2001 through the first quarter of 2018, a level we've never seen in our nation's history. We've brought in more just in a five-year period than the entire Muslim population of Belgium, which has become saturated with radical Islamic elements.

Consider the immigration policies of the past 20 years in light of what the 9/11 Commission staff report on terrorist travel wrote in 2004:

It is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country. Yet prior to September 11, while there were efforts to enhance border security, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a tool in the counterterrorism arsenal. Indeed, even after 19 hijackers demonstrated the relative ease of obtaining a U.S. visa and gaining admission into the United States, border security still is not considered a cornerstone of national security policy.

Here is a list of people we've brought in just on immigrant visas from predominantly Islamic countries. Notice nearly 100,000 Afghans were brought in since 2001:

Not only did we send our best warriors into a meat grinder with no defined mission or logical outcome, we had them fight for a compromised force, making them subject to endless ""green on blue"" attacks. In the ultimate paradox, we invested so much in building up the Afghan military that we brought thousands of unvetted Afghans to our shores every year under the guise of helping a war effort that in itself placed our troops in danger from unvetted coalition ""partners.""



Several hundred Afghan military trainees have gone AWOL in our country over the years. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) observed that the ""limited vetting of Afghan trainees, and the restrictions of the investigatory and asylum processes, may pose a security risk to the United States when trainees go AWOL."" We've spent about $81 billion on the Afghan security forces, as part of a nearly $1 trillion price tag for the two-decade war.

Yes, you can always count on the Democrats to wait 20 years and then pull out in the worst way imaginable, not even bothering to plan an orderly pullback and ensure that weapons are removed or destroyed before the retreat. But this should not be used as an excuse to rectify the situation with mass migration.

Some are suggesting that we owe it to these people to resettle them in the United States. This is the most absurd line of argument imaginable. It's only because of the war that we are bringing foreign nationals to our shores in record numbers. The same unvetted Afghans who were leading our soldiers into ambushes for years are being brought here in the thousands every year. The number of special immigration visas from Afghanistan has increased over time, and they are not subject to the refugee cap. We've brought ""here"" roughly 65,000 individuals who helped us fight ""there.""

Those Republicans joining Democrats in demanding that we bring in tens of thousands of unvetted Afghans, as if the American people owe them more blood, treasure, and sacrifice, are violating the social compact of governance. These swamp congressmen and governors must understand the admonition of the 9/11 Commission staff report: that 9/11 was all about visas and immigration because ""terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country."" Now, in addition to nearly 2,500 dead and tens of thousands of wounded soldiers fighting ""over there,"" we have nothing to show for the war other than 100,000 largely unvetted new Afghan migrants.

Have we learned nothing from Europe? In 2014-2015, Europe suffered a massive migration crisis from places like Afghanistan and north Africa with the rise of the Islamic State. It set off a torrent of Islamic terror attacks on the continent, and the problem has still not abated. Europol's latest European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2021 (TESAT) documents that perpetrators of five completed terrorist mainland attacks during 2020 had ""entered the EU as asylum seekers or irregular migrants.""

To this day, we have not even ended the foreign military training programs on our U.S. military bases, even for those from countries with a strong jihadist presence. Even after Saudi Royal Air Force pilot Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, one of an estimated 850 Saudi military personnel training on our bases, shot dead three Americans at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, we continued the program. If we couldn't even vet official military trainees from the Middle East, are we really supposed to trust every Tom, Dick, and Harry Afghan who claims to have ""helped"" our military help his own country?

One would think Republicans would universally reject the proposition of following in Europe's footsteps. Then again, these are some of the same Republicans who have refused to reject COVID fascism and have instead rejected the one way to treat this virus while opting for painful and counterproductive measures – just like our response to 9/11.



It's time for red-state legislatures to convene and bar all refugee resettlement in the United States. We have already accepted hundreds of thousands of people from our own hemisphere thanks to the Biden administration's invitation at the southern border. As for the Middle East, our own taxpayers have already paid enough for what goes on there with our blood and treasure. We need not come full-circle again and pay for it on our own shores with the one policy that will ensure that what inevitably will happen in Afghanistan will indeed migrate to our shores.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-republicans-embracing-refugee-resettlement-completely-misunderstand-9-11-and-afghanistan,2021-08-20
"Horowitz: After SCOTUS ruling, states on their own in combatting border invasion","There’s a monthly invasion of hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, deadly drugs, gang members, and unknowns crossing our border, and it has now become clear that nothing at the federal level will stop it. It’s now or never for the state governments. Waiting for a Republican president two and a half years from now is not the solution. Rather than waiting helplessly until 2025 for someone like a potential President Ron DeSantis to solve the problem, all the GOP governors should follow his example as governor in deterring illegal immigration.

Believe it or not, the president can’t just thwart our sovereignty laws and invite people in to remain in the country indefinitely pending an immigration court hearing. Yet Justice Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the liberals in upholding the Biden administration’s decision to abolish Trump’s policy of making illegal aliens return to Mexico while petitioning for entry into the country.

Biden v. Texas, which involved the state of Texas suing the DHS for flooding the state with illegals, was not just about continuing the policies of a predecessor. Obviously, a president doesn’t have to maintain the executive orders of the prior president – unless your name is Trump and you are actually enforcing immigration law, in which case the same Supreme Court on numerous occasions made him continue Obama’s amnesty programs. This case, however, is about the plain meaning of the law.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U. S. C. §1225(b)(2)(A)) states plainly that if anyone is caught coming over our border “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,” the individual “shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.” And no, just because the entire world claims bogus asylum, it doesn’t mean they get to remain indefinitely pending the adjudication of their claims. The same statute (§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)) makes it clear that the asylum petitioner “shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.”

The court majority attempts to get around this by ignoring the main statute and focusing on §1225(b)(2)(C), which deals with returning aliens to their country of origin and states that the DHS “may” return them. As such, the court ruled that clearly Biden doesn’t have to return aliens to Mexico because that Trump-era policy was optional. But there’s one problem: The same law states that the DHS “shall” either not allow them to enter or must detain them. One way of fulfilling that dictate is to return them to Mexico. If Biden doesn’t want to do that, he is welcome to detain them. “But it’s not feasible to detain millions of people,” he will suggest. Exactly! So, then he has no other choice but to return them in order to keep within the letter and spirit of the law, which reflects a core sovereignty interest of the states and the people. Yet he’s released so many that even the detention space we have is empty in some facilities.

Moreover, the fact that there are exponentially more aliens than detention space is prima facie proof that this is not about asylum at all, but a carte blanche invasion. So, the Supreme Court used one word of one statute in isolation to render the entire letter, spirit, and goal of the INA obsolete.

Justice Alito, in his dissent, offered the perfect analogy for what would happen if a private citizen read the law the way the Biden administration is abusing the INA:

Here is one more example. A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle “shall” be inspected every year. The law also says that motorists “may” have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage. A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off. This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he “may” use such a facility. Would the motorist escape a citation?

Well, the same principle should apply here. How can the federal government get away with violating the core social compact it has with the states and the people? One of the core tenets of just government we celebrate this week by commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence is that all government power must flow from the “consent of the governed.” This implies jurisdictional and political sovereignty in the sense that no outside forces not controlled by the members of that society may determine the destiny of the society. Millions of foreign nationals cannot unilaterally assert jurisdiction, drain our resources, obtain citizenship against our will for their children, and then be counted in the census and distort our representation.

All signs point to states taking the lead in the face of the federal betrayal of this contract. Florida Governor DeSantis has taken the lead by, among other ideas, convening a grand jury to investigate who in Florida is involved in the smuggling operations that have brought millions of illegal aliens, along with so much criminal activity, into the country. The Florida Supreme Court recently agreed to impanel a statewide grand jury to investigate the scope of the problem, which could eventually lead to prosecutions of those involved.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, who has worked on interior immigration enforcement for over three decades, believes that this example, if followed in other states, could deter the flow of trafficking or at least divert them to blue states.

“This criminal infrastructure includes the coyotes, who bring the illegal migrants over under the protection of the cartels, but also a vast and well-organized network of stash houses, transportation carriers, identity fraud rings, illegal labor contractors, money launderers, and even charities who assist the migrants along the way,” explained Vaughan. “What is happening is not a benign, humanitarian process; it is a dangerous, exploitative system that undermines our sovereignty, not to mention imposes enormous economic and fiscal costs on American communities. This grand jury will be able to expose just how ugly this system is, and it will be in a position to disrupt what is happening, potentially through criminal prosecutions.”

Vaughan notes that obviously Florida can’t single-handedly stop illegal immigration, but it will likely deter smugglers from using Florida to operate. “If the smuggling organizations and their associates are successfully disrupted in Florida, they will decide to work elsewhere. We should all pay attention to how this plays out. Over time this could potentially set a new standard for state action to deflect the impact of federal policies’ failures.”

Then, of course, there are the border states. Arizona and Texas must simply begin removing illegal aliens themselves. Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe should serve as an example for the state officials in those border states. He caught four illegal aliens in a busy smuggling corridor in the Del Rio Sector, but border agents refused to take custody of them. So he drove them an hour away to the international bridge at Eagle Pass in his own sheriff’s van. “So, I can’t let them walk the streets. I can’t say, ‘Hey, go, be free.’ Because I still have to protect the Constitution and protect the people in the county.”



Now it’s time for Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey to follow his lead.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-scotus-immigration-states,2022-07-05
Horowitz: State sovereignty acts: The single most important post-election agenda item for conservatives,"“When Ottawa announces policies and laws that attack our economy or violate the rights of our people or when Ottawa seeks to take control of our sovereign areas of provincial jurisdiction, our UCP (United Conservative Party) government will not enforce those laws & policies in this province, period."" Those were the words of newly elected Alberta Premier Danielle Smith in announcing the Alberta Sovereignty Act.



If the Alberta premier could be this bold in a country where the people are much more compliant with tyranny, where she is the only conservative leader, and where provinces are less sovereign than American states, how much more it is incumbent upon us to pressure Republican governors and legislatures to erect “get off our lawn” signs in Joe Biden’s face.

Last week, I posted a comprehensive analysis of the scope of power Republicans hold in state government and how they are likely to dramatically expand it. Between trifecta control and supermajorities in legislatures, they could conceivably hold the power to pass legislation unchallenged by Democrats in at least 30 states. As such, when national Republican leaders lament the limits of their power to check the Biden administration in Washington for lack of full control of government, we must remind them it doesn’t absolve the party of its duty to enforce the Constitution in the states Republicans control.

What does that look like? Governors and legislators need to announce that when the federal government seeks to violate the Constitution, statutes, the rights of the people, or the social compact itself by openly engaging in destruction of our food, energy, and natural resources, those policies will be blocked in the states.

Practically, what does that mean?

The first bill all GOP-controlled legislatures should pass when most of them convene in January is a law allowing them via concurrent resolution to declare a federal policy, regulation, or statute unconstitutional. That would automatically, pursuant to this law, have the effect of criminalizing the enforcement of that policy within the state’s boundaries by any state or local official or state-funded NGO. It would also call upon the state law enforcement agencies to work directly with the governor to, with all practicable means, block any attempts of federal officials to enforce those edicts.

On specific issues, this means:

All federal policies regarding transgenderism cannot be enforced.

All federal policies concerning medical mandates, surveillance, or public health policies deemed harmful or unconstitutional are prohibited.

All federal policies locking up state fuel, food, or natural resources are suspended.

All FBI raids on residents of the state that are prima facie political persecutions when no allegation of violence is brought are illegal and will be thwarted by all means possible.

All cooperation with federal law enforcement on surveillance, information sharing, or apprehension of political opponents is suspended.

On issues pertaining to federal violations of the social compact, where no reasonable person can assert that the federal government is trying to govern in accordance with the general welfare, states must also step up to the plate. For example, if the feds are locking up lands from pipelines, natural gas terminals and storage facilities, and drilling and refining oil, states must work together to create a parallel economy for energy. That is the only way to fight the climate fascism, which is quite literally threating to turn us into transhumans eating bugs and sewage water and living in containers. As Danielle Smith wrote, “On major policy issues, our government will be discussing a pushback strategy to address issues such as the federal oil and gas emissions cap, fertilizer reductions, and the firearms confiscation program. The Alberta Sovereignty Act is a critical part of that strategy.”

Then there is the issue of illegal immigration. While it naturally is a federal issue, what is a state to do when the federal government violates the nation’s sovereignty laws and floods the states with cartels, drugs, and criminal aliens? The Constitution is not a suicide pact. As Justice Scalia observed in Arizona v. United States (2012), ""The naturalization power was given to Congress not to abrogate States' power to exclude those they did not want, but to vindicate it.""

As such, states have a fiduciary responsibility to their residents to protect them from the safety and economic concerns of illegal immigration. They should form a compact and institute a state-based “return to Mexico” policy. At a minimum, they must cut off all employment and benefits so that the cartels will only be incentivized to send illegal immigrants to the blue states.

The first American Revolution had its roots in the colonial legislatures, which worked together to form the Continental Congress and interpose against the British monarch. Once again, we are confronted with a centralized government that has become destructive to the moorings of human freedom. The state governments are well placed to deter, thwart, and overcome this federal tyranny.



So the next time you hear your state or federal Republican official say we must wait until after the 2024 presidential election to restore life, liberty, and property, remind them that if they can’t properly govern with the power they already wield, the presidential election is meaningless.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-state-sovereignty-acts-the-single-most-important-post-election-agenda-item-for-conservatives,2022-10-31
Horowitz: States should block caravan invaders if Biden regime refuses to do its job,"What if our own federal government openly encourages caravans to flood the border states and saddles them with violent drug cartels, crime, social ills, hospitalizations, and the public cost of mass migration from across the border? Are the states completely at the mercy of the federal government's refusal to defend the sovereignty of the whole union and that of the individual states, particularly those like Arizona and Texas at the border?

This is essentially the question Justice Antonin Scalia asked Obama's solicitor general during oral arguments in Arizona v. U.S., when the Obama administration began illegally granting amnesty to illegal aliens and preventing Arizona from enforcing the laws on the books. ""What does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?"" Scalia asked, referring to Arizona's right as an individual state to defend its own borders. ""The Constitution recognizes that there is such a thing as State borders and the States can police their borders, even to the point of inspecting incoming shipments to exclude diseased material,"" said Scalia during litigation between the Obama administration and the state of Arizona.



This discussion is even more relevant today, as the Biden regime has de facto invited caravans to come for amnesty by suspending Trump's asylum reforms and has now asked ICE to release some of the worst criminal aliens imaginable.

The Constitution is clear as to the responsibilities of the federal government and why we have one in the first place. The federal government exists not to impose more mask mandates and lockdowns on the people, but to protect their rights and security where states are inherently less capable of doing so effectively — namely, in repelling an invasion. Ironically, it is the one act of war a president can pursue without the consent of Congress, yet the invasion at our border is the only one we refuse to address. So where does that leave the states?

Scalia answered this question in his partial dissent in the 2012 Arizona case:

But there has come to pass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and the States that support it predicted: A Federal Government that does not want to enforce the immigration laws as written, and leaves the States' borders unprotected against immigrants whom those laws would exclude. So the issue is a stark one. Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws?



Scalia rhetorically asked:

Now, imagine a provision—perhaps inserted right after Art. I, §8, cl. 4, the Naturalization Clause—which included among the enumerated powers of Congress ""To establish Limitations upon Immigration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced only to the extent the President deems appropriate."" The delegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to the exits.



He ended his dissent discussing Obama's amnesty and Arizona's response to it:

As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that are the proper object of our attention suppresses the very human realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears the brunt of the country's illegal immigration problem. Its citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy. Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so. Thousands of Arizona's estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants—including not just children but men and women under 30—are now assured immunity from enforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Arizona citizens for employment.



Scalia concluded, ""If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State.""

The Constitution is not a suicide pact for the states, as Americans are treated like criminals and criminal aliens are treated like pristine citizens. If courts were able to rule in favor of states abrogating and criminalizing the enforcement of immigration law under Trump, it's for states to enforce them while Biden is seeking to unilaterally nullify them.

As Scalia observed in the Arizona case, ""The naturalization power was given to Con­gress not to abrogate States' power to exclude those they did not want, but to vindicate it.""

What Scalia meant is that states can't be more liberal than the federal government on immigration because that would violate the national sovereignty and the choice of the union of states to deny entry. This is exactly why our Founders assigned control over immigration policy to the federal government. They didn't want states to artificially inflate their representation by flooding the entire federal union with undesirable aliens. Commenting on the power of Congress (as opposed to states) over immigration, Justice Joseph Story explained, ""If aliens might be admitted indiscriminately to enjoy all the rights of citizens at the will of a single state, the Union might itself be endangered by an influx of foreigners, hostile to its institutions, ignorant of its powers, and incapable of a due estimate of its privileges.""

While this was written in 1833, every word is speaking to liberals today in states like California that want to increase their representation at the expense of other states. Let's not forget that once an alien is admitted to the union by one state, he is free to move around anywhere in the country. Thanks to California's sanctuary policies, Americans all over the country must suffer.

Roger Sherman, among the greatest of all the Founders, noted during the House debate on the Naturalization Act of 1790 that ""it was intended by the Convention, who framed the Constitution, that Congress should have the power of naturalization, in order to prevent particular States receiving citizens, and forcing them upon others who would not have received them in any other manner"" (emphasis added). Sherman was emphatic that federal control was designed to ""guard against an improper mode of naturalization"" and prevent individual states from flooding the country with immigrants based on ""easier terms.""

James Madison, in a 1782 letter to Edmund Randolph, noted that a uniform rule of naturalization from a future federal government would cure the existing problem under the Confederation of ""the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other States."" Writing in Federalist #42, Madison elaborated that the federalized power over naturalization solved ""a very serious embarrassment"" and ""defect"" of the Articles of Confederation, whereby ""certain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious"" can force themselves on several states had they ""acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State.""

Thus, both the Constitution and the inherent right to sovereignty rooted in social compact theory dictates that federal control over immigration should primarily be in one direction: more restrictive than states would want, not less restrictive. Now, obviously, once the feds were given final say over immigration, the letter of the law dictates that states cannot prevent immigrants from settling within their borders where statute otherwise authorizes it. However, as Scalia noted, a state ""has the sovereign power to protect its borders more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal prohibition,"" and in this case, ""Arizona is entitled to have 'its own immigration policy'—including a more rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not conflict with federal law.""

To that end, patriots would be wise to pressure every red state to institute a mandatory E-Verify law like the one Florida just implemented. These states must clamp down on tax fraud and identity theft and refuse to accept unaccompanied alien minors being resettled in their states.

In addition, the border states, which have their sovereignty literally violated by the caravans, smugglers, and cartels, have the right to deploy their own National Guard units to push back any invasion. Are Texas and Arizona at the mercy of Biden's criminal disregard for the violent hordes of predominantly young males attempting to crash their borders like we saw in Guatemala last week?



Article I, § 10, cl. 3 (the Compact Clause) states:

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.



The Constitution is clear that, all things equal, states shouldn't engage in warfare with other countries. But all things are not equal in this case, and the Constitution made an exception for those times when states are invaded and in imminent danger.

Joseph Story in his commentary on the Compact Clause writes that while the prohibition on states making war is obviously necessary, it was ""wisely guarded by exceptions sufficient for the safety of the states, and not justly open to the objection of being dangerous to the Union.""

Still, a state may be so situated, that it may become indispensable to possess military forces, to resist an expected invasion, or insurrection. The danger may be too imminent for delay; and under such circumstances, a state will have a right to raise troops for its own safety, even without the consent of Congress.



Haven't the border states (the ones that still care) waited long enough, with too much delay?

Some might suggest that caravans coming north are obviously not part of a declared war. But if you look at the original language of Article IV's guarantee clause protecting states from invasion, Madison originally drafted its language to be read as protecting against ""foreign violence."" It's clear that this was not necessarily referring to formal warfare with a nation-state, but repelling violent incursions from Indian tribes. If a state can't protect against foreign violence, then what can a state do?

This past year, we have learned that states are evidently so powerful they can call an emergency and suspend our lives, liberty, and property under the guise of protecting hospitals. Perforce, those same states should be able to declare an emergency of illegal immigration (especially as they come over to use our hospitals ) and do the job the federal government refuses to do.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-states-should-block-caravan-invaders-if-biden-regime-refuses-to-do-its-job,2021-01-26
Horowitz: Tennessee lawmakers introduce bill to prevent businesses from discriminating against customers without masks,"In our society, businesses are sued for not looking at customers the right way or for not taking expensive actions to accommodate the needs of employees and customers through OSHA, ADA regulations, and anti-discrimination laws. Since when did it become OK, then, for businesses to force customers and employees to take very definite actions against their bodily integrity, such as wearing face masks, no matter their personal conditions? A group of conservatives are pushing a bill in the Tennessee legislature to address this problem, and it just might become a model for other states.

Tennessee is one of 12 states that currently does not criminalize breathing without a Chinese face burka, but the damage done by the local and federal mandates has made businesses feel as if they need to enforce it to cover their backs. Despite no statewide mask mandate and overall fewer restrictions than other states, RINO Gov. Bill Lee he has still declared going to church in person dangerous and tried to dictate to Tennesseans how many people with whom they could gather. He has also enabled and empowered localized health board tyranny instead of individual liberty, and even put out a video promoting face masks. Thus, like in every other state, Tennessee businesses are enforcing this mask tyranny on the citizenry.

A group of Tennessee lawmakers have introduced the Medical Non-Discrimination Business and Consumer Act (SB 0320/ HB 0794) to ensure that businesses are not enforcing what government is clearly incapable of doing. It is also designed to place anti-discrimination and disability laws vis-à-vis mask-wearing in line with every other practice of business regulation that prevents even private businesses from wholesale discrimination, invasion of medical privacy, and violation of the ADA.

Specifically, this bill would prohibit a person from denying an individual the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation, resort, or amusement on the grounds of the wearing or use of a medical device, or whether the individual has received medical treatment, such as a vaccine.

On a practical level, this bill would prevent grocery stores, restaurants, movie theaters, and gyms from requiring masks or proof of vaccination in order to receive services. This is in line with current anti-discrimination law as it relates to every other facet of society. Just a year ago businesses would have been shut down for the rampant and cruel discrimination they are engaging in today.

Pursuant to the ADA (36.201), no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services, without retaliation or coercion (36.206) covering any condition whether a physical or mental impairment (36.302.1) wherein mere presence does not constitute direct threat, even if contagious or noncontagious with transmissible diseases (36.302.b.2, 36.208).

Universal masking within businesses is unattainable because it does not address the chaos variable of the many who have an ADA right to reasonable accommodation to receive full access to goods and services, and you do not get to know what is wrong with them. Exemptions include PSTD from trauma, rape, and bound torture, autism, cancer, COPD, asthma, lung disease, pregnancy, and exposure/illness. Yet masking is the one thing that can violate anti-discrimination and disability laws, despite the fact that masks are worthless in combatting a respiratory virus.

Thus, this bill would merely place mask policies in line with every other ADA and anti-discrimination regulation we enforce on businesses today. It takes away the liability that businesses would potentially incur for allowing people to come in without a mask. It further prohibits local governments within the state of Tennessee from enforcing such mandates, a step Gov. Lee has failed to take until now.

The Senate bill is sponsored by Sen. Joey Hensley, and the House bill is sponsored by Rep. Susan Lynn. The bill is being promoted statewide by Tennessee Stands, a grassroots organization promoting a more rational approach to the virus.



Are you sick of the left regulating businesses into oblivion, then suddenly empowering them to enforce the ultimate form of discrimination when it comes to their sacred masks? If a mom-and-pop bakery must bake a cake for a gay wedding when the couple can find one hundred other businesses willing to service their event, then certainly businesses can't shut off all vital goods and services to a human being for merely breathing, especially when there is no evidence they even have the virus. Moreover, if ""businesses can do whatever they want,"" then businesses can open without capacity restrictions or other lockdown policies. It's time to apply anti-discrimination law and business regulations as a two-way street.

Let's be clear, unless this legislation is passed in all the 31 states with GOP-controlled legislatures, the mask cult will never end. It's time to even up the score and push back against government tyranny with equal and opposing force. The Medical Non-Discrimination Business and Consumer Act is that opposing force we've been waiting for.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-tennessee-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-prevent-businesses-from-discriminating-against-customers-without-masks,2021-02-15
Horowitz: Texas school district warns of danger from illegal alien car chases over the border,"Rural America is generally safer from crime, but not if you are unfortunate enough to live in a rural county near the Mexican border. As the politicians and the media focus the attention of the border crisis on the needs of the illegal aliens held in detention, they never focus on the terrible effects mass illegal immigration foists upon Americans living near the border.

Cotulla is a small town about 60 miles north of the international border at Laredo, Texas. Yet it is so affected by the invasion over our border that the school district sent out a letter to parents and administrators warning them to protect the children from the endless car chases and bailouts of criminal aliens in the region.

""Please be watchful of your children as they are playing outside, walking home from school, or generally out of the house,"" warns Cotulla Independent School District Superintendent Jack Seals and La Salle Sheriff Anthony Zertuche in a joint notice to the community. ""Both our communities and the rural areas of the county have experienced a great increase in law enforcement chases and 'bailouts.'""

The sheriff goes on to warn the citizens about 8-10 car chases and bailouts a day and encourages the locals to lock their cars and not keep valuables outside.

This cuts to the core dereliction of the federal government, which in many ways undermines its entire legitimacy. The purpose of the federal government is to keep us safe from foreign threats. These communities, which would otherwise have minimal internal crime, are now faced with high-speed car chases, rampant theft, and menacing criminal aliens and drug carriers attacking their ranches.

It was recently announced that the border numbers for March were higher than any level in 15 years, with over 170,000 apprehensions. Many of those people are ultimately released and sent out on buses, but tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of others have never been apprehended, but are able to get into the country while Border Patrol is busy caring for illegal aliens rather than protecting the ranchers and border citizens from them. Those are the people we should really be concerned about.

Border Patrol has already apprehended three times the typical number of sex offenders, and given the amount of money they pay the cartels to cross clandestinely, it's likely that many more successfully evade capture. In other words, the world's criminal enterprises are all converging on our border and trespassing on the private property of our fellow Americans.



One rancher, Cyndie, who owns a lot of property south of La Pryor in Maverick County, Texas, posted on a private Facebook page that her husband was assaulted by a group of illegal aliens when he found them hiding out in their lodge. When they called Border Patrol, they were told they didn't have the resources to come out, a complaint I've heard from many ranchers. Eventually, the sheriff's deputies caught them, but were forced to release them immediately.

Cyndie told me yesterday that when she got home from work, she found sheriff's SUVs parked across from her mailbox and two Border Patrol vehicles in the ditch on the ranch. When she went to check it out, she heard a helicopter hovering. ""Then he [the helicopter pilot] ducked down and went towards the bush, and he's trying to flush out a big group that was on the property, so I ran to the house for safety and my husband joined their search,"" she told me. ""It's so sad that we have to live this way.""



On Monday, Deputy Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz stated that ""way over 100,000 people"" have gotten away from Border Patrol this week. Who do you think those people are? Girl Scouts? Our ranchers are the first victims of their invasion, but they don't necessarily stay at the border. They come to all 50 states, and we have no idea who they are. Earlier this week, CBP announced the capture of two Yemeni nationals on the FBI's terror watch list at the California border earlier this year.

Again, how many terrorists, sex offenders, and previously deported criminals have not been caught? With Border Patrol now expecting 184,000 unaccompanied minors this year, how many hundreds of thousands of criminals will they enable to cross our border while tying down our agents with ""humanitarian"" missions? How much money will pile up in the coffers of the cartels to further facilitate their human smuggling and drug operations? And how will such a mass flow of criminal activity affect the border counties?

As one rancher, Jessica, wrote on a private Facebook page of border citizens about current life as far as 100 miles from the border:

Friends who do not live near our Southern border, I invite you to read this then close your eyes imagine this is your life.



It's 7:30pm on a Monday, your husband is outside working, your oldest is outside playing with baby kittens, your middle baby is in the shower and your littlest baby is outside enjoying playing in the dirt (supervised) while you wash dishes. You get a call from a concerned friend there has been another bail out, only this time, a 1/2 mile from your house and less than a 1/4 from your parents. You normally receive an emergency alert from the local sheriff's department but not this time. You aren't given much information. Number of criminals - unknown. All you know is there is an unidentified number of illegals running from local law enforcement somewhere in your area. For a moment you think F this. We aren't stopping what we are doing. We have protection and this is starting to interfere with our daily lives. Then you remember, our border patrol agents are being shot, children are being left to die, vehicles are being stolen and left with only the kind of evidence you see on CSI and for most there is no punishment. You find a gun, grab your spouse, bring everyone inside and lock the doors. You watch and listen carefully. You can't help but look at your children and wonder why United States of America has a President that couldn't care less about its citizens.



This THIS is what it is like living 107 miles from the Mexican border. This is not a story fabricated by President Trump or Republicans. This crisis doesn't care about your skin color or who you voted for, only your location. How fortunate some of you are to look at this situation and pretend it's make believe.

Should the protection of American ranchers against these people take priority over the care of the hundreds of thousands trying to surrender to agents to freeload in our system? Where is their vaccine passport to cross the border as Americans are now facing the prospect of needing one to function within their own cities?

The bottom line is that our government and its law enforcement resources were created for the benefit of our people. It's time to use them for that cause.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-texas-school-district-warns-of-danger-from-illegal-alien-car-chases-over-the-border,2021-04-08
Horowitz: Texas should secure its own border. Here’s how.,"""Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws?""

That was the question Justice Antonin Scalia posed in his partial concurrence in Arizona v. U.S. in 2012, when there were 357,000 apprehensions at our southern border. With four months left in this fiscal year, there have already been 900,000 apprehensions, with the numbers from the past three months nearly tying the all-time record.

But the situation at the border is even worse than those numbers suggest. The number of gotaways, which are usually the worst criminals, is higher than ever. Also, this comes at a time when Border Patrol and border infrastructure are much larger and more robust than they were during the greatest previous waves of illegal immigration 20 years ago, which makes the lack of deterrent behind those numbers all the more remarkable.

The reason why things are worse than ever despite more agents on the ground is because our Border Patrol is now being used to actively work with the cartel smugglers. Todd Bensman of the Center for Immigration Studies reports that CBP has prohibited agents from catching the smuggler who steers the rafts across the Rio Grande River.

""So established is this non-belligerence arrangement that cops and smugglers often banter with one another across the water or at the Texas shore about the weather, or how long the boats might be running tonight,"" reports Bensman. ""Scenes play out where Border Patrol agents simply watch from five or six feet away as smugglers stand on the Texas riverbank or in shallow Rio Grande waters helping their illegal-alien customers out of boats.""

From his conversations with high-ranking officials at the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Bensman, who worked at the Texas DPS for 10 years, reports that CBP is warning Texas officials that they should also refrain from nabbing the smugglers as well.

Taken together, this strategy ensures that all the assets of Border Patrol are actually being harnessed to facilitate a more efficient invasion, which is why the numbers are sky high.



Which brings us back to the original question posed by Scalia in 2012: Are states really at the mercy of DHS' criminal behavior in not only leaving the border wide open but downright facilitating human smuggling into the states?

In 2006, then-Sen. Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act. It required the secretary of homeland security to ""take all actions"" necessary within 18 months of passage to ""achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States"" (emphasis added). Section 2(b) of the bill defined ""operational control"" as ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

What has ever come of this requirement? Why should a state be constrained by ""federal powers,"" if they are suffering from the results of the feds violating those very federal powers?

Article I, § 10, cl. 3 (the Compact Clause) states:

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.

The Constitution is clear that, all things equal, states shouldn't engage in warfare with other countries. But all things are not equal in this case, and the Constitution made an exception for those times when states are invaded and in imminent danger.

John Marshall, during the Virginia Ratifying Convention, made it clear that this section affirms that the power given to the states by the people to repel an invasion ""is not taken away"" by the federal war powers. ""When invaded, they [can] engage in war, as also when in imminent danger,"" asserted the future chief justice during the debate over the Compact Clause on Monday, June 16, 1788. ""This clearly proves that the states can use the militia when they find it necessary.""

Joseph Story in his commentary on the Compact Clause writes that while the prohibition on states making war is obviously necessary, it was ""wisely guarded by exceptions sufficient for the safety of the states, and not justly open to the objection of being dangerous to the Union.""

Still, a state may be so situated, that it may become indispensable to possess military forces, to resist an expected invasion, or insurrection. The danger may be too imminent for delay; and under such circumstances, a state will have a right to raise troops for its own safety, even without the consent of Congress.

Haven't the border states (the ones that still care) waited long enough, with too much delay, to act unilaterally?

Some might suggest that caravans and groups of illegal aliens coming north are obviously not part of a declared war. But if you look at the original language of Article IV's guarantee clause protecting states from invasion, Madison originally drafted its language to be read as protecting against ""foreign violence."" It's clear that this was not necessarily referring to formal warfare with a nation-state, but repelling violent incursions from Indian tribes. If a state can't protect against foreign violence, then what can a state do?

Remember, in addition to telling CBP to stand down at the border, the Biden administration is handcuffing ICE from removing even the most violent foreign criminals. Does that mean a state is forced to allow illegal alien rapists to remain within its borders with no recourse? There has been a 900% increase in apprehension of criminal aliens just in the Laredo Sector alone. Is Texas without any right to stop the untold numbers who are likely getting away and cutting through the ranches of its citizens?

As always, the Lone Star State needs to go it alone and lead the way. Governor Greg Abbott should call a special session to bolster the resources and legal authority of state and local law enforcement to deter and punish illegal aliens. The following issues should be addressed:

A surge in funding for an entire division of the Texas DPS to focus solely on deterring illegal immigration.

A surge in resources to build or repurpose jail space to hold illegal aliens who are charged on state crimes.

Severe mandatory minimum sentences for human smuggling, criminal trespassing, child endangerment, and other existing state crimes that can be used to hit those coming over the border. Also, make them ineligible for bail because they are, by definition, the ultimate flight risk.

Pass Rep. Bryan Slaton's bill to have Texas build the border wall. This can be done with a public crowdsourcing campaign as well.

In addition, it's time to make illegal immigration a state crime. Many federal crimes are doubled up as state crimes, and there's no reason why illegal immigration should be any different. With a new Supreme Court, it's time to challenge some of the premises behind the erroneous legal theory of the 2012 Arizona v. U.S. decision.

Throughout the Trump tenure, blue states successfully thwarted the enforcement of immigration law with sanctuary policies. Why then shouldn't red states be able to enforce the laws the feds refuse to abide by? The Constitution was designed for the federal government to protect the states from invasion. At some point, that principle can no longer be contorted to such an extent that it becomes a suicide pact,s whereby states are bound by the federal government's own malfeasance.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-texas-should-secure-its-own-border-heres-how,2021-06-10
Horowitz: The Biden administration is making illegal aliens a superior class over citizens,"The preamble of the Constitution establishes the purpose of the government: to provide for the common defense and secure the blessings of liberty. Today, we have a government that subverts the common defense of the people, for whom they also abrogate the blessings of liberty. Americans are treated like criminals for exercising basic civil rights during the new COVID regime, while illegal aliens who invaded our border are being invited back at taxpayer expense!

The citizens are not only disenfranchised and stripped of sovereignty, security, and public safety; they are forced to subsidize it as well. On Tuesday, the AP reported that the Biden administration will allow thousands of illegal aliens who were subject to the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy under the Trump administration, called the Migration Protection Protocols, to return and reapply for asylum if they had their cases dismissed or denied for failing to appear in court. Who do you think will pay for a second round of judicial proceedings for people who should never have had a first round? It sure won't be the smuggling cartels.

Thus, the 175,000 illegal aliens coming in on their own every month as a result of ending these policies were not enough for the Biden administration. The administration is now re-inviting as many as 10,000 more, according to an estimate by Michele Klein Solomon of the International Organization for Migration. You can bet your bottom dollar these individuals will not be required to be vaccinated like so many Americans are in order to obtain services or employment in so many areas of life.

The 10,000 estimate is likely low, because according to data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, 27,842 aliens were denied for failing to appear in court and 6,686 had their cases dismissed. In total, about 70,000 illegal aliens were returned to Mexico while MPP was in place since 2019. It's hard to imagine that any effort to reopen those cases will not involve spending taxpayer funding to pay for the invasion, as well as possibly permitting more of them to remain in the country undetained and giving birth to more citizen babies.

And yes, this is an invasion. There's no possible way that people in the Biden administration can believe this is about asylum, because these policies are focused on inviting even criminals. As the Center for Immigration Studies reports, Biden's DHS has scrubbed ICE's most wanted criminals from its website. This webpage once included six individuals who are wanted for vehicular homicide and remain at large. Why would officials possibly want to protect people like this if their immigration agenda were all about asylum?

What's worse is that earlier this month, ICE announced it was ending the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office (VOICE) program, which was created by the Trump administration to provide aid to victims of illegal alien crimes. Officials are replacing this program with the Victim Engagement and Services Line, a service designed to help illegal aliens who claim to be victims of crime. They have flipped the positions of citizen and alien.

Additionally, the DHS has announced it will be issuing more worker visas to those who apply for U visas as victims of crime. The problem is that so many of these people are criminals themselves. I cannot tell you how many illegal alien sex offender cases I've researched in which I was told by ICE officials that they could not give me information on them because they had a pending U visa application. Many gang members can easily claim they fear reprisal from other gang members and as such are eligible for a U visa, even as they pose a threat to Americans.

Sadly, we need a program for American victims of criminal aliens more than ever. Martin County, Florida, Sheriff William Snyder recently said that ""close to 50 percent"" of the criminal aliens in his agency's custody are having their ICE detainers dropped. Last month, an 82-year-old woman in his county was raped by an illegal alien with prior arrests and sex crimes but was not deported by the feds.

Thus, we didn't even need the data point of border apprehensions increasing by 1,000% in the Del Rio Sector to recognize that the border surge was not a natural phenomenon of asylum-seekers. This is an orchestrated displacement of Americans with a new population that is considered more useful in achieving the ""Great Reset"" agenda.

The reason it's so obvious this is an orchestrated tyrannical agenda is because, historically, when you have a loose border and rampant domestic crime, as we do today, it means there is limited control by the government, more reflective of an anarchist regime. However, these pro-criminal and pro-open-border policies are coinciding with the greatest power play ever perpetrated against the citizens.



Larvita McFarquhar, the restaurant owner being attacked by the Minnesota attorney general, had her business license revoked earlier this week simply for having remained open. And no, there is no president willing to offer these people a second chance like they do for illegal aliens. Two citizens were arrested for showing up at a school board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, because it was declared an ""unlawful assembly."" Using dangerous cartels to crash our border, on the other hand, is now considered the ultimate act of love by our government.

And need we mention what the government has done to anyone within earshot of the Capitol on January 6? Meanwhile, almost all of those most responsible for the rioting last year have either had their charges dropped or pleaded down to the most mundane charges.

Hence, our government knows how to run a tight ship when it so desires. It's just that it replaced the Constitution and the rule of law with the rule of the chosen. You and I simply didn't make the cut.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-biden-administration-is-making-illegal-aliens-a-superior-class-over-citizens,2021-06-24
Horowitz: The country that ‘succeeded’ against COVID with masks has the highest case rate in the world,"Those who believe in the freedom of bodily autonomy are celebrating a slew of recent court rulings enjoining the Biden administration’s injection mandate. However, no GOP state attorney general has bothered to fight the equally immoral, illogical, and inhumane mask mandates that are still in place. Despite nearly two years of evidence that strict mask-wearing has zero effectiveness in stopping the spread, the mandates on 2-year-olds on planes and in many schools still continue. Slovakia is a perfect case study of the mask mendacity.

On May 13, 2020, the Atlantic published an article lauding Slovakia for, at the time, having the lowest per-capita COVID death rate in Europe. The article’s prediction should now be the laughingstock of the world:

When this pandemic ends, and when the reckoning over how the world responded invariably begins, Slovakia will likely be among those highlighted as a success story, whereas the United States—which was supposed to be the country best prepared for such a crisis—will be remembered as among those that suffered the worst. How Slovakia was able to flatten its curve comes down to more than just quick decision making and the widespread adoption of face masks. Perhaps the greatest lesson to be learned from Slovakia is of the value of leading from the front.

Slovakia was so worried about masks that the country even got Taiwan to donate hundreds of thousands of these useless cloths as part of a bilateral trade agreement.

Well, that was before Slovakia’s first winter wave. One can excuse people for mistaking low spread at the time for mask efficacy rather than the fact that the country just didn’t get its turn yet. But for countries to continue this inhumane mandate despite what we now know demonstrates that masks are not a means to public health but an end in themselves of tyranny.

At over 2,000 new cases per million per day, according to Our World in Data, Slovakia now has more cases per capita than any country in the world. To put this in perspective, that is almost three times the level of the winter peak in the U.S., a country that has not exactly performed well in the pandemic!

It’s true that some individual states closer to the size of Slovakia have had more severe waves. However, even the worst counties in the upper Midwest are tracking about 1,200 new cases per million per day.

And here is the epidemiological curve presented by the inimitable Ian Miller, juxtaposed to policy solutions:

It’s not just Slovakia. Wherever you turn in Europe, both masks and vaccine mandates have failed miserably, and the spread is now worse than ever. Belgium is now six weeks into the new mask mandate, and it has more cases than ever before, even though the Belgians already suffered one of the deadliest waves in all of Europe. Oh, and 87.4% of adults are vaccinated.

To begin with, the CDC, as late as May 2020, was citing the 10 randomized controlled trials that showed “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.” The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford also summarized six international studies that “showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.”

The only randomized controlled trial studying mask efficacy against COVID published last year was the now famous Danish study that failed to show any meaningful reduction in spread from mask-wearing. Then, several months ago, the media trumpeted a large study done in Bangladesh that seemed to show efficacy. Well, now that the authors have released the actual data, we see that indeed no such claim can be made from the study. It turns out that out of over 340,000 individuals over a span of eight weeks, there were only 20 fewer cases of COVID detected in the mask group over the control group – 1,106 symptomatic individuals confirmed seropositive in the control group and 1,086 such individuals in the treatment group.

Even these results are hard to interpret because of numerous confounding factors. University of California Berkeley professor Ben Recht critiqued the study as follows:

This study was not blinded, as it’s impossible to blind a study on masks. The intervention was highly complex and included a mask promotion campaign and education about other mitigation measures including social distancing. Moreover, individuals were only added to the study if they consented to allow the researchers to visit and survey their households. There was a large differential between the control and treatment groups here, with 95% consenting in the treatment group but only 92% consenting in control. This differential alone could wash away the difference in observed cases. Finally, symptomatic seropositivity is a crude measure of covid as the individuals could have been infected before the trial began.



Given the numerous caveats and confounders, the study still only found a tiny effect size. My takeaway is that a complex intervention including an educational program, free masks, encouraged mask wearing, and surveillance in a poor country with low population immunity and no vaccination showed at best modest reduction in infection.

In other words, you can now add this to a list of 400 studies compiled by the Brownstone Institute that fail to find any correlation between public policy interventions and better pandemic outcomes.

It’s not OK for Republican-controlled states to continue to ignore the facts that masks are inhumane and they simply don’t work. Consider the fact that Head Start has now mandated masks on 2-year-olds, many of whom have special needs. Oregon has moved to make its mask mandate permanent. Why are no red state governments at least suing against the federal mandates, and why are so few red states even banning mask mandates within the states?



The courts are all political. They only responded to the lawsuits against the vaccine mandate when they saw robust political opposition within the political branches of the red states. They see no such opposition regarding the mask mandates. Thus, absent a unified effort from state attorneys general, they are unlikely to respond to a handful of individual lawsuits. The same legal rationale denying the feds the power to force vaccines also denies them the power to cover our breathing holes. But the courts only respond to political momentum.

If nearly two years of masking failing to work anywhere is still not enough to end the most invasive human mandate of all time, then we truly are no longer a free people.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-country-that-succeeded-against-covid-with-masks-has-the-highest-case-rate-in-the-world,2021-12-07
Horowitz: The federal government has forfeited all power over immigration enforcement,"This year the Biden administration has orchestrated the most widespread invasion of illegal aliens at our border on record. At the same time, the number of arrests and deportations in the interior have plummeted to the lowest level in recent memory. As such, the federal government is the entity that has seceded from the compact established in 1789. States should respond in kind by doing what it takes to rid themselves of other countries' criminals at any and all costs.

According to a new ICE report, in fiscal year 2021, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made about 72,000 administrative arrests, down from an average of 140,000 from 2017 through 2019. What this means in plain English is that our own government has left tens of thousands of violent criminals from other countries on our streets, declining to do its most foundational job of protecting us from foreign threats.

It's not like the arrest and removal numbers were low because of a lack of illegal fish in the pond. This year, nearly two million illegal aliens were apprehended at our borders, over 1.7 million of whom were caught at the southwest border, which is the most on record. Our federal government has essentially dissolved the sovereignty of the entire union by forfeiting its power over the one unifying national policy that was designed to keep all 50 states safe from an invasion.

It's truly hard to overstate the reduction in the number of illegal alien criminals in this country committing completely avoidable crimes if our federal government merely did its job. As of last year – before the biggest influx of all time – there were 3.26 million aliens on ICE's undetained docket. These are individuals who have been targeted by ICE for removal, which most likely means the overwhelming majority have criminal records in addition to immigration violations. That means over 3 million criminal aliens who were dangerous enough to be on ICE's radar remain in the country indefinitely without being deported. That number has obviously swelled under the Biden administration, with its de facto moratorium on interior enforcement as border enforcement against the new flow collapsed entirely.

As of 2018, there were more than 1 million illegal aliens who have already received final deportation orders, with another 1.5 million having already received deportation orders but in the process of seeking an appeal. The case of an illegal alien allegedly raping an impaired woman on a Philadelphia commuter train as onlookers did nothing to stop the person is perhaps a grisly but apt metaphor for what has become of our union. States have done nothing to pick up the slack from the lack of federal enforcement of our national sovereignty, claiming their hands are tied when the feds refuse to remove convicted sex offenders, as this Philadelphia alleged rapist was not deported despite such a conviction. Are states at the mercy of the federal government's abandonment of our most foundational laws and tenets of the social compact?

Just this past Saturday, a 5-year-old girl in Polk County was killed by an alleged drunk driver who was in this country illegally from Guatemala. Drunk driving is a pervasive problem among illegal aliens and takes the lives of countless Americans every year. Yet none of them would die if we merely enforced our laws against illegal aliens. How bad does it have to get before the states take up the slack?

If red states truly cut off all the magnets, ensuring that illegal aliens could not obtain benefits and get jobs within the states, they would move on to the blue states and leave the red states alone. Red states must be willing to form a compact and agree to enforce the laws together and ignore illegal and illogical federal court rulings forcing red states to offer benefits to illegal aliens while they greenlight blue states violating federal immigration law every day. They must publish information quantifying the costs and crimes incurred by illegal immigration and provide citizens with a cause of action in state court against local officials who cause harm through sanctuary policies.



Our founders promised the citizens of this country a Constitution that would ""insure domestic Tranquility"" and ""provide for the common defense"" as a means to ""secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."" What we are seeing today is a government that secures the curse of tyranny domestically, while failing to protect us from foreign threats. If the federal government is going to abrogate the entire purpose of its existence, states should pick up where they left off before that preamble was written.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-federal-government-has-forfeited-all-power-over-immigration-enforcement,2021-10-27
Horowitz: The government’s mass migration from disease-ridden countries during a pandemic is quite revealing,"What do you call a government that will mask an asymptomatic 2-year-old American but bring in people without measles and polio vaccines from the most disease-ridden countries in middle of a pandemic?

You have to give Australia credit. At least it is consistent about its totalitarian approach to the pandemic. While Australian officials repress their own people, they most certainly don't allow foreigners into their country either. America, on the other hand, has now commandeered the bodily integrity of its own citizens under the guise of combatting a pandemic with a vaccine that doesn't even work. At the same time, our officials are inviting the greatest global migration from countries that have some of the lowest vaccination rates for diseases we have basically eradicated and for which the vaccines actually work.

The beauty of the American left is how deftly and seamlessly they are able to turn on and off a public policy faucet when it suits them. When it comes to bulldozing fundamental rights of Americans, there is quite literally no tool our government won't use under the guise of public health. Yet when it comes to inviting hundreds of thousands of people from Afghanistan and close to 2 million at our border this year from third world countries, even older viral threats suddenly don't exist any more.

While the American media and politicians, including the Senate GOP leader, compare not getting the risky, ineffective COVID shots to not getting the polio vaccine, both parties have agreed to bring in hundreds of thousands of unvetted Afghanis. Among many problems is that their country is saturated with diseases. The CDC says that ""individuals from Afghanistan are being resettled across the U.S. Afghanistan ranks 7th in the world for measles cases with a current outbreak,"" and yes, "" one of only two countries with both wild and vaccine-derived poliovirus in circulation "" (emphasis added).

Now there are measles outbreaks in Northern Virginia and Wisconsin's Fort McCoy, two places that have received large numbers of the Afghan refugees. We flattened our economy, society, and liberty in a failed attempt to alleviate the burden on the hospitals, yet now we have elected fill Northern Virginia hospitals with Afghans during our own pandemic.

Here are the latest details from the Epoch Times:

Other than measles, tuberculosis, and malaria, the CDC said that there are concerns about evacuees having an increased likelihood of ""shigellosis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, hepatitis A, rotavirus, and viral diarrheal diseases.""



The CDC, according to the release, is ""also aware of some cases of varicella, mumps, tuberculosis, malaria, leishmaniasis, hepatitis A, and COVID-19 among evacuees. Although COVID incidence in this population has been notably low, COVID immunization and testing is being provided for all evacuees.""

The CDC claims it is vaccinating and quarantining the Afghans, but why are we bringing them in the first place when, according to DHS Secretary Mayorkas, 84% of them are not special immigrant visa holders or lawful permanent residents? In addition, Biden plans to bring in 125,000 other refugees this year — not including those from the border or from Afghanistan.

This is the relatively controlled, though unvetted, flow of refugees. What about the hundreds of thousands crashing our border? As Fox News reports, the government has contracted with private airlines to fly tens of thousands of illegal aliens into the interior of this country. ""So basically all we're doing is we're catching them at the border, shipping them into the interior, releasing them and getting more and then releasing them and then getting more and releasing them,"" warned former ICE Buffalo Field Office Director Tom Feeley.

Do you really think all of these are up on their shots and are properly quarantined? In fact, White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the illegal alien exemption from international testing and quarantine regulations by suggesting that these border-hoppers are ""not intending to stay here for a lengthy period of time.""

Yeah, right! They came from around the world for a week's vacation! And since when did international travelers get exempted from COVID restrictions when they are not staying here for a lengthy period of time?

So, what explains the gross dichotomy between the treatment of Americans and foreigners with regard to public health policy? Well, it's certainly not driven by concern of viruses. It's all about control, subjugation, and replacement of Americans. To add insult to injury as it relates to immigration and the pandemic, New York officials are now threatening to replace Americans fired from health care jobs for not getting the shots with ... you guessed it ... Haitian nurses! New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters Wednesday that they are working with the State Department ""to find out about visas for foreign workers, on a limited basis, to bring more nurses over here"" as part of the solution to replacing the 20% of health care workers who are refusing the shots.



In other words, they never cared about COVID. After all, if they truly feared the virus, they would have carpet-bombed the country with early treatment rather than restricting it. They are not doing this to protect us from the virus; they are using the virus to replace us as citizens.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-governments-mass-migration-from-disease-ridden-countries-during-a-pandemic-is-quite-revealing,2021-09-24
Horowitz: The massive invasion and human rights violations ... at our own border harming our communities,"We have the wealthiest, most sophisticated and brutal cartels at our border who surveil our side of the border with cutting-edge technology and bring over millions of impoverished aliens, thousands of dangerous criminals and gang members, and drugs killing over 100,000 Americans a year. Perhaps if we renamed Texas or Arizona “Ukraine,” we’d get Republicans to finally care about the issue.

It’s not that Putin hasn’t violated human rights and invaded a sovereign nation. It’s that the testosterone levels of GOP politicians go from 0 to 100 instantaneously when discussing the sovereignty of every nation but our own. Our government continues to refuse to release this year’s ICE immigration enforcement report, but the preliminary numbers paint a shocking picture.

We are on pace for roughly 700,000 illegal aliens to be released into our country in one year. Moreover, this open invitation has allowed the cartels to strategically distract our agents with babysitting while smuggling in thousands of people who are even more problematic. Consider the magnitude of Biden’s invitation to invade America. Look at the percentage increase in Border Patrol apprehensions of categories of criminals since Biden took office:

Notice the jump in apprehensions of convicted murderers and sex offenders. Now consider the fact that those people pay the cartels a significant sum of money to be strategically and surreptitiously crossed. Given their successful business model, it’s hard to imagine CBP apprehending more than a tiny fraction of these dangerous criminals. Every boatload of fake refugees our agents are forced to deal with is a strategic ploy for the cartels to cross over dangerous individuals. That is an invasion.

We will never know the full scope of the number of dangerous criminals who enter our country, but we can begin to quantify how much it affects our safety by looking back during the Trump administration when they were still apprehending them inside our country. If you go back to FY 2018, ICE apprehended criminal aliens who together racked up 542,798 criminal convictions and arrests. The numbers include 2,028 homicide offenses, 5,562 robberies, 11,766 weapons offenses, 50,753 assault charges, 76,585 dangerous drug charges, 80,730 DUIs, and over 12,000 sexual offenses.

Just ponder for a moment the immeasurable carnage caused by our senseless disregard for sovereignty and the number of nameless victims the media will never spotlight. This data doesn’t include those criminal charge categories that had fewer than 1,000. Only 29% of those were unconvicted charges, which likely means that the main focus of ICE removal operations, understandably so, is on convictions because they focus on the prisons and jails. Which means there are likely many more arrested for crimes who are not apprehended by ICE.

Also, keep in mind that ICE only has fewer than 6,000 deportation officers, a fraction of the size of the NYPD, and the largest number of illegal aliens live in sanctuary cities, which made it difficult for ICE to catch the largest number of criminal aliens.

As of the most recent ICE report, there were 3.26 million aliens under ICE's undetained docket. These are individuals who have been targeted by ICE for removal, which most likely means the overwhelming majority have criminal records in addition to immigration violations. That means over 3 million criminal aliens who were dangerous enough to be on ICE's radar remain in the country indefinitely without being deported.

As of 2018, there were more than 1 million illegal aliens who have already received final deportation orders, with another 1.5 million having already received deportation orders but who are in the process of seeking an appeal.

Even if we focused solely on the bad guys, we lack the resources to make a dent. As early as 2013, DHS estimated, based on ICE programs in local jails, that there were 1.9 million criminal aliens in this country and that 900,000 aliens were arrested every year. Chillingly, the report noted that ""550,000 criminal aliens convicted of crimes exit law enforcement custody every year"" and that ""this population of criminal aliens poses a major threat to public safety.""

Now consider the fact that this is all old data and preceded the worst border invasion in our history. Just since fiscal year 2018, we’ve apprehended 3.7 million at the border, of whom undoubtedly most were released and many more never recorded got away from agents. While we often complain that all illegal crime is avoidable and that not enough criminals are deported, we have still deported from the interior and at the border 1.8 million criminal aliens from 2007 to 2018. Can you imagine how many of them likely took advantage of the invasion of the past few years, paid the cartels enormous sums of money, re-entered our country and communities, and enriched these vicious cartels at the same time so they can more effectively control, surveil, and manipulate both sides of our border?

Nobody has ever endeavored to fully quantify the magnitude of crime, chaos, fiscal cost, and drugs and gangs in our cities as a result of this. It is astounding that we don’t try to ascertain the citizenship of every individual arrested, but back when ICE was still doing good work, they divulged some numbers in New York City from among those they lodged detainers against. In FY 2019, ICE’s New York bureau field office lodged 7,526 detainers for foreign criminals who racked up 17,873 criminal convictions and 6,500 criminal charges. The offenses included among those crimes were 200 homicides, over 500 robberies, over 1,000 sexual offenses, over 1,000 weapons offenses, over 3,500 assaults, and over 1,500 DUIs.

At the time, I noted the 200 homicides are astounding because there were only about 300 murders per year at the time. Not all of those homicides were committed in one year, but for ICE to have definitively identified aliens with 200 murder convictions or charges in just one year’s worth of detainers is simply astonishing.





Which brings us back to the border and the broader lack of prioritization of geopolitical threats by our political class. In January, Todd Bensman reported live from the Mexico-Guatemala border that the U.N. was handing out cash assistance to encourage migrants to invade our border. It’s this invasion that is facilitating unconscionable amounts of crime, drugs, sex trafficking, and gang and cartel activity at our border and in every major American city. Ranchers on our own soil live and work in constant fear. It’s hard to conjure up a greater, more comprehensive systemic threat to our sovereignty, security, culture, and human rights than the policies facilitating the border invasion.

While the media whips everyone into a frenzy over a foreign country over which we have little control and few options, they will never tell what is occurring at our own border. For GOP politicians to only care about what the media tells them to while ignoring the plight of our own people is a violation of their oaths of office.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-massive-invasion-and-human-rights-violations-at-our-own-border-harming-our-communities,2022-02-28
Horowitz: The only solution to border invasion is for Texas to remove illegal aliens,"What is the solution when the federal government not only fails to secure the border but actively invites the largest influx of illegal aliens in American history? Well, the Constitution is a two-way social compact, in part, between the states and the federal government. If the feds are breaching it in order to violate Texas sovereignty, and California can breach it to invite in illegal aliens, why can't Texas uphold sovereignty by removing illegal aliens?



Just consider the predicament of the Lone Star State. The preliminary border numbers for July show that 205,000 illegal aliens were apprehended, a number that is simply unfathomable, and up from 188,829 in June. Just in the Rio Grande Valley alone, there were 8,144 apprehensions over the weekend. That is an annualized pace of nearly 1 million just for one border sector!

If that is not an invasion, then the word has no meaning. Some might suggest that there is no violence involved, but aside from the violent cartels orchestrating the flow, let us not forget the end-result that Texas must deal with. The latest report from the Texas Department of Public Safety tabulates more than 573,000 criminal offenses committed by 344,000 criminal aliens, 235,000 of whom were confirmed to be here illegally, who were booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011, and June 30, 2021. The crimes include:

1,245 homicides

66,924 assaults

17,456 burglaries

72,835 drug charges

980 kidnappings

33,335 thefts

4,155 robberies

7.076 sexual assaults

8,332 sexual offenses

49,408 obstructing police charges

8,317 weapons charges

These numbers only account for those illegal aliens who already were encountered by the feds and have a matching fingerprint in the system, so the numbers are really much higher. Keep in mind, that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of illegals evading Border Patrol this year. Those are usually the worst criminals, but if they are arrested for a crime in Texas and they are not in the DHS IDENT database they are not included in the count.

However, given that those recorded as committing crimes were already known to the feds, why weren't they removed? As Hans van Spakovsky asks, ""Why were these 235,000 illegal aliens – who were identified because they had been previously detained by DHS – still in Texas, still present in this country, and thus able to commit their crimes?""

The federal government not only floods the state with criminal aliens, in contravention to nearly every section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), they refuse to remove those aliens caught committing new crimes in the country. Is Texas really at the mercy of the federal malfeasance to secure its own sovereignty?

Article I, § 10, cl. 3 (the Compact Clause) states clearly that ""No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, ….or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.""

If this is not an invasion, I'm not sure what is. Also, nobody is suggesting that Texas go to war with the countries of origin of these invaders. But the principle of sovereignty of states spelled out in the social compact, and clearly preserved in the Constitution, dictate that a state has the right to evacuate itself from imminent danger if the federal government is unwilling or unable to help. In this case, the federal government is actively aiding and abetting the invasion.



Even former Chief Justice John Marshall, a strong proponent of a robust federal government, stated clearly during the Virginia Ratifying Convention that states ultimately have the final say when the people believe they are in danger. ""This clearly proves that the states can use the militia when they find it necessary,"" said Marshall during the debate on the Compact Clause on June 16, 1788.

Some might suggest that the federal courts will throw a tantrum and say they cannot deport illegal aliens. Indeed, a George W. Bush-appointee had the nerve to rule that the Texas governor could not use COVID-19 to stop the transporting of aliens throughout Texas, even as the courts have greenlit governors to control our businesses, movement, and bodily autonomy under the guise of COVID-19.

In fact, last year, Gov. Greg Abbott set up checkpoints on the roads leading into Texas from Louisiana to screen people and enforce the mandatory quarantine, as if Louisiana were an international border. The courts had no problem with it. Suddenly, when it comes to invaders, they have more rights than we do.

The courts have lost all moral and legal authority on this issue. The Constitution is not a suicide pact, and most certainly, judicial supremacy is not a suicide pact. The time has come to kick the federal courts out of illegal immigration. Remember, these are the same courts that had no problem with sanctuary cities and even upheld New York's policy to criminalize federal enforcement of national sovereignty. Yet, when states want to enforce their own sovereignty when the feds are refusing to enforce provisions of the INA, the courts suddenly find religion with federal powers.

When the courts tried to block Arizona from dealing with the influx under former President Barack Obama, the late Justice Antonin Scalia stated in his partial dissent in Arizona v. U.S., ""If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State."" Well, Texas needs to ask the same question Scalia did of Arizona: ""Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws?""

""A good way of answering that question,"" continued the great justice, ""is to ask: Would the States conceivably have entered into the Union if the Constitution itself contained the Court's holding?""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-only-solution-to-border-invasion-is-for-texas-to-remove-illegal-aliens,2021-08-04
Horowitz: The problem with the GOP legislative agenda,"So, you’ve been locked out of power completely for two years, and specifically in the House of Representatives for four years. What are your first-priority bills out of the gate to respond to what has occurred under Biden and the Great Reset?

Well, for starters, the world was destroyed under the COVID regime. You’d expect Republicans to address that in their first act, right? At least their second or third priority?

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise released a list of the first 11 bills and resolutions scheduled for the floor vote, and you’d think COVID fascism – the seminal issue of our time – never occurred. Not only is there no mention of the vaccines or terminating pharma’s immunity to liability, but no legislation even on the consensus issues of masks and lockdowns.

In a sane world, the first bill, “H.R. 1,” would involve Congress reasserting legislative authority and banning all emergency public health declarations beyond seven days unless Congress passes the measures. After all, this is not the 1800s anymore, and Congress can convene at any moment. It’s precisely the most impactful decisions of our country that require congressional buy-in, not governance by administrative fiat. The bill would ban the CDC from ever requiring shots, masks, or social distancing and from recommending shutting down schools.

Have we learned nothing from the past few years? How is this not on the agenda? I’ve offered dozens of ideas that red states must implement and that should be implemented on the federal level, beginning with ending the Prep Act and liability exemption for pharmaceutical companies.

But if you look at the GOP agenda in general, all the items are designed to be nuanced and very specific in order to elicit a “gotcha” talking point against Democrats rather than to usher in civilization-changing ideas.

Let’s be honest: With Republicans giving up their budget leverage until later in the year, all they are left with are “messaging bills” that won’t go beyond passage in the House. So the only purpose is to stimulate debate, change hearts and minds and culture, and motivate states to act on some of these items. The goal would also be to expose just how bad things are under the current system and demonstrate extremely bold contrast. Here are examples of bills that will plow new ground:

No indemnity from liability for greedy and criminal pharma companies and repeal of the Prep Act, which gives immunity to any pandemic-related decision or authorization.

No global warming regulations and green subsidies that lie at the heart of inflation, supply chain problems, and diminished quality of life.

No releasing anyone at our border; a complete ban on all benefits for illegal aliens.

Clarifying that states can enforce any immigration law and go beyond federal enforcement.

According states standing to sue in court when harmed by federal policies releasing illegal aliens.

An end to Chinese foreign student visas en masse.

Selling off federal lands to Western states so that the feds can’t lock up food, energy, and natural resource development.

No spying, surveilling, or monitoring any American with any agency program unless there is probable cause the individual committed a crime. This would include repeal of the Patriot Act. Any agent caught violating civil rights would be on the hook for a private cause of action in federal court.

A complete abolition of race education in the Department of Education.

A complete extirpation of any reference to, much less support for, castration throughout all federal agencies. Abolish all sexuality programs in the Department of Education.

An increase in mandatory minimums for violent felons caught illegally possessing a gun or using a gun thereafter in a crime, not just the small-ball crime bills they have planned.

Ban all woke, green, and biomedical policies in the military.

Audit not just Fauci’s NIAID, but also DARPA and BARDA and the entire biomedical security state.

Ban Biden’s executive order on transhumanist biotech, which calls for the “genetic engineering technologies and techniques to be able to write circuitry for cells and predictably program biology in the same way in which we write software and program computers.”

Pull out of the U.N., or at least the WHO and other onerous international agencies.

Abolish the TSA and revert back to private airport screening. This affects most Americans, and everyone hates the way they are treated. The tyranny began in airports.

There are countless more examples on critical issues of our time.

In other words, we need to be discussing categorical, big-picture demands that would help facilitate a broad debate on the anarcho-tyranny that has taken hold of the country under Biden. The messaging bills, because they have no chance of passing, must be oriented toward shifting the Overton window and plowing new ground on ideas. So yes, it’s great to vote on defunding the new IRS agents, but while you’re doing it, let’s sow new ideas like creating a legal defense fund for victims of IRS political targeting and then addressing the bigger fish: the FBI. One of the first bills should be barring all federal law enforcement agents from monitoring political opponents and creating a private cause of action in court against the specific agents caught engaging in those activities.

For example, whistleblower FBI agent Steve Friend told members of Congress that the FBI is targeting people who weren’t even at the Capitol just because of their political activities and statements. We need legislation that goes big, not because any of this will be enacted now, but because it accentuates the magnitude of the tyrannical government.

As for illegal immigration, all benefits to illegal aliens should be banned, and all catch-and-release should be prohibited, again, with a cause of action for states to sue DHS for violations. Instead, they have a random bill scheduled forcing the DOJ to notify ICE when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun and is pinged in NICS. Great idea and great talking point to get Democrats on record as against it, but that bill is good as a side dish, not the main course. The main course is that the American people should not be on the hook for an invasion, and those perpetrating it must be liable for civil and criminal penalties. Go big or go home.

On energy, Republicans are planning a pair of bills preventing Biden from drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and selling the petroleum to China. We obviously all support these ideas, but again, they are nuanced “one-off” ideas to embarrass Biden, not to address the root of our regression in energy, food, and vital goods and services, along with supply chain shortages and inflation. Instead, they should be offering a more categorical bill ending all global warming mandates and subsidies that diminish our quality of life, make vital goods expensive and scarce, and ensure that our products and appliances don’t work.



Republicans have a resolution prepared to declare their appreciation for law enforcement. Nice touch, but that will not move civilization. How about a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that every American has the right to refuse any medical procedure, treatment, injection, device, vaccine, or prophylactic on or in his body and that mask and vaccine mandates violate the most fundamental rights of bodily autonomy?

Instead it’s all theater designed to give the Republican lapdogs on radio and Fox News endless fodder of “but the Democrats” and “Biden crime family” rather than demonstrating how we will actually make people’s lives better and change the corrupt system in reality. If running and governing purely as the anti-Democrat didn’t work in the 2022 political environment, it will never work any other time.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-problem-with-the-gop-legislative-agenda,2023-01-05
Horowitz: Time for red states to begin deporting illegal aliens after feds suspend sovereignty laws,"How do you publish an enforcement report when enforcement has been suspended? Well, that was the predicament in which the Department of Homeland Security found itself last year. Therefore, officials refused to publish the annual ICE enforcement report for nearly five months. Now that they have finally published it, they failed to disclose the most important data. But what we see is so appalling that it violates the entire social contract that the federal government forged with the states – “to insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence.” States have no other option but to pick up the slack.

After delaying the release of the fiscal year 2021 enforcement report for nearly half a year, ICE finally published a scaled-back version last Friday, which essentially shows that enforcement of our sovereignty has ground to a halt. During the entire FY 2021, ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 74,082 noncitizens in FY 2021 and deported just 59,011. For comparison, there were 267,258 removals in FY 2019 and 185,884 removals in FY 2019.

The numbers are even worse than the top lines indicate. Remember, Trump was still president for the first few months of FY 2021, and Biden didn’t change the enforcement policies until Feb. 18. Just 28,677 of the 59,011 removals took place after Feb. 18. In other words, under Biden, there were just a little over 4,000 deportations a month, down from pre-pandemic levels of over 22,000. Thus, while ICE agents still receive salaries, Biden has essentially fulfilled the woke mission of abolishing ICE without actually firing the agents.

It’s not like there were few fish in the pond to deport. The lowest interior enforcement numbers coincide with the greatest invasion at the border itself. From Oct. 2021 through Feb. 2022, there have been 838,685 encounters, a 111% increase from last year’s record-setting encounters year-to-date. That is an annualized pace of over 2 million illegal aliens, not to mention close to a million others who will escape apprehension.

Every day, the Border Patrol catches murderers, child molesters, and gang members, so all those gotaways are going to include those who pay exorbitant sums to evade the Border Patrol and enter the interior of the country. Once they enter our communities, it is now clear that ICE will never catch up with them. What does that mean for our communities?

Well, guess what was missing from the report? The classic breakdown of criminal offenses by criminal category among those apprehended by ICE per fiscal year. For example, here is the tabulation for FY 2019:

Typically, this is the tally of criminal offenses among those arrested by ICE in a given year, totaling nearly 470,000 in FY 2019. And these numbers would roughly mirror that total every year. Now consider the fact that this year ICE reduced its apprehension numbers. Imagine how many of these people with these rap sheets remain in the country. Well, they did publish the tally for five of the most serious categories: Homicide, 1,506; sex assault, 3,415; assault, 19,549; robbery, 2,717; kidnapping, 1,063.

So even the most serious categories were down dramatically, and not because the pool of criminality is smaller. No wonder they never wanted to report their enforcement numbers and, even in the tardy report, made sure to omit the criminal offense chart.

Also, while ICE did take possessions of criminal aliens this year, what happens next year when the full force of Biden’s policies is in effect? A lot of the arrests this year of the criminal aliens are likely due to the aggressive detainers placed on them during domestic criminal proceedings during the Trump administration. For example, in FY 2019, ERO issued 165,487 detainers on aliens subject to criminal charges or convictions, amounting to more than 56,000 assaults, 14,500 sex crimes, 5,000 robberies, 2,500 homicides, and 2,500 kidnappings. 2,500 homicides! Detainers are the best front-end measure of enforcement. How many detainers were issued on new criminal aliens in FY 2021? We don’t know, because officials declined to publish any information on detainers, but we will likely feel it in our communities in the coming years.

“This report is more significant for what it doesn't cover,” said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, who has analyzed these reports for years. “ICE is desperate to conceal how little enforcement there has been.”

Vaughan suspects the numbers are even worse than the report suggests, because there are indications officials are counting border turn-backs and removals in the same data points that are typically reserved for interior enforcement numbers. “They have gone to great lengths to make it hard for people to compare ICE's performance to prior years. They brag about arrests, but they won't say where they happened and whether these people are still in custody. They brag about increasing the percentage of removed aliens who are criminals from 56% to 66%. But in recent years, the number removed from the interior who are criminals has been more like 95%. That means their numbers include many border cases.”

Vaughan concludes that they are “deliberately co-mingling these cases so people can't see how few criminals were removed from our cities and towns, especially compared to prior years — even during the pandemic lockdown year and even under Obama.”

In other words, the message to the world is that once you get into the interior, you are here to stay, even with a horrendous criminal record. This fact is not lost on the cartel smugglers who know they can earn a killing off such a contrived market for human smuggling, so that they can buy more drugs and weapons to operate on both sides of our own border.



Are states going to sit back and take this? At a minimum, they must begin requiring state law enforcement to always check the immigration status of anyone arrested for a crime and publish statistics every month quantifying the number of illegal aliens arrested by criminal offense category. Eventually, Republican governors must work together to fill the vacuum of immigration enforcement left by the federal government. If sanctuary states like New York and California so badly want these criminal aliens, then perhaps states like Florida and Texas should grant them their wish.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-time-for-red-states-to-begin-deporting-illegal-aliens-after-feds-suspend-sovereignty-laws,2022-03-16
Horowitz: Time’s up: Trump doesn’t need permission of cities participating in insurrection to send in military,"How is it that we are two weeks into an armed insurrection in Seattle, where local politicians let terrorists take over a police precinct and several city blocks and prevent all city services from entering? How is it that Americans continue to get beaten out of their cars by lynch mobs, and it appears there are no police in sight? Every Republican tells us that re-election of Trump is the most important outcome we can strive for, but he is president right now. He holds the power of the federal government. Are we really at the mercy of local governments ignoring or downright participating in the insurrection?

This question was settled long ago. State governments never had the power to violate life, liberty, or property, pursuant to Art. IV, §2, cl. 1 of the Constitution, which prohibited states from violating core natural rights from the very first day of the republic. In 1867, however, the 14th Amendment's Privileges and Immunities Clause gave the federal government enforcement power over states that violate those natural rights, which were specified at the federal level in the Bill of Rights after states had already adopted the original Constitution.

In response to the Civil War, Congress passed a law in 1871 to authorize the president to put down any insurrection. It was the original enforcement legislation designed to put teeth into the 14th Amendment, as envisioned under Sec. 5 of that amendment, which authorizes Congress to enforce violations by states. It's law to this day under 10 U.S. Code §253 and was amended in 2008 to apply to natural disasters and terrorism.

The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it—

(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or

(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.

There are no limitations on the time, methods, or place in which the president can deploy the military to put down insurrection and domestic violence. With the anarchists desiring to relive the Civil War, it's time to use a Civil War-era law to put down this rebellion, as the law was designed to do.

What we are facing today in many cities is the worst unlawful combination of insurrection and violence that is hindering numerous state and federal laws, blocking highways and threatening motorists, and destroying businesses and property. Everyone seems to think that the president needs the permission of the state to deal with this, but the law was clearly designed for when ""authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection.""

The language of ""privileges and immunities"" was taken from the then-recently passed 14th Amendment to ensure that states couldn't get away with ignoring people's inalienable rights. Trump and Senate Republicans need to up the ante and threaten to invoke this statute if states and cities continue to allow ""autonomous zones"" and rioters to maim, loot, burn, steal, and obstruct traffic.

Obviously, we were all reluctant to immediately deploy the military and were hoping that local police would finally come to their senses, as they always have in the past after a few days of rioting. However, three weeks into this insurrection, many of these city governments have downright joined in the insurrection, which has led to direct threats to the lives and property of all Americans indefinitely. Truckers now have to rethink where they deliver goods, as if this were Afghanistan, where you need a map to see where the government has full or partial control over the territory.

Here is the latest motorist lynching in Santa Monica, California, captured in a video posted by my BlazeTV colleague, Elijah Schaffer:

With California officials downright encouraging this behavior and preventing the police from stopping it, the president is obligated to step in. The philosophy behind the 14th Amendment and the 1871 law to implement it is that the federal government was created for situations where states are either inherently incapable of defending liberty (a foreign invasion) or when they refuse to protect liberty and downright promulgate tyrannical edicts against life and property. Slavery and Jim Crow had to be swatted down by the federal government. Now these riots and beatings need the same response.



The police have been made to be criminals while the criminals are being exalted as civil rights leaders. This cannot go on longer. We cannot wait until November. Trump is already president and already has all the authority he needs. It's time to use it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-times-up-trump-doesnt-need-permission-of-cities-participating-in-insurrection-to-send-in-military,2020-06-19
Horowitz: Top 6 demands to put Americans first in omnibus bill,"Our nation is at an inflection point like never before. Despite clear science and data indicating that our government is now responsible for countless deaths and injuries from vaccine mandates and the blocking of treatment, nothing has been done to rectify this for the future. We have a border that is wide open to millions of illegal aliens and cartel criminals. We have a government getting us into war with Russia over a corrupt Ukrainian regime, crushing consumers with inflation without any effort to boost American food and fuel production. And we have a budget bill that will not only ratify these policies, but spend even more money enforcing them and exacerbating the demise of the U.S. dollar.

In other words, it all comes down to the 2,741-page omnibus bill released late Tuesday night, which the House will vote on hours after it was posted online. It’s time to fix our government through the budget or shut down this ruinous government from destroying our lives. Let’s not forget that the inflation and supply chain crises were not originally caused by the Russian war; they were caused by COVID fascism and biblical levels of spending that devalued the dollar. Currently, both parties plan to solve the problem … by spending even more on COVID funding, spending $12 billion on Ukraine, and engaging in a proxy war with Russia and its oil exports without ramping up domestic production.

Republicans have the votes to block the omnibus bill in the Senate. Technically, they even have a majority, because Democrat Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.) is on medical leave. Here are the six demands they should make before passing a budget bill.

1) End of all COVID mandates: Workers, soldiers, health care professionals, and patients are still being forced to get the shots, despite everything that has been revealed about the safety and efficacy. All the vaccine and mask mandates still in place must be terminated. Yet not only does the omnibus bill fund every corrupt agency that is still promulgating these immoral and illogical policies, it gives another $15 billion to HHS to promote Pfizer, mass testing, and health surveillance. In total, the monsters at the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for the COVID disaster got a 12 percent funding boost, which will total $108.3 billion.

2) End emergency declaration: Ideally, the existing emergency statute should be repealed and replaced, but at a minimum the current emergency declaration and the invocation of the PREP Act that has induced all of this mischief and has handed our society over to Big Pharma must end.

3) Drill, baby, drill: Both parties seem to agree that we must dump $14 billion into Ukraine while cutting off Russian oil. Putting the prudence of these policies aside, it is indefensible to harm American consumers without first ramping up American production. This includes:

Approval of the Keystone pipeline;

Expansion of drilling in Alaska and federal lands and termination of moratorium on permits;

Removal of Biden’s recent global warming regulations on energy production;

Elimination of the ethanol mandate, which increases the price of fuel and food and harms independent oil refiners;

Ending the ban on financing of coal-fired power plants;

Ending all the existing barriers to fracking;

Ending restrictions on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission limiting its ability to approve natural gas pipelines;

Pulling out of the Paris climate accord;

Suspending the EPA seasonal fuel blend regulations, which would decrease refining and transportation costs.

4) Ban oil and gas from Venezuela and Iran: If we are going to ask the American people to sacrifice Russian oil and gas on behalf of the Zelenskyy regime, then shouldn’t that same sense of morality trump supply concerns when it comes to Iran and Venezuela? Yet the Biden administration plans on using them as alternative exporters of energy.

5) Defund spying on political opposition: The DHS has announced it is treating opponents of election fraud and COVID fascism as the highest terrorism concern. The DOJ is promising to work with local law enforcement to combat concerned parents standing up to licentious school board officials. How can we combat authoritarians overseas when our own government is engaging in tyrannical behavior?

6) Defund border invasion: Thousands of illegal aliens are being flown from the border to our communities rather than being removed. Over 62,000 were released in January alone. Any program designed to complete the criminal smuggling conspiracy of the cartels must be defunded, and Title 42 removals must be applied to all who come to our border.

The bottom line is that a vote for the current omnibus is a vote for more inflation, more medical experimentation, more mandates, an open-ended war with Russia from a position of weakness, and every other immoral activity funded by our government. Yet rather than secure these demands, what was the hill to die on for GOP leader Mitch McConnell? He bragged about raising Biden’s $10 billion Ukraine aid package to $14 billion. In other words, he doesn’t give a hoot about Americans and American issues. The only thing that elevates his testosterone levels is foreign interests.



Does anyone believe this will change when Republicans have the majority and the same GOP leaders control the floor process with the same decrepit values they harbor today? If anything, there is no time like the present. With a 27% approval rating, Republicans could fight on every one of these issues and have the public on their side. Except all of the bad guys are actually on the same side – Republicans and Democrats. Which leaves we the people without any avenue to redress our grievances.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-top-6-demands-to-put-americans-first-in-omnibus-bill,2022-03-09
"Horowitz: Understanding DeSantis, shocking election results, and the red-state revolution we need","There are three political parties in America: Republicans, Democrats, and Ron DeSantis. Democrats are extremely unpopular but were somehow, nonetheless, able to defeat Republicans (morally, if not tactically), who are essentially a controlled opposition. Democrats won big given the circumstances, but at the same time, Ron DeSantis, who is the most antithetical to what Democrats stand for, won big as well. What gives?



There is no way to sugarcoat the GOP crap show in this election. Republicans began this election season with first and goal at the Democrat end zone, with a 50-50 Senate and 212 seats in the House. Even a traditional modest midterm gain against the incumbent president – even with a good economy – should have been enough to flip both chambers. Add to it the fact that the economy, crime, tyranny, border invasion, and inflation have never been worse, there was so much malaise in America, and all the polls showed the GOP winning on every major issue, and we had the makings of a wave that should have swamped the GOP waves of 2010 and 1994.

Oh, and back then you had Democrat presidents who were charismatic and personally popular, as opposed to the deeply unpopular Joe Biden. Yet Republicans were essentially beaten by Joe Biden and John Fetterman to a draw, even though, thanks to reapportionment, Republicans might narrowly control the House.

When the historic results came pouring in from Florida quicker than any other state, showing a Democrat bloodbath, we all thought it was a harbinger of what was to come for the rest of the night. But that bloodbath never came, and to the extent it did, it was the other way around, when Republicans lost legislative chambers in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Michigan. While the polls undersold the Democrat performance in almost every other state, they also undersold DeSantis’ already dominant position headed into Election Day in Florida. DeSantis successfully made himself almost like a new political party. And indeed, if you follow his views on the issues, there is a greater gulf between him and most prominent Republicans than between Republicans and Democrats.

Therein lies the problem. While it is puzzling that voters would choose Democrats given the state of the economy and security, let’s face it: Republicans barely disagree with Democrats on the issues. For most Republicans, it’s as if COVID never happened. Aside from a few throwaway lines, most Republicans never ran on the full extent of the problems with biomedical tyranny. Instead, they allowed Democrats to outflank them on “my body, my choice,” which should have been our message for the taking in a post-COVID world.

On Ukraine and foreign policy in general, there is barely any difference between the parties. Even as they ran strong on crime and illegal immigration, for most of recent history Republicans were for “comprehensive immigration reform” and “criminal justice reform,” only opting to superficially take the other side as an easy election talking point. They have no vision, and they stood for nothing. They produced nothing of the quality of Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America.

Yes, a few candidates here and there did run on something other than the weak GOP-controlled messaging, but they get swept away in the negative perception voters have of the party. Only DeSantis, with four years of internationally recognized, distinctly effective governance – particularly on the issue of our time – did the voters treat as a stand-alone entity. He was able to win the suburbs and even some urban areas.

In other words, Ron DeSantis is the control group that exposes the GOP as a controlled opposition. He demonstrated – not in Wyoming or Idaho but in a former swing state – that you can win over a supermajority governing coalition with sincere America-first policy that speaks to the people’s concerns and even changes their preexisting views by offering them something different from what the two pathetic parties are offering. This is how Republicans were able to lose the legislature in Michigan for the first time since 1983 but pick up supermajorities in Florida.

The problem with the Republican Party is not Trump per se, although it’s hard to see his mix of style, inconsistent messaging, and weak policies and personnel being the winning formula going forward. The conservative movement has a Republican Party and Fox News problem. Conservatives incur all the liabilities of those institutions without any policy or civilization benefit. How much longer are we going to be conservative souls trapped in the contaminated GOP body, servicing Republicans’ WWE-style fake fights with Democrats as they ensure the latter come out victorious on policy – and now even electorally?

So, the answer is to have DeSantis run for president, right?

While it’s hard to stand opposed to that proposition, and there is certainly nobody else on the horizon who sports this mix of policy benefits and electoral appeal, focusing on the presidential election is the wrong takeaway from DeSantis’ stunning victory. It’s the “Fox News mindset” of soap opera politicking as an end to itself. It’s not even clear that anyone can win with the country so brainwashed and the elections designed for Democrat mail-in shenanigans in all the right states. Moreover, the blue states have become like France, and the federal government is irremediably broken. Is it even worth trying to fix it and trying to govern over people who will never accept us in the long run?

The question everyone should be asking, however, is if half the states are as reliably red as the blue ones are blue, how come we don’t have leaders who govern like DeSantis in every one of those states? What would the country look like if the governors of Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alabama, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, and Idaho governed like DeSantis rather than a bunch of WEF-inspired technocrats? What would happen if every supermajority red-state governor used the machinery of state government to change the economies, culture, legal structure, and policies of the states the way Florida has done? What if every red-county government, school board, and health department reflected the values of the locals rather than the elites, as they currently do in most states aside from Florida?

The bad news is that the electorate is confused, angry, aimless, and divided. But that is also the good news. The same way we will never be able to crack the blue states, Democrats can’t crack the reliably red states. But almost all of them aren’t red in its pure sense, because the Republicans are frauds. So, before we ask how to beat the Democrats’ growing juggernaut in the formerly swing states, why are we not asking why we don’t have a DeSantis in every state with GOP supermajorities in the legislatures?



The answer will bring us back to the same point we’ve refused to confront for too long. The Republican Party, with few exceptions, is a controlled opposition. DeSantis accomplishing what he did in the third largest state with multiple urban centers demonstrates that we are being sold out in the R+20-30 rural states and have been for years. The soul-searching needs to examine more than what is wrong with the Republican Party: that the party itself is wrong.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-understanding-desantis-shocking-election-results-and-the-red-state-revolution-we-need,2022-11-09
Horowitz: We can no longer celebrate our independence. We must fight for it again.,"The day was July 4, 1826. As John Adams lay on his deathbed in the afternoon, he uttered his final words: ""Thomas Jefferson survives."" While in the literal sense, Adams was mistaken because Jefferson had died several hours earlier, in one way he was correct. The work that Jefferson completed on that very day exactly 50 years before – the work Adams helped him craft before the two became archenemies and then friends again – survived another two hundred years. Until now.

July 4, 2020, will be an Independence Day celebration like never before. In fact, it won't be a celebration at all, but merely a commemoration of what we have lost and hopefully a reminder of what we need to fight for all over again after 244 years. It will be marked not by the grand public displays of fireworks, for those are forbidden by restrictions upon the very liberties expressed in the Declaration of Independence, but rather by the sounds of fireworks being thrown by anarchists against police – anarchists who now dictate our way of life as we the people continue to be locked down.

It wasn't just the statue of Thomas Jefferson that was ripped down in Portland, Oregon. It was the foundational governing document he helped draft – the guiding light of our republic until it died 244 years later – that has been torn to shreds.

Ronald Reagan observed on July 4, 1986, as he related the story of the reuniting of Jefferson and Adams in friendship, that ""the things that unite us – America's past of which we're so proud, our hopes and aspirations for the future of the world and this much-loved country – these things far outweigh what little divides us.""

Well, indeed, 34 years later, we can now say with certainty that there are very few things that do not divide us, chief among them whether we are even proud of America's past or whether we seek to uproot every last vestige of its memory.

In order to understand what we have lost and what we need to fight for again, let's review the precious document that was signed on July 4, 1776. The product of five great men – Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson – in just the 201 words of its preamble, this founding charter of government established six inviolate principles of the morality of a just governing system – all of which have since been broken:

That individuals are born with natural rights that come from God, not from historical precedent, English Common Law, or the democratic whims of the majority in a given society. Those rights are beyond the reach of mob rule or a tyrannical political majority. That chief among those natural rights given by God are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to earn a living and own property. Implicit in this is the natural right to self-defense. As Sam Adams, the Founding Father of the American Revolution, said, ""Among the natural rights of the colonists are these: First a right to life, secondly to liberty, and thirdly to property; together with the right to defend them in the best manner they can."" That individuals form a government as a social compact, not to infringe upon those rights but to protect those inalienable rights from threats in a way that could not be managed without a governing body. That on issues not affecting inalienable rights, government may exercise other just powers, primarily for the safety and stability of the society, but only by the consent of the people as expressed through some legitimate form of republican representation (consent of the governed). Inherent in this principle is that no outside forces not controlled by the members of that society itself may determine the destiny of the society. That all men were created equal in access to and defense of those inalienable rights, not societal outcomes, privileges, or other human pursuits, an ideal that runs to natural law. Also, implicit in the preamble is that all members of a given society are equal in the right to self-governance in their respective societies on their territories and that no ruling class or individual has the right to invasively govern over someone else's life. That when a long train of abuses and usurpations of the aforementioned principles continues without any other recourse, the people have the right, indeed a duty, to rebel against the existing system.

The first five principles have been abrogated beyond recognition, which leaves us struggling with how to apply the sixth.

Today, we are suffering from a perfect contortion of these self-evident truths – the worst mix of tyranny and anarchy and the most widespread violations of fundamental rights since our Founding. We have a government that undemocratically locks down our physical movement and right to earn a living based on distorted data and flat-earth ""science,"" while facilitating unequal treatment for favored classes to riot. They strip us of the right to self-defense, while freely empowering their protected people and movements to maim, loot, block free movement, and even kill.

Everything our governments should be doing, they ignore, and everything they are prohibited from doing based on natural law, they elevate to the highest order of governance.

Mobs are allowed to roam freely and dictate policies through fear and intimidation.

Desires of foreign nationals who are not signatories to the social compact founded in the Declaration are elevated above the rights of the citizens governed by the compact.

Government by the consent of the governed? Our government is allowing people across the border to come here to get treated for the virus, then using those hospitalizations as a pretext to place curfews and other restrictions on the liberty and property of Americans.

""That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men …"" They are now allowing roving mobs to restrict our movement and attack motorists. In the process, they are spreading the virus, which gives this same illegitimate government further excuse to blame we the people and lock us down. We can't gather in small groups to work or socialize, while they can gather in the thousands to dismantle our republic. How is that for all men created equal?

As I laid out in my indictment of our illegitimate government, rather than a government built on promoting and protecting inalienable rights for all, we have a government that manufactures super-rights and privileges for some at the expense of foundational rights of the whole of the people. Liberty, according to our illegitimate politicians, now means the right to someone else's property or a public benefit, instead of freedom from restraint by someone else or by government.

Thus, this is not about a few or or even many policy disagreements. It all stems from the government's contortion of life, liberty, and property to mean the exact opposite of what our Founders knew them to be. There is no bridging the divide.

This government will not fix itself without deeper intervention and divine guidance. The Republican Party is part of the problem, not the solution. As we grope in the darkness and strategize and pray for a long-term or even short-term solution, we ourselves must never forget our liberty and property rights as well as the right to individual and jurisdictional sovereignty. We must never forget that these truths are still self-evident and that we are still willing to fight for them. We must never agree to this grotesque confluence of anarchy and tyranny as ""the new normal."" And we must certainly never legitimize this illegitimate usurpation of our social contract.

They might have torn down Jefferson's statue and perverted the government built on the contract he wrote, but we still have the actual contract. It belongs to us. And in that contract, Jefferson offered not only the moral imperative to break away from England but also the moral imperative to fight back against future government usurpations of that contract in the future. That contract is eternal, because it is built on natural law from God.

As Abraham Lincoln said following the Supreme Court's dreadful Dred Scott decision in 1858:

The assertion that ""all men are created equal"" was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain; and it was placed in the Declaration, not for that, but for future use. Its authors meant it to be, thank God, it is now proving itself, a stumbling block to those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant when such should re-appear in this fair land and commence their vocation they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.



Those infallible rights we are endowed with are inherent and don't come from government. They cannot be covered by a mask. They cannot be taken away.

So, where do we go from here? As we formulate a long-term solution to a problem that is much greater than any of us can deal with alone, we need to build an immediate movement and take steps. The first step is to rise up and fight back. Until now, only the mob's voices have been heard, because there is nobody else on the playing field. Nobody is representing us. To that end, we need to think beyond just the electoral process and take back our government under the following short-term propositions:

No American should be restricted by arbitrary coronavirus edicts so long as rioters are able to violate them while destroying public and private property.

No American without a criminal record should be barred from carrying a gun to protect himself from the lawlessness of gun felons who are allowed to roam the streets.

No American should be arrested for self-defense as the police stand back and allow rioters to attack them in cars and on their lawns. Patriotic sheriffs should start programs to deputize and train law-abiding owners to help keep the peace.

No American should have to pay local taxes until that governing authority reclaims the streets and the highways from roving bands of anarchists.

No federal tax funds should go to jurisdictions promoting lawless sanctuaries for the BLM mobs and criminal aliens. Patriots must demand that Trump veto any budget bill in September that does not defund anarchy.

Finally, it's time we organize citizen defense groups the way our Founders envisioned. No, we are not going to attack and harm innocent people as the governing mob is doing, but we will reclaim our right to defend our lives and property. We all respect law enforcement, but local police departments can't have it both ways. They can't abdicate their duties and throw us to the wolves but then swoop in when we try to fill the vacuum for our own protection or punish us for not wearing diapers on our faces even outside.

Just like the Minutemen of the 1770s, we need to form at the local level citizen defense groups to defend life, liberty, and property. After all, what made this great document we commemorate this week more than musings on paper was the signers' resolve to ""mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."" That pledge must be renewed at the local level in parts of the country where patriots are most common. Block by block, city by city, state by state, we must take our country back from the violent modern French revolutionaries and create another great American revolution that will make our Founders proud.

Eleven years after the signing of the Declaration, many of the same patriots assembled in the same hall in Philadelphia to codify the system of government based on the blueprint of this social compact. During the final day of triumph on September 17, 1787, Benjamin Franklin rose to speak. In his notes on the convention, James Madison captured his words as follows:

Whilst the last members were signing it [i.e., the Constitution] Doct FRANKLIN looking towards the Presidents Chair, at the back of which a rising sun happened to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often in the course of the Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun.



Over two centuries later, we have come full-circle, just as the Earth rotates on its axis, and we no longer have a rising sun. We have a sun that has already set. But the good news is that through darkness comes light, and from storm clouds come the growth and sustenance of rain. The same God who birthed us with these inherent rights constantly accords us numerous opportunities in life to defend and renew those rights, just as yesterday's sunset gives birth to a new sunrise. All we have to do is show up and fight for it.

It won't be easy, but it wasn't easy the first time around, when the patriots were in the minority and most were loyalists or indifferent. As John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, the day before he signed the great contract of American sentiment, ""I am well aware of the toil, and blood, and treasure, that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend these states. Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory; I can see that the end is more than worth all the means, and that posterity will triumph.""

Horowitz: What virus? DHS dumping COVID-positive illegal aliens into Texas cities,"The CDC wants all American children to suffocate under masks and college students to get experimental injections, but the same government is allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to waltz into the country — no questions asked.



Every other country has implemented strict travel bans during the pandemic, but this administration decided to wave in more than 1 million illegal aliens in the middle of a pandemic that it is using to suppress its own people. According to Border Report, busloads of illegal aliens are being distributed across Texas border towns, even though migrants have recently had a 10% COVID infection rate.

On Tuesday morning, Border Report witnessed two buses full of dozens of migrants being dropped off at the Humanitarian Respite Center. They were first sent across the street for coronavirus testing by a non-governmental organization hired by Catholic Charities and paid by the City of McAllen.

The city has spent more than $97,000 in coronavirus testing of migrants, Rodriguez said Tuesday, adding that the city hopes to get federally reimbursed. But he said it's more important now to spend the money and to ensure that no infected migrants get released in McAllen.

Pimentel told Border Report that on Monday afternoon there were 1,100 migrants at the Respite Center when it closed its doors to new arrivals. She said there are about 1,000 migrants who are currently isolated in eight to 10 area hotels within a 40-mile distance in the Rio Grande Valley and include locations in Weslaco, Edinburg, Mission and La Joya.

What other nation does this? Why are we responsible for the epidemiological curve of other countries as well as our own? Why are agents waving them in only to discover they have the virus, rather then turning them back right at the border, which in itself would disincentivize more crowding?



What has become clear is that human intervention does not change the trajectory of the virus, but if our government believes we are solely responsible for its spread, then cross-border migration is likely the worst thing we could be doing.

If a pandemic is enough to shut down the lives of Americans, how in the world can it not be sufficient to shut down illegal immigration and turn back the illegal aliens rather than welcoming them in with impunity?

""If you're an American citizen who goes to one of these countries, you can't even come back without a negative COVID test, yet these illegals can pour over from the very same countries and be dumped into our communities,"" said Don Mclaughlin, mayor of Uvalde, Texas, in an interview with TheBlaze. He said that Uvalde is turning the CDC guidance back on DHS and is requiring a negative COVID test before any of the migrants can be dropped off in the city.

According to a recent ICE report, just 13% of the illegal aliens released have shown up for their court dates. The report claims 50,000 have been released, but given that over 1 million illegals have been apprehended (and hundreds of thousands more likely evaded detection) and less than 30,000 are in custody, that number is likely exponentially higher.

It's uncanny how we've seen every clause of the Constitution violated under the guise of protecting us against the virus, yet not a finger will be lifted to stop people from coming from all over the world to our border. Texas gubernatorial candidate Don Huffines is entertaining the idea of having Texas officials remove the illegal aliens back across the border. Some might suggest that this would violate the federal dominion over immigration, but what is a state to do when the administration is refusing to enforce immigration laws? If states can become sanctuaries and thwart federal enforcement, why can't states enforce the laws the feds themselves are violating?

During the summer COVID wave in the Southern states the same time last year, we saw border counties with low population density with higher death rates than even urban areas elsewhere. There is a real concern that they will again aggravate what should be a mild summer wave in Texas. If COVID can be used to send hairdressers like Shelly Luther to jail, why can't it be used to secure our border?



In March, Governor Greg Abbott had no problem issuing a mandatory quarantine for those traveling back from California; Connecticut; New York; New Jersey; Washington; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; or Miami, Florida. He even set up checkpoints on the roads leading into Texas from Louisiana to screen people and enforce the mandatory quarantine, as if Louisiana were an international border.

For a state to cut off travel from another state is unconstitutional and was prohibited even under the Articles of Confederation. Yet the understanding is that the new 'COVID constitution' permits such drastic actions against fellow Americans. By that same logic, can't the new arrangement empower states to bar illegal invasions from foreign countries? Why can't Texas troopers turn people back to Mexico? Or perhaps, Texas DPS should send planeloads of illegal aliens to Washington, D.C., release them at the Capitol, and see how they like it. After all, there is no need for a wall around the Capitol, right?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-virus-dhs-dumping-covid-positive-illegal-aliens-into-texas-cities,2021-07-28
Horowitz: What we expect from GOP governors and legislators in this crisis,"This is it. This is why our founders created a layered approach to government — for this very nightmare scenario we are confronted with today. The question is whether the Republican governors and legislators will rise to the occasion.

We all knew this was coming. Yesterday, the Biden regime announced a full federal requirement to get the waning, leaky, and risky COVID shots that are so ineffective that they already need a third shot. In following Israel's lead, the Biden administration is not only mandating the shot on the federal workforce, but anyone who works for a private company with more than 100 employees. But the difference is that, unlike in Israel, we have state governors who can and must interpose between the feds and the people.

There has quite literally never been anything this tyrannical foisted upon us in our lifetime. The shots come with a tremendous amount of risk, particularly to those who already had the virus, which in parts of the country is already a majority of people. They haven't even fully studied the effects on pregnant women, menstrual cycles, and myocarditis in young people, yet the mandate is preceding the science.

At the same time, it is very likely that the mass vaccination with a leaky vaccine is causing a quasi-Marek's disease enhancement syndrome, which can make the virus even worse, under what is known as the ""imperfect vaccine hypothesis."" As PBS noted in a 2015 article on the leaky chicken vaccine, which causes vaccinated birds to transmit the virus to unvaccinated birds and kill them with higher viral loads, the Marek's disease vaccine ""has helped this chicken virus become uniquely virulent."" Sound similar to what we are experiencing today in Israel with a worse viral spread than ever before?

As PBS noted, ""To test the imperfect vaccine hypothesis in humans, you would need [to] monitor the vaccine response for either a large or isolated population for a long time. … Does the vaccine merely reduce symptoms, or does it also keep patients from getting infected and transmitting the virus?""

Well, we already have the answer to that in the first human vaccine in human history to not only be used in middle of a pandemic, but to be leaky and very narrow spectrum. How can this be continued without first ruling out the growing prospect that the mass vaccination with a flawed shot is making the pandemic worse?

This is where the red states come into play. Republicans hold 27 governorships, 23 trifectas, and 19 supermajorities in state legislatures. The governors in those states must immediately convene emergency sessions of the state legislatures and request that they pass a bill prohibiting the implementation of the federal mandate within the states. While they are at it, they should also punish any medical board or pharmacy that gets in the way of the true solution to COVID, which is early treatment with cheap repurposed drugs. To put teeth into their new state laws, legislators must empower state troopers and the National Guard to arrest any federal employee or agent seeking to enforce a mandate violating human rights.

How much longer will these elected Republicans sit out the Super Bowl of liberty vs. tyranny? These same governors and state legislatures allowed our economies to be destroyed, trillions of dollars to be flushed on worthless and painful voodoo measures, and individual liberty to be crushed, only to make the virus worse than ever before. They got the lockdowns, they got the masks, and they got endless payouts to Big Pharma for dangerous drugs like remdesivir while crushing any cheap therapeutics. Now, they have very high vaccination rates in most parts of the country and are demanding boosters. They had their chance to experiment with our liberties; now it's time for any red state worth its name to pull the plug on the tyranny.

No, ""see you in court"" is not the appropriate response to this tyranny, Gov. Noem. More must be done.

The courts have already greenlit vaccine mandates. They have not only sided with COVID fascism for a year and a half — including blocking lifesaving treatment for people without options — they are now upholding ""rights"" of county governments to violate people's bodily integrity. So, the same courts that ignore any lawsuit on mask and vaccine mandates will immediately grant an injunction to county governments who seek to upend decisions made by governors and state legislatures to protect freedom.

Indeed, the courts are part of the problem. If the federal government declared that all employers must ban people of a certain race or creed from employment, would state governments cry to the courts? No! The governors would discover their executive powers and teach a civics lesson in Federalist #33. In that essay, written by none other than Alexander Hamilton, the chief proponent of federal power himself makes it clear that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution only applies to lawful federal powers.



""It will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land,"" wrote Hamilton in Federalist #33.

James Madison in Federalist #46 explains the recipe for how to accomplish this. Madison predicted that a federal encroachment would easily be mitigated by state action, because ""the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand."" What is the winning formula?

The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.

Indeed, this is what happened with the sanctuary movement for illegal aliens. There is no more legitimate federal power than protecting the national sovereignty from invaders, yet the states that were united behind protecting illegal aliens were able to thwart ICE at every turn. Deportations in California plummeted to a near standstill during Trump's presidency because of the success of this movement. Ultimately, local government predominates ... when it wants to.

So, if leftist local governments are capable of creating a sanctuary on behalf of illegal alien sex offenders and gang members, why can't Republicans secure a sanctuary to protect the bodily integrity of Americans?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-we-expect-from-gop-governors-and-legislators-in-this-crisis,2021-09-10
Horowitz: Why are Republicans going along with the blank check for Ukraine?,"Over the past two generations of foreign policy blunders, our government has failed to formulate an exit strategy. Now, as it relates to the endless transfer of cash and arms to the capricious Ukrainian government, we don’t even have an entry strategy. Nobody could explain in a few coherent sentences what exactly we hope to accomplish, how our sacrifice will sustain anything in the face of inveterate ethnic conflicts in eastern Ukraine, or why it’s worth exacerbating the worst supply chain crisis in our lifetime. All Republicans know is that they want to trip over themselves to outbid Biden’s virtue-signaling on the dime of American taxpayers and consumers.

We thought Republicans learned their lesson from COVID legislation not to jump on expensive, civilization-changing legislation just to be on the “right side” of the new, ephemeral “current thing,” but we were wrong. When Biden pledged his original cash payments and weapons to Ukraine’s fractured civilization, Republicans demanded that he spend even more money. We got $13.6 billion out of that deal. Then all but 10 Republicans in the House just voted for an unconditional “lend-lease” weapons transfer program. Now Biden is demanding another $33 billion in spending, $20 billion of which will be more arms. Those are Iraq/Afghanistan level numbers.

There are certain basic questions anyone should be asking at this point. Republicans should start demanding answers to the following:

Where are the money and arms going, and how are they not going toward the neo-Nazi Azov brigade that will, in the small chance they defeat the Russians, continue persecuting the ethnic Russians and fuel an intermittent conflict with Russia in perpetuity?

Why has our government, and the Biden family in particular, been so obsessed with Ukraine for years, and how do we know this money is not going to fund the very same grifting elements behind the Russia collusion story?

Don’t we first want to investigate why the same players involved in the Wuhan research have been involved with the bio-labs in Ukraine and how this funding is affecting those endeavors and the corrupt people behind them?

Ukraine is on Russia’s border, and in the eastern part of the country, Ukrainians are Russian kinsmen. Especially after the sacrifice of the past few months, Russia is not budging. There is no way arms and cash will ever deter or dissuade the Russians. All they will accomplish is to continue to fuel the macro-war and more internal ethnic bloodshed with an uncontrolled flow of weapons. Short of a full-scale allied invasion against Russia, this “middle ground” of cash and weapons will actually fuel the worst outcome. How will this not result in more needless bloodshed?

Then again, forgetting about commitment of troops, the other European countries have barely devoted a fraction of the funding that we have. If the Europeans clearly aren’t worried about this being the “Poland and Hitler moment of 1938,” then why are we barreling head-first into the next Sunni vs. Shia-equivalent dumpster fire?

All the while, the more we fuel the war rather than encourage Zelenskyy to give up what is already given up, we will make Americans (and the world) suffer with endless supply shortages. The Western oligarchs have been open about the fact that prolonging the Ukrainian conflict will help transition us away from individual freedom and our abundance of fossil fuels. Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s executive vice president responsible for energy policy, recently said that the “geopolitical imbalances” have made us realize “we have paid way too little” for food and fuel in the past 40 years.

As for the latter point, that might be an added feature to this strategy for the left, but conservative Republicans supposedly care about American taxpayers and consumers. So why are they, including Freedom Caucus members, unquestioningly joining this morass?

There is no greater ally to Ukraine than Israel, with tremendous cultural and economic ties. Israel has taken in a lot of refugees. But at the same time, the Israeli prime minister advised Zelenskyy to give in to Putin’s demands on the ethnic Russian territories and NATO membership. The Israelis understand that this cost is already sunk from years of weak NATO and U.S. policies that on the one hand poked the Russian bear relentlessly, but then weakened their own hard and soft power deterrents both on military power and energy independence – placing them at the mercy of the Kremlin’s demand.

Last Thursday, all but 10 Republicans voted for a bill (S.3522) that will allow the DOD to transfer any weapon of war aside from nuclear weapons to the tenuous Ukrainian government.

Do we even know where these weapons are landing? In a recent expose, CNN quoted a defense official who conceded, “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.""

""I couldn't tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,"" a senior defense official told reporters earlier this year regarding Mi-17 helicopters, 155 mm Howitzer cannons, Switchblade drones, and Javelin and Stinger missiles.

This after the Pentagon just admitted to leaving $7 billion in weaponry behind in Afghanistan.

So, after two decades of funding multiple sides of every Middle Eastern conflict, in which our weapons kept trading sides as quickly as Harper’s Ferry changed hands in the U.S. Civil War, we’ve learned nothing from our blunders? It’s no wonder the White House had to enlist the help of “TikTok stars” to propagate support for its Ukrainian escapade. Sadly, Republicans didn’t even need convincing.



And who are we supporting? Is the Ukrainian regime really worse than Putin? The civil rights violations are appalling. Have we even conditioned the aid to democratic reforms? Of course not.

Republicans and conservative media had a good laugh out of Biden’s horrifically incoherent, and essentially insane, statement attempting to articulate who and what we are fighting in Ukraine. However, the laugh is really on them, because their strategic thinking is just as gibberish. At least Biden can blame it on cognitive decline.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-are-republicans-going-along-with-the-blank-check-for-ukraine,2022-05-02
"Horowitz: At this point, why even have a Department of Homeland Security?","In 2004, the 9/11 Commission staff report on terrorist travel wrote that “prior to September 11, while there were efforts to enhance border security, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a tool in the counterterrorism arsenal” and that still, three years later, “border security still is not considered a cornerstone of national security policy.” Nearly two decades later, with the Department of Homeland Security now openly facilitating rather than stopping an endless invasion at our border, isn’t it time to abolish the post-9-11 experiment? After all, at this point, the DHS can only be used against political dissenters among Americans, not to deter foreign threats.



Benjamin Franklin once said, “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Well, it’s now self-evident that the only thing the DHS can be used for is to infringe upon our liberty, not to protect our safety. Earlier this week, Fox News’ Bill Melugin reported that there have been over 500,000 gotaways so far at the border. When added to last year’s estimate, it means that almost 900,000 illegal aliens have evaded detection under Biden’s presidency, in addition to the over 3 million apprehensions over the same time. In other words, since January 2021, there have been more gotaways – likely many dangerous people – than the population of San Francisco, and there have been more total illegal alien incursions than the population of Los Angeles.

The gotaways are particularly problematic because anyone who is scared to meet a border agent under this administration usually has a criminal record. And as noted before, there is strong evidence that we are undercounting the gotaways. The job of the DHS – between CBP and ICE – is to stop the invasion at the border and remove illegal aliens in the interior. Now the agencies are actively working to facilitate the invasion and disrupt any effort to remove even criminal aliens from the interior. The result? An unknown number of dangerous individuals have flowed through the border.

Just since Biden took office, the number of apprehensions of sex offenders has skyrocketed. It used to be exceedingly rare for Border Patrol officers to actually catch a convicted murderer at the border; now they are catching 60 a year.

But this is with agents tied down on babysitting duty and most criminals paying a lot of money to the cartel smugglers to successfully cross undetected. Given the new flow of criminal aliens and the cessation of removal of the existing ones, how many more criminals are now ravaging our streets during a time of record domestic crime?

A quick look at the past few years of ICE enforcement data reveals that ICE typically arrests illegal aliens who have a cumulative tally of 12,000-15,000 sex offense charges and convictions every year. That's an awful lot of sex offenders who have been deported in recent years and are likely trying to get back into the country while Biden is offering amnesty. Also, on the interior, Biden has slashed deportations. For fiscal year 2021, there were just 3,415 sexual assault charges and convictions among those targeted for removal. And clearly, given the increase at the border, it’s not because fewer sex offenders exist.

At this point, if you didn’t have a DHS, the states would be able to pick up the slack – both at the border and in the interior. We’d be better off without the feds. Now, their entire purview is centered around efficiently infiltrating the states with as many illegal aliens as possible, and they are offering more incentives to come. Last week, the Biden administration announced a pilot program to offer the invaders temporary ID cards, which will allow them to more seamlessly blend in to society as if they have some legitimate legal status. In other words, the DHS has become a conduit for the cartels and the smuggling operation, offering them free marketing just as they do for the American drug cartels, aka Pfizer.

The federal incentives to crash our border have gotten so bad than even deep-blue city mayors like D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and New York Mayor Eric Adams have complained about illegal aliens straining their city services. At this point, it’s clear that states – with their limited budgets – are much more incentivized to combat illegal immigration if we didn’t have the federal government standing in the way.

Which raises the obvious question: Why even have Homeland Security? So the TSA can violate rights and fondle people in airports while bringing in thousands of unvetted Afghans? So they can keep out tennis star Novak Djokovic for not getting the Pfizer juice while orchestrating and incentivizing an invasion at our border?

Remember, a police force is a double-edged sword. Once you no longer benefit from the security inherent in its existence, you are liable to suffer from its abuse. The DHS views political opponents as terrorists. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb said on my podcast that in a recent DHS briefing with sheriffs, the federal official made it clear that those who think the election was stolen pose the greatest threat to the homeland.



So perhaps it’s time to call the bluff of those on the left. They want to abolish ICE? Let’s do them one better and abolish the entire Department of Homeland Security.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-have-dhs,2022-07-27
Horowitz: Why John Thune’s 'plan' to fight the debt ceiling over Social Security is stupid – and will never happen,"The Biden administration has unleashed upon us, life-killing, liberty-killing, and civilization-killing issues – one after another – that must be defunded in the budget bill. These issues will kill our country and liberty right now and are all very unpopular. Instead of focusing on those issues, GOP leaders plan on fully funding the current tyrannical policies but are promising through the debt ceiling deadline next year to reopen battles over Social Security and Medicare from decades ago – issues that aren’t current, need to be dealt with more artfully, and are political losers in the GOP’s messaging. Spoiler alert: The GOP will never fight the debt ceiling anyway, but will message it just enough around cutting entitlements to destroy our candidates and their ability to fight the issues that matter.



So which policy issues are the worst for our way of life, imminently threaten our liberty, or loom as a threat to our survival as a nation? You might pick “died suddenly,” biomedical tyranny, our broken hospitals, the surveillance state, transgender grooming, arresting political opponents, government-corporate apartheid and censorship against conservatives, the border invasion, or the climate war on our food and fuel, to name a few. But one thing you would not pick to lead the year with is making changes to Social Security or Medicare. Then again, the GOP promoting gay marriage wasn’t one of those issues either.

It doesn’t mean that these programs don’t need innovation, because they certainly do. But it’s because these very same Senate GOP weasels failed to deal with them at the appropriate time over the past two decades that those proposals, in the way they were messaged then, are now over the hill. Our job at this point is to save our own lives, liberty, and culture, not to die on the “fourth rail” of American politics they helped create.

In comes Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), and he opposes using the budget to leverage against the Fourth Reich issues that are so easy to engage in brinksmanship against and is instead seeking a debt ceiling fight over entitlement spending. “There’s a set of solutions there that we really need to take on if we’re going to get serious about making these programs sustainable and getting this debt bomb at a manageable level before it’s too late,” Thune told Bloomberg editors this week in pushing his debt ceiling strategy.

Look, we all understand that entitlements cost more than the discretionary spending that will be funded through omnibus or CR bills; however, it is suicidal from a policy and political standpoint to focus on entitlements when the funding of bureaucracies is killing our culture and is hugely unpopular. Which would you rather engage in a budget/debt brinksmanship fight over: funding transgenderism and clot-shot mandates in the military and the IRS arresting political opponents or a plan that will be easily messaged as cutting Social Security? Tampering with entitlements or funding of child castration?

Yet when it comes to the budget bill, Thune is advocating that Republicans give Democrats a full year’s worth of funding all the aforementioned policies through the FBI, CDC, and IRS for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. “It's going to take a while obviously for them to get organized, and usually when it comes to these things, my past experience is it's very hard, usually it gets pushed into the middle of the year, and then pretty soon you're at the end of the fiscal year and you're still operating on a CR,” Thune said Monday. “So I think one way or the other it's probably in everybody's best interest to try to resolve this for a year — whether that's an omni spending bill or a full-year CR.""

Thus Thune, along with the other GOP leaders in both the House and Senate, including “hope yes, vote no” Kevin McCarthy, have no problem giving up our leverage on the most important issues of our time for the remainder of the year. But somehow, they are going to have a debt ceiling fight with the allegation of causing a default on our credit over cutting Social Security?

Let’s cut the suspense here: People like Thune will never be fiscally conservative and fight on a debt ceiling for anything. How do we know? Because Thune has constantly voted to raise or suspend the debt ceiling in return for nothing, including when Republicans controlled all three branches. When Trump was president, Thune voted for a massive debt ceiling increase bill that also canceled the only budget caps put into place in decades. These are the same people who passionately promoted COVID lockdown bills that spent more money than anything in our history. We are to believe that suddenly they are committed to cutting the most politically popular programs?



Indeed, they are only using the debt ceiling of next year as a squirrel for us to chase while they screw us on the current issues during the lame-duck session, including the budget bill. So we will never benefit from their feigned fight over the debt ceiling with true budget cuts, but only suffer the political liability of allowing Democrats to distract from their fascism and funding of the fascist bureaucracy by blaming us for cutting Social Security. Once again, we must ask, how would a controlled opposition act any differently?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-john-thunes-plan-to-fight-the-debt-ceiling-over-social-security-is-stupid-and-will-never-happen,2022-12-02
"Horowitz: With record food prices, time to repeal the ethanol mandate now","One could not have thought of a more irrational idea than taking 40% of the corn grown in this country and shoving it into our engines, thereby raising the cost of both fuel production and food. Corn is the beginning of the food chain, and with the worst crisis of food and fuel pricing ever, why on earth would Congress not immediately repeal the renewable fuels standard?

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was a Bush-era boondoggle passed by Congress in 2005 to force consumers to buy only transportation fuel blended mostly with corn-based biofuels. The original RFS required 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be blended by 2006, but that target was expanded to 36 billion in the 2007 energy bill. Despite years of subsidies, mandates, and tax credits, the industry has failed on the promise of energy independence and a cleaner environment and has left us with higher food and fuel costs.

In fact, the RFS annual targets were never met, so the EPA created a costly RIN (renewable identification number) credit system forcing independent refiners to essentially pay ransom for these credits for not meeting the target. Big oil companies then make a killing off the speculation market of those credits, while independent refiners go out of business. As such, we never achieved more than 20 billion gallons of renewable fuels in any year, but we did cause numerous small oil refiners to go out of business, deplete fuel output supply, and destroy blue-collar jobs.

Almost all the biofuels are created from corn, soybeans, and sugar – with corn taking up the lion’s share of the market. Venture socialist market distortions induced by the government caused so much farmland to be requisitioned for this ineffectual fuel and diverted from cattle feed, thereby driving up the cost of food. According to a study cited by the Heartland Institute, families are forced to pay $2,055 more for food every year because 40% of the corn crop – the antecedent of the food chain – is used for fuel. A study from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2012 – when ethanol production was just 14.5 billion gallons per year – found that restaurants pay $18,000 more per year.

The lower fuel mileage from adulterated fuel with less energy content and the billions in extra costs to the restaurant industry because of the higher cost of beef, thanks to scarcity of cattle feed, were harmfel effects of the policy from day one, but are downright devastating during this inflation crisis. According to Robert Bryce of the Manhattan Institute, ethanol is proportionally 2.4 times less efficient than unblended gasoline. Thus, we are adulterating the black gold that has become gasoline to ensure we need even more of it at a higher price!

In other words, if we’d flush that corn down the toilet, we’d be better off than with the RFS in place. However, what’s even better is using the abundant corn we have to flood the domestic and global corn market, thereby alleviating the pressure on chicken and beef prices. Wheat prices have already set a new record, and corn prices are close to an all-time record, up 25% just since the beginning of the year. Ukraine is responsible for 16% of the world’s corn exports, and it supplies the EU with 60% of its corn. It is time to get the corn out of our engines and into our food and cattle feed supply.

Ethanol is not the only way we waste our food supply. For years, our government has de facto paid farmers not to grow crops by enrolling up to 25 million acres annually in the Conservation Reserve Program. The program has incentivized wealthy land owners to buy up land from real farmers to keep it dormant in order to save the planet from the weather! Trump promised to cut $9 billion in the phony conservation program, but the 2019 farm bill he signed expanded the number of acres under the program rather than cutting it. The program does nothing but enrich wealthy land owners and further inflate the cost of land, just like any subsidized asset bubble, all the while reducing the supply of crops. The omnibus bill Congress is passing this week increases funding for this counterproductive program across the board.

God has blessed America with an abundance of food and energy, not only to sustain our people but enough to support much of the world. Yet the same way woke energy policy, rooted in pseudo-science, inducing poverty, and growing oligarchic power have impeded our energy production, likewise, woke agricultural policies have limited our food supply. And obviously, an attack on our energy supply is going to further exacerbate the pressure on food prices, which rely heavily on all forms of transportation.



But while our government is finding every way it can continue to make Americans feel the pain of rising costs for food and fuel, guess who is working on buying up the food supply for their people? The Chinese, of course. Bloomberg is reporting that China is buying up U.S. soybeans and corn: “Chinese buyers recently booked about 20 cargoes of American soybeans and about 10 shipments of corn, according to traders who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The buying spree reflects robust demand in the top importer as worries over supplies grow following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and weaker-than-expected supply from Brazil, the world’s biggest soybean producer.”

This is reminiscent of China buying up the meat during the supply chain shortage induced by the 2020 lockdowns. China always plans ahead to boost its people, while our government seeks to inflict pain on its people.

What Pelosi's Taiwan Visit Means for American Grand Strategy,"At just after 10:40 p.m. local time, on Tuesday night, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi landed at Taipei’s Songshan Airport.

Pelosi’s touchdown marked the highest level American visit to the Island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997. Though many comparisons can certainly be made, much has changed surrounding the geopolitical circumstances in East Asia.

Gingrich’s visit came just over a year after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, so to say the political environment at the time was tranquil would no doubt be an overstatement. However, when compared to current circumstances one would have to say the stakes of the Pelosi visit are markedly higher.

One notable reason for this is the increased strength of Beijing over the preceding 25 years. In 1997, China’s GDP was $961B, it’s now nearly $15T. Its military spending was $15.7B, today it’s more than $250B. In 1997, China possessed zero aircraft carriers, and today, it fields two combat-ready carriers with a third on the way.

Perhaps more telling of the changing landscape is Chinese rhetoric. In the late 1990s, China was still operating from former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum, “Hide one’s capabilities, and bide one’s time” (tao guang yang hui). Deng’s belief essentially advocated for China to hide in the background while it amassed power, and only when the level of power was sufficient should Beijing look to take a leadership role.

Well, under Xi Jinping that time has arrived, at least as far as the current leadership in Beijing is concerned. According to internal documents, China seeks regional and then global domination, and it sees the US as the biggest hurdle in its way. However, it doesn’t take access to classified documents to understand China’s intentions. Its leaders and diplomats are more than comfortable with being publicly aggressive and antagonistic towards the US.

And, on top of the rhetoric, China continues to try to expand its influence abroad via Xi’s keystone policy: the Belt and Road Initiative--which promises infrastructure and economic growth in developing economies, but more often results in high-interest debts that recipient countries can’t pay back. This means that China is able to take over projects and land in these countries, as it did in Sri Lanka when it was granted a 99-year lease on the Port of Hambantota after Colombo defaulted on its payments.

In short, America is dealing with a much stronger, more ambitious, and increasingly more aggressive China than it was in 1997.

Given the circumstances then, what does Pelosi’s visit signal regarding America’s overall strategy? Why would she choose now to go, and what will change now that her trip has concluded?

The skeptic would say that Pelosi’s trip was born out of her own political calculation. Her party is floundering, and her position as Speaker will almost certainly come to an end in November, so it wouldn’t be particularly out of the realm of likelihood that she saw a trip to Taiwan as a chance to lionize herself. In fact, these considerations are almost certainly at the forefront of Pelosi’s motivation.

This becomes even more likely when one considers that President Biden was initially not too fond of the idea. Given his atrocious approval rating, it definitely doesn’t hurt Pelosi to move against his wishes.

Anyway, answering this question would require getting inside Pelosi’s head, and that seems like it might be a confusing place to wind up. But the fact remains, she did make the trip, and regardless of her individual intent, it does signal to both our allies and enemies in the region.

Since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Washington has practiced strategic ambiguity. While it refuses to commit to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, it also has left that option in play. The goal, of course, is to deter Beijing while also discouraging Taipei from formally declaring independence, which would almost certainly trigger immediate retaliation from China and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

While Biden’s national security spokesman John Kirby insisted that Pelosi’s trip was actually upholding the status quo, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in Zhongnanhai that agrees. And the evidence in this case, as exemplified by the trip itself, leans in the direction of Beijing’s interpretation.

Pelosi’s trip included meetings with the foreign ministry, leaders in the semiconductor industry, and a press conference with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.

The joint press conference was filled with political speak regarding economic exchange and budding relationships, very par-for-the-course type of stuff. But in her opening remarks, Pelosi did, perhaps subconsciously, point out the contradiction in America’s Taiwan policy.

""Let's just put it in perspective. Four decades ago, the Taiwan Relations Act was built–in building a strong bond between our two countries: advancing our shared interests of governance, economy, and security, while respecting the ""One China"" policy. Our solidarity with you is more important than ever, as you defend Taiwan and their freedom.”

Well, which is it? Does America support the ""One China"" policy or Taiwan’s right to self-determination? Because those positions are increasingly mutually exclusive.

When Pelosi notes that American solidarity with Taiwan is more important than ever, she’s absolutely correct. But substantively, what is America doing to address this need?

For all the reasons this article has addressed already, coupled with CCP’s long-held belief that China’s rejuvenation will only be complete after the absorption of Taiwan, it’s imperative that the US change its strategy vis-a-vis Taiwan and East Asia in general.

As Elbridge Colby points out in his newest book, America’s top foreign policy goal should be preventing another state from gaining regional hegemony, most chiefly China in Asia. This is due to a combination of China’s power in comparison to other potential regional threats like Russia, as well as Asia’s overall importance. For instance, when it comes to global GDP, Asia’s share trumps that of Europe’s, and the gap is only growing.

In short, Colby’s well-substantiated claim is that once China achieves hegemony in Asia, it will have the ability to drastically manipulate the American way of life and potentially seek to project its domain across other regions.

While China is busy in a multitude of theaters in its attempt to achieve hegemony, the most important and crucial prize in Beijing’s eyes is Taiwan. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan, while not sufficient, is absolutely necessary to achieve this goal. Therefore, it’s imperative that America prevent this from happening.

While Speaker Pelosi’s trip is undoubtedly symbolic, it does nothing to actually address the systemic problems that are developing in the region.

What is required of Washington to protect Taiwan and deny China’s bid for hegemony goes far beyond official visits and political posturing. It requires concrete change in the way America conducts foreign policy.

Understanding then, that Asia is the most important theater in the world, it would behoove decision makers in Washington to make choices that reflect this reality. However, instead of consolidating more resources in the Pacific, the US is increasing its commitments to Ukraine and Europe.

At a June NATO summit in Madrid, Biden committed to the Ukraine effort for “as long as it takes,” and on Tuesday, John Kirby announced the US would send an additional $550 million in military aid to Kyiv. This brings the figure to more than $8 billion in total aid since Russia launched its invasion. The US has also increased its troop deployment in Europe to 100,000, up from 80,000 pre-invasion.

As admirable as the Ukrainians are and as noble as it might be to want to support their cause indefinitely, the truth is that these moves are counterproductive. They pull resources and focus that should be concentrated in Asia.

By effectively concentrating military resources in Asia, the US will signal to China that it is committed to the region and denying Beijing’s ambitions. In the same breath, Washington should also change its Taiwan policy, and officially discard any adherence to the ""One China"" policy.

Strategic ambiguity served a purpose for much of the Cold War era, and it was even understandable in the 1990s when there was at least a hope that China would reform and Westernize. However, with the Soviet threat long gone and the theory of a liberal China thoroughly dispelled, the ""One China"" policy serves no purpose. It merely handicaps potential cooperation between Taipei and Washington.

A continuing insistence on refusing to commit to the Asian theater, and the perpetuation of word games to appease Beijing will only lead to confusion and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait and all of East Asia. This confusion will not reduce, but significantly increase the likelihood of conflict with an increasingly emboldened China.

America should take a note from China and develop a grand strategy focused on broad horizons, not merely political considerations of the day. The first step in doing so is realizing that Asia, and not Europe, will dominate the 21st century and China is the main threat to the order America has sacrificed so much to build.

By accepting this premise, one can’t reasonably argue defending Taiwan isn’t of paramount concern to the American people.

While Pelosi’s trip in itself doesn’t solve or even address these issues in a meaningful way, it does provide the opportunity for the US to seriously consider what its relationship with Taiwan should be and what its overall strategy should look like.

China has certainly taken note of the visit and responded in bombastic fashion.

Shortly after Pelosi departed Taipei en route to Seoul, China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, tweeted, “The US is the provocateur, and China is the victim. The US side colluded with Taiwan and made provocations first, whereas China has been compelled to act in self-defense.”

And, the spokesman for the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, exclaimed that Tsai and her ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) were “pushing the island into the abyss of disaster.”

The Chinese response hasn’t just been talk, either. According to the South China Morning Post, China announced starting Thursday it would begin live-fire drills in seven locations surrounding Taiwan’s coastline, effectively blockading the island.

Pelosi’s visit provides much-needed momentum and reflection for policymakers in Washington, and it mustn’t be squandered. There are only so many more opportunities for America to come to terms with its geopolitical reality. China already has, and the clock is ticking.

Horowitz: Border state officials dealing with violent incursions deep into US territory,"What would you call a situation where tens of thousands of young males pour over our border, orchestrated by the most violent cartels and smugglers in the world? How would you refer to high-speed car chases and bailouts across our border continuing on for at least 200 miles beyond the border? It sure looks like an invasion to ordinary Americans. But what do you call it when our own Department of Homeland Security is orchestrating such chaos, lawlessness, and trans-national travel during a pandemic at the same time officials are entreating Americans to obey COVID fascism? A sadistic undermining of the very foundation of this country, indeed.

""Illegal immigrants from 59 different countries have crossed the border illegally in our area – the Del Rio Sector,"" warned Uvalde, Texas, Mayor Don McLaughlin in an exclusive interview with TheBlaze. ""These illegal immigrants are from China, South America, Venezuela, Cuba, and the Middle East and Africa, just to name a few.""

Uvalde is a small town of 17,000 inhabitants, and it is now overrun by illegal immigrants and an international cartel smuggling operation. Uvalde is 40-60 miles from the border, but it might as well be right at the border given how the smuggling corridors come right up to this town.

""In our city and county, we are averaging 6-8 car chases a week,"" said McLaughlin in describing how the border crisis strains the area's small law enforcement operation, which is already stressed from the logistics of the pandemic and the recent weather-driven energy crisis.

""These human smugglers have no regard from human life – they have led our officers on chases through our town at speeds exceeding 100 mph. In two instances, our local law enforcement officers have been shot at. It's not unusual to find weapons in these cars when they are caught. In Kinney County, which borders us, the chases are exceeding 20 a week. In these chases they are finding illegal immigrants that have previously been deported and have criminal records for sexual assault, murder, and drug trafficking.""

The Biden administration has ended Trump's pandemic response policy, which, pursuant to Title 42, required Customs and Border Protection to immediately turn away illegal aliens who show up at the border. The new policy openly invites illegal aliens to come in, which has created an entire cottage industry for the smugglers and the drug cartels. While the smugglers can present illegal aliens who don't have criminal records openly at the border, they still have to sneak in those with criminal records through gaps in the border wall, which leads to dangerous high-speed chases that result in what are known to border officials as ""bailouts."" Often the smuggler will drive off the road and crash, with the occupants bailing out and running in every direction.

The more agents have to deal with those coming in directly, the less manpower they have to apprehend the dangerous ""runners"" who usually have criminal records. This is particularly a problem during the pandemic, when more personnel are now required to deal with the social distancing logistics of the mass flow across the border.

The fact that the border wall was stopped midway through construction has actually been a boon to the smugglers, because they are able to use the newly created access roads to gain entry into the interior but are not completely blocked because of the gaps, as reported by the Washington Times from Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels. This has enabled the high-speed chases and bailouts to penetrate deep into Texas, as far as Jackson County on the eastern coast, which is some 200 miles from the border.

""We're on the travel corridor,"" said Jackson County Sheriff A.J. Louderback in an interview with TheBlaze. ""We've had an uptick in stolen three-ton pickups; we're having the bailouts coming through.""

Louderback placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of the Biden administration. ""This is a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy to disable and dismantle every facet of our immigration system,"" said the veteran rural sheriff. ""This is a concerted effort to alter all of immigration laws through policy change. It's an absolute nightmare. I don't think there is a single place in the INA that has not been violated. It's obvious to me that they've been working on this for quite some time. We went from a secure border to an unsecure border in a matter of days.""

Sheriff Dannels told me that in southeast Arizona, in some of the most rugged terrain at the border, the cartels now have roads they can use to navigate an area that was previously extremely hard to traverse. ""By ending the wall construction with the roads exposed, they have become nothing but cartel roads,"" said Dannels to me. Here is a picture of the access roads built behind the wall in Cochise County.

Cochise County Sheriff's Department

According to Dannels, apprehensions in his remote county went from 300-500 a year ago to 2,500 in December. The suspension of the border wall mid-construction in his county has been a boon for the cartels. ""We went 24 months without illicit drugs, and now we're catching more than 500 pounds,"" said Sheriff Dannels. ""12 people were injured in car crashes, and there have been two deaths. Some of the coyotes [human smugglers] are now shooting at my deputies. It's insane how nobody sat down with local law enforcement to discuss the ramifications of not completing the construction that was already under way.""



The bailouts are often risky for the migrants as well. In California earlier this week, 13 of them were killed when their car caught fire during a high-speed incursion at a breach in the border fence, which the Biden administration refuses to repair.

Mark Lamb, sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, is seeing the same problem on the western side of the border. ""We're 60 miles off the border, and we've had 45 pursuits and have assisted in another 80 with other agencies,"" the Arizona sheriff told TheBlaze. ""We had one bailout where they had 11 people who bailed into the desert and left us with a 16-year-old Guatemalan girl in the car. ICE doesn't even have space for these people, and they are let go right into our communities. Talk about a kick in the teeth. When you do this, it sends a message to criminals that they can do whatever they want because we are no longer for the rule of law.""

Not only is Lamb prohibited from holding these people, he wouldn't even have the jail space anyway. ""We get 20-30 a day right now. I could fill my entire jail within a week.""

The cartels are sending 2,000 children over the border each week this month, and there are now at least 8,000 minors in custody, approaching a record. The Biden administration is openly bragging about estimates of 117,000 minors on the way. With that comes a massive pipeline of transnational gang recruitments inside our country and in every major city.



It's a lose-lose for everyone. Americans are stuck with the expenses and social effects, as well as the narcotics and increased gang activity. At a time when the lockdowns are tempting so many Americans to turn to drugs, the Biden border invitation is creating a lucrative market for the drug cartels in human smuggling as well as drug smuggling. And in the irony of all ironies, the COVID lockdown policies that are inducing the circuitous drug cycle exacerbated by the border policies are suddenly being relaxed when it comes to illegal aliens.

As for the illegal aliens themselves, Mayor McLaughlin observes that there is nothing humanitarian about chaotic open borders.

""We as a country act as though we are helping these illegal immigrants as we release them into our country. We talk about slave labor and sex trafficking all the time, but these illegal immigrants end up working day jobs where they are picked up in neighborhood street corners where they stand around waiting for work, are paid subpar wages, and if hurt, are dropped off back without getting taken care of. The women are forced into the sex trade to survive and take care of their families. We are not helping these people or our country. We are only setting them up to fail.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitzhorowitz-border-state-officials-dealing-with-violent-incursions-deep-into-us-territory-border-state-officials-dealing-with-violent-incursions-deep-into-us-territory,2021-03-05
Roth: Blame the government for our woes,"Every major problem we are facing today is not because of war, but because of the arrogance, ignorance, and incompetence of government central planners and their cronies.

The elites pushing their agendas and their cronies’ pet projects, whether through short-sightedness or nefarious intentions, have delivered an obvious negative outcome for America.

Our economic woes started long before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. And while Putin deserves the blame for war, our government central planners get the full credit for our economic and national security vulnerabilities.

The highest inflation in the last 40 years was recorded before eastern Europe even entered the conversation. This came on the back of central planning decisions, while those central planners feigned ignorance as to the outcome. The Federal Reserve printing trillions of dollars and the trillions more of government “relief spending,” increased further with Biden’s “American Rescue Plan,” were enough to drive substantial inflation. Add to that the decisions that turned off large swaths of the economy over the past couple of years and structurally kept workers out of the labor force, which also disrupted the supply chains and labor markets to increase the inflationary pressures.

Then, include the Biden administration’s suspending oil and gas leases, withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and the crony corporate kowtowing to the elite push for ESG reducing oil- and gas-related investment; these actions all impacted rising gas prices before Putin’s madness came into play.

Once Russia invaded Ukraine, these existing vulnerabilities became bigger weaknesses, something that should have been obvious to the average American, let alone those in government “leadership” positions.

Not expanding the United States' capacity as a producer of oil and gas resources was both a farce and an obvious national security issue. It didn’t decrease the demand for those resources (although the pandemic reactions did temporarily); what it did was shift some percent of the production from the U.S., which has the technology, capabilities, and incentives to produce more cleanly, to nations run by terrorists, tyrants, human rights abusers, and other generally bad people. These regimes and countries share the same planet, yet do not produce as cleanly as the U.S. could.

That’s quite a “green” strategy — both from an economic “green” and an environmental “green” standpoint.

These decisions have reverberations globally, creating vulnerabilities for our allies in Europe, who also reduced their own nuclear and oil and gas energy production, exposing them to geopolitical strife.

So, while we could have been fortifying U.S. production so that one or more foreign bad actors wouldn’t be able to leverage that against us, our government and corporate cronies couldn’t see (or didn’t care) what was flashing in front of them like a giant neon sign and ultimately did nothing on that front.

These actions will only worsen the already fragile U.S. economic situation caused by their other policy decisions.

The average American ends up paying the price, both figuratively and quite literally.

It’s not just oil and gas. The past two years exposed the weakness of depending on China for key inputs and products. The Russian invasion is highlighting other dependencies, ranging from nickel (which is a key component in the batteries used to make electric vehicles, among many other things), aluminum, wheat, fertilizers, and many other products that are key to a smooth functioning economy and everyday living, and some that could even lead to bigger crises, like food shortages in parts of the world.

Instead of strengthening America, both for economic security and national security, the central planning government leaders have been actively making us more vulnerable, taking policy direction from people who range from activist-sponsored teenagers to global entities that would be thrilled with the destruction of the American economy and way of life.

There will always be some bad actor around the corner, and we must be prepared. It’s far past the time to reverse these bad government policy actions and focus on a stronger America and better strategic decision-making.

If we don’t hold government accountable and enact change, then we will only have ourselves to blame.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-blame-the-government-for-our-woes,2022-03-09
Roth: Can the Federal Reserve fix inflation?,"Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation was already being measured at the highest levels in four decades, an outgrowth of overzealous and incompetent monetary and fiscal policy, as well as other nonsensical government policy decisions. The Russian invasion has exacerbated an already bad situation, with the CPI (Consumer Price Index) measure of inflation (one that arguably understates considerably the level of cost increases borne by families) coming in at 8.5% for March.

The Federal Reserve — the same group that didn’t see inflation coming, told us it was transitory, didn’t anticipate the disruptions in the labor market and supply chain, and was enacting accommodative policy by buying securities up until last month — now believes that it can save the economy with monetary policy tools.

As foolish as it is to think that those who created the problems and then didn’t see the outcomes on the horizon will suddenly be economic saviors, it is more foolish to think that their tools could possibly fix what is broken.

Tools that the Federal Reserve uses to enact its monetary policy include changing the target Fed funds rate and buying or selling securities to expand or contract its balance sheet. Lowering the target Fed funds rate and buying securities are expansionary policies meant to lower interest rates, increasing demand for credit and ultimately “juicing” the economy. Increasing the target Fed funds rate and selling securities are contractionary policies meant to slow down the economy.

With inflation continuing to rise, the Federal Reserve has begun to tighten its policy, enacting its first rate hike and signaling it will be contracting its balance sheet, with many current and former Fed members telegraphing the need to do more.

Sure, an increasing interest rate environment can quell some demand-related components of the economy, but how does it fix the supply imbalances that were made worse by reckless policy? The last set of data showed that there are around 1.8 jobs available for every job seeker, keeping wage pressure high. How does monetary policy fix that at all, let alone without tanking the economy? Perhaps it creates such a high cost of living and dents 401ks and pensions in a manner that forces people back into the workforce? Or, it puts even more small businesses out of business, taking away some available jobs? None of those sound like palatable outcomes.

On the housing front, increasing mortgage rates will make housing even more unaffordable than it already was for first-time homebuyers. But with housing undersupplied in the realm of 4 million to 5-plus million homes, and with corporate buyers flush with capital buying housing with all-cash offers, will that really cool off housing enough without creating a slew of other issues on the housing front?

And the underinvestment in energy and health care infrastructure that will continue to show a supply-side imbalance well into this decade isn’t going to be solved long-term with monetary policy.

How does this abrupt policy not tank the economy or the market? In a recent opinion piece in Bloomberg, former FOMC vice chair and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Bill Dudley said, “It’s hard to know how much the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to do to get inflation under control. But one thing is certain: To be effective, it’ll have to inflict more losses on stock and bond investors than it has so far.” His sentiment, along with comments made by current Fed members, doesn’t generate a lot of confidence in the Fed or warm and fuzzy feelings about the market and the economy.

It's unlikely that the Fed, which created this problem, is now going to solve it elegantly. Be prepared to weather the storm, whether that be stagflation (a stagnating economy with high inflation), a recession, or stagflation that goes into the recession.

The Fed and the government have caused this predicament that we are all paying for. We need to stop allowing these damaging policies to continue, because if and when we recover, they won’t have learned a thing.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-can-the-federal-reserve-fix-inflation,2022-04-12
"Roth: DEBUNKED and EXPLAINED: No, greedy oil companies are not to blame for gas prices","U.S. gas prices hit an average of $5 per gallon for the first time last week, according to AAA. Americans are having to spend more of their hard-earned money on energy. But who is really to blame?



It is probably helpful to start with a breakdown of the components of the price of gas.

The cost of crude oil is the biggest cost component of a gallon of gas and can skew the cost. In January, via the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the cost of crude was just over half the cost of gasoline, at 52%. In February it was 61%, and as of March 2022, it was 59% of the total cost of a gallon of “regular” gasoline (diesel varies slightly). Given its overall weighting to cost, changes to crude oil prices have an outsized impact on final gas prices.

The remaining major cost areas include refining, marketing and distribution, and taxes. As of March 2022, refining was about 18% of the total costs, distribution and marketing about 12%, and taxes (federal, state, and local) about 12%, depending on your location.

It is worth noting that gas stations make very little, and they don’t reap windfalls when prices go up. Most gas stations are independently operated, even those that bear a brand associated with a major oil company. It is estimated that a retailer’s markup on a gallon of gas is around 15 cents, and the profit after expenses averages around 2 cents per gallon. Because of this low take, most gas stations supplement their business with selling a variety of other things, from cigarettes to beverages.

The cost of crude

The cost of crude oil is set by factors of supply and demand. Supply/demand imbalances can lead to major swings in the price of oil, as we have seen recently. Of course, there is also a major oil cartel that decides how much to produce at given times, which factors heavily into supply.



On the demand side, the world has seen massive shifts because of decisions made around the world related to the pandemic and the changes in behaviors that brought about. As people were locked down, demand plummeted, and as people emerged from lockdowns, demand increased. When China fully emerges from another series of lockdowns, as the number-one importer of oil in the world, it will add demand to the worldwide market.

In 2021, the U.S. used almost 20 million barrels per day; worldwide, around 100 million barrels per day were used. You can see why President Biden’s PR stunts of releasing a small amount of inventory from the U.S. strategic reserves wasn’t going to have a meaningful, lasting impact on pricing.

On the supply side, in addition to the whims of OPEC+ regarding production, a variety of domestic and international factors impact oil production. The push for green energy has thwarted the progress that the U.S. was making in energy independence and increasing supply. The Biden administration canceling oil and gas leases, shutting down pipeline progress, and having substantial red tape for drilling and production all factor into the market calculations on what supply will be like today and going forward.

Additionally, the demonization of this critical industry, including the push of ESG initiatives to direct capital away from traditional energy projects, has led to substantial under-investment in the sector, which also materially impacts the supply side of the equation. It is estimated that as much as a trillion dollars in investment has been postponed or canceled over the past few years, with a large part of that related to the ESG and green energy pushes.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, looking at the U.S. field production of crude oil, while the U.S. was producing almost 13 million barrels per day of crude oil before the pandemic, we are now only at 11.655 million barrels per day (as of March 2022).

Europe has largely done the same and is paying the price, quite literally, for it. The Russian invasion of Ukraine took already increasing prices and added a new supply constraint on them, to some extent. The EU is still buying, and with the higher prices Putin is on track to make more money on oil and gas exports this year than last year!

Of course, if the U.S. and Europe had been leaning into more traditional sources of energy (along with expanding their green initiatives instead of trying to substitute the latter ahead of time), the supply would be closer to parity with demand than it is today, even with the invasion.

There is also a monetary policy component to this. If the Federal Reserve had been managing interest rates appropriately and not printing trillions of dollars, we wouldn’t be seeing inflation in everything, including oil and gas, at the same levels as they are at today.

Refining

People tend to forget about some of the other costs of gasoline. Refining is the process that turns the crude oil into not only gasoline but a variety of other products and components for products. These costs depend on the time of year and geography, based on laws that require different blends for different times of year and the associated climates. Input costs of items that may also be refined with the gasoline can also impact this cost (think ethanol). The supply-constrained labor market also makes wages more expensive throughout the organizations that do the refining.

Distribution and marketing

Oil needs to get from its location to the refinery. Once the oil is processed into gasoline, it doesn’t magically appear at the gas stations, either. All of the distribution related to eventually getting gas to you is intricate and expensive. Given that energy is required to transport the oil and gas, increasing energy costs end up being a double whammy for you at the pump. Again, the labor market is also making wages in distribution more expensive. The American Petroleum Institute (“API”) says on the marketing side, “Marketing costs are incurred to support the sale of gasoline by the refineries, distributors and wholesalers and the retailer.”

Taxes

API estimates that on average, 57 cents per gallon of gasoline goes to taxes. The federal tax is constant at 18.4 cents per gallon. State and local taxes vary widely. The high is California at 68 cents, and the low is Alaska at 15 cents, with the state average around 39 cents.

At least this is better than in Europe. Accounting firm UHY says that “on average taxes comprise 59% of the cost of the price of petrol and 52% of the cost of the price of diesel.” This high taxation is meant in part to discourage the use of such fuels.

Are the oil companies and greed to blame?

Oil companies work to supply you with gasoline, as well as other petroleum byproducts, regardless of the broader economic situation.

As noted, the biggest component price in gasoline is set by the market, with a thumb on the scale from OPEC+. With several U.S. companies delivering gas products, if one company wanted to charge even more for its products, other companies could take market share by setting a better price. Obviously, the constraint of supply factors in here as well.

During the sharp reduction in demand during the pandemic, major oil companies took huge losses. The five biggest companies (aka “Big Oil”) lost a combined $76 billion. But if you needed gas, they were still there for you. Furthermore, nobody offered to pay more to help them out.

Now that demand has increased far ahead of supply, the market has driven crude prices up, which has given them more revenue and, as that works, more profit.

In a June 10 tweet, Fox Business host Charles Payne said, “In 2020 Exxon lost $22.4 billion; federal government made $25.8 billion on gas taxes,” and pointed out the federal government is likely making much more today.

While people like to look for a scapegoat, price gouging isn’t what we are seeing today.

While it is easy to focus on gas prices because you see them every day, the supply/demand imbalance in the availability vs. need for traditional energy sources shows up elsewhere. It flows (no pun intended) through the entire economy, from the cost of moving goods and components for services to their destinations to a myriad of byproducts, including those impacting the availability and cost of food.

Some may say that price controls are the answer. They are never the answer. They lead to hoarding and less supply and never have the intended outcome.

You may hear that we should nationalize the oil companies. One only needs to look to Venezuela, which used to be the fourth wealthiest country in the world before nationalizing its oil. Now its citizens have a median net worth of zero.

The reality is we need energy. We needs lots of it. We need more of it. All kinds of energy. While new, “greener” sources of energy are being developed and scaled, we should, side by side, be investing in more traditional sources of energy as well, including nuclear energy.

President Biden could change all of our fortunes today and for the future by changing his energy policy. Signal to the markets that more investment will be going to traditional energy, alongside green initiatives. Clear the red tape and reinstitute drilling, leasing, and pipelines.

While we can’t turn on a tap overnight, those kinds of policies would start to show relief at the pump today, but even more importantly, secure our future, financially and in national security.

Roth: SOTU 2022 preview: The state of the union is a mess; here’s how Biden is likely to spin it,"The state of the union is a mess. Inflation is running at a 40-year high, with the prices of everything from energy to food to housing making the cost of American living much higher. Broken supply chains aren’t helping inflation or the ability to get goods and services, and we have substantial dislocation in the labor market. And if that wasn’t enough, many jurisdictions are just starting to dial back onerous COVID-related policies that have trampled on individual rights, with a backdrop of a treacherous geopolitical landscape.

But none of that will stop the president from trying to put a rosy spin on what is going on in America and selling his “accomplishments,” no matter how removed from reality they may be, during Tuesday night’s State of the Union address to Congress and the American people.

Here’s what you are likely in for:

Severe economic gaslighting

As noted above, the economy is in disarray. The administration knows that and will do everything possible to ensure President Biden touts half-truths and statistical spin as reality. Biden will likely talk about the supposed record job creation under his administration. This is a wild claim, given that there have been no new jobs created since the pre-pandemic February 2020 levels; there has been merely the reclaiming of some, though not all, of the jobs lost directly as a result of the government at various levels closing businesses and then re-opening them.

Biden will also likely address low unemployment, due again in part to the low starting point in February 2020 and the large number of individuals who have permanently left the workforce since then, in large part due to government policies.

While he won’t talk about his administration’s role in stoking inflation, from the very unnecessary $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” to canceling oil and gas leases and the Keystone XL pipeline, Biden may trot out wage increases as a highlight, of course failing to mention that these inflationary increases have also not kept pace with inflation overall and that every dollar today buys you substantially less than it did before he took office.

As many Americans haven’t filed their taxes yet and may still not realize that the child tax credit payment they received was in large part an advance, not a gift, he will also likely shout out that policy, again not talking about its role in inflation.

The wild card is the stock market. Knowing that it was a favorite measure of President Trump, Biden may mention that the broader stock market, although currently off its highs, is up since he has taken office, with the S&P 500 hitting 68 record highs during his first year in office and in aggregate, up around 12% since his Inauguration Day. While that’s largely the result of Fed intervention in the market instead of policy and facing challenges from both inflation and a potentially slowing economy, Biden may still try to grab credit here.

Green energy cheerleading

Just a couple of short years ago, the U.S. was energy independent and the leading producer of petroleum and natural gas in the world. Among Biden’s first actions in office was suspending oil and gas leases and withdrawing the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.

This has created economic instability and national security implications for the U.S. and its allies, particularly given that the European Union reportedly gets 40% of its gas imports from Russia, a number that is expected to increase. It also is counter to “green” initiatives, as it shifts energy production from the U.S., which has the technology and desire to produce more cleanly, to countries that don’t.

However, Biden will likely spin the Russian invasion of the Ukraine as some sort of “proof” on why we need more green energy and why his decisions show green leadership, despite the underlying realities.

He will also likely try to talk about how tough he has been on Russia with sanctions that widely have been criticized as weak.

Taking credit for vaccines and virus cycles

Both President Biden and Vice President Harris during the 2020 election cycle expressed doubts about any vaccine brought to market under Trump. At the State of the Union, we will likely hear Biden shift to taking credit for the vaccines brought about under Operation Warp Speed.

Despite admissions by many politicians and experts that COVID is likely to be endemic and the Biden administration did very little, if anything, to help the situation, as well as more COVID deaths recorded under Biden than prior to him taking office, the president will most likely take credit for safely navigating the country through the pandemic.

For extra pandering, Biden may have some front-line workers in attendance for their heroics during the pandemic, despite the fact that his administration fired any of these heroes who weren’t vaccinated.

Those are likely to be some of the key “highlights” of the president’s speech. It will likely be written to tug on emotions, as there’s only so much he can do to spin the facts and truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-sotu-2022-preview-the-state-of-the-union-is-a-mess-heres-how-biden-is-likely-to-spin-it,2022-02-28
Roth: We are in a reality emergency,"We are having a climate emergency. I am sure it’s true because important people have said so. These are the same people who have been wrong about everything of late: solving crime, COVID, printing money, and energy transitions, to name a few. They have pushed a half-century’s worth of climate predictions — all of which I have managed to live through — from acid rain to Manhattan being underwater by 2015. They also travel around on private jets and yachts when they are not living in their massive waterfront properties, because they are the safest places to live in an emergency, obviously.



Yes, I am sure there’s an emergency, but it’s an emergency of indulging people entirely uncoupled with reality.

The ""boy who cried wolf"" routine isn’t cute, it’s destructive. People who are in charge of major decisions have bullied their ways into having their fantasy narratives accepted and acted upon. Large cities and even non-urban locales are experiencing outbreaks of crime because the fantasy crowd said it was mean to enforce laws. They wanted to defund the police and go easy on criminals, which, entirely unpredictably, has empowered the criminals. Stores are being robbed, people are getting attacked and car jacked, and overall, violence is increasing. Even Starbucks is closing stores in formerly desirable locales like Santa Monica, California, and Union Station in Washington D.C., for Pete’s sake!

We were told that printing trillions of dollars and injecting trillions of dollars more of stimulus money into a supply-constrained economy — one that was supply-constrained because those who shut it down didn’t realize there would be consequences — wasn’t going to produce any inflation. Then, we were told inflation was going to be transitory. Then, it was the consumer’s fault and greedy businesses’ fault, all before blaming Vladimir Putin even when inflation hit a 40-year high the month prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Now, individuals and small businesses alike have to contend with labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and massive inflation that are all threatening their financial security.

We were told that we have to transition to “green” energy and start to execute a full-scale plan when there was no “green” replacement available at scale or at a viable cost. They said this without a plan and without any consideration of the most clean energy source widely available: nuclear energy. This has led to not only sky-high energy costs in the U.S. but to our president begging countries like Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. This is the “green” equivalent of believing that an unpartitioned smoking section works. And, given that global demand for energy will only increase, this is also not a transition to “green” energy, it’s a transition of our economic and national security into the hands of bad actors around the globe.

You can be a good steward of the planet and its resources and still be in touch with reality.

Now, because they have put everything else in disarray and have nothing to fall back on for their power and money grab, the climate emergency has come out of the playbook. I know preppers — people who are actually concerned about outcomes — and they act accordingly. Riding on a private jet, vacationing in your oceanside mega-mansion, or taking a yacht cruise with friends is not the action of anyone who is concerned about anything other than their own money and power.

The lunatics are running the asylum. This needs to stop. They need to be held accountable for everything that they have gotten wrong. Those areas that they have destroyed and impaired need to be fixed and restored. And it needs to be clear that they don’t get to dictate and bully us anymore. We cannot afford, financially and for the sake of our safety and quality of life, to indulge one more minute of their fantasies.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-we-are-in-a-reality-emergency,2022-07-21
Roth: What the Federal Reserve rate hikes mean for you,"The Federal Reserve has been very active with its monetary policy and resulting market intervention over the last decade and a half, and especially since March 2020 with its extraordinary measures taken in conjunction with the COVID pandemic. The Fed's actions, which included purchasing trillions of dollars in assets and keeping the target interest rate for overnight bank-to-bank lending (called the “fed funds rate”) near 0%, have meant that borrowers paid lower interest costs and savers haven’t been able to earn much of an interest return on their money. Moreover, these actions have been a significant factor in the increases in asset prices and spiking inflation.

The Fed's next scheduled meeting, which takes place Tuesday to Wednesday, is widely expected by investors to result in the Fed increasing the fed funds rate by 25 basis points as a first step toward helping to control inflation (100 basis points equals one percentage point, so 25 basis points is equal to a quarter of a percent). The Fed may also give guidance, or at least some clues, on whether authorities plan to undertake other actions that may impact interest rates, including future rate hikes and shrinking the balance sheet from some of those asset purchases.

How does this impact you?

The fed funds rate directly and indirectly impacts other interest rates in the market. If you have debt that has an adjustable interest rate, that means it changes (as opposed to fixed-rate debt, which is locked in at a particular interest rate), and when interest rates go up, so does the amount banks and other lenders will charge you for interest on that debt. For any adjustable interest rate debt, from credit card rates to mortgages that have an adjustable component, you will see those interest costs increase. You will also find that borrowing will start to become more expensive as well, in terms of the rate that you are being charged to take out a loan or take on other debt.

If you haven’t already taken advantage of low rates, you may want to consider locking in a fixed rate before they rise further.

On the savings front, unfortunately, because there is already so much money sloshing around the financial system, banks are not in substantial need of deposits to lend, and so they won’t likely be raising the rates they offer you on your savings accounts very much. With the latest CPI data showing the highest inflation in 40 years at 7.9% year over year, you definitely won’t be making up for the loss in your purchasing power with any interest income you may make by parking it in the bank.

If you have a business, note that your borrowing costs are likely to rise. And if you invest in individual stocks, take into account the strength of the company’s balance sheet, as companies' borrowing will also become more expensive and companies with high debt levels may become riskier investments.

Whether or not the Fed actions at this and subsequent meetings tame inflation — and if they do, how long it takes to do so — remains to be seen. With the challenges in the supply chain and the labor market, coupled with the ongoing issues related to energy, food, and precious metals exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation will likely get worse before it gets better (and, unless we see deflation, those cost increases will be permanent), so be prepared for that scenario as well.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-what-the-federal-reserve-rate-hikes-mean-for-you,2022-03-15
Texas on pace for ANOTHER record month in illegal immigration: 19% increase from April,"After the new record numbers of family units coming to the border almost every month this fiscal year, some might have thought the crisis would have maxed out in April and the numbers would begin decreasing. But preliminary data from Customs and Border Protection apprehensions so far in May show that numbers continue to skyrocket.

According to preliminary weekly data used internally by CBP and given to CR by a Border Patrol agent who must remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the press, 71,834 illegal aliens were apprehended between points of entry in the state of Texas from May 1 to May 28. That works out to a daily pace of 2,565.5 per day or a flow of 936,408 annually – just in the state of Texas alone. One has to go back to fiscal year 2006 to find this level of annual apprehensions in all four border states combined.

This ensures that May will now crush April's unfathomable numbers. The same internal, preliminary CBP data for April shows that 60,476 illegals were apprehended in Texas during an equivalent 28-day period from April 3 through April 30. That means that illegal immigration into Texas likely increased roughly 18.8 percent in May over April.

Overall, in April, almost 99,000 illegal immigrants were caught between points of entry at the entire southwestern border, in addition to roughly 10,000 inadmissible immigrants at points of entry. Given that approximately 60 percent of the aliens have been coming in through Texas and Texas' numbers increased almost 19 percent in May, it's likely that when the final numbers are tallied for the entire border, May will easily set another overall record. Axios is reporting that 75,000 families have arrived, absolutely blowing out the record 58,000 in April.

On Wednesday, a record 1,036 illegal immigrants came in one large group at El Paso, which is the most of any single group coming in at once. Clearly, the situation is getting worse, not better.

While the overwhelming majority of the illegal aliens hailed from the three northern triangle countries in Central America, there were also a number of people from other Latin American countries and even other parts of the world. There were 1,045 from Brazil, 1,787 from Cuba, 1,118 from Ecuador, and 1,301 from Nicaragua. This suggests that a number of people in other countries relatively close to the smuggling routes are catching on to the de facto open border for those coming in with a child.

There were also illegal aliens caught from countries of possible terror concern, including 67 from Bangladesh and 40 from Uzbekistan. Special interest aliens (SIAs) usually pay smugglers much more to get smuggled in while agents are tied down with Central American family units, so it's very likely that the apprehension rate for those from countries of particular concern is lower.

Yesterday, Politico reported that the president would be announcing a shutoff of asylum for those who could have claimed asylum in Mexico or other countries. When reading the Immigration and Nationality Act and the UN treaty on refugees, it's striking how they are all written in singular language referencing individuals claiming asylum. Nothing in our laws would ever define a mass cartel smuggling operation accounting for a significant percentage of a country's population as asylum. It's an invasion. Whether the president is prepared to treat it as such is yet to be determined, but the clock is ticking on his legacy. In 2015, when Trump referred to the border situation as making America a ""dumping ground,"" we were apprehending 38,000 illegal aliens per month. Now, we are seeing twice that number just in Texas alone.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/texas-on-pace-for-another-record-month-in-illegal-immigration,2019-05-31

Ryan: Making of an ant queen,"The embattled, Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Liu Xiaobo wrote, ""Life is priceless even to an ant.""

An ant colony can survive for only a few months after the death of its queen. On average, queens live 10 to 15 years. Some, up to 30 years, one of the longest insect lifespans, hidden deep within the colony, protected, unable to use her wings because she's a little bigger than she used to be.

Plus she's very busy.

The majority of ants are female. Wingless, sterile worker ants. They build nests, they forage, they hunt.

Theirs is a far briefer life than the queen's, ranging from a few weeks up to a year. But they see more of the outside world than any other ant.

The bigger they are, the farther they travel. And they release pheromones along the way so that they have a trail home.

Drones — winged male ants whose primary function in life is to mate with the queen — die after mating and rarely make it out of the colony.

Then, there are the soldier ants. They protect the colony and attack.

To quote philosopher Bertrand Russell, ""Ants and savages put strangers to death.""

They go on raids.

The attacking colony rarely loses, so most colonies flee as soon as an invasion begins. But they sometimes remain and fight. Ants on both sides of the battle die in droves.

Henry David Thoreau describes an ant battle in Walden: ""On every side they were engaged in deadly combat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely.""

If the attackers succeed in overtaking a colony, they pillage the eggs. Some are eaten, fed to larvae. But others become victims of slave raiding. Meaning that the victors return home with their enemy's unborn, feed them, nurse them. Then, when the eggs hatch, the victors force them into slavery.

Often, the slaves even develop an allegiance to the colony that ransacked their home and enslaved them. They'll even help raid other colonies and either die pointlessly or help with the seizure of the next generation of slaves.

Sometimes, however, the slave ants rebel.

In the words of Persian poet Saadi, ""Ants, fighting together, will vanquish the lion.""

Flying ants, both male and female, leave the colony to form another colony. Once they find a suitable place, the males's wings fall off and they mate to their death. Then one or more of the females becomes queen.

It felt odd, any time I sat with a roomful of media, a few hundred journalists from all over the world, as they simultaneously, silently, decided ""Yep, that's newsworthy. We should hammer that.""

It wasn't like everyone turned to each other and said, ""Let's agree on the narrative.""

It was an energy.

Like in Houston, at the third Democratic Debate, after Biden misused the word ""record player,"" you could hear chatter spread through the room, people muttering the words ""records"" and ""record player.""



In Houston, the media watched the debate from a gymnasium around the corner from the auditorium. So I could contrast the crowd's reactions with the media's reactions.

Nearly every time, there was a disparity between the two. The media were more relaxed — during the debate at least. The audience enjoyed any mentions of identity issues. There were a lot. But the media barely reacted at all.

This was a good thing, probably.



*

It's impressive to see how politicians force their stump speeches into a new form, depending on the context. How they say it like an epiphany.

That night brought the opposite for the ever-fledgling Kamala Harris. I could not believe it. Was this the same woman who'd made Iowa hers, just a little over a month ago?

All night, she was so loyal to the tactic she'd premeditated that she didn't realize it wasn't working, like she kept putting on a puppet show on some busy sidewalk.

At one point, she declared, proudly, ""We're not talking about Donald Trump enough.""

The most talked-about man in the world, perhaps in our country's history.

In five weeks, she became an entirely different candidate. Her latest version resembled a Xanax-fueled stepmom. It was like she was transforming into Joe Biden.

She kept laughing at her own jokes. And the entire media room cringed every time.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Amy Klobuchar's pre-formed jokes and half-zany dad jokes fell short every time, too. Most of the media saw Klobuchar's long rants as a chance to chat with a neighbor or jet off to the nearest bathroom, which was likely a locker-room full of plastic flight containers and padded camera cases and journalists who curse like sailors.



During the debate, the press was stoic. So if a candidate got a reaction from them, it carried a certain authenticity.

They laughed at things that the audience ignored or disliked or didn't notice. In part because the audience didn't do a whole lot of laughing. But the media laughed like professionals laugh. In-jokey and staid yet ready for anything unexpected.

They loved it when Booker said the thing about ""Let me translate that to Spanish … 'No'."" And Yang's opening handclaps. As well as Pete Buttigieg's reaction to Yang's raffle.

The biggest laugh of the night in the media center, surprisingly, was when Yang said, ""I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.""

*

Early scientists believed that ants adhere to a complicated hierarchy, which biologist E O Wilson compared to the Hindu caste system. The idea was, ants and humans have a lot in common, and ants belong to a society divided by class and determined by labor.

In ""The Wealth of Nations,"" father of capitalism Adam Smith wrote: ""It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.""

Ants have been organized into colonized societies since the Cretaceous Period, 140 million years ago, when dinosaurs still dominated the Earth. All of that changed 74 million years later. Which was about 66 million years ago. When a comet slammed into what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, resulting in the KT mass extinction.

Eighty percent of all plants and animals died. The ash and dust and debris polluted the air, blocked the sunlight, transforming the Earth into a dark, frozen wasteland full of asthma.

Insects, carrion-eaters, and omnivores all survived. Any purely carnivorous animals starved to death, while mammals and birds fed on insects and worms until the earth repopulated itself with more animals that could be eaten.

The K-T Mass Extinction ushered in a new era of life. Species that had lived in constant retreat from predators were suddenly able to form more elaborate purposes.

After these lifeforms thrived for tens of millions of years, certain mammals started to become vaguely humanlike. Early humans popped up about 300,000 years ago.

Meaning, ants have existed for 140 million years, which is 139.7 million years longer than humans.

For reference, if you counted to 300,000, it would take you roughly three-and-a-half days. To get to 140 million would take about four-and-a-half years.Humans only began developing language about 100,000 years ago.

Yet we're the ones with libraries and governments and ABBA and iPhones. What did ants have? Other people's sugar?

*

Before the debate, I wandered out of the gymnasium and onto bustling sidewalks with makeshift security fencing on each side. And hopped over the massive yellow tubes that belonged in E.T. and pumped cold air into the building. Past dozens of police and security, through an elaborate weave of temporary checkpoints and wires bigger than a fire hose.

On the street, I passed a group of six-or-so teenagers flipping DELANEY signs around like those cardboard ""WE BUY GOLD"" banners which actual people bob around while dressed as Elvis or Lady Liberty or a Banana.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

The sun cast a delightful orange over Houston, glitter in the humid air.



Those kids were having a blast with those signs. Laughing so hard they had to stop occasionally and slap their legs.

On the other side of the fence, some of the most powerful people in the world were readying for battle, and these kids could not have cared less.

*

The protestors had gathered just outside the gates of the campus entrance.

Far as I could tell, it was me and no other journalists present. The rest of the media were in the gymnasium, preparing for the debate or networking or already on-air. Once they got into the media center they stayed put. For many reasons, I assume. The air collapsed under a wave of heat unique to Houston.

Gnarled blockades served as borders on both sides of the street. Locked into steel fencing, flanked by rows of police cars with their lights on but their sirens off.

Worse than the humidity, and more intense, was the energy bouncing out of the protestors on Cleburne Street. The opposite of suction energy, shoving out with tension and panic and elation.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Curtis Mayfield's ""Move on Up"" blared from a Bluetooth speaker. I envisioned a slow zoom from above, beginning with the top of my head and rising, up and up and up. Drawing in the greater scene. Up past Trump's message-board plane. A panorama of city, then county, then state, capturing the topography and nuance of each snapshot of nature.



The higher the camera rose, the more I resembled an ant. One more wingless worker or obedient soldier rushing from place to place on a mission.

And when you got far enough above, you saw the colony that each of us belongs to.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Then it shrank like a passing bobsled, and Earth itself resembled an ant.



The scale of it is daunting.

For thousands of years the sky has filled humans with romance and humility and wonder. A restive impulse that strikes when we gaze up at the moon, the stars, the galaxy, the quiet.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

But at ground level, I was a man in the throes of a great human drama. And my job was to document it as neutrally as possible.



The 120-odd protestors on the south side of the street spilled onto the sidewalk and into a lawn, and they chanted as the Trump plane groaned overhead.

They were crowded together, and they were all fighting for different causes. Lots of contradictions under the same banner. Next to a group of Beto supporters with pro-choice T-shirts, several women chanted:

We.

Want.

A pro-life.

Dem.

Chaos itself occupied the south side of the street. The protestors weren't sure how to handle it. So they chanted and sang and probed for the problem. Like so many tiny creatures hauling an orange slice.

Across the street, facing that horde of supporters, two men gripped pro-life signs.

They were the counter-protestors. Their barricade was far wider than needed. The grass around them looked sad, like the trail a dog makes along the fence when it wants to escape.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Behind the two counter-protestors, a mini-bus covered with photos of aborted babies, tangled fetuses, severed and indistinguishable chunks.



I squinted and gasped and felt downright unwell.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Two days earlier, my wife and I found out that she was pregnant with our first child.



At the very moment I stared at images of tiny human shapes contorted and grey, our baby was the size of a pea. A few weeks later, we'd see its heartbeat pulsing like a strobe.

I'm not making a statement on abortion. That's not my job as a journalist.

It's more my admiration for the impeccable depth of life. The timing. How messages and symbols confront us all the time, with unmatchable creativity.

Because there I was, literally in the middle of two opposing factions. Again. In the divide. Tangled into so many dichotomies. Life and death. Freedom and oppression. Order and chaos. Activity and stagnation. Creation and loss. Art and nature.

And I had once again remained in the middle.

This brought me tremendous satisfaction. It signified personal and journalistic success.

It was also a bit ridiculous.

As a reporter, I never wanted to pick a side. I already had a side. My side was America, and Ireland. My side was humanity.

Ryan: Mayor Pete's last night in town,"Pete Buttigieg deadpanned the stage, barely out of view on the eve of disaster.

For nearly a year, he had practically lived in Iowa, as he competed with a veritable boatload of Democratic presidential candidates. Despite the outlandishly crowded field, he had risen from what the Washington Post described as ""the most interesting mayor you've never heard of,"" to a front-runner in the presidential race, edging his position among the seven remaining candidates.

Super Bowl Sunday. With the first-in-the-nation-vote Iowa caucuses in 28 hours, this ""Get Out The Caucus"" rally was Buttigieg's last pre-caucus event. Not a parking spot for 10 blocks by the time Buttigieg was supposed to have appeared.

A couple thousand people packed inside the Roundhouse, a gymnasium that resembled an ant colony, with its spiraling dome built in 1965. Situated on the campus of Abraham Lincoln High School, with its imposing Collegiate Gothic architecture, hilltopped on the south side of Des Moines, near Gray's Lake — which, on that Feb. 2, 2020, had succumbed to Iowa snow and shortened days, so the water was frozen. Not solid, not deep — only on the surface.

Inside the gymnasium, a profusion of red and yellow. Sultry, humid. People sweating. Warmed by a nagging fluorescence. And bustling. Frantic.

Abraham Lincoln High School, home of the Rail-Splitters Photo by Kevin Ryan

Periodically, the crowd shouted ""BOOT-edge-edge"" to the cadence of ""U-S-A."" Some of their far more elaborate chants had surely been scripted.

Then, lightning shook the gymnasium in the form of Panic! at the Disco. An instrumental loop of their once-ubiquitous single ""High Hopes,"" which you have definitely heard. Over the past year, it has become Buttigieg's campaign song, especially after this video went viral. The choreographed dance routine became a meme, and more videos appeared of Buttigieg-supporter flash mobs, at parks, in conference rooms, at Irish pubs.

Saturday Night Live took a few jabs, with Weekend Update anchor Colin Jost joking, ""It's all part of Mayor Pete's strategy to get a negative percentage of the black vote.""

And, just like that, Buttigieg, 38, took the stage. Behind him, a giant American flag and risers full of Pete-gear-bedecked supporters shouting ""BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE.""



The floor rumbled. The bleachers and stairs and blinking scoreboards shook. It was a tribal war ceremony. A pep rally for a game that could cost us everything. Our freedom, our lives, our fast food whenever we want it.

The Maltese Chicken

In many way, Buttigieg represents the anti-Trump.

He's polite. He's intellectual. He's young. A church-going Episcopalian, a Rhodes Scholar, a veteran, a former McKinsey management consultant, a Harvard grad, a piano player. He even once accompanied Ben Folds for a performance of ""Steven's Last Night in Town,"" a song about an enigmatic guy who's always about to leave but never does. Afterward, Folds said, ""It was a very difficult song he pulled off. I'm serious. He's a fine player.""

www.youtube.com

He's well-spoken, decorously well-spoken. Also fluent in French, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic and Dari, a dialect of Persian that he learned while serving overseas. Oh, and Norwegian.



Like presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, he's a veteran. He joined the Navy Reserve at 27, achieved the rank of lieutenant, with a Joint Service Commendation medal. Then, In 2014, he took a leave as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to serve a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence officer as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

""I was packing my bags for Afghanistan while [Donald Trump] was working on Season 7 of 'The Apprentice,"" he said at a May 2019 rally.

In his autobiography, ""Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future,"" he says that, during his time in Afghanistan, he was mostly ""behind a sophisticated computer terminal in a secure area,"" although he served as a vehicle commander on convoys through Kabul 119 times.

I would heave my armored torso into the driver's seat of a Land Cruiser, chamber a round in my M4, lock the doors and wave a gloved goodbye to the Macedonian gate guard. My vehicle would cross outside the wire and into the boisterous Afghan city, entering a world infinitely more interesting and ordinary and dangerous than our zone behind the blast walls at ISAF headquarters.

Like fellow candidates Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders, and former candidate Kamala Harris, Buttigieg is a second-generation American. His father emigrated from Malta in 1979, became a naturalized American citizen, then taught as a professor. ""Buttigieg"" is Maltese for ""lord of the poultry.""

History in the Making

Two types of people at the rally — Buttigieg supporters decked in PETE 2020 gear, and journalists, strutting or looking bored. Meanwhile, I desperately fished through my backpack for my Houston Astros hat, failing, dropping everything, a human spill. But with a smirk, because the Astros had just been disgraced following revelations that they cheated their way to a World Series win, something about banging a trash can like it was a kettledrum.

All through Buttigieg's speech, various media chattered. With their PETE press badges stuck to their arms, they gabbed like people do at annual conferences or family reunions, indifferent to the presidential candidate 80 yards away.

Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" gabbed right beside us. Media pundits, anchors, columnists, all the important people, had converged on Des Moines.

It was like a journalism catwalk. It was like homecoming, for us, the media — the eloquent vultures who stomp around with our wings stretched as a show of dominance or a remedy to fear, compensating always.

Fox News anchor Bret Baier strutted up the aisle, flanked by an entourage. It looked like he'd deep-fried himself in orange baby powder.

Baier lacked the ordinariness that I'd sensed when I met him in Houston at the third Democratic debate. I liked Baier, even if he did snub me when I told him I write for Blaze Media. Now, he was a puffin of confidence, resembling some American emperor as he walked, parting the crowd.

Didn't any of these journalists want to know what Buttigieg had to say? Sure, when you cover an election, you hear a stump speech 40 times and it loses its spark. But our whole job was to comb for lice.

Buttigieg asked the audience, ""So, are you ready to make history one more time?""

They'd be making history, all right, far more than they expected, but not like they'd imagined. By the end of the next day, American democracy would take a pie to the face.

Youth and Inexperience

If elected president, Buttigieg would be the youngest in our nation's history, just two years over the minimum age. He got his start as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at the age of 29. After serving two terms, he left office on Jan. 1, 2020.

In a field of seasoned, older politicians, including a former vice president, Buttigieg has faced relentless scrutiny for his lack of political experience — it has come up every single debate. Most recently, in a now-viral campaign ad from former Vice President Joe Biden, who like Buttigieg, coincidentally, entered politics at age 29 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history.

So much of this campaign has been about age, and not in a charming way. A 73-year-old Ronald Reagan responded to a question about his age by saying, ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""

Buttigieg has often championed the idea of ""Intergenerational justice"" as a means of establishing an ""intergenerational alliance."" Connecting the generations.

During a May 2019 town hall for Fox News, Chris Wallace asked Buttigieg about the constraints of age for a president. Here's Buttigieg's response:

www.youtube.com

At 38, Buttigieg is technically a millennial, and the first to become a serious presidential candidate.



""We're not a generation that feels sorry for itself,"" Buttigieg told one journalist. ""But I think when somebody says, 'Gosh, why are you guys less likely to leave the home?' It's like, well, because college is unaffordable, most of the best opportunities are in cities that are unaffordable. And we graduated into a recession. So what do you expect?""

Politics Politics Politics

Despite all the chaos in the Roundhouse as Mayor Pete chanted to the crowd, I found Justin Robert Young, host of the Politics Politics Politics podcast.

Justin and I first connected last November, after my story on Kanye West's appearance at the Joel Osteen megachurch in Houston. Then Justin had me on his podcast. Immediately, we connected.

The Buttigieg rally was the first time we'd met in person.

Justin gave intermittent commentary into his ZOOM portable recorder, the kind with dual external microphones.

In person, as on his podcast, Justin Robert Young discusses politics with the grace and off-handedness and clarity of a philosophy professor explaining Immanuel Kant. Like a surfer gliding a wave.

But then he throws in some humor. He is what you could call an outcast of the media world. Same as me. There aren't all that many of us. We work for different publications, networks, podcasts — media of every political orientation. But we take umbrage with the politics of new media, it's Trumpian snarl and disdain, it's blunt sense of apathy.

He asked me for my prediction, my ""1, 2, 3, 4"" on who would win Iowa.

I get asked questions like this fairly often. I don't pretend to be a political expert. But if you're at the horse races, you pick a horse, and sometimes you just go with the horse trotting the wildest and maybe it will win.

""For my number one,"" I said, ""I'd guess Bernie. Two, Biden. Three, Warren. Four, Klobuchar.""

""No Pete?"" Justin asked.

""I mean, that would really surprise me.""

Outside the Wire

Buttigieg is the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate. He came out in 2015, at the age of 33, near the end of his first term as mayor, with an essay in the South Bend Tribune:

Like most people, I would like to get married one day and eventually raise a family. I hope that when my children are old enough to understand politics, they will be puzzled that someone like me revealing he is gay was ever considered to be newsworthy. By then, all the relevant laws and court decisions will be seen as steps along the path to equality. But the true compass that will have guided us there will be the basic regard and concern that we have for one another as fellow human beings — based not on categories of politics, orientation, background, status or creed, but on our shared knowledge that the greatest thing any of us has to offer is love.

Ten days later, the Supreme Court struck down all state bans on gay marriage, making same-sex marriage legal on the federal level. He married his husband, Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher from Michigan, in 2018. The following year, he appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine, with his Chasten, and the words ""First Family.""

The Atlantic said a Buttigieg presidency could ""transform the relationship between gay and straight America for the better."" One op-ed in the New York Times praised Buttigieg for changing America with what the author called ""Mayor Pete's gay reckoning."" Another noted that ""Mr. Buttigieg's ascent has made a sudden and unexpected reality of something [LGBT] donors thought was still years away, if not decades."" Although the author added that the LGBT community is by no means monolithic.

Any criticisms of his gayness, or his being a white gay man, have come not from conservatives or Republicans, but from the left, from LGBT groups and openly left-leaning activism-journalists — a discord that the right has crudely exploited for their own benefit, with concern-troll schadenfreude. Because most of the writers who've criticized Buttigieg are themselves LGBT. And, while they may focus far more on differences than unity, it's their prerogative.

Either way, it's complicated. All of it. For everyone. But especially for the people in the middle of the chaos.

The most cited Buttigieg hit piece is probably the one from The Outline, titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is bad for gays.""

The author dislikes Buttigieg's ordinariness, his lack of overt gayness, and, finally, his status as a ""democratic capitalist."" The author concludes,

But it is hard to escape the way that American capitalism and American democracy have worked in tandem both to dissipate and to assimilate the radical democratic energies of queer liberation by giving a very circumscribed sort of gay a conditional membership to the club.

LGBTQ Nation responded with an article titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is good for gays,"" rebuking the Outline article, ""That isn't an argument. That's self-hatred.""

A journalist for Slate wrote that

in a primary for the overwhelmingly pro-gay Democratic Party, Buttigieg can be more accurately lumped in with his white male peers than with anyone else.

Senior politics reporter for HuffPost Jennifer Bendery wrote,

[H]is candidacy is already exposing tensions in the LGBTQ community between gay white men, who benefit from the economic and social privileges of being white men, and all the other queer people who don't.

Buzzfeed wrote, ""You Wanted Same-Sex Marriage? Now You Have Pete Buttigieg.""

Vice wrote, ""Why Do White People Love Pete Buttigieg?""

The Root wrote, ""Pete Buttigieg is a lying MF.""

The New Republic published an article in which author Dale Peck, who is also gay, referred to Buttigieg as ""Mary Pete."" LGBTQ Nation called the article disgusting. Within a day, New Republic editors removed it, saying that it crossed the line into ""inappropriate and invasive."" The removal of the article caused its own controversy.

Buttigieg addressed the negative press on ""The Clay Cane Show,""

I just am what I am, and, you know, there's going to be a lot of that. That's why I can't even read the LGBT media anymore because it's all, 'he's too gay, not gay enough, wrong kind of gay.' All I know is that life became a lot easier when I just started allowing myself to be myself and I'll let other people write up whether I'm 'too this' or 'too that'

Negotiating

Outside, among the snow of things and the ice-veiled football field, a vendor wearing a Los Angeles Lakers beanie sold Buttigieg T-shirts and hats, prowling behind two poker tables.

""Buttigieg gave quite a speech,"" I said to Justin. ""But it was so neat and tidy.""

""Nice, is the word,"" he replied. ""What we saw was a coordinated effort to be the nice guy.""

""That's not so bad.""

Buttigieg has repeatedly championed the importance of dialogue between the left and the right. Which would involve broadening the information we consume. Twitter, obviously, perpetuates echo-chamber tribalism. But the news media are guilty of ideological round-abouts as well, so it's a matter of media literacy, what Buttigieg calls ""correcting our media diet."" He was the first Democratic candidate to appear on FoxNews.



""I also think sometimes there's a sense of condescension coming from our party,"" he told Bill Maher. ""I think a lot of people perceive that we're looking down on them."" Which can lead to radicalization. A loss in the sense of belonging.

Truth

Later, Justin and I drank cheap beer and watched the Super Bowl at Beechwood Lounge in Des Moines' Historic East Village, with its boutiques and microbrews and gay bars and pedestrians. Hell of a place to watch the Super Bowl. That long narrow room, steep, a revamped house of some kind. Low lighting. No frill from the bartenders, just abrupt conversation so you know they meant what they said. Home to fashionable outcasts, such as ourselves. The less militant kind with their passion and their certitude, the profound disquiet, a disgust with the status quo.

2020 marked the centennial Super Bowl. Also, it was Shakira's birthday, a fact that everyone in the nation buzzed with, later, during the halftime show, on account of her and J-Lo being hosts, and both giving acrobatically flawless performances. Photo by Kevin Ryan

Toward the end of the night Justin raised his finger, squinted his left eye, and said, ""For your series. You should find a universal truth. Something everyone knows but hasn't said or can't express. Give them a universal truth.""



On the flight to Des Moines, I read Forrest Gander's Pulitzer-Prize-winning poetry collection ""Be With."" All week, I kept thinking about one line. A seeming non sequitur. A sentence fragment. ""Intuition of the infinite.""

Is that truth? When we discover truth, are we grasping something infinite? A constant strain. Reaching for feathers as they float through the breeze. Chasing a rabbit near a busy road and all you want to do is save a creature but it's just too fast and now the danger has spread. Still, in the words of Robert Browning, ""Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?""

Our era already resigned itself to a life of mistruth, the Age of Fake News Supreme. We know the chaos of doubting whether something is the truth or a lie. A pattern that seems to worsen each day. So it has become harder than ever to apply a universal truth to hundreds of millions of people. But I would do it.

""You're going to see some ads saying there's only two ways to go,"" Buttigieg had said earlier that day at the rally. ""Either you're for a revolution or you're for the status quo. But the good news for Americans today is we have a historic majority ready not only to rally around what we're against to get a better president, but to come together in the name of what we are for as a country.""

During an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Dr. Phil perfectly described how this is possible.

""Why do you think that nobody can talk to each other anymore?"" Colbert asked.

""You know, to tell you the truth, I don't think anybody's trying to get along right now,"" Dr. Phil said. ""Everybody is pissed off and it's like they don't want to get along. If I'm negotiating with somebody — if I'm negotiating with you, the first thing I'm going to do is figure out how to get you the most of what you want I possibly can.""

Colbert recoiled. ""Is negotiating all about winning?"" he asked.

""Certainly you want to win,"" said Dr. Phil, ""but you gotta define 'win.' If 'win' is all one-sided, that's not gonna last very long. If you and I make a deal and I say, 'Okay, here's the deal, you do all the work and I'm gonna get all the money,' I might talk you into that today, but three-four days later you're gonna go, 'Excuse me, can we — kiss my ass, I'm not doing that anymore. Nobody's gonna go along with that, you've gotta have a sense of saying, 'All right, let's start by saying, what do we agree on?""

""Okay, that's it,"" replied Colbert. ""What do we agree on? Because it seems like, right now, during the campaign and right now, too, people are having trouble agreeing on reality. People are having trouble agreeing on what is a fact, what is an alternative fact … Why is this happening, Dr. Phil?""

""Any time there's a dispute,"" Dr. Phil responded, ""the first thing I do is say, 'Okay, let's figure out what it is we agree on, because we might agree on more than we think, and then we can have these things over to the side that we disagree on.'""

He added, ""So. What do we agree on? Everybody agrees that we're all Americans, that we all enjoy the freedoms that we want, we all want to be safe — everybody agrees with those things, right? If you say, 'What do we not agree on' — okay, now we're talking about the disagreements, but we at least have some common ground. Nobody's talking about that.""

Ryan: War,"Virgil begins ""The Aeneid"" in darkness. ""I sing of warfare and a man at war,"" followed by an invocation of the Muse and a ton of badass one-liners. Such as:

""The descent into Hell is easy"" and ""If I cannot move heaven, I will raise hell"" and ""Let me rage before I die.""

War is what happens when we lose our minds collectively, sometimes on a global scale. It is both uniquely human and bleakly inhuman. Brutalism by design, rococo on accident. An animalistic loss of composure that we perfect through elaborate, brilliantly organized maneuvers, only to devolve to our worst selves, overtaken by an ugliness that bursts up from Hell.

Murder is the worst thing a person can do, worse than rape. And war is industrialized murder, assembly-line killing, the violent death of millions of people, scattering our bones into the earth by the pile. Betraying ourselves in every possible way. And often accompanied by all sorts of heinous crimes, including rape. Which makes war, by far, the most odious behavior that humans can commit.

When a war begins, the world gets quieter. Collectively, subconsciously, we are frightened, like a child hiding from a monster. In 2020, this pronouncement — of war — is just as bone-rattling as it has ever been, same as it was in Virgil's Rome, only now, it's infinitely more tangled, complicated by invisible networks that we don't fully understand, like everything else we encounter these days. Because our human era will go down as ""The Bluff Age,"" when everyone was constantly pretending to be relaxed, and competent, but, secretly, no one had the slightest clue what was happening, or why, and especially not how.

Right as I was gliding into the peaceful, dreamy territory of an evening nap, my phone began firing off under a stack of books on the bed. Emails, DMs, phone calls. A text from my father that said, ""War.""

""Jesus, not again,"" I said, with the same annoyance you get when the doctor is late and you're stuck in the waiting room.

In 2019, I had to cut five stories because the news moves too fast for all of us. And, here I was, two stories into part 2 of this election series, a new year, and I'd just spent an entire month preparing stories, had literally just completed the final edits on the six-part installment about Trump rallies in Louisiana, and now our attention as a country shifted to war.

Why We Fight: Prelude to War (Frank Capra) www.youtube.com

Times have changed since Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" series used cinema to explain World War II to the American public. In ""Prelude to War,"" the first installment, a vaudevillian narrator asks, ""Why are we Americans on the march?""



The media change but the questions, at their core, stay the same.

In 2020, you strap on your goggles and dive into Twitter if you want to know about our culture's most recent dumpster fire. Best of all, The Donald himself treated the platform like it was his personal blog.

But Trump hadn't tweeted in hours. An ominous sign.

And Twitter, to nobody's surprise, was a s**tshow. A portion of the activity was news-related, mention of rockets hitting a U.S. airbase in Iraq, likely as retaliation for Trump's recent killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. An assassination that was itself a retaliation, in a history of retaliations too intermingled for anyone to remember who threw the first punch.

For the most part, however, Twitter was just as pathologically sarcastic and delusional as always, only now #WAR was trending.



Meanwhile, the front page of Reddit was even more frantic than normal. At the top, an ""Iran War"" megathread, flawlessly assembled, with everything I needed all in the one place.

All of it was so serious. I needed a good laugh. A dose of comedy. So I put Fox News on the TV.

Some cardboard pundit kept saying that the amendments to the Constitution are like people — they were born, they grow perfect, but some turn degenerate and come undone, until we're full of senseless death.

Then, like a robotic wax figure, he lifted his chin and faced the camera and said, ""War is inevitable.""

Then the Fox News logo spun like clipart into an ad for adult diapers. Next was a commercial for those Oakleys-style sunglasses that Navy Seal snipers wear. Isn't it great, the way they pop their heads out of the river with their sunglasses on?

Don't get me wrong, the other networks weren't any better. Just smug in a different way. And now add tension, uncertainty, fear. Would we live through another 9/11? Good God, no, no, no.

Outside, the air belted larger and farther and quicker than usual, slanting with cinema shade that hung behind a divided Moon. Half of it was bright, its usual morose, like an acne-faced teenager. And darkness gloved the other side, low and cracked like a parking lot.

The night seemed so painfully quiet, all at once.

""War and peace,"" I shouted, in the direction of my two dogs. ""Darkness and light.""

They expected treats, given the tone of voice I'd chosen. They got treats.

Humans have had cognitive awareness for about 100,000 years now. War has baffled us since we were able to be baffled. Why do we fight?

Poets, philosophers, artists, theologians have all plundered their minds for an answer and the best we can come up with is contradictory, at the very least. It seems that war and peace need one another, like a sexually charged divorce. Existence itself needs that struggle, life and death working together.

Leo Tolstoy captured the existential absurdity of this dilemma in his novel ""War and Peace,"" which chronicles Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. In it, he writes, ""If everyone fought for their own convictions there would be no war.""

Fighting for your own convictions turns out to be far trickier than we assume. Because we're not as independent as we'd thought. There is no silence in the world we have created through language and art and religion and history. No single hero, no lone villain. It's never my world. It's only ever ours, with me in it.

Despite our postmodern concept of selfhood as a unique experience that each of us controls, we matter more to the collective than as an individual. Each of our lives achieves meaning as a part of the greater whole. The rest of it is trophies.

Tolstoy writes, ""Man lives consciously for himself, but serves as an unconscious instrument for the achievement of historical, universally human goals.""

War is inevitable. But how it affects each of us is a matter of fate. Maybe you're born into the cozy rung of a country that nobody cares about or one that everybody loses to. War still happens, just elsewhere.

War is as fortuitous as life itself. Who knows why we were born now, here, as the person each of us is. But, if you're lucky, war is something you can discover at your leisure.

Russian sanctions great reset,"Why is the west slamming Russia with sanctions on everything, while also refusing to increase our own oil production? This week on the Glenn Beck Podcast, Glenn sat down with former MTV video jockey and co-host of the “No Agenda” podcast Adam Curry — the man who introduced Joe Rogan to the ESG movement and its role in the Great Reset.

Adam and Glenn took a hard look into the terrifying realities playing out around the world, including in Ukraine, and agreed that something’s very ""off"" about the global response to Russia’s invasion. But Adam had a shocking theory as to why.

The billionaire elites behind the World Economic Forum's Great Reset agenda — including chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink, newly-appointed chair of Pentagon Defense Innovation Board Michael Bloomberg, and Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) chair Mark Carney — make no secret of their plans to transform the global financial system. Adam told Glenn he believes part of that plan is to destroy the value of the ""petrodollar,"" the system that designates the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. And they don't intend to let the crisis in Ukraine ""go to waste.""

""Anyone who has a brain will say, if we're taking away petroleum and oil and we're replacing it with 'renewables,' doesn't that screw up the petrodollar?"" Adam said.

""So, now we have a Putin-Russia ... kinetic attack ... and we're hitting back with what? Financial weapons. Why? Why are we using financial weapons? I believe this is it, Glenn: never let a crisis go to waste. This is the tipping point we need to price energy so high ... that the idea is to shut down global production because of the [high] cost of energy,"" he explained.

""But don't worry, [the government] will take care of you, just like with COVID,"" Adam added sarcastically. ""[They]'re going to send you money. This time, though, not a check. This time, it's your Federal Reserve digital dollar, and then we're in deep trouble and I don't think that's stoppable. I think that is unstoppable at that point — but I'm a doomer-optimist, so I have I have ideas and solutions.""

The monster behind the pop-culture hero: Former CIA operative Félix Rodríguez reveals the real Che Guevara,"In this episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast,"" Glenn sat down with former CIA operative Félix Rodríguez, who participated in the historic manhunt to capture Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara.

Félix is a Cuban-American Vietnam veteran who fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion and was recruited to train and lead a team to track down Guevara due to the fact that he had been instrumental in Fidel Castro's Cuban Revolution.

In this podcast, Félix gives a first-hand account of the capture and execution of the man whose image is still being appropriated as a counterculture fashion statement. He also provides detailed insight into Guevara's blood lust and depravity as a man who not only killed many people during his lifetime, but greatly enjoyed it.

Ukraine Crisis Digital Dollar,"Glenn Beck warned that Great Reset elites were looking for the next “serious crisis,” and … enter Ukraine.

The global corporate community has UNITED with world governments to defeat Putin and Russia’s invasion. The West’s answer was to turn on an economic weapon of mass destruction. But not just against the Russian government. Russian civilians have been forced to feel the pain too. It’s the very same economic enforcement built under the Great Reset with ESG.

Glenn warns this economic WMD model could also be used against Americans found “treasonous” under Biden’s administration. With a new Axis power hostile to the U.S. and its dollar, the president has responded with another path to full control and submission through a DIGITAL dollar being built RIGHT NOW. Glenn reveals what this programmable dollar will look like and what it all means for you. ESG could be enforced with the press of a button. Privacy would be a thing of the past. And local banks probably won’t survive. The crackdown is coming.

WATCH: Critical Race TYRANNY: The Great Reset of Education,"A virus has escaped the university labs and is super-spreading through our culture. It's called Critical Race THEORY and what used to be a fringe topic in the academic world is now a dangerous Marxist REALITY infecting our public schools where students are taught the U.S. is a ""parasitic system"" based on the ""invasion"" of ""white male settlers.""

On Glenn TV this week, Glenn Beck exposes how some teachers are being instructed to ""cash in on kids' inherent empathy"" in order to train them to become ""activist intellectuals,"" starting as early as first grade.

CRT is an absolute toxin to America and Glenn warns that in just one generation the Constitution, freedom, and true equality will be totally destroyed. Yet, any opposition to the spread of this disease is shouted down as racism and bigotry. If Critical Race Theory is not already in your local school curriculum, it will be soon.

Joined by Asra Nomani, Vice President for Strategy and Investigations at Parents Defending Education, Glenn arms you with the facts about CRT so you can stand up to this tyranny in your community.

Russia economic new world order,"Glenn Beck believes something has been off with the world’s reaction to the Ukraine invasion since the beginning.

Have you noticed how all the private corporations of the world have come together at an unprecedented level? They are now moving in tandem with world governments in the largest public-private partnership the world has ever seen. Now, McDonald's shut down all its restaurants in Russia. Why? Glenn says it doesn’t make sense unless you understand the Great Reset. And Russian oil just may be the last nail in the coffin to usher in the economic new world order.

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Glenn connects it all at the chalkboard and asks: How much are you willing to sacrifice to help Ukraine? Because those sacrifices are coming. Over half of Americans are already living paycheck to paycheck, but CNN says Americans are okay with paying higher prices if it means holding Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine.

Glenn retells the “Titanic” movie, but with Russians, oil prices, and an economic weapon of mass destruction. In this version of the story, the iceberg is still there and President Biden is steering us straight toward it.

Phil Robertson: Gun confiscation would DESTROY our national security,"On ""In the Woods with Phil,"" Phil Robertson of ""Duck Dynasty"" fame said there's a good reason our enemies want to see American citizens disarmed: We ARE national security.

Phil shared an article from the Bradenton Herald that argued the number of licensed hunters in the state of Wisconsin alone, would constitute ""the 11th largest army in the world,"" outnumbering the people under arms in Iran, as well as France and Germany combined.

The article's author also pointed out that Wisconsin's 894,543 ""men, women and youngsters, were deployed in the woods of a single American state to hunt with firearms. They did so efficiently and with expertise — no one was killed.""

Noting the statistics in the article, Phil suggested that the millions of legal gun owners in this country would serve as the ""largest army in the world"" should there be ""an armed invasion from another country.""

""Any way you slice it, this old guy is just saying there's going to be a bone to be chewed if some kind of foreign army comes in here,"" Phil said. ""We have a gigantic army of armed individuals waiting on them. America will forever be safe from foreign invasion with that kind of fire power.""

Counting down LevinTV's top ten videos of 2021,"As we gear up for 2022, LevinTV counts down the top ten videos of 2021.

#10 Let's start with #10. Remember when Joe Biden launched a commission to examine ""Supreme Court Reform""? We do. Revisit Mark's recounting of the history of the nine-judge system as it stands today and how Biden may seek to damage the republic with his court-packing.

#9 This is #9: “Milley Gets Blackburned.” Rewatch how General Mark Milley squirmed under the intense questioning from senators over the withdrawal from Afghanistan — especially from powerhouse Marsha Blackburn.

#8 Here is #8: How badly did Joe Biden bungle our exit from Afghanistan, abandoning Americans and allies alike? According to Mark, enough to anger Jake Tapper.

#7 Coming in at #7 is ""The Secret Texts."" New encrypted texts revealed his hypocrisy after Joe Biden preached that he would ""leave no American behind.""

#6 Joe Biden is in trouble again in #6: Mark Levins believes Joe Biden's reproachable ""leadership"" left our men vulnerable, our allies distrustful, and our country ashamed. Mark questions what could be more shameful than a leader who disrespects our fallen soldiers?!

#5 MSNBC’s coverage made the #5 LevinTV video from 2021. The far-Left praised Biden when his moral compass, to some, appeared broken. Watch as U.S. Army veteran Matt Zeller schools them on decorum and leadership.

#4 ""Obama Palooza"" made the #4 video from 2021. In this video, Mark believes that with the Omicron variant emerging, it's important to remember when Barack Obama ignored the dangers of the Delta variant to throw a flashy, maskless, three-day birthday extravaganza like the affluent aristocracy he is.

#3 Coming in at #3 is “Medical Fascism.” Levin discussed events that took place in July when the CDC threatened to mandate masks for vaccinated people while millions of illegal immigrants stream across our southern border — many of them unvaccinated. Mark asked the right question: If illegal immigrants get a free health pass into our nation, why were Americans treated like medical prisoners?

#2 “Jim Crow Joe” is #2. Mark explained why Joe Biden is the ""liar in chief.""

#1 The #1 LevinTV video: ""Chaos in Kabul"" saw the military disaster of the Afghanistan withdrawal and the cowardly leadership known as the Biden presidency. Our ""commander in blame"" stood by his decision while Kabul imploded under the Taliban invasion. See Mark fire away at Biden's foreign policies that still threaten to set fire to America's reputation and security on the world stage.

'They're coming for YOU': Mark Levin says THIS is who Biden's IRS plan really targets,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is on the defense concerning the Internal Revenue Service monitoring your cash flow. With a projected ""tax gap"" of $7 trillion dollars over the next decade, Yellen and the Biden administration want to authorize an unprecedented invasion of privacy and government overreach by the IRS. And as Mark Levin pointed out on the latest episode of ""LevinTV,"" the IRS has a history of abuse of power.

Yellen defended the proposal during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Development Committee hearing, saying that ""banks already report directly to the IRS the interest that they pay on accounts when it exceeds $10"" and that the IRS would not be collecting ""detailed transaction level data by banks to the IRS"" under the proposal.

""This is not the kind of information that the IRS currently receives or monitors,"" Levin argued. ""If they choose to do an audit on you, then they have access to whatever they want, but they don't audit most people. So what they're doing here is poking around in people's checking accounts and savings accounts or money market accounts.""

""If you give the IRS this kind of power, they're going to abuse it. They're going to exploit it,"" he continued. ""They want to add $85 billion to the IRS budget. What else do they want to do? They want to add between 50 and 60,000 new agents. That's intended to abuse you. They're coming for you. That's what's going on. They believe you're a bunch of crooks and so they want to threaten you. They want you to get letters and they want to audit you. That's a lot more people than you need to audit billionaires, I can tell you that.""

Mark Levin strategy against Putin,"Mark Levin described Putin's ruthless invasion of Ukraine as having revealed his evil ambitions. As the west mobilizes against his atrocities, Putin turns to threatens the use of nuclear weapons against all who come to Ukraine's aid.

Now, Mark and others are asking if ""it would be so bad to take Putin out."" So, why is the Biden administration willing to settle for the slow death of Ukraine? Mark tackles these questions and goes on to explain different ways Ukraine can be helped without sending troops to the battlefield.

Russia's Ukraine Mark Levin,"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine provides a timely opportunity for a critical thinking exercise.

Suppose you are the leader of Russia, China, Iran, etc. Consider Biden's tragic exit from Afghanistan in August 2021, and the strained relationship that disaster created with our NATO allies. Wouldn't you see the present as a golden window of opportunity to carry out your war-filled dreams? After all, what America has in President Joe Biden is a commander in chief who Mark Levin, host of ""LevinTV"" noted, is incapable of defending The United States of America.

In this clip, Mark addressed a video from NBC Today that covered the developing situation of Russia and Ukraine. If you follow politics, you are well aware that what we see on the surface usually does not reflect reality. Mark highlighted the general principle, pointing out the implications of what a Russian invasion of Ukraine means.

""The fear is, the Russians will cut through Ukraine and then start gobbling up little pieces of other countries,"" Mark assessed, meaning the fear is that Russia will gain control of new territory. Mark added that the United States is not in the best position. Watch the clip for a clear breakdown of what is unfolding between Russia, Ukraine, and potentially NATO.

why-ukraine-gave-up-nukes,"As Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-fledged military invasion of Ukraine, BlazeTV host Mark Levin recalled how the United States, along with the U.K. and Russia, guaranteed Ukraine ""national security"" if it gave up its sizable nuclear arsenal, the third largest on earth in 1994. But in 2014, Putin gambled that then-President Barack Obama was all talk and no action and invaded eastern Ukraine. Obama was obliged to confirm his suspicions and did nothing.

In this clip, Mark unpacks Russia's terrifying track-record of subjugating Ukrainians and explains why he thinks Putin won't stop until he has forcibly taken over Ukraine.

Crowder obliterates Lincoln Project video that compares ANTIFA to WWII soldiers,"In this clip, Steven Crowder discussed a video — produced by The Lincoln Project — created to mark the memory of D-Day when brave Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, during World War II. But, things turned comical when the video compared those brave men to Antifa.

""Are they talking about the same Antifa?"" Crowder asked sarcastically.

Crowder broke down all the ways that the Antifa we see today is nothing like the heroes that fought in WWII. Crowder and his crew reminded viewers of the fascism imposed on the American public in current times. ""Silencing political opinions is what fascists do,"" the guys agreed.

Crowder produced a video of his own to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the day Antifa ""stormed the City of Seattle and changed the name to CHAZ.""

10 Most Significant Stories of 2022,"On the final episode of 2022, ""The Steve Deace Show"" covered the ten most significant stories of 2022.

Listen to the full episode here.

10. Canadian Trucker Convoy Truckers from across Canada protested vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions with a ""Freedom Convoy"" that began in British Columbia and made its way to the nation's capital with tens of thousands of supporters.

9. Selling Out The House of Representatives on Friday passed the ""Assault Weapons Ban of 2022,"" a bill that would ban various semi-automatic guns, though the measure would grandfather in firearms that people already own. ""It shall be unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon,"" the text of the bill states. ""Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession, sale, or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of enactment of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022."" Republican Reps. Chris Jacobs of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania joined most Democrats in voting for the bill, but Democratic Reps. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against the bill. Read more.

8. Ukraine The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in first-world weaponry to Ukraine since its invasion by Russia. House Republicans, poised to take control of Congress in January, are now pressuring the Biden administration for greater accountability and transparency about these weapons transfers as well about other aid packages sent to the embattled Slavic nation. The push for greater oversight comes after it was revealed that there have only been two in-person weapons inspections conducted by U.S. monitors since February.Read more.



7. Inflation Tiffany Wilding, an economist who works for investment management giant PIMCO, explained on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the report is deceiving because certain measurements skew the data. ""There is a little bit of noise that you have to take into account because inventories and trade numbers can obviously be very volatile. If you dig into the details of the quarter three GDP numbers, what you find is when you exclude those more volatile categories, growth was pretty subpar,"" she said. ""For the year as a whole — excluding those categories, we call that 'final domestic demand' — growth is sub-1%,"" she explained, noting that 2021 saw ""robust"" growth of 5%. Read more.

6. Groomers U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a Democrat who lists the gender pronouns ""She/Her"" in her Twitter biography, is publicly praising Drag Queen Story Hour, a program that features cross-dressers reading books to children. ""Across the country, books are being banned, which are depriving our nation’s youth. But thanks to @NYPL and programs like Draq Queen story hour, NYC’s next generation are getting a well rounded education about LGBTQ+ issues and gender identity,"" Maloney tweeted on Monday. Read more.

5. Ron DeSantis Florida law requires that elected officials tender an irrevocable resignation if they seek another office the term of which would overlap with the term of their current office. ""No person may qualify as a candidate for more than one public office, whether federal, state, district, county, or municipal, if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other,"" the law explains. ""No officer may qualify as a candidate for another state, district, county, or municipal public office if the terms or any part thereof run concurrently with each other without resigning from the office he or she presently holds."" Read more.

4. Elon Musk Buys Twitter Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk reportedly fired four top executives from the leadership of Twitter on Thursday after completing a deal to buy the company. Musk reportedly fired Twitter chief executive officer Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, top legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde, and general counsel Sean Edgett, according to a report from the New York Times that cited confidential sources. The report said at least one executive was escorted out of the offices after he was fired. Earlier on Thursday, Musk outlined why he was buying the popular platform. Read more.

3. Depopulation One may have thought that Bill Nye’s new Netflix show had reached its lowest point with a crude and anti-science song about genitals and gender theory, but beyond the nonsense, the former children’s show star is also floating the theory that bringing children into this world ought to come with government-imposed penalties because of climate change. On the season finale of “Bill Nye Saves the World,” entitled “Earth’s People Problem,” the former children's show star turned panderer to millennial nostalgia and hype theory discusses overpopulation, asking a panel whether or not “we should have policies that penalize people for having extra kids in the developed world?"" Read more.

2. The Red Wave That Wasn't Imagine how amazing things could have been had we woken up last Wednesday morning with Republicans winning 54 seats in the Senate and 250 seats in the House. We’d be off to the promised land, right? Wrong! Actually, from a policy perspective, we’d be in the same place we are today, sans the much-needed introspection that is taking place deep in the souls of conservative politicos — an introspection we’ve needed for decades. It’s not about Trump per se, and not even so much about McConnell and McCarthy. It’s that we are the true RINOs — Republicans in name only — in a party that has never shared our values for most of its history. Read More.

1. Roe Overturned The Supreme Court of the United States officially overturned Roe v. Wade, and the debate over abortion rights has been given back to the states. On this historic day, BlazeTV hosts celebrate the Supreme Court's incredible decision and take a look at some of the insane reactions as the left comes completely undone.Read more.

"INSANE: BLM protesters list demands for local businesses, threaten 'repercussions for non-compliance'","Black Lives Matter protesters sent a shocking, threatening letter to businesses and nonprofits in Louisville, Kentucky. The letter made a series of demands related to racial reparations, and threatened consequences if the demands weren't met, The Daily Wire reported.

On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck detailed the letter's list of demands and threats, and pointed out that these tactics are strikingly similar to those we've seen during some of history's darkest chapters.

The letter, which was sent to businesses in the East Market District in downtown Louisville, listed demands such as ensuring that at least 23% of staff are black, providing race and inclusion training for all employees, displaying a written statement professing support for the BLM movement, buying at least 23% of inventory from black retailers, and submitting to external audit.

""Repercussions for non-compliance"" to these demands will result in sit-ins and protests being staged outside the business, social media smear campaigns, boycotts, negative media attention, and ""invasive reclamation,"" the letter threatened.



""So, I'm making quite a charge here, but I think it absolutely fits,"" Glenn said on the show. ""Carl Kaufman, the representation that was used by Hitler and his machine, he convinced the youth that they were the answer, they would finally take control, and they would bring equality. [Kaufman said] the Jews controlled everything, and because of the Jews, the Germans really didn't have any freedom. Because of the Jews, they couldn't do anything. They were held down by the Jews. He said, 'We're going to have to boycott those stores. And if those stores don't comply, we will keep our storm troopers outside of the doors.' And they did. They intimidated anyone who walked into those stores. They berated anyone who walked into those stores. They beat anyone who walked into those stores.""

""I told you once, that if America goes dark, we'll become the darkest nation ever in the history of the world,"" Glenn continued. ""Guys, we're allowing our nation to go dark. And we're doing it because of fear. Everybody knows this is wrong, but who is going to stand up against it?""

Glenn Beck: Taiwan is preparing for potential WAR with China — but will Biden do ANYTHING?,"Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu is now warning that his nation is preparing for war with China after Beijing flew a record number of warplanes over Taiwanese territory. Wu reached out to another country for help, but it wasn't the United States.

In a video, Wu urged Australia to help prepare for a possible invasion, but gave the U.S. no mention.



""The defense of Taiwan is in our own hands, and we are absolutely committed to that. And if China is going to launch a war against Taiwan, we will fight until the end. And that is our commitment. And, of course, during this period of time, we would like to exchange with other countries for security cooperation,"" Wu said on ABC News In-depth's China Tonight program. ""We would like to engage in security or intelligence exchanges with other like-minded partners, Australia included, so that Taiwan is better prepared to deal with the war situation. And so far, our relations with Australia is very good. And that is what we appreciate it for.""

On ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" Glenn, Pat Gray, and Stu Burguiere discussed whether or not America would do anything during such a conflict — because it sure seems like President Joe Biden is more focused on working with China to fight climate change. Plus, why did China just cut off all cryptocurrency?

Russia Ukraine food shortages,"Record price hikes could soon see another huge spike — this time on wheat-based grocery items in particular — as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine coincides with the crop season for one of the world's most essential food sources.

Fifteen percent of all global calories come from wheat and rice, and one-third of the world’s wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. The crop season for wheat is right now, but very little farming currently is occurring as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on for a second month.

On the radio program, Glenn Beck broke down the importance of this statistic — plus many more — and explained why these numbers could even point to a possible famine by the end of the year.

""When you're looking at food, understand that 15 percent of all global calories come from wheat and rice … and one-third of all of our wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine,"" Glenn explained. ""The next stat you need to understand is ... the supply chain for food is 90 days. We have 90 days worth of food in the supply chain and ... if it stops, let's say for some reason stop all farming, we would have 90 days left of food worldwide. Okay? Now, 25 percent of all global production is food. We're about to lose 12 percent of that production. That means, we're losing half of our food supply,"" he added.

""Now, the bigger problems [are] fertilizer and energy. The energy price to run the tractors, to run the trucks, to run everything else. And the price of phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. Those are the three major things we use to make fertilizer ... this is causing so much stress on the farmers that farmers all around the world are not planting their fields. They are reducing the acreage, because without fertilizer, you're not growing much. So why plant all those fields?"" Glenn continued.

""So far, the price of corn has doubled. Soybeans [and] wheat are skyrocketing. The strategic food reserves, in some parts of the world, are now opening,"" he warned. ""We'd better have perfect weather all over the world, because if things continue the way they are and don't turn around quickly, hundreds of millions of people will experience famine by the end of the year.""

Glenn went on to detail what you can do now to prepare. Watch the video below to hear Glenn break it down. Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

"Mike Pompeo: Biden MUST hold Putin accountable for cyberattacks, 'This is an attack on America'","President Joe Biden and world leaders are spending the week discussing the biggest issues across the globe. But Mike Pompeo, former secretary of state during the Trump administration, believes more needs to be done.

Pompeo joined the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Tuesday to talk about President Biden's upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and to explain why he believes it's not just ""appropriate,"" but necessary to hold Putin accountable for the recent cyberattacks on the Colonial Pipeline and the JBS meat processing company.

Pompeo said it's likely that ""at the very least"" Putin turned a blind eye to the major attacks against U.S. infrastructure. He stressed that the Biden administration should not abandon private businesses in the face of these ransomware hacks, but rather do everything possible to make sure those businesses' assets are secure from future invasions.

""This is an attack on America,"" Pompeo said. ""It came through an attack on a commercial enterprise, but the capacity for pipelines to move product around on our east coast is an American national security interest.... We have to help these businesses protect their systems, and then there has to be a national effort to impose costs on those who put American lives at risk by denying available product around our country.

""Putin, at the very least, is turning a blind eye to [the cyberattacks], probably more. So, it's appropriate to hold Vladimir Putin and the Russians accountable for the actions taking place inside of their country,"" he added. ""We have to do it, and there are tools by which we can.""

Rand Paul: President Trump did NOT give Turkey the 'green light' to invade Syria,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to discuss the recent conflict in the Middle East, and to explain why he stands by President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Northern Syria.

President Trump has faced intense criticism from both Republicans and Democrats after announcing earlier this month that the United States would pull American troops out of Syria ahead of a Turkish offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces. Critics claim the the president gave Turkey the ""green light"" to launch an attack against the Kurds in Syria. But Paul says we need to look back at the region's history before we make assumptions about present day events.

""People need to remember the beginning of the Syrian war,"" Paul said. ""For years and years, it was Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton, both on the same side, both supporting Sunni extremists against Assad. Now, Assad is no angel but most of the Christians in the country actually sided with Assad and had been a minority religion protected by Assad's government for decades. The Sunni extremists that we supported, or our government supported ... if those people had taken over, my fear is that their ideology would have been closer to the ISIS caliphate, than it would have been anything that the West is known. It's a very complicated situation.""

Paul noted the important difference between Syrian and Iraqi Kurds. ""The Syrian Kurds, their political ideology is socialism. In fact, the Kurdish Workers' Party is socialist and terrorist within Turkey. Interestingly, the Iraqi Kurds, who have been our friends and have some autonomy in Iraq, don't like the Syrian Kurds, and actually have an arrangement in Turkey where they've turned over Kurdish Worker Party terrorists back to Turkey,"" he added.

""The Iraqi Kurds have a good relationship with Turkey currently,"" continued Paul. ""I think the irony of this is, if you care about the Kurds, it actually may turn out that in the last 24 hours there is an alliance between Assad and the Kurds developing. And that maybe the Syrians can convince the Turks that they will patrol their country. There will be no Kurdish incursions into Turkey, but there need be no Turkish incursions into Syria. And maybe there could be a development of a semi-autonomous region ... maybe there could be some peace. ""

Paul argued that President Trump did not give Turkey the ""green light"" to invade. Rather, Turkey's President Erdoğan likely told the president he was planning to invade one way or the other, and President Trump had to decide whether or not it was wise to leave our 50 or so U.S soldiers in the way of a military invasion.

Does Joe Biden need to eat a Snickers or is he just OLD?,"According to Joe Biden, Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices worldwide. The president claims that 70 percent of the increase in inflation was the consequence of Putin's price hike because of the impact on oil prices.

However, the notable thing about Biden's speech is less about the words he said and more about how he said them.

Glenn and Stu address Biden's agitated state on Friday's radio program with a question. ""Has anybody noticed how much of an old 'get off my lawn' man Biden is these days?"" Glenn is not the only person to notice that Biden might need to eat a Snickers bar.

Multiple instances involve Biden making an aggressive or accusatory statement about a member of Congress or a member of the press, then lashing out in angry denial.

Stu explains that everyday interactions get frustrating when you start to lose your marbles.

Glenn considers that it might be time for Biden to get a metal detector and fill his days with walks on the beach.

"Locked down Shanghai residents leap to their deaths, and Biden remains silent","The world — along with the Biden administration — SHOULD be outraged about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the destruction caused by President Putin. But there's another ongoing crisis that deserves just as much furor from around the world — yet President Biden remains silent.



On Thursday's program, Glenn details what's currently happening in Shanghai, China, where millions of residents have been forced into their homes — without food — due to strict COVID lockdown measures. People are suffering, but pets are also being thrown in trash cans and clubbed to death. Dogs and cats, in trash bags, set out on the curb like garbage.

The CCP's use of force to keep people in their homes and left to starve is even more disturbing. Lockdowns were meant to last four days, but have lasted two weeks and counting. Shanghai residents are suffering immeasurably, and many of them have already succumbed to the Chinese government's brutality over the last week.

""This is like watching what happened at our World Trade Center on 9/11, except this isn't a fire,"" Glenn said. ""These people are just trying to escape from the government, the lockdown, and hunger.""

We must demand our President speak out against this tragedy because if he doesn't, it further proves his administration has been bought and sold by the Chinese Communist Party.

Rep. Tlaib claims Palestinians tried to 'create a safe haven for Jews' after Holocaust. Glenn Beck has a little history lesson for the U.S. Congresswoman.,"During the Yahoo News podcast ""Skullduggery"" on Friday, Freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) made yet another shocking anti-Semitic statement, this time about the Holocaust giving her a ""calming feeling"" whenever she thinks about it. She went on to claim ""it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people's passports. And, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews.""

Here's her statement starting at about 28 minutes into the interview:

""There's always kind of a calming feeling, I tell folks, when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people's passports. And, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time. And, I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that, right, in many ways, but they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them.""

On Monday's radio show, Glenn Beck reacted to the Congresswoman's stunningly anti-Semitic and historically inaccurate remarks.

""This is incredible on so many levels,"" Glenn said. ""Let's not rewrite history here. First of all, Israel was the Jewish homeland for thousands of years, and facts don't care about your feelings. The Jews began migrating back toward their homeland before the Holocaust, in the late 1800s, there was a movement to go back. The Balfour Declaration in 1917 legislation supported a two state solution. The Palestinians rejected that and got violent.""

Glenn goes on to note the Peel Commission of 1937, the Palestinian alliance with the Nazi's during World War II, a post-WWII invasion of Israel in 1942, and the Six-Day War in 1967 -- all instances of historically documented Palestinian hostility against the Jews.

""So what gives Tlaib this 'calming feeling'?"" asked Glenn. ""I'd just like to know.""

Putin ally Aleksandyr Dugin's daughter killed in car bombing,"We still don’t know who was behind the car bombing that killed the daughter of Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent Russian ultranationalist and alleged ally of President Vladimir Putin, on a highway outside of Moscow on Saturday. But whether it was a foreign strike or an inside job, it could have a devastating effect on the world.

On the radio program Monday, Glenn Beck warned this could be an ""Archduke Ferdinand"" moment and talked about why he believes ""we need to be very careful, very prayerful, and prepared.""

""I believe this war with Russia, this proxy war, is going to end up being Biden's biggest failure and largest criminal scandal in American history,"" Glenn began, going on to suggest it could also lead to ""the end of the western way of life if everything goes wrong, God forbid.""

It appears that Dugin, who is often called ""Putin's brain,"" was the intended target of the attack, but a last-minute decision to switch cars put Dugin's daughter, Daria Dugina, in the doomed vehicle at the time of the explosion. Now, Russia is blaming both America and Ukraine, while Dugin is calling for revenge and for Russia to ramp up attacks on Ukraine.

""[Ukraine President] Zelenskyy has warned of a nastier phase of war as Russia says the bombing was a contract killing from Ukraine,"" Glenn explained. ""If Putin escalates this war ... I believe [the United States] will respond. I urge you to pray for the president and those in power around him,"" he added.

""A war at this time ... is the ultimate way to change the world,"" Glenn said. ""Imagine if we had a devastating war. That's how worlds change. That's how everything changes.""

He continued, ""I hope this isn't it, and I don't think it is, but we don't know. I have been saying for a very long time that the next war will be fought in such a way that it will sneak up on you and we'll have an 'Archduke Ferdinand moment.' Nobody knew who Archduke Ferdinand was and we went into World War I over it. Nobody in the world really knows who Aleksandr Dugin is. I hope he's not the guy and this isn't the reason, but you need to know who he is because ... he is wildly dangerous.""

""I tend to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Pray for your country, and pray for guidance and peace,"" Glenn said.

Glenn Beck russia ukraine,"Something regarding Russia's invasion into Ukraine — and the way the west responded to it — hasn't made sense to Glenn Beck since the chaos all began.

While Russia is increasing its nuclear preparedness and while western oil markets are struggling amid sanctions, the Biden administration closed yet another avenue for oil here in the United States. Western countries have also blocked certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network, but that comes with a potentially devastating catch for the U.S. too.

Glenn has been carefully combing through the details of the struggle between Russia and Ukraine: Which countries have backed Russian President Putin, new ways the world is standing against Russia, and what Ukrainian politicians predict may be coming next. But some of the so-called ""facts"" just ""don't make sense,"" he observed. For example, why didn’t Putin immediately destroy internet access in Ukraine to confuse both citizens and its military? And why did world leaders wait several days before enacting SWIFT sanctions?

In this clip, Glenn starts to piece the puzzle together: It's the first time the western world has formed such a powerful ""coalition"" — including multiple public-private partnerships between banks, big corporations, and world governments — in response to foreign disputes. But the way world leaders banded together demonstrates what may be coming for us all: The Great Reset. And now, proponents of the World Economic Forum's masterplan have a crisis on their hands they likely will not let go to waste.

Zelenskyy and wife take a break from war to pose for Vogue,"Between courageously defending their nation in the face of Russia’s brutal invasion and the non-stop rigors of cashing in on all those billions of U.S. aid dollars, it's a wonder that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife Olena Zelenska were able to find the time for a little photo shoot with Vogue magazine.

The magazine shared a few photos from the upcoming October 2022 issue on social media Wednesday.

People on Twitter seemed duly impressed:

On ""The News & Why It Matters"" Wednesday, BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales, BlazeTV host Elijah Schaffer of ""Slightly Offens*ve,"" and head writer and researcher for Glenn Beck Jason Buttrill discussed the ""portrait of bravery"" and asked, ""How many billions of dollars did the U.S. send Ukraine again?""

Abbott shuts down ABC host with reality check when she tries to shift blame for border crisis,"On “The Rubin Report” this week, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a video clip of ABC News’ Martha Raddatz attempting to convince Americans that Republican rhetoric from the likes of former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is to blame for the ever-worsening crisis at the southern border — not the Biden administration's policies.

""You talk about the border wall. You talk about open borders. I don't think I've ever heard President Biden say, 'We have an open border, come on over.' But the people I have heard said it are you, or former President Trump, or Ron DeSantis,"" Raddatz said to Abbott on ABC's ""This Week.""

""That message reverberates in Mexico and beyond. So they do get the message that it is an open border, and smugglers use all those kinds of statements,"" she added.

""It was known from the time that Joe Biden got elected — that Joe Biden supported open borders,"" Abbott replied. ""It is known by the cartels that have sophisticated information, whether the Biden administration is going to enforce the immigration laws or not. It's known across the world, but most importantly known among the cartels.""

Raddatz wasn't quite ready to give up. ""And how do you play into that? What can you do better?"" she asked.

""We have every level of government doing everything we can to prevent people from coming into the country illegally, or repelling them, or arresting them and putting them behind bars,"" Abbott stated.

""Do you see what [Raddatz] just did there?"" Dave asked after playing the clip. ""She's saying to Greg Abbott, who has all these Texas border towns, she's saying because you guys say that Biden has an open border, that's why people are coming. Not because of Biden's actions. So she's trying to blame the people who are calling out the problem, for the problem itself.""

He added, ""She completely flips the reality ... it's not Biden who says 'open borders.' It's you guys — who are not in charge of the border. It's you, Greg Abbott. It's you, Ron DeSantis. It's you, Donald Trump. And that's what the migrants hear ... and that's why they're coming. It's such an extraordinarily subtle, pernicious distortion of the truth. Gross, disgusting, but this is what they do to all Republicans.""

'Are you for real?!' AOC melts down when asked why she isn't talking about 'kids in cages' anymore,"On the latest episode of ""The Rubin Report,"" BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talked about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) now-viral meltdown after she was asked why she's been ignoring the ""kids in cages"" and the border crisis during the Biden administration.

Dave shared the Instagram Live video showing how Ocasio-Cortez responded when a question was posted that said, ""Why are you not addressing the border crisis and the kids in cages like you used to?"" In response, the socialist congresswoman pivoted to a bizarre rant about the term ""surge,"" the climate, and white supremacy.

""Are you for real?"" Ocasio-Cortez exclaimed in response to the question. ""So, let's talk about this because much of our national conversation, which is not a conversation, about immigration, is driven by people who could not care less about immigrants. So often, people want to say, 'Why aren't you talking about the border crisis?' or 'Why aren't you talking about it in this way?' Well, we're talking about it, they just don't like how we're talking about it.



""Because it's not a border crisis,"" she continued. ""It's an imperialism crisis, it's a climate crisis, it's a trade crisis, and also, it's a carceral crisis. Because, as I have already said even during this term and this president, our immigration system is based on our carceral system.""

She went on to claim the use of the term ""surge"" is a ""white supremacist"" attempt to ""invoke a militaristic frame.""

""Just — gut check. Stop. Anyone who's using the word 'surge' around you, consciously, is trying to invoke a militaristic frame. And that's a problem. Because this is not a surge, these are children, and they are not insurgents. And we are not being invaded, which, by the way, is a white supremacist idea, philosophy, the idea that if an 'other' is coming in the population, that this is an invasion of who we are,"" she asserted.



""She is just awful,"" Dave said, visibly cringing. ""It's just over-emotive theater with her ... they [progressives] are using overly emotive, ridiculous language and a character actor to basically trick young people.""

Dave also discussed the New York Times' Trump and Biden double standards, how the mainstream media is ignoring declining COVID-19 infection rates after the lifting of the Texas mask mandate, a college professor being paid less because he's white, and California's COVID-19 restrictions that are finally being lifted.

Ron DeSantis says Biden is to blame for record-high gas prices,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) ripped into President Joe Biden over record-high gas prices, which the administration first blamed on supply disruptions from the COVID pandemic, then Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and, most recently, oil refineries in the United States.

Not only does the president not have any ""proactive solutions"" for skyrocketing gas prices, but his policies are the ""cause of a lot of it,"" DeSantis said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""Joe Biden came into office and declared war on American energy. We were energy independent for the first time in my life. When he came into office, he had sweeping executive orders to try to kneecap American energy production,"" DeSantis began.

""This is a global market, it's not just the U.S., but [Biden] has made it way worse here in this country,"" he continued. ""They will not reverse course. This is just a religion for them to be attacking energy production in the United States, and people are paying at the pump like never before. It's hammering blue-collar people, working people because ... it impacts everything in the economy.""

""There's also the fact that they printed trillions of dollars that we didn't have,"" DeSantis added. ""Those two factors have created a really a hellish scenario and now we're on the precipice of — if we're not already in — a formal recession. Maybe that won't happen, but I think everyone's looking at it and saying, 'under Biden, with his policies, he's going to plunge this country into a recession.""

On a recent episode of ""The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin predicted that DeSantis' ""political sanity and rationality"" would be a ""gold mine"" for conservatives in the upcoming midterm elections.

""Republicans [could] really turn this thing around, and that's why I'm feeling good about the world right now,"" Dave said. ""Opportunity is right in front of us, but we have to grab it.""

Psaki desperately defends Biden inflation,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin reacted to White House press secretary Jen Psaki's desperate attempt to convince Americans that a year ago nobody could possibly have predicted today's soaring inflation.

""We know, if we look at the recent inflation data, a per-, a large-, depending on which data you look at, two-thirds to even 70 percent of inflation data is a result of energy prices,"" Psaki stammered. ""A- a- large part of that is the result — and, and, and Chairman Powell has spoken to this and Secretary, um, Secretary Yellen has also spoken to this — as a result of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and the impact on the gloyal-, global energy markets. Those are all steps and impacts that I don't think anyone could have predicted a year ago.""

""Nonsense. Everyone could have predicted it,"" Dave commented.

""It's also a lie that this is all because of Putin ... we know that this isn't because of Putin, right. First off, prices were going up — we've covered this many times — gas prices were already up over a dollar before the the invasion of Ukraine. ... And do you think if you endlessly print money ... that the amount that you had first might start dropping? Well, that's what they've been doing. They endlessly print money,"" he added.

Vendors were hired to monitor and rate the performance of the Siri function, which is voice-activated and activates when muffled background noises are detected, including couples having sex, confidential conversations between doctors and their patients, and drug deals.

Apple gave the following statement to The Guardian:

""A small portion of Siri requests are analyzed to improve Siri and dictation. User requests are not associated with the user's Apple ID. Siri responses are analyzed in secure facilities, and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple's strict confidentiality requirements.""

Man breaks into home and fights with homeowner. But homeowner grabbed gun beforehand — and intruder loses.,"An Alabama homeowner woke up hearing noise in his residence late Monday night and saw a light on — so he grabbed his gun and checked things out, WAAY-TV reported.

Sure enough, the homeowner found a man searching through items in his Athens residence and a scuffle ensued, the station said, citing the Limestone County Sheriff's Office.

As you might expect, the fight was ultimately one sided. The homeowner shot the intruder, the sheriff's office told WAAY.

After authorities were called, the suspect was taken to a hospital. The sheriff's office didn't release the suspect's name, and the station said it didn't know his condition.

The same suspect allegedly wrecked his car about 10 p.m. Monday prior to the home invasion, WAAY reported.

'I would do what I had to do'

After the incident, neighbors told WAAY in a follow-up story that they're nervous — but fully behind the homeowner who pulled the trigger.

Kelly Lewis lives across the street from the home in question and told the station ""it's frightening. Very scary.""

Kelly Lewis Image source: WAAY-TV video screenshot

She added to WAAY, ""I don't blame them. I would do what I had to do. They were over there minding their own business and somebody came in there like that. I'd do what I had to do. I wouldn't want to shoot anybody. I'd start out low, and if they didn't want to go, then I'd start going up a little higher.""

Another neighbor, Amy Jackson, said she and her family are prepared if the same thing happens to them.

Image source: WAAY-TV video screenshot

""We've got our weapons, and my husband showed us what to do at all times,"" Jackson told the station. ""If anything like that happens, he told us what to do.""

"'This is like Alex Jones territory': Reporter DEMANDS evidence of stunning State Dept. claims, leaves spokesman stammering","Associated Press reporter Matt Lee was not about to let State Department spokesman Ned Price get away without providing evidence to back claims that Russia plans to film and broadcast fake videos to justify invading Ukraine.

At a media briefing Thursday, Price told reporters that the Biden administration suspects Russia is planning to produce and broadcast ""a video with graphic scenes of false explosions - depicting corpses, crisis actors pretending to be mourners, and images of destroyed locations or military equipment - entirely fabricated by Russian intelligence"" to justify a further invasion of Ukraine.

""Well, it's an action that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that,"" Lee said to Price. ""And I'm going to get to the next question here, which is, what is the evidence that — I mean, this is like, crisis actors? Really? This is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into now. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?""

Price and Lee then engage in a fruitless, albeit entertaining, back-and-forth in which Lee repeatedly asks for evidence to support these allegations, and Price repeatedly claims that the allegations themselves are all the evidence he needs.

The Hill's post of the exchange on Twitter has been retweeted nearly 10,000 times:

"Biden: Expect 'real' food shortages due to sanctions — oh, and sanctions never work","During a press conference in Brussels on Thursday, President Joe Biden admitted that food shortages are ""going to be real"" because that is ""the price of the sanctions"" that have been imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

""With regard to food shortages … it's gonna be real,"" Biden said. ""The price of the sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia. It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well. Including European countries and our country as well.""



Of course, we all know the incoming food shortages have absolutely nothing to with any of the Biden administration's policies.

















Minutes later, Biden was asked why the U.S. and other NATO nations are continuing to impose sanctions when ""deterrents didn't work.""

""Let's get something straight,"" snapped a visibly peeved Biden. ""I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter [Putin.] Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter.""

So, what is the point of sanctions if ""sanctions never deter""?

Also, President Biden and several administration officials representing him, have most definitely said that the sanctions are indeed intended to deter.

David Hogg Russia Ukraine,"Gun control activist David Hogg took to Twitter to share a brilliant new idea for how we can all help Ukraine as Russia continues its deadly, multi-front invasion: just find Russian soldiers on social media and dating apps and let them know ""how stupid the war is.""

This is but a small sample of the kind of genius we've come to expect from Harvard's special superstar. Case in point, here's Hogg's clever comeback when another Twitter user asked if he really thinks Russian soldiers are concerned with social media and dating apps during combat.

This didn't stop Hogg from continuing his own personal Twitter-assault on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

joy behar face plant,"Joy Behar apparently missed her chair and fell rather dramatically during the opening of Thursday's episode of ""The View.""

In video footage from the live show, the 79-year-old co-host was seen falling forward, then on her side, before fellow co-hosts rushed over to help her back up.

""Come on just stop, just stand,"" laughed Whoopi Goldberg.



""Twenty-five years that has never happened to me,"" Behar said, adding, “Who do I sue?”

While Behar is reported to be just fine after her fall, the mishap garnered mixed reactions on social media.

















Behar is no stranger to making headlines, for better or worse. Just last week, she was shredded for complaining that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might interfere with her plans to vacation in Italy. The previous week, Behar was caught maskless in public after declaring she'd keep wearing her mask indefinitely, even if the CDC eases their guidance.",https://www.theblaze.com/video/joy-behar-face-plant,2022-03-04
Joy Behar scared Russia Ukraine Italy,"“The View” co-host Joy Behar is so heartbroken and scared for the Ukrainians as Russia invades their country, potentially killing and displacing millions of Ukrainian citizens.

“Estimates are 50,000 Ukrainians will be dead or wounded and this is going to start a refugee crisis in Europe,” co-host Sonny Hostin said. ""We’re talking about 5 million people that are going to be displaced. It’s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.""

""Yeah,"" Behar agreed. ""“I’m scared of what’s gonna happen in Western Europe, too. You know, you just, you plan a trip, you wanna go there. I’ve wanted to go to Italy for four years and I haven’t been able to make it because of the pandemic, and now this, you know? It's like, who's gonna, what’s gonna happen there?”

Yes, she REALLY said that. It's hard to believe, we know, so here's the video:





Keep in mind that this is the same sanctimonious snob who on Wednesday likened the ""traitorous behavior"" of former President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists after Trump claimed the Ukraine invasion ""never would have happened"" if he was in office.

“A lot of people in the GOP right now are buying this lie, that [Trump] would have solved the problem. He would have said, ‘Here. Here is Ukraine, take it. And I’m gonna build a casino there any minute now,'” Behar said. “The traitorous behavior that’s going on right now on the right is just, it’s unbelievable to me ... for having grown up in a country that fought this fascism, we are now becoming the people that we fought!”

Behar the hypocrite was also spotted in a crowded public setting without a mask on after announcing on ""The View"" that she'll keep wearing a mask in crowded places “indefinitely” — regardless of what health officials say.

Pre-dawn FBI raid on Journalist at direction of Biden's DOJ could backfire,"Journalist Lara Logan tweeted about her first livestream with Project Veritas' President James O'Keefe. In a separate tweet, Logan amplified footage caught on a hidden camera of an FBI raid conducted at the home of O'Keefe and two other Project Veritas journalists. The caption for Logan's tweet read, ""Unconstitutional pre-dawn FBI Raid on Project Veritas journalist shows armed agents clutching weapons, tossing belongings, and ransacking home at the direction of Biden DOJ.""

The raids occurred in November of 2021. According to O'Keefe, the government's invasion of their First Amendment Rights should send shivers down the spine of every journalist. O'Keefe vowed he would continue to fight for the rights of all journalists.

What else?

The ACLU is by no means a friend to Project Veritas, calling the tactics used by O'Keefe as ""disgraceful deceptions"" that ""reasonable observers might not consider to be journalism at all."" But even the ACLU agreed this raid set a precedent that could have ""serious consequences for press freedom.""

What do you think? Did the FBI abuse its authority? Watch the video for more details..

Putin pretaped declaration of war on Ukraine,"According to reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""live"" broadcast declaring war against Ukraine was pre-taped on Monday, sparking concerns that the large-scale invasion was already planned but ""postponed for reasons unknown.""

Putin announced a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine and issued a chilling warning for President Joe Biden and NATO not to intervene during what appeared to be a live broadcast on state TV Thursday. But according to several reports, the announcement was actually filmed three days earlier.

""Putin's speech about the declaration of war was recorded on the evening of February 21, on Monday. You can verify this by downloading the video from the Kremlin website and checking its properties,"" read a translated tweet from Russia's Novaya Gazeta.





Additionally, Russian-based Conflict Intelligence Team noted on Twitter that ""Putin's clothes [during Thursday's broadcast] match his clothes at the meeting of the Russian Security Council on February 21 ….""





""This suggests that a large-scale invasion of Ukraine was planned for February 22, but was postponed for reasons unknown to us,"" CIT added.",https://www.theblaze.com/video/putin-reportedly-taped-declaration-of-war-against-ukraine-days-before-live-broadcast,2022-02-24
Mark Levin Trendiing on Twitter,"Mark Levin was trending on Twitter Monday morning for comments about President Joe Biden's weak handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I mean, Biden is the so-called commander in chief. He is a disgrace and disaster,"" Levin said. Adding that Biden ""actually has the Russians negotiating with the Iranians on a nuclear deal with us.""



On Sunday's episode of ""Life, Liberty & Levin"" on Fox, Mark expressed that ""[Biden] puts more sanctions on the American oil industry and no sanctions on the Russian oil industry as I speak. What kind of a fool does that when we can use oil to debilitate the Russian economy, the Putin economy, and war machine, rather than debilitate you, Mr. and Mrs. America?

""We do have a damn fool in the White House, there's no question about that, and we should be muscling up our military for any possibilities. We're not. Despite spending trillions and trillions of massive debt, we are not muscling up the United States military. Russia, China, Iran, the axis of evil, the real axis of evil that now exists.""

Twitter exploded with mixed reviews of Levin's take on Biden's weak leadership. Some commenters agreed with Mark, while others threw obnoxious tantrums. Check out the comments on these tweets.

Russian mobile crematoriums,"Russia reportedly has ""mobile crematoriums."" Yes, crematoriums on wheels that follow along behind troops as they continue to advance into Ukraine, which could be used to hide evidence of the number of casualties, according to a Fox News report.

The British Ministry of Defense released chilling footage that revealed the inner-workings of Russia's horrifying motorized incinerators designed to ""get rid of dead soldiers"" and ""avoid sending body bags back home.""

“If I was a soldier, and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield in a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or a father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was a mobile crematorium, I’d be deeply, deeply worried,” said U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in the video shared by the Telegraph on Wednesday.
