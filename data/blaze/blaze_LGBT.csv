"Musk claims his 'pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,' prompting furious backlash","Twitter CEO Elon Musk managed to simultaneously enrage two ostensibly enmeshed groups Sunday with a single tweet, poking fun at conformity to LGBT activist pronoun conventions and calling for the outgoing director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to be prosecuted.

Although the tech magnate routinely agitates leftists online, Musk was evidently signaling something more significant with this particular tweet: that the forthcoming ""Twitter Files"" may provide some damning insights into an internationally recognized lockdown and vaccine advocate whose agency funded dangerous gain-of-function work in Wuhan.

Fauci files

Musk tweeted ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci"" on Sunday. The tweet received over one million likes and was retweeted over 167,000 times.

Musk's humorous call for the criminal prosecution of Fauci took place the morning after Stanford professor and Great Barrington Declaration proponent Dr. Jay Bhattacharya visited Twitter's headquarters.

The second edition of the ""Twitter Files"" released last week revealed how the previous Twitter regime had placed Bhattacharya on a ""Trends Blacklist,"" preventing his cautions about the harms posed to children by lockdowns from circulating online.



Twitter was not, however, alone in trying to silence criticisms of lockdowns and government overreach. Fauci was involved in an effort to engage in a ""takedown"" of Bhattacharya's anti-lockdown declaration.

TheBlaze previously reported that in response to a plea by former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins to issue a ""quick and devastating takedown"" of the Great Barrington Declaration, Fauci dutifully pushed a British article claiming, ""There is no 'scientific divide' over herd immunity"" and alleging there would not be additional lockdowns.

The article circulated by Fauci put down Bhattacharya and other highly esteemed experts, casting doubt on anti-lockdown concerns.

When asked whether Fauci's invocation would be explained in a new ""Twitter Files"" part, Musk answered in the affirmative.

The Twitter CEO also posted a meme in which Fauci, Photoshopped in for the conniving and morally bankrupt ""Lord of the Rings"" character Gríma Wormtongue, begs President Joe Biden — swapped in to replace the addled King Théoden of Rohan — for ""JUST ONE MORE LOCKDOWN.""

The timing of Bhattacharya's visit, his mention in last week's ""Twitter Files,"" previous indications that Fauci had a hand in silencing him, and Musk's admission together indicate that Fauci will be the subject of a forthcoming series of insider Twitter insights of potential interest to the lawmakers poised to investigate him in the new year.

Backlash from Fauci fans and pronoun pushers

Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly tweeted in response, ""Elon, please don’t mock and promote hate toward already marginalized and at-risk-of-violence members of the #LGBTQ+ community. They are real people with real feelings. Furthermore, Dr Fauci is a dedicated public servant whose sole motivation was saving lives.""

Musk did not mince words in his reply, tweeting, ""I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.""

The New York Post reported that Musk may be sensitive to the consequences of the pronoun game and the ""neo-Marxist"" transgender agenda it is part of as a result of his 18-year-old son's decision to identify as a woman.

""As for Fauci, he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo,"" added the Twitter CEO.

According to the CDC's ""COVID Data Tracker,"" 1,080,472 Americans have died with or from the virus.

Democrat Sent. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) snapped back with a defense of Fauci, whom Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) suggested lied to Congress, saying, ""I’m a big fan of Dr. Fauci and how he’s calmly guided our country through crisis. Re Musk tweet? Courting vaccine-deniers doesn’t seem like a smart business strategy, but the issue is this: could you just leave a good man alone in your seemingly endless quest for attention?""



Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips (Minn.) wrote, ""It’s America. You can select any pronouns you damn well please. But Anthony Fauci has likely saved more human lives than any living person in the world. Shame on you.""

Former CIA director and Obama White House official John Brennan similarly rushed to defend Fauci, calling him a ""national hero who will be remembered for generations to come for his innate goodness & many contributions to public health.""

Brennan, signatory of the Oct. 19, 2020, letter erroneously claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop story was likely Russian disinformation, added, ""Despite your business success, you will be remembered most for fueling public hate & divisions. You may have money, but you have no class.""

Although Musk's tweet was denounced by a handful of high-profile pronoun- and Fauci-defenders, millions of people apparently liked it, including Sen. Rand Paul.

Paul wrote, ""Fauci’s resignation should not prevent a full-throated investigation into the origins of the pandemic. He must be required to testify under oath regarding any discussions he participated in concerning the Wuhan lab leak. His policies destroyed lives.""

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote, ""Kudos to @elonmusk for looking beyond the propaganda.""



Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, noted that the ""Left's hysterical response to @ElonMusk 's criticism of Fauci (along with slight mockery of transgender extremism) is something else. That they have so much invested in Fauci's authoritarian approach to public policy speaks volumes ...""",https://www.theblaze.com/blaze-news/elon-musk-says-his-pronouns-are-prosecute-fauci,2022-12-12
Eight Republicans join House Democrats to pass Equality Act to add more protections for sexual orientation and gender identity,"The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Equality Act by a vote of 236 to 173, with eight Republicans crossing the aisle to vote in favor of the bill.

What is this bill?

The bill would include both sexual orientation and gender identity under the protections offered by both the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is already illegal for employers to discriminate against people based on either of these criteria, but the bill's authors said that these existing protections did not go far enough.

Conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation, have expressed concern that the Equality Act could force religious doctors and hospitals to perform sex change surgery, and that it would preempt the rights of parents in cases where their minor children identify as transgender.

Who voted for it?

Eight Republicans joined Democrats in voting for this bill: Reps. Susan Brooks (Ind.), Mario Diaz-Balart (Fla.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Will Hurd (Texas), John Katko (N.Y.), Tom Reed (N.Y.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), and Greg Walden (Ore.). Fitzpatrick and Katko were co-sponsors of the bill, as well as Puerto Rico GOP Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. Representatives from U.S. territories can co-sponsor bills and vote on them in committee, but are not permitted to take part in the floor vote.

What happens next?

While Democrats hold a majority in the House, Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. In addition, at least one Democrat — West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — has said that he will not be supporting the bill. Since Vice President Mike Pence would almost certainly cast his tie-breaking vote against this legislation, this means that Democrats would have to ensure the support of all remaining senators from their own party and convince five Republicans to join them in order for the bill to pass.",https://www.theblaze.com/breaking/eight-republicans-join-with-democrats-to-pass-equality-act,2019-05-17
Word is bond for Debra Soh,"Debra Soh has a recurring dream that she's on a rollercoaster, and she can't get off. She doesn't like rollercoasters. She hates them. So the dream has always filled her with unease. But what she's learned to do when she finds herself trapped in a clanking iron seat as it inches up a mechanical hill, toward a freefall, is to give in, to enjoy it, or at least to believe that the plummet won't be so bad.

This attitude has blossomed outward, into her waking life.

""I think in general,"" she says, ""if you experience any discomfort or pain, the only way you can overcome that is to embrace it and say, 'This might be something I don't like, but what is it that I can take from this?'""

A few hours ago she was in Canada; now she's 1,400 miles from home, in Dallas, Texas, at Mercury Studios, for The Glenn Beck Podcast. She is surrounded by cameras and microphones, perched at a wooden table across from Glenn Beck, who just asked her about furries, the subculture of people who dress up as animals, presumably for sexual reasons. Glenn's voice lingers, ""Is it a sex thing?""

She pinches the black gemstone of her forefinger ring, then wiggles it down to a riprap of knuckle — lingering, caught in self-interrogation, careful and specific with her answers: Debra Soh is thinking.

The metallic air constrains with a thud of anticipation.

No, she says. It is not about sex, she says. It is about community.

Then she says that the truth matters.

Word is bond for Debrah Soh. As a sexologist, neuroscientist, former academic, journalist, and columnist for Playboy, she is answering the thorniest questions we're all curious to ask but eager to avoid. The ones that make us blush or cringe, the ones about gender and rape and manhood, about wayward feminists and child sex robots.

Before the podcast, in the makeup room, draped into her red vinyl chair, Soh was warm-voiced and kind and sweet. Now, an hour later, she stares ahead through dark eyes and talks with deliberate pauses. Even her vocabulary has shifted. The effortless warmth that lilts at the end of every sentence has been replaced by many-syllabled words spoken in a lower timbre. I'm not calling her disingenuous. The opposite, in fact: Her tone accords to the contextual rigors of her place and setting, an emotional intelligence that feels multilingual.

Behind Soh, the jointed arms of a camera-rig spook up like robotic graveyard willows. A doting forge of halogen yellow shimmers from high-watt lamps, off into Tramadol bright, through air too cold to carry any kind of a scent. It's oddly quiet on Stage 19, which was once used as a film set for ""Barney & Friends,"" the children's show with adults in animal costumes, humans pretending to be a goofy purple dinosaur and his reptilian lackeys. And as Soh lingers in thought, her reticence is haunted by similar goons, who are cloaked instead by generic usernames and anime profile picture. They are hidden everywhere, even here, prowling in the shadows among the ghosts of Barney and Mother Goose and Baby Bop.

The time is 1:00 p.m., but there are no windows here so you wouldn't know it, as Soh shifts her bone-ribboned hands like two feathering wands. She is the only woman in a room full of men, talking about how it's okay for men to be men, saying that women don't want a man who won't be a man.

When she was a child, Soh had gender dysphoria: All her friends were boys. People called her a tomboy. She hated girly clothes and dolls and pink of any kind. She loathed being female. She enjoyed sprinting around the house with a He-Man sword and standing up to pee. Her parents were supportive. They never forced her to be a boy or a girl. They let her dress however she wanted. They let her shave her head. At the time, she was convinced that she'd been born in the wrong body. Then, as a teenager, she gravitated toward feminine clothing, grew her hair out, and carried a purse.

All her life, many of her best friends have been gay. She thinks of herself as having grown up as a straight girl in the gay community. Every June, she went to the Pride Parade with a raucous group. On one of these occasions, well before she'd ever even considered a career as a sexologist, an older gay friend told her: ""Don't be ashamed to talk about sex, because there's nothing shameful about it.""

On-air, she speaks with the same pointedness you find in her writing. She remains stoic, seemingly unaffected by the near-frost temperature of the studio, while — in reality — she's freezing. Everyone is. Only she's half their size! But, her being a professional, she has figured out exactly where and what the camera frames (from the tabletop up: the rest is hidden). So she clamps her thighs into a black jacket with bright silver zippers, a space heater at her feet. And hides any teeth-chatter or shivering. And rarely speaks in contractions. Preferring to separate one given word from another, so that each sentence is an assembly-line production of vowels, and fricatives, and silence.

She neither smiles nor laughs. But when Glenn asks about brain imaging, one of her areas of expertise, she breaks this stoniness, and her eyes bulge like imperative statements. Without meaning to, she rattles off medical jargon, something about the interstate-like pathways of this or that neural circuit. Glenn wobbles his head and shakes his hand and tells her to slow down and talk normal. A few minutes later, the podcast is over, and the set bustles to a close. Cameras being dismantled, lights unrigged, microphones probed and wires looped into circles.

Soh and I chat in her dressing room. It's mid-October of 2018, and the entire Western world is juiced with the word ""Kavanaugh"" (as in, Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh), amid allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when she was 15 and he was 17. Everyone must have an opinion about this situation — well, according to Twitter. And every opinion is an act of warfare, something people sacrifice friendships to maintain.

So, of course, the topic of Judge Brett Kavanaugh comes up at different parts of Soh's day, briefly.

But fleeting as it is conversationally, the Kavanaugh question bums around and undergirds the helpless platitudes that transform headline news into public opinion. Kavanaugh's confirmation did a number on the whole country. Doesn't matter who you are or what side of the barbed-wire gate you chose — or even if you shrimped out and played dead like a champ — a conflict of that intensity, as widespread and harsh, will glue itself to your thoughts until the next disaster plows into the nation's consciousness or fury, possibly even longer, and all the time all we want to know is how? and why? Because now more than ever people are desperate with questions. Debra Soh has answers. More important, she says them as a matter of principle.

""Honesty, intellectual honesty, is my most important virtue,"" she says. ""I think being honest with yourself, too, because that's important for personal growth, and in terms of how you interact with other people, and the kind of life that you live.""

As a college student, she loved studying the science of sex. Had a path laid out for herself: work as a researcher, then establish her own research lab, then her own research program. But, after more than a decade at university, having finally earned her Ph.D., she was overcome by a discouraging uncertainty about her future.

""I decided that the [academic] climate had changed so much that, for me, it wouldn't have been a rewarding path forward,"" she says. ""I just didn't see the point of myself being in an environment where I couldn't pursue interesting questions.""

The decision was by no means impetuous. She rummaged around for months. But it always came back to one thing: she felt threatened. What if she said the wrong thing? Which became, ""What is happening that I even have to ask that question?""

In 2014, on a whim, she attended the Furnal Equinox, Canada's largest furry convention, where nearly 1,000 furries had gathered in Toronto. (""When else would I get a chance to meet a bunch of furries?"") She wrote about the experience in an academic article titled ""A peek inside a furry convention"" for the journal ""Sexual Behavior."" Then ""Harper's Magazine"" ran it (""Below the Pelt""), and — just like that — Soh had a new career. Since then, it's just been hill work — lots of climbing. Building on her success as a journalist, she and Jonathan Kay created ""Wrongspeak,"" a podcast about ""the things we believe to be true but cannot say.""

So much of her life has been academic, and her writing has an at-times inflexible scholarly feel that delicately blends into personal stories. Like her Playboy article about her personal history with the gay community, how she writes confessionally, then weaves into an examination of sexologist Ray Blanchard and ""his theory of the fraternal birth order effect — the idea that gay men were, on average, more likely than straight men or lesbian women to have a greater number of older brothers."" (Blanchard's work inspired Soh to pursue sexology.)

One of her specialties is paraphilia, or ""atypical sexual interests"" like voyeurism, exhibitionism, and fetishism, which she neatly explains in this animated rundown for Men's Health. She takes a similar approach in ""Sex, Gender and Bullshit,"" a ten-part series by We the Internet TV. Of course, as a sexologist, she faces the inevitable question, the one you're probably thinking, about her own sex life — the awkward, ""So you must study all this kinky sex for personal reasons?"" People ask her every time. She politely, with humor, tells them that, despite her profession, her sex life could be classified as ""vanilla."" She leaves it at that.

Because, more than just a sexologist, she serves as a middleman for the rest of us. Like when she explains the difference between sex and gender in one of her Playboy columns:

Biological sex refers to whether we are male or female, based on our reproductive functions and anatomy. Gender is how we feel in relation to our biological sex. For 99 percent of us, our sex and anatomy dictate our gender; they are essentially the same thing.

With this definition, Soh addresses one of the overarching sexual complications of our era: the social environment is steamed, and we don't know about women or men anymore, not like we used to. Much of this is the result of legitimate and meaningful progress. In the last three years alone, the LGBT rights movement has launched millions of Americans straight up Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Human rights. Dignity. But many people, understandably, have been capsized by the pace of it, while also expected to be immediately in agreement with this at-times dauntingly new part of the mainstream. Especially transgenderism. The concept of gender fluidity alone has sent many heads into orbit. Partly because there's an academic tone to much of it that many people aren't used to or don't care for, and perhaps they're more overwhelmed with confusion than steeped in the hostility and bigotry that they are so often, unfairly, accused of.

Soh often jokes that talking about the science of sex should be no more scandalous than charting the dietary habits of geese: No controversy, just facts and data. Because sexology is meant to be a purely scientific study of human sexuality, absent of social issues and policy and theory. Not the case these days, she says, baffled that politics — from the left and the right — have entered sexology to begin with. But while many of Soh's ideas are taboo among the right, e.g. that pornography addiction does not exist and that pedophiles should be treated humanely, conservatives and libertarians have — so far — shown her warmth.

All day today, she's been hesitant to open up, as if afraid she'll misspeak. It becomes clear that the people she's afraid of are trans-activists, who comprise a small portion of the population here in America but whose persistence and conviction have driven the movement into ubiquity. As Soh sees it, while transgender rights have been positive for many people, the activism itself occasionally devolves into the very bullying it claims to oppose. (To be clear, Soh supports the transgender movement, but only when practiced by adults, i.e., surgery and hormone treatment should wait until adulthood, after puberty). Trans-activists have perfected online activism. They gather on Twitter, Reddit, and Tumblr, in niche communities, where they organize group efforts, resulting in the same kind of echo-chamber tribalism that you find among their ideological counterparts, e.g., men's rights activists (MRAs), incels (involuntary celibates), and MGTOWs (Men Going Their Own Way).

The news media support trans-activists far more than their right-leaning opposition — often for good reason — but this can also leave trans-activists unchecked. Which is problematic, given how they fight. They even attack ostensible allies, as seen by their disdain for TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists). TERFs believe that gender is a social construct assigned at birth and used to oppress women. Therefore, they argue, trans women are not in fact women, they are men, and, by dint of insisting otherwise, they are in fact flexing their male privilege over women. Trans-activists consider this belief transphobic and paint TERFs as bigots.

Opinions about trans-activists tend to be more extreme and intense than opinions about other activists. They're seen as heroes by some, tyrants by others. And they fight like they're cornered, with an air of invincibility.

Call it a matter of opinion, but I consider Dave Chappelle the cultural philosopher king of new America, the Voltaire of our time. Nobody owns him. Nobody tells him what to do. He probes America and people respond. He is fair, and sharp, and his comedy defies boundaries: it spares no one. Yet the trans-activists, with the help of journalists, got steamed about Chappelle's transgender jokes in a recent Netflix special: ""I support anyone's right to be who they want to be,"" he said. ""My question is: to what extent do I have to participate in your self-image?"" Then, on his next special, he doubled down with a marathon of transgender jokes. The retaliatory uproar was loud. ""Bigotry + Chappelle"" was a popular equation for a veritable flood of salty op-eds and exclamatory tweets.

Soh says that the problem in that situation was activists' inability to shrug off something they're offended by without making a show of their outrage.

Point being, trans-activists have repeatedly confronted Soh on social media and in op-eds, labeling her a concern troll who uses ""self-victimization"" and catastrophizes their confrontations, which they do not consider harassment. They have accused her of transphobia for a slew of reasons, most recently for discussing rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD), a theory that they consider transphobic. They have called her alt-right, even neo-Nazi, for her interest in the James Damore memo and her criticism of racial quotas at universities. Most of all, though, they hate her stance on gender dysphoria in children.

Specifically, they label her a troll for promoting the ""desistance"" approach to childhood gender dysphoria, an alternative to increasingly popular two-tier approach, which involves: 1) social transitioning: when a person changes their name and pronouns to fit their gender; and 2) physical transitioning: puberty blockers. (There's a serious debate about whether or not trans-activists actually support hormones and sex reassignment surgery as an option for children.) The 11 studies on desistance near-unanimously concluded that, in most cases, the adults who had had gender dysphoria as a child wound up being gay or bisexual, and happily cisgender, i.e. they no longer felt like they were in the wrong body.

In an article for HuffPost, trans-activist Brynn Tannehill argues that the ""desistance narrative is built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia,"" adding that the studies themselves are riddled with shoddy work, often the result of cruelty, even mockery, by researchers. She pries apart several of these studies' methodological errors. In 2015, trans-activists led a concerted effort to expose alleged anti-LGBT practices by psychologist Kenneth Zucker, who was in charge of desistance research at the Child and Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH in Toronto. They accused him of conspiring with hate groups to ""cure"" gay children with conversion therapy, among other things. The hospital fired Zucker and closed the Child and Gender Identity Clinic.

In his article about the convoluted politics of childhood gender dysphoria, Jesse Singal counters each of Tannehill's criticisms:

Every study that has been conducted on [desistance] has found the same thing. At the moment there is strong evidence that even many children with rather severe gender dysphoria will, in the long run, shed it and come to feel comfortable with the bodies they were born with.

Either way, many trans-activists just don't like desistance. Something about the haze of it. Like their reality is being overlooked, because no amount of data could explain how they feel. Transgender people suffer from anxiety and depression at an alarmingly higher rate than the rest of the population, even as children, which can result in self-harm, even suicide. Trans-activists often fault society for locking gender dysphoric children inside a physical reality that they don't belong to. Just as their opponents consider transitioning and non-binary parenting harmful to children, trans-activists see the reverse as destructive.

Soh doesn't buy their argument, says that their intentions are political, adding that she first noticed a frantic cultural shift toward trans-activism in 2015, around the time she wrote ""Why transgender kids should wait to transition."" She adds that previous data estimated that 3-in-1,000 Americans were transgender, and that that number has doubled in the past decade. ""Why is it that every [news] piece is telling parents that every child should transition?"" she asks. ""It wasn't as mainstream an idea as it is now. Like now, people almost take for granted that if a little kid says that they're the opposite sex, that, 'Of course, you should just let them transition. Tell them, ""I love you"" and affirm their feelings and help them transition.'""Her tone shifts, lower: ""I think many kids are going to be affected by this. We're going to see in 10 years, they are going to be changing their minds.""

In a rebuttal to some of Soh's major points, psychologists Lily Durwood and Kristina Olson counter the idea that trans-activists even hold such ideas about gender dysphoric children:

No one in mainstream medicine (or elsewhere, to our knowledge) is performing surgery on or providing hormones to prepubescent transgender children.

Of course, ""prepubescent"" is relative: some children begin puberty as young as 8 or 9. For Soh, that's still too young for any sort of medical intervention. Either way, she says, adults are enforcing ideology for political reasons. So much so, she says, that scientists, doctors, and mental health officials increasingly avoid the topic altogether. But she hasn't shied away, and she hasn't given up: ""I try to be optimistic and think that we'll come back from it,"" she says. ""That science will prevail, that reason will prevail. But it seems like, every day, every week, there's more and more misinformation moving us in the wrong direction. People almost take for granted that if a little kid says that they're the opposite sex, that, 'Of course, you should just let them transition.' But even if a kid says they want to be the opposite sex, why are we taking them at face-value? Kids say all kinds of things. Adults should be more responsible.""

Here's a quote from a trans-activist, whose blog includes a three-part series titled ""Debra Soh is really bad at trans science"":

Nearly all anti-trans scientific claims are unsound, outright false, or plainly misleading, including those made by the foremost voices of public transphobia.

This absolutist rhetoric makes it nearly impossible for anyone to challenge trans-activists (critics of any kind are seen as ""the foremost voices of public transphobia""). By traditional standards, such an approach would be considered fallacious, then discarded as nonsense. But ""tradition"" is one of the concepts that trans-activists are confronting. They tend not to see their rhetoric as filled with ad hominem attacks, but as truthful, justified an appropriate response to rhetoric that they consider bigoted and transphobic.

The whole thing is so damn confusing! Like a tug-of-war, and we onlookers become the little flag in the middle. How can two groups of people be so certain that they are right and their enemy is wrong? Where's the line between legitimate criticism and bullying, when discussing transgenderism? Are social media platforms and news media unreasonably biased in support of trans-activists? Or do trans people face so much vitriol that they need extra protection? Who's actually the intolerant or regressive one? Which side is the aggressor? Who's the victim? Who do we believe? And who actually has the power? How reasonable are trans-activists' expectations of the general public concerning pronoun usage, ""dead-naming,"" and, the real tricky one: whether or not it is transphobic for a cisgendered straight person not to be attracted to someone who has transitioned to the opposite sex? And does policy that supports these expectations violate the rights of anyone who disagrees? Even the basics are uncertain. Should our understanding of gender be social? Or biological? Is sexuality a social construct or a genetic reality? Are trans-activists actually stifling scientific advancement? Or are scientists' views on transgenderism actually outdated, bigoted, and fascistic? In other words, sex and gender have become more than just sex for many people. Now, it's about identity.

Soft-voiced, ""Why is it nowadays that there are so many things that have been deemed harmful or dangerous that we can't say or think them, even though they're true?"" asks Soh. ""I don't think this is a good way to live. And our culture is a mess right now. But I do hope it's going to come back to the middle. Because it always goes really far in one direction and then it slowly comes back.""

This is the credo of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web — Dave Rubin, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jordan Peterson, Gad Saad, Joe Rogan, and, now, Debra Soh.

""[IDW members are] portrayed by journalists like they're awful, demonic people,"" she says. ""And then when I meet them and talk to them, they're so genuinely kind. But that narrative is the reference point where most people are coming from.""

A few months ago she spent three hours on ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

""Rogan does the long-form interview because he wants to see, 'Do you actually know what you're talking about?'"" she says.

""Because it is easy for people to spout these platitudes, or to memorize what they are supposed to say. And then if you prod them and say, 'Well why do you think that? What is your evidence for that?' it usually it stops there. Especially in a three-hour interview. Eventually, what you really think and who you really are start to come out.""

As is the case with many of Rogan's guests, Soh has become politically homeless. She finds it surreal, the way her career keeps playing out. But, really, it is a sign of the times. Soh is a sign of the times.

* * *

She glances down at her watch's large, manly, statuesque face. Today has been all haste and timeline. A mechanical stride to it, careening from one motion-picture scene to another, onto the next full-scale stage with all new furniture and backdrops. She saunters to the Stage 3 for ""The News and Why It Matters."" Earlier, a few hours ago — an amount of time that seems impossible, given all that Soh has accomplished today—the studio was a cold, cold place, a few degrees from your breath in the air. Warmer, now. Maybe too warm — ah, jeez, too warm for sure — and behind the plywood walls, off-set, myself and a few others hide, sweating and vying for the chair under the A.C.'s jet stream.

The pine aroma of the set powders the nose. Forest-like, with hints of spray-paint and industrial glue. From the other side of the wall, the set appears to be a winter cabin. The way the elaborate panels and the roaring taxidermied bear seem real, and mechanical sounds whir like a thunderstorm and the floor has been stomped on for years, painted so many times that its edges look like gorgeous stones covered in minerals and pastel-tinted crystals. Backstep a few feet and the curtain shoots up. At the edge of snares and wire. Metal walkways four stories high. Risers, props — and every heavy thing has wheels. Everybody quiet at the same time, with the countdown for the show: five, four, three, two, and the silent one.

Under the cannonballs of stage-light, the show scoots to life.

Soh starts by saying that she's a liberal, but what does that even mean anymore? She has other elegant things to say, quietly. Behind the set, the control panel spurs with so many screens, each yawning into a different vision of the program. A few of us gaze at the show as it's being played out on tiny monitors, none of which emit sound, but we hear every on-screen person speaking because we're all in the same room.

At one point, maybe off-air, they start talking about sex robots and how, rumor is, there's going to be a robot brothel in Houston. Someone says that we better be careful: If the robots gain consciousness they're not gonna like being raped and abused. Someone else says that machines are just machines.

Strange future either way. But it's happening, and, oddly, the possibility of robot prostitutes signifies a masterful, nuanced eruption of human advancement. Because over the past twenty years, we have witnessed a rare event in human history. A monumental transformation last seen during the Industrial Revolution, when people's conception of the world — everything they knew — shifted. Our idea of life as part of a world designed and guided by God was stamped out by factories, motors, and interchangeable parts. Suddenly, the world had gears, steam, and corrupted air that billowed from smokestacks. People clustered nearer to each other, gawking as machinery rose up all around them. They were the creators, and their metal inventions were proof that they had become a new kind of God.

Similarly, now, we are realizing for the first time that we no longer belong to a mere world; we belong to a universe. And our understanding of this universe — everything we know — has shifted from the idea of the world as a machine, to the universe as a network: Boundless, infinite, uncaring, incomprehensible. It turns out that we, regardless of any inventions we claim, are the finite, mechanical contraptions, patterned by the unknowable, God-like network that always outlives us.

As soon as the show finishes, Soh trods back out through the swinging doors. As usual, the 75-foot-tall midway of Mercury Studios bustles with activity, always someone dashing from one studio to another, headsets on or thumbing at clipboards. Amid the chaos, Soh remains calm. All black clothing and twinkle-red stilettos, streaks of blonde down her shoulder-length hair. She peeks at the original Darth Vader mask in Glenn's office, curving her finger into her chin as she stares, then says, ""Until recently, I had considered myself a feminist.""

She wavers between the Darth Vader mask and the crowd of models down the hall, in an independent studio not affiliated with BlazeTV, as part of some photoshoot. A horror magazine, supposedly, and they are dressed in provocative costumes — one minute it's a lizard, the next minute it's Mrs. Claus, then a superhero or a jailbird in a shredded prison mini-dress. Tall, Amazonian women, who strut like they're on a platform. Early-to-mid 20s, but hard to tell with their Pharaoh-mask of makeup. They lurk into the studio for a while, then emerge an hour or so later to wander the hallway looking hungry and bored as Soh talks about the pitfalls of feminism in the #MeToo era.

""At the core it had some good points,"" she says. ""More recently, I think it does a disservice to women because it's teaching women to believe things about men and women that are not based in reality. I think most rational women have distanced themselves from feminism, because it stands for things that most rational women are not going to be okay with.""

In print, that quote reads harsh and a little arrogant. But the way she says it — it's like she is secretly heartbroken that a good friend abandoned her, and she misses her home. She says that, to succeed, feminism must embrace science. Then she waves her hand at an imaginary thing, at the invisible outline of feminism, as if asking it to please come back, and a woman in cheetah lingerie stares.

It's 4:15 p.m.; one last interview; in the radio studio. Since arriving here at 11:00 this morning, Soh has launched from one commotion to the next. By her own observation — about how Joe Rogan's marathon interviews reveal who the person actually is — any of her defenses are now down, cramped to a halt by fatigue, and this is Debra Soh at her realest. She is kind, and funny, and she spills lettuce from her salad as we talk.

Her voice tilts upward at the end of each sentence. Hulking over her, a massive camera strapped into a rail like a mechanical rabbit at a Greyhound race, and it suddenly — loudly — violently — thrashes to motion and starts groaning and spinning and flashing and shifting along a rail. Is it launching? Taking flight? It startles all of us and, for a moment, we stare horrifically at the animatronic life-form having a conniption fit, some weird machine with a mind of its own, a tiny black pontoon on a trapeze railway, careening upward always.

Then the little robot falls back to sleep.

""I used to be intimidated by controversial ideas,"" she says. ""When I first started writing, I always worried about what people would think. Now, I'm not okay to stay quiet. If I don't agree with something, I can't keep my mouth shut.""

Above all else, she believes in empathy, believes that people are empathic. She says she constantly asks herself, ""Am I doing enough?"" As in, is she doing enough to effect the change she wants to see, despite any risks?

As a teenager, she loved punk music. In her studded denim jacket and her blue mohawk, she felt alive at punk shows. The way violence always lingered, in the mosh pits and the stagedives and the motoring drumbeats. Yet, the moment someone fell down, the instant someone lost balance or got hurt, everybody stopped to make sure they were OK.",https://www.theblaze.com/contributors/word-is-bond-for-debra-soh,2019-06-24
Squires: Afghanistan failure demonstrates America’s identity crisis hurts the world,"The fall of Kabul and the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan are a stark reminder of how much identity matters to a country. Unfortunately, America's identity obsessions are major vulnerabilities that have been met with aggression from our adversaries and threaten the stability of our own nation.

The longest war in United States history is concluding in the worst way possible. A suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. servicemen and at least 60 Afghans in an attack on Aug. 26 outside Kabul's airport. This is yet another reminder of how quickly the situation in Afghanistan has descended into chaos, despite the best efforts of President Biden and top military officials to assure Americans that everything was under control.

Most Americans assume that the world's mightiest military would be able to train up a national Afghan Army over the course of nearly twenty years and prepare it to fight religious insurgency in its home country. Despite the U.S. military's best efforts, the Afghan Army disbanded once the national government collapsed earlier this month. The Taliban's blend of fundamentalist Islam and Pashtun cultural norms is a combination that would be completely foreign to the average American. Part of the reason the Taliban recaptured the country so quickly is because it is a lot clearer about who it is and what it believes than either the Afghan Army or the American politicians and military brass who are winding down the war.

America is battling an identity crisis because our ruling class and the people who identify with their beliefs have forgotten who we are. This is most clearly seen in our domestic political fights about CRT and vaccine passports, but it also has implications for how we engage the world. The American experiment of representative government, expressed through our constitutional republic, is not the default across the globe. We have enjoyed stable, orderly transitions of power for so long that we underestimate how hard it is to build a nation. We are equally unappreciative of the effort it takes to hold one together, especially one with such ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity.



The Taliban has deeply held religious principles, and its adherents are willing to die for them. Our leaders have trendy beliefs and don't even have the courage to debate them. American politicians included $10 million for gender programs in Pakistan — paid for by a COVID-relief spending bill last year meant for Americans — but deny the gender binary even exists back home.

The Biden administration is busy trying to fashion a woke utopia by parroting trendy equity-speak, insinuating someone other than women can get pregnant, doing land acknowledgements before official government meetings, and promoting recruitment videos for the military and intelligence agencies that focus more on personal narrative than national identity. Our military leaders focus on ""white rage"" in congressional hearings; our embassies hoist the LGBT pride and BLM flags across the globe; and our current president rescinded regulations that blocked taxpayer-funded foreign aid from being used for abortions overseas. We assume our positions on these issues are the correct ones and export them to other countries without considering how they square with their customs, cultures, and beliefs.

We are a country divided by race, confused about the biological reality of gender, ashamed of our complicated national history, and paralyzed by fear. The Afghan Army surrendered its country because its identity and resolve were no match for the Taliban's. We are losing our country because our national identity is being taken over by narcissistic identitarianism. Our nation of over 330 million is splitting into factions held together not by timeless truths rooted in our own Judeo-Christian heritage and founding documents but by superficial tribal similarities.

Many Americans have concluded that nation-building is a misuse of American military and financial resources. I would argue that nation-sustaining is just as difficult when you're in the midst of an identity crisis. A country that sees itself and the world through a set of lenses clouded by skin color, sex, sexuality, and party affiliation will always have difficulty understanding the complexities of tribe, religion, sect, and ethnicity that are a fundamental part of life in other parts of the world. Even worse is a country whose leaders have disdain for half its citizens. That type of country is unstable and could collapse at any time, because no empire lasts forever.

Squires: Are conservatives and cops on the verge of a big breakup?,"The impact of COVID on old alliances and governing principles is becoming increasingly bipartisan.

The left abandoned its commitment to “my body, my choice” personal autonomy and supported firing first responders and medical professionals for vaccine refusal one year after calling them “heroes” during the height of the pandemic.

Now COVID is forcing conservatives to reconsider their relationship with one of their most important constituency groups — the police.

The “Back the Blue” ethos that has animated the Republican Party for decades has been challenged by police in this country and around the world whom people see as enforcement agents of draconian COVID policies. Reports of Canadian law enforcement seizing vehicles and fuel during the trucker protests in Ottawa as well as images of violent clashes between police and protesters may be the final straw for the right.

Kurt Schlichter, a senior columnist for conservative website Townhall, asked the following question on Twitter:

“Conservatives, has the willingness of law enforcement to carry out the orders of leftist politicians since COVID began affected your willingness to ‘back the blue'?""

Of the 5,400 people who responded, only 5% said they fully support the police, 25% said they “back the blue much less,” and 49.5% said “the cops can back themselves.”

It is hard to say how well this sample captures the views of conservative voters or politicians, but the results are still stunning. In many ways the changing dynamics between the populist right and the police are similar to the GOP’s changing relationship to big business. Law and order, like the free market, is an ideal to be pursued, not a deity to be worshiped.

Conservatives have had to rethink their blind support of corporate America because they eventually realized Fortune 500 companies have been captured by the left. Large corporations signal support for all of the trendy social justice causes and throw their weight behind specific pieces of legislation on both federal and local levels.

Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola were two of the first companies to oppose Georgia’s new voting law in 2021. Multiple conservative governors in 2021 found themselves facing pressure from large pro-LGBT corporations like Walmart and Amazon for supporting “anti-trans” bills that would have banned puberty blockers for minors and limited participation in girls’ sports to biological females.

The conservative reorientation toward the police is equally complicated.

The right’s realignment toward law enforcement is taking place at a time when shootings, homicides, and carjackings have all increased in some of our largest cities over the past two years. Conservatives have called for a strong police response to combat the spread of violence, chaos, and disorder. They do so knowing that the same officers apprehending a murder suspect today may be enforcing a vaccine passport policy tomorrow.

As is often the case regarding matters of law and policy, race adds another layer of complexity to the issue. Derrick Bell, one of the scholars credited with creating critical race theory, believed that black people achieved civil rights victories only when they also benefited white people. Bell’s “interest convergence” theory was shaped by his views on Brown v Board of Education, but there is nothing inherently racial about people focusing their political resources on issues that impact them personally.

The problem arises when people lack the vision to see the potential boomerang effect caused by supporting policies that erode the rights of others. Conservatives who supported New York’s stop-and-frisk policy over a decade ago believed it lowered crime rates. They saw no issue with only 10% of the 532,911 stops in 2012 resulting in arrest or 2% of the 297,244 frisks finding a gun. It was easy to dismiss the concerns of largely black and Hispanic men at the time if you were someone who had no fear of being stopped on the street by police.

That bubble of immunity to harassment burst after seeing a viral video of a woman in Ohio being tased and arrested for not wearing a mask at an outdoor football game. Other images in this country and across the West since 2020 showing police cracking down on citizens protesting COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates have had a similar effect.

This is why political coalitions should be built around shared principles and values, not hues or party affiliation. Using force to put down legitimately peaceful protests should concern civil libertarians, whether people are marching for police reform or an end to the biomedical surveillance state. The same can be said for seizing private assets from people who have not been charged with a crime, whether the action is connected to a political speech or a traffic stop.

This realignment is also a reminder that politicians who are more concerned with trying to “own” the other side or symbolism are poorly serving the people who put them in office. Over the past decade, we have seen Republicans make Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling a national issue and Democrats clad in Kente cloth kneeling in the U.S. Capitol for nearly nine minutes in memory of George Floyd. Neither led to substantive change for citizens.



Police fill a very important role in our society. Without them, we would have mob rule and anarchy. Their authority is ultimately determined by the legislators who make our laws and executives who issue orders. Some of these people are more committed to the enforcement of mandates and policing “misinformation” than violent offenses and property destruction.

The police deserve our support when they risk their lives to protect victims of crime and bring justice to law-abiding citizens. They deserve criticism when they abuse their authority and should face swift justice when they break the laws they are hired to uphold and enforce. Conservatives are being forced to balance this tension in real time. Only time will tell whether they side with red-state thought criminals or the boys in blue.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-are-conservatives-and-cops-on-the-verge-of-a-big-breakup,2022-02-23
Squires: Have black churches abandoned biblical teachings for political treasure?,"A recent Washington Post story entitled “Why some Black churches aren’t elated about the possible end of Roe” is a sobering reminder that institutions die when they abandon their purpose and lose their identity.



Multiple clergymen talked about being personally pro-life in theological terms, but not political terms. One was Rev. Cheryl Sanders, senior pastor of a church in Washington, D.C. Leaving aside the fact that the Bible reserves the pastoral office – marked by the responsibility to teach and exercise authority over the church – for qualified men, Rev. Sanders’ perspective on abortion is a sign of deep distress for many black churches.

Why?

The article noted she “doesn’t want to align herself with far-right conservative activists she disagrees with on many social issues.”

In an era when diverse identities — not common values — lie at the heart of our politics and culture, faith leaders and churches with this worldview have made their priorities clear. They see their identity as Christians as secondary to their skin color and political affiliation: “While Black churchgoers share religious values with White Christians, their racial identity, along with historical distrust over issues such as civil rights, has made it more difficult to come together.”

The story also cites an opinion from Justice Thomas, in which he claims states have in interest in preventing abortion from becoming a form of modern-day eugenics. The response from another black minister in D.C. was, “They don’t care about Black babies. You can’t care about Black babies and gut pre-clearance in the Voting Rights Act.” Other ministers cited fatal police incidents and HBCU funding as more pressing concerns than abortion.

The story also noted that many black churches are led by men who disagree with abortion but feel ill-equipped to speak on the issue. In a final display of spiritual decline, the Post included comments from Pastor Earle J. Fisher of Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church in Memphis, who is also a member of Planned Parenthood’s Clergy Advocacy Board.

There is nothing more useless than a church that has abandoned the Bible’s treasures for the world’s trinkets. The church is where people go to learn that the worst type of bondage is slavery to sin. A biblically faithful church will be honest about God’s judgment of sin as well as the salvation that is found in repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. That is the Good News, not that Ketanji Brown Jackson made it to the Supreme Court or that Roe may be overturned.

A church that draws moral parallels between the sanctity of life and government funding for colleges has lost its way. The future that awaits black churches that subscribe to this worldview can be seen in mainline Protestant denominations or liberal Catholic churches that fly BLM and rainbow flags outside their ornate buildings and have worship services dedicated to Beyoncé.

It is only a matter of time before black churches that abandon the Gospel are hosting “Drag Queen Story Hour” on Sunday mornings, like one Lutheran church in Chicago.

The rise and fall of Black Lives Matter over the past two years have demonstrated the danger of the race-over-faith mindset. The founders of BLM were self-described radical feminist Marxists. In theory they should have very little in common with Bible-believing black churches other than skin tone.

Unfortunately, many black churches jumped on the BLM bandwagon because they thought the organization was fighting for racial justice. The truth is that BLM is an LGBT organization that listed the disruption of the nuclear family as one of its thirteen original principles.

Like BLM-supporting clergy, the ministers featured in the Washington Post story need to repent of idolatry that expresses itself in elevating their racial identity over their Christian identity for the sake of politics. Abortion isn’t the only issue that reveals this problem.

One reason YouTuber Kevin Samuels was so popular was that he filled a void left by political black pastors. Some, including Jamal Bryant and Michael Eric Dyson, talk more about increasing government spending for low-income women than the biblical model of marriage and family. Like the leaders of BLM, the only model of family they promote publicly is the left’s vision of a woman, her children, and the government.

The black church has a long history of social activism, epitomized by the work of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The truth is that the same Dr. King who led the civil rights movement to end legal discrimination also partnered with Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood to promote birth control in black communities. I am not sure if King explicitly endorsed abortion, but it is easy to see how ministers like Rev. William Barber and Sen. Raphael Warnock – who now leads King’s former church – see their abortion advocacy as continuing King’s work on behalf of the poor. Like Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, these men see abortion as a tool to help impoverished black women stay in the labor market.



I pray that these ministers and churches don’t represent the larger body of black churches across the country. If they do, black Christians are in deep trouble. The problem isn’t just that they won’t stand boldly for the unborn. It’s the fact that their equivocation is driven by naked political calculus. For these clergy, being connected to conservatives — specifically Trump voters — is a punishment akin to hell (on Earth).

Christians are often told to beware of wolves in sheep’s clothing. That is wise counsel, but what’s even more dangerous is a wolf in shepherd’s clothing. The former can devour a few sheep before the others scatter, but the latter can lead an entire flock over a cliff.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-black-churces-abandoning-biblical-truth,2022-05-20
Squires: Black 'male feminists' are the white liberals of black people,"Kanye West has generated so much controversy over the past two weeks that he has forced other people to apologize for even being associated with him. But a recent Huffington Post column makes the argument that there is another rapper who is even more “dangerous” politically than the self-proclaimed richest black man in history.

According to Stephen Crockett, Killer Mike (née Michael Render) is a politically savvy and socially conscious artist who has squandered his cultural capital by becoming a Republican shill. Crockett, a former writer at the Root, based his argument on the fact that the rapper chose to meet with Governor Brian Kemp in 2020, interviewed Herschel Walker during his current Senate run, and provided constructive feedback to the Stacey Abrams campaign.

In the world of black liberation political discourse, simply speaking to a conservative – and allowing one to speak to your audience – is an act of racial treason. To Stephen Crockett, conservatives are so evil and anti-black that there is no reason for black voters to listen to anything they have to say – especially when a black woman in the South has a chance to become governor.

This is an unsophisticated way to approach politics, but this hit piece is the logical byproduct of a worldview best described by another writer from the Root.

Damon Young, author and co-founder of the site Very Smart Brothas, wrote a controversial opinion piece in 2017 entitled, “Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People.” Young argued that black men benefit from male privilege and use it to center their concerns regarding racial injustice, while dismissing the concerns of black women (e.g., sexism, domestic violence) in the same way white people downplay and disregard racism and white supremacy.

The essay lacked substance, but the provocative thesis provides a useful framework for understanding the role men like Young and Crockett play in the larger political ecosystem.

Put simply, black male feminists are the white liberals of black people.

The primary political purpose of white liberals today is to atone for the “sin” of whiteness and the actions of their historical doppelgangers. The BLM flags, black squares on social media, and “racial justice” activism are all attempts to receive absolution for the transgressions of white people past, present, and future.

The high priests of racial politics, from Rev. Al Sharpton to Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, demand a sacrifice, and white liberals are always ready and willing to offer up their conservative counterparts as an act of atonement. This is one reason they eagerly share stories about the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or the “Karens” destroying America. They want black people to know that they know and agree that white people are terrible and need to give up power and privilege for black people to thrive.

Black male feminists play a similar role within the black community. They see themselves as beneficiaries of male privilege in a systemically sexist culture and want to show black women that they are committed to black female liberation. The trick is doing so in a way that won’t be seen as black men playing dark knights in shining armor swooping in to save black women. That would only reinforce the worst aspects of “toxic masculinity.”

The goal of the black male feminist is to signal to the women who run things (as well as black LGBT allies) that they are not those kinds of black guys – the “hoteps” who listen to Kevin Samuels and Dr. Umar Johnson. They have no issue periodically acknowledging the ways in which hip-hop culture objectifies and degrades black women, but they wouldn’t be caught dead criticizing similar imagery from Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.

These are the pastors who declare “I’m with her” and comedians who wear “I WILL AID AND ABET ABORTION” shirts to show women that they too are committed to keeping as many black children from being born as possible.

The black male feminist doesn’t just share similarities with white liberals in political purpose. They share a similar outlook and disposition. They are often neurotic and anxious, two qualities that will always warp a person’s ability to assess threats and prioritize resources.

These men are the ones who think white domestic terrorism and genocidal police officers are the biggest threats to black lives in America’s largest cities. Their white liberal comrades, similarly, believe upwards of 1,000 unarmed black men are shot and killed by police each year. It’s easy for both groups to come to those conclusions when you completely ignore street crime and actual homicide data for fear of spreading “conservative talking points” about “black-on-black crime.”

White liberals think systemic racism and white supremacy – terms they rarely define – are the biggest impediments to the success of black people. Black male feminists think whiteness and masculinity are the biggest threats to black women. And increasing numbers of black women in the media think that whiteness, traditional notions of masculinity, and the gender binary itself are existential threats to trans women. In the Oppression Olympics, black men take the bronze, black women get the silver, and black trans women own the gold.

Zerlina Maxwell, a political analyst and MSNBC host, complained about sexism among Democrats after Sen. Elizabeth Warren ended her presidential campaign in 2020. Maxwell didn’t explain why Warren, the first female senator in the history of Massachusetts, came in third among women in the state, because she didn’t need to. Instead, she jumped straight to charges of sexism and demanded more men publicly support women in leadership roles.

Craig Melvin, the man moderating the discussion, sheepishly obliged: “Um … OK … uh … for the record, I want to see women in positions of power.”

The other option for black male feminists in media is to sit silently when the women are doing the hard work of leadership. Tiffany Cross felt comfortable saying black men in Georgia should “get in line” behind black women and vote for Stacey Abrams because she knew none of the male panelists – including Roland Martin – would challenge her.

Part of the reason people reacted so strongly to Stephen A. Smith telling Malika Andrews that she couldn’t silence him on ESPN’s First Take is because we have all become accustomed to seeing men like him roll over and show their bellies when a woman encroaches on their territory.

This is why the criticisms of Killer Mike will only get louder if he continues to withhold an endorsement in the Georgia gubernatorial race. He can expect to be the subject of numerous think pieces and drive-by tweets if an Abrams loss is due to black males who don’t vote or who cast ballots for her opponent.

But ultimately, these critiques say more about men like Stephen Crockett, Damon Young, and the legion of black feminists eager to separate themselves from the black men who have unapproved thoughts and speak their minds freely.

There was a time when men with their platforms challenged the status quo. Not any more. Now they harangue professional athletes for not taking experimental drugs. These men are toothless guard dogs – they have plenty of bark, but their words have no bite. They recite predictable liberal pablum that boils every social problem down to a tidy list of “-isms” and “phobias.” More importantly, they completely misunderstand the “power” to whom they claim to be speaking truth.

There is absolutely no risk in being a black liberal accusing President Trump or Governor DeSantis of racism on MSNBC. But it takes actual courage to sit in between BLM’s co-founders and ask, “Why is an organization that claims to care about black people committed to destroying the nuclear family?”

The same goes for an artist who takes the stage at the BET Awards and says, “I appreciate this award, but I will not return to this awards show until this network stops platforming artists who degrade black women and sell murder music to our children.”



Black male feminists don’t have that in them. Men who mimic the language of personal therapy that is so common on the left today aren’t built for the type of culture war playing out within black America.

If being mistaken for an Uber Eats driver in your luxury condo is a harmful, triggering microaggression that requires an extra hour of therapy, you’re not the type of man who can stand firm when the black leadership class points its rhetorical guns at you or tries to make you an outcast within the culture. It’s much easier to submit and obey.

Squires: Frederick Douglass pursued freedom so that black people could have dignity. Eric Adams fights so that black students have drag queens.,"Juneteenth has been surrounded by a cloud of partisanship in recent years since it was rapidly transformed from local celebrations, mainly in Texas, to a federal holiday in the wake of George Floyd’s death. On one side are activists who see the United States as a white supremacist country that needs a new flag, anthem, and Independence Day. On the other are conservatives who reject the essence of the holiday because they think it is being used to further divide the country.



While Juneteenth has been celebrated in Texas for decades to commemorate the end of slavery in that state, news of the Emancipation Proclamation contained in Union General Gordon Granger’s General Order No. 3 did not end legalized slavery in America. Two Union border states – Delaware and Kentucky – did not formally end slavery until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865. In fact, Delaware did not ratify the 13th Amendment until 1901, almost 40 years after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

Like much of American history – especially when it comes to race – Juneteenth is complicated. It shouldn’t be that way because Juneteenth is a holiday celebrating the most important American value: freedom. But like all values, freedom is not neutral. In this context it implies being released from one thing in order to pursue another.

The formerly enslaved used their newfound liberty to rebuild their families, create businesses, fight honorably in foreign wars, lead social organizations, birth political movements, and march for equal citizenship. The black freedom struggle of the 19th and 20th centuries was a testament to what liberated people can do, epitomized by a famous quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.”

King’s understanding of the moral universe makes sense to me as a Christian, but New York City Mayor Eric Adams shows how quickly that arc bends into a boomerang when stripped of the biblical definitions of morality and justice.

Adams tweeted, “Drag storytellers, and the libraries and schools that support them, are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces.” He followed up with another tweet saying that schools should be used to “educate” students on LGBT issues. His admission is in stark contrast to the Democrats across the country who denied this type of indoctrination was taking place as they protested the Parental Rights in Education bill in Florida during their “Don’t Say Gay” campaign.

Adams, who is black, is one of the highest-profile Democrats to come out and publicly support the practice of using schools – and taxpayer dollars – to promote gender ideology to children, often without the consent of parents.

His race is only important to the extent it shows that racial identity politics are often a smokescreen for radicalism in America today. Hiram Revels was a Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Mississippi in 1870 and the first black person to serve in Congress. He pushed for equal citizenship for freedmen during the Reconstruction era as well as the reintegration of ex-Confederates into American society, as long as they pledged loyalty to the Union.

Eric Adams is the second black mayor of New York City. His political interests and instincts align more with the liberal white wine moms of the Upper West Side than the working-class black families in Queens and Brooklyn who powered his mayoral campaign.

There is no way Frederick Douglass could ever have imagined that his work to abolish slavery would eventually lead to the mayor of America’s largest city promoting drag queen story hour to low-income students. He pursued freedom for the right reason.

“As colored men, we only ask to be allowed to do with ourselves, subject only to the same great laws for the welfare of human society which apply to other men, Jews, Gentiles, Barbarian, Sythian. Let us stand upon our own legs, work with our own hands, and eat bread in the sweat of our own brows.”

The fight against chattel slavery and segregation was built on the biblical principle that every person is created in the image of God. The sexual revolution, gay rights movement, legalized abortion, third-wave feminism, and the trans movement reject biblical teaching about the nature of mankind in favor of a twisted form of individual transgressive libertarianism.

The Bible says that there are false prophets who promise freedom but are themselves “slaves of corruption.” It also says that people who abandon the knowledge of God and entangle themselves in sin are in a worse position than if they never knew God’s commandments in the first place.

We are a nation enslaved to sin and too prideful to see our confusion. No generation, country, or political party has a monopoly on immorality, but there are important distinctions that point to different stages of cultural devolution.

Prostitution is commonly called the “world’s oldest profession” because of its prevalence in every culture since the beginning of time. There is a significant difference between it being done secretly in the privacy of a person’s home, in the back of someone’s car in violation of the law, and openly on every other street corner in the town square with the full support of legislators, businesses, and celebrities.

The act is the same in all three places, but the increasing levels of acceptance and promotion are indicative of a culture in decline. Christina Aguilera recently wore a strap-on during an L.A. Pride performance. That type of behavior will cost her nothing. Public support for the next Republican candidate for president, however, would cost her everything.

A nation that has no shame over gross moral misconduct and that socially censures differences in political opinion is one in which disease is the default state of the body politic. It is the inevitable result of promoting darkness in the daylight and forcing the light into hiding.

This is why getting a politician or pundit on MSNBC to say that every school deserves a drag queen story hour is easy, but getting one to say every child deserves a mother and father is hard.

Freedom without restraint is bondage. For much of this nation’s history, those boundaries were religious in nature. Even if you did not attend church, theft, murder, and adultery were all serious moral failures because the Judeo-Christian influence over the culture created an assumed center.

Americans have largely replaced religion with politics, and that evolution has changed the “closet” in our culture. Every society promotes certain beliefs, behaviors, and practices and penalizes others. The question is not whether certain things go in the closet, but which things go inside.

The LGBT community today is allowed to live out loud and proud, with the full backing and support of Fortune 500 corporations, corporate media, Hollywood, academia, and elected officials. People who believe in the gender binary or who don't want toddlers learning about personal pronouns have to say so quietly and carefully for fear of losing their jobs or becoming social outcasts. People see what happens when celebrities like J.K. Rowling speak up for women and adjust their behavior accordingly.

This is why the Christian worldview is such a threat to the people who celebrate sin in the name of liberation. They don’t mind Jesus as an always-affirming moral teacher, as long as his lessons support their agenda. This is as true for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when she connects Jesus to immigration as it is for Rep. Lauren Boebert when she connects his crucifixion to gun control.



Political zealots hate the notion of Jesus as the only remedy for the sin-sick soul. They reject the notion that our standards of morality come from an external, transcendent source. They believe life has conditional value, sex is casual and primarily for recreation, marriage only requires two consenting adults (for now), and crime is caused by unmet material needs. This worldview sounds like freedom in theory, but it leads to bondage in practice. It also proves a valuable lesson for us all: Retaining a moral standard in a culture where everything is permitted is much harder than doing it in a culture where nothing is allowed.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-frederick-douglass-eric-adams,2022-06-20
Squires: Kanye and George Floyd prove the gatekeepers of hip-hop only care about black lives when they're taken by white cops,"Kanye West is back in the news cycle, and this time he’s brought some friends. The mercurial rapper dragged fellow hip-hop veteran N.O.R.E into his drama when he brought up George Floyd on the rapper’s ""Drink Champs"" podcast. West stated, “They hit him with the fentanyl” and that Derek Chauvin’s knee wasn’t on Floyd’s neck “like that.” The inference that most people drew is that Kanye believes George Floyd died of a drug overdose and not Chauvin kneeling on him for over eight minutes.

What amounted to a few seconds within a longer conversation sent social media into a frenzy and N.O.R.E. into full damage control mode. The fact that the medical examiner who performed Floyd’s autopsy found that heart disease and fentanyl were contributing factors to his death has become irrelevant in the face of the larger narrative. N.O.R.E. called into ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show to apologize to George Floyd’s family and anyone else who was “hurt” by Kanye’s comments.

This was a groundbreaking moment in hip-hop history. For more than 30 years, concerned listeners, parents, and activists have called for artists to be more careful with their words. Their pleas have generally been ignored.

Until now.

Hip-hop has seen the light. It has repented of its sins and developed a conscience. And all it took was one of its icons questioning the manner in which one man died.

There has been a great deal of attention on Kanye, his decision to wear a “White Lives Matter” shirt, his interview with Tucker Carlson, and several comments he has made about Jewish people in media and entertainment.

But hip-hop’s epiphany is about more than one man. It is a valuable example of beliefs, values, standards, and shame. And people like N.O.R.E. and Maverick Carter – LeBron James’ business partner – make several things clear. Killing black men and degrading black women doesn't qualify as “hate speech.” Likewise, “harmful stereotypes” don’t include videos with guns pointed at the camera or strippers with enhanced backsides bigger than Sarah Baartman’s.

When it comes to the behaviors hip-hop’s gatekeepers are willing to enforce, some groups take a much higher priority.

The people who police the borders of rap culture have had decades to enforce moral standards. They chose not to do soafter Snoop Dogg publicly attacked Gayle King for bringing up Kobe Bryant’s rape charge shortly after his death in 2020. He concluded his rant this way:

“Funky dog-head b*tch, how dare you try to tarnish my m*therf*cking homeboy’s reputation, punk m*therf*cker? Respect the family and back off, b*tch, before we come get you.”

Snoop Dogg apologized to King after talking to his mother.

The hip-hop culture police were much more forceful with rapper DaBaby after he used crude language about sex acts and HIV at a concert in 2021. The LGBT community and its allies made the artist apologize within days. The message was clear: Vulgar comments about no one in particular are unacceptable, but threats to specific female journalists are fine.

It certainly isn’t an aversion to violence that made the keepers of hip-hop culture see the light. The entire hip-hop ecosystem is fueled by packaging violence – and the “realness” of the artists who rap about it – for consumer consumption.

The number of artists who talk about shooting and killing “n*ggas” is too long to list. The same goes for the objectification of women in lyrics and videos. There was a period of time in hip-hop culture when “video vixens” were so influential that other women started getting black market butt injections to look like them. BET produced a documentary called ""Killer Curves"" that provided an honest look at the fallout from such distorted beauty images, including women who had their legs amputated and others who died from having foreign substances injected into their bodies.

Female artists like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, and Megan Thee Stallion grabbed the flesh-peddling baton from their male counterparts and moved women in hip-hop from background eye candy to the queenpins of stripper culture. Their influence, coupled with the advent of social media, has made the bare bottom the new peace sign for girls and women taking pictures.

I’m glad that hip-hop gatekeepers want to enforce standards of conduct and protect fans from dangerous stereotypes. Unfortunately, these efforts seem like superficial attempts to abide by the rules set by their overlords in the media and big business.

This means hip-hop fans can expect to hear rappers using “she/her” pronouns for a bikini-clad man who thinks he is a woman before calling him a “bad b*tch.” Some may see this as progress, but real repentance would look like artists casting off the sexual immorality, debauchery, hatred, and rage that characterizes the genre for something much better.

There is nothing about rap music that prohibits artists from promoting messages of love, peace, faithfulness, and self-control. Eminem has been on the hip-hop scene for over 25 years and has never publicly uttered the N-word. There is no reason that his peers have to rap about murder and doing drugs.



In our contentious culture wars, Kanye is proving to be closer to Private Pyle from ""Full Metal Jacket"" than Chris Kyle from ""American Sniper."" His unpredictable nature and meandering style of storytelling make it difficult to always understand the point he is making, but his words always make a significant impact on the broader culture. No one could have anticipated he would be the man to make gangster rappers develop a warm, tender side. Hopefully, their new aversion to hate speech will inspire them to actually put down their guns for good.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-kanye-floyd-black-lives-white-cops,2022-10-18
"Squires: Lia, Laverne, and 'The Lion King': How trans activists use the legacy of lynchings to silence the culture","The ubiquity of rainbow flags and pandering corporations at the beginning of June can only mean one thing: LGBT “Pride” Month has officially begun.



It is hard to overstate how quickly the country has changed on matters of sex and gender identity in the seven years since Bruce Jenner announced he was a transgender woman named ""Caitlyn.""

A recent campaign video from Charles Booker explains one major reason.

Booker is a Kentucky Democrat running to unseat Senator Rand Paul in the upcoming election. He released a video that showed him with a noose around his neck as he spoke about the ugly history of lynchings in the South. He also claimed Senator Paul voted against anti-lynching legislation and compared health care expansion to slavery. The message was clear: Rand Paul’s ideas are part of Kentucky’s racist past and Charles Booker is its tolerant future.

Booker’s use of stark racial imagery explains why Lia Thomas received a sympathetic profile on ESPN this week from a writer with “they/them” pronouns and Laverne Cox announced that Mattel is making a first-of-its-kind transgender Barbie doll in his image.

The overwhelming majority of Americans know that there are only two sexes, but they have been largely silent in the face of trans ideology capturing every inch of our culture, from public policy and big business to corporate media and K-12 education.

Why?

Democrats now accuse anyone who does not agree with their new definitions of “man” and “woman” of transphobia and bigotry. In an instant, millions of loyal Democratic voters who hold traditional views of sex – from suburban soccer moms to inner-city teachers – have become enemies of what President Biden calls the “civil rights issue of our time.”

When it comes to gender ideology, we’re all Klansmen now.

Academics, politicians, pundits, and corporations act as if keeping men out of the women’s swimming pool at the Olympics is the same as wanting separate water fountains for blacks and whites. People who refuse to date someone who identifies as transgender will soon be shunned and shamed like racial purists who oppose interracial relationships. They have been told criticizing men in women’s bathrooms or mastectomies for teenage girls makes them bigots who wish death on transgender children. Democrats have likened every American who believes in human biology to a Grand Wizard holding a hangman’s noose.

No one wants to be associated with the people who carried out heinous acts of bigotry and racial violence. LGBT activists know this and have linked the gay rights movement to the Civil Rights movement for decades. The phrase “gay is the new black” is not just a rallying cry for them; it’s also their view on the natural progression of America’s long march toward equality and freedom.

The problem for the LGBT movement is that homosexuality rests on the belief that biological sex is real. The “Ts” completely disagree. They believe gender is a social construct, sex is “assigned” at birth by doctors, and gender identity is a matter of personal choice.

Like many self-professed feminists, black progressives, and white liberals, the “Ls” and “Gs” would rather nod along in silent submission than risk being placed in the same basket of deplorables as racist Trump voters. There is no worse fate for people who see themselves as oppressed than being cast in the role of oppressor. The masses have gotten the message, which is why so many would rather be silent than be linked to the new crop of multi-racial white supremacists. This is yet another reminder that shame is a powerful tool for social control.

Transgender activists used the looming legacy of battered black Americans marching for civil rights to catapult themselves to first place in the oppression Olympics. They went from John Lewis on the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPYs in the blink of an eye.

Disney, the parent company of ESPN, is one of the most influential companies in this movement, and anyone who has ever watched ""The Lion King"" understands exactly what is happening in America today.

Scar, the jealous younger brother of King Mufasa, kills the patriarch and sends young Simba into hiding. Now king, Scar takes over the Pride Lands, allows hyenas to move in, and oversees the rapid deterioration of the land. His rule over the Pride Lands and his lie about Mufasa’s death remain unchallenged until Simba grows enough in stature and courage to defeat his evil uncle.

The lesson is clear: The removal of a strong male always leaves females and the young vulnerable to outside attacks. In nature, weakness is always met with aggression. The decades-long effort to demonize masculinity and patriarchy has not eliminated male leadership; it just changed the dominant males from providers to predators who prey on those they should protect.

As is often the case, Charles Booker’s use of racial imagery for personal and political gain is built on a lie. He accused Rand Paul of opposing anti-lynching legislation but failed to mention the current Kentucky senator opposed the original bill in 2020 because he wanted to make it stronger. Paul eventually co-sponsored the Emmett Till Antilynching Act along with Senators Cory Booker, Raphael Warnock, and Tim Scott.

Lies and emotional manipulation are at the heart of every subversive movement. The left has shown over the past twenty years that tolerance and acceptance are not the goals. Leftists want total submission and unquestioning affirmation. They want you to take a picture of your child in the lap of a burly, bearded drag queen and think “what a blessing of liberty.” They want you to see men with three percent body fat and deep voices smashing records in women’s sports as the next frontier of equality. They want you to believe that anything less than your total support and allyship makes you a vile, hateful person.

The truth is that they don’t even believe what they say, as evidenced by how quickly abortion went back to being a women’s issue once Democrats learned Roe might be overturned. Every “birthing person” and “chest feeder” was forced to the back of the bus for the sake of political expediency.



Affirming the reality of sex, whether you base your position on Genesis or genetics, is the most important act of personal humility and cultural resistance you can engage in today. It is the antidote to pride because it acknowledges a power greater than the human mind. Doing so will require clear vision, an honest tongue, nerves of steel, and a multigenerational mindset. The other option is continued silence and cowardice.

Squires: Macy Gray found out that the false religion of 'woke' is long on vengeance but short on mercy,"Macy Gray has had a tough month. By now everyone has seen her public about-face on the definition of womanhood. She went from describing some of the physical differences between men and women during a conversation with Piers Morgan to declaring that anyone in the LGBT community is a “hero” and “being a woman is a vibe” in an appearance on the ""Today Show.""

Many people see Gray’s reversal as the public humiliation ritual it appears to be on the surface.

I see a powerful spiritual lesson about the grace and mercy of God, personified in Jesus Christ, contrasted with the vengeance of our culture’s false idols.

One of the most unpopular aspects of Christianity for people who reject it is the notion that wrath is a part of God’s definition of justice. This is a throughline in scripture, starting in the Old Testament, where death was listed as the punishment for a multitude of sins. It continues into the New Testament, where the Apostle Paul writes this in Romans 1:18:

“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.”

Paul goes on to define “unrighteousness” for his readers further in the chapter and includes everything from murder and malice to envy and disobedience to parents. The message is clear: No one is truly righteous of his own accord, and God’s wrath is the just punishment for all sin.

This is why I reject any ideology that links humanity’s sin nature with skin color. We have seen this play out in America through historical stereotypes about the savageness and promiscuity of black people as well as the current framing of “whiteness” as rooted in theft and genocide. It is possible to have honest discussions about crime and injustice without attributing people's individual actions to their nature or ascribing them to their ethnic identity. The Bible is clear that no person or group is inherently evil or righteous. The same acts of evil may not be as prevalent among every group or within every nation, but that does not mean anyone has a monopoly on either vice or virtue.

The punishment for mankind’s depravity is pretty bad news. Thankfully the story does not end there.

In the Christian faith, the good news is that a person is made right with God (i.e. “justified”) by turning from sin and believing that Jesus Christ took the punishment for the person's unrighteousness on the cross. Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection complete a cosmic transaction for the true believer: Jesus takes on our sins and we take on his righteousness. All of this is a function of God’s grace and mercy, which means no human can boast about any part of the process.

It is the ultimate act of restorative justice.

America’s new civil religion is a cheap copy of a perfect original. Whether you call it social justice or “wokeness,” it includes the intense desire to right all historical wrongs, eliminate all disparities between groups, and liberate all groups oppressed from their oppressors. It has some of the same elements as the Christian faith: sacred texts, prophets, teachers, and evangelists, as well as a definition of justice that repays sin with vengeance.

One thing this faith doesn’t have is mercy or grace for the unrighteous. It also lacks any sense of full and final payment for one’s sins, which distorts the nature of good works. For Christians, moral behavior is the fruit of salvation, but within the woke church, it is the root of salvation.

In this false religion, repentance and belief (in lies) only lead to more sacrifices, more apologies, more commitments to “do better,” and more shame. There is no assurance, only perpetual insecurity regarding one’s faithfulness. Macy Gray found this out the hard way, as have countless others who have issued multiple apologies and pledged to support LGBT organizations after upsetting the gods of sex and sexuality.

Christians can have peace because we know that our faith rests on the only one who is truly righteous. Jesus was flogged publicly for the sins of all who believe in him. Macy Gray was flogged publicly for affirming God’s design for men and women. God gives Christians the spiritual weapons to fight our sin. False gods demand that their followers fight the truth.

Prophets and evangelists in the Bible declare God’s wrath and love – rooted in His holiness and justice – to spur the ungodly to repentance. The false prophets of social justice use fear and manipulation – rooted in lies – to force people into conversion. They know that the average person would rather bend his knee in submission than be publicly nailed to his own cross.

This is why pastors who advise believers to practice “pronoun hospitality” with the gender-confused or Christian social commentators who believe drag queens reading to children are a “blessing of liberty” are guilty of spiritual malpractice.

A good shepherd leads his flock to green pastures for their sustenance and drives off wolves for their protection. Encouraging the sheep to eat synthetic grass or advising them to be more winsome toward those who wish to devour them are signs of a shepherd who is ill equipped to carry out his vocation.

We live in an age where the social, medicinal, and surgical “transition” of people who are confused about their gender is official federal policy. No amount of gentleness or compromise will satisfy those who see rejection of transgenderism as the ultimate act of blasphemy.



This is why the Bible forbids idol worship and warns Christians not to be controlled by the fear of man. God knows how easy it is to draw our affections away from Him and toward other loves who will never love us back. Every other religion tells its followers all the things they must “do” to be made righteous. It is a list that has no end. The Christian looks at the cross and hears Jesus say his work on our behalf is “finished.”

Only one of those sounds like good news to me.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-macy-gray-false-religion-woke,2022-07-11
Squires: Monkeypox shows the left's fetish for saying 'gay' to kids in the schoolhouse but never to men in the bathhouse,"Governor Ron DeSantis was accused of marginalizing LGBT teachers and students when he signed the Parental Rights in Education bill earlier this year. The media, as it is often wont to do, lied about the bill and branded it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

The response was a useful window into the mind of the American left. Politicians, entertainers, and corporations made a point to say “Gay!” every moment they could prior to the bill being signed into law.

Fast-forward a few months to the current monkeypox public health emergency – an actual threat to the LGBT community – and suddenly the keepers of culture have a bad case of laryngitis.

Yes, they grudgingly acknowledge that gay men – “men who have sex with men” in public health parlance – make up virtually all monkeypox cases.

Their overriding concern, however, in the public response to the outbreak is to avoid “stigmatizing” gay men. The writers of a recent Washington Post article acknowledge that public health authorities are weighing whether to recommend that gay men limit their sexual partners to help control the spread of the virus. The Post linked to a resource from San Francisco that tried to provide practical prevention tips for men attending a popular kink festival.

“We’re gearing up for an exciting return of our favorite street festival in San Francisco: Up Your Alley (aka Dore Alley), where you’ll get your fill of hot hairy daddies, hungry pigs, BDSM babes and kinks of all kinds. Douchie’s got some hot tips for a fun and filthy weekend — free of anxiety.”

Romans 1 is clear that a society that sows kink and celebrates filth will reap destruction both physically and spiritually.

“Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.”

“Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.”

Promiscuous sex is one aspect of gay culture the left is loath to discuss publicly. Journalists bend over backward not to offend men who lack the discipline to stop bending over forward for random men at sex parties.

The shame mechanism for the people engaged in this behavior is completely broken. Only a mind enslaved to sin would think that being told not to engage in anonymous sex acts at orgies, at bathhouses, and in public bathrooms is more stigmatizing than the acts themselves.

Thankfully, the same book that details the ultimate end of all who are in bondage to sin also describes the freedom found in repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The Gospel has the same power to save the gay man who has spent decades degrading himself through the unnatural use of his body as it does the church girl who thinks her good works are what make her righteous in God’s sight.

What makes the left’s “don’t say gay” monkeypox response so galling is the stark contrast of how this public health emergency is being handled compared to our last one.

During COVID, the media, academics, politicians, and public health officials had no problem using their platforms to chastise and criticize anyone who disobeyed their COVID orders. They ordered churches to close and demanded that people not see their families for the holidays.

People who refused COVID shots and complained about mask mandates were blamed for killing children and senior citizens. They were threatened with job loss, isolated in churches, and chastised for prolonging the “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Conservatives who died after expressing concern about the public health response to COVID were mocked online and in major media outlets.

Now monkeypox is here, and the politicians, public health authorities, and media outlets who spoke with moral force as they shamed disobedient voters have become much more circumspect with their public guidance. We are being led by people who felt emboldened to tell Americans not to celebrate Thanksgiving with family but tremble at the thought of having to tell gay men not to attend kink festivals.



Enabling self-destruction is neither loving nor kind. Immunity from criticism creates a breeding ground for cultural dysfunction and communicable diseases.

We need more leaders willing to discuss abstinence with adults and fewer teachers trying to talk about gender identity and sexuality with toddlers. The people who need to hear “gay” most right now are the men in the batthouse, not the children in the schoolhouse.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-monkeypox-left-wont-say-gay,2022-08-05
Squires: Rainbow is the new black,"A recent Gallup poll revealed that 20% of Americans in Generation Z (born 1997-2003) identify as LGBT, double the rate of Millennials (born 1981-1996) and five times the rate of Gen X adults (born 1965-1980). This explosion of LGBTQIA+ identity in the next generation of voters is the primary reason the Democratic Party will continue to be much more vigorous in its focus on sexuality and gender identity than race as a strategy for mobilizing voters.

The left’s response to “anti-CRT” bills in state legislatures across the country was a handful of stories and opinion pieces about the danger of banning controversial ideas (e.g. white privilege) and teaching materials (e.g. 1619 Project). Those responses pale in comparison to the national outcry from politicians, journalists, pundits, entertainers, and corporations who objected to what they falsely describe as Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill that banned teaching young children about sexuality and gender identity.

That difference in scope and intensity of opposition reflects the left’s new priorities. Simply put, “rainbow” is the new black. This doesn’t mean Democrats no longer care about black voters. It means race issues will increasingly be viewed through the lens of sexual identity. This is why President Biden’s discussion of trans issues often includes a reference to violence against “transgender women of color and girls of color.”

The left has done the same thing over the past six years by framing abortion bans as attacks on the reproductive rights of black women. The beauty of this strategy for Democrats is that it allows them to advance all their policy priorities while championing their DIE (diversity, inclusion, and equity) agenda and remaining committed to their female voter base. This functions as a political “blackcine” they believe protects them from the ailment they fear most: accusations of racism.

For more than 60 years, black Americans have been some of the Democratic Party’s most reliable supporters. The party has gotten about 90% of the black vote in every presidential election since 2000 and has made explicit appeals to black voters through “race issues” like affirmative action, police reform, and public education funding.

Democrats also use the realities of racism in America’s past to garner support for their policy priorities today. This is how a voting law in Georgia that provides a longer early voting period than Massachusetts and Delaware ends up cast as “Jim Crow 2.0.” The party wants to leverage the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, but it has no interest in advocating the Christian values or supporting the types of black men who led the churches that were instrumental in agitating for social change.

Those men, who often held to biblical ethics regarding sex, sexuality, marriage, and family, have views that are no longer welcome in the Democratic mainstream. The types of men and ministers who are welcomed on the left today are people like Rev. William Barber and Senator Raphael Warnock. Both men draw on the cultural traditions and moral authority of the black church but abandon biblical truth about sexuality and the sanctity of life.

Barber and Warnock know that the days of “love the sin, hate the sinner” and “tolerance” are over. The left demands full affirmation of all things related to sexuality and gender identity. No group has been as instrumental in helping the left transition its identity politics focus from skin color to sexuality as Black Lives Matter (BLM). Two of the three co-founders – Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza – describe themselves as feminists and Marxists. They also explained how “queerness” was at the forefront of their movement — back in 2015.

While BLM came to global prominence after George Floyd was killed in 2020, the organization was clear about its priorities from its inception. Not a single one of BLM’s 13 guiding principles uses the words “police,” “brutality,” “man,” or “boy.” The only time the word “violence” is used is in relation to transgender women (i.e. men who identify as women).

By contrast, BLM had principles entitled “Queer Affirming” and “Trans Affirming” as well as ones describing its commitment to disrupting the nuclear family. This worldview is why the left criticizes a focus on fatherhood and the nuclear family, whether from President Obama in 2014 or Governor DeSantis in 2022, but defends Drag Queen Story Hour and doctors who want to sterilize and mutilate adolescents in the name of “gender-affirming care.”

In this way, BLM was the perfect Trojan horse and bridge from the politics of civil rights to the politics of sexual affirmation. Even though the group has been pushed from national prominence due to financial mismanagement, its contributions to the shift in the left’s political priorities will endure for the foreseeable future.

Changes in the culture are also under way. Like President Biden, publications like Essence and the Root are much more likely to run stories about violence against trans women than ones about black men, unless they involve white perpetrators. The reason, as is often the case on the left, is power dynamics. When one black man kills another, both are seen as victims of racism and poverty. But when a black man commits an act of violence against a trans woman, he is seen as helping to maintain the forces of male and “cisgender” privilege that keep both women and trans people oppressed.

This is why men like Dwyane Wade, the retired NBA champion, also play a critical role in the left’s identity politics transition. Wade’s public support of his son Zaya, who identifies as a transgender girl, has been instrumental in tenderizing his peers to accept the new rules of gender identity. Wade’s appearance on “Ellen” reached a mainstream audience, but his discussion with fellow professional athletes on “I Am Athlete” about how Zaya “educated” him on trans issues is what will change the hearts and minds of men who want to be less “toxic” LGBTQIA+ allies.

The political grounds are shifting, and everything we knew about traditional coalitions is changing. Big business is now in the pocket of Democrats, and an Amazon worker trying to start a new union appeared last week on Tucker Carlson’s show. Similar dynamics are at play with respect to identity politics. The black preachers who hold to biblical views about sex and gender identity should know that they will be cast out of prominent positions and demonized for their views by Democrats who want their vote but hate their values.



The left has moved from a desire to stop the criminalization of private sexual behavior to demanding it be unquestioningly affirmed publicly through law and social custom. They have succeeded in “queering” the country and forcing Christians to censor – or abandon – many of their most important beliefs. The only question is how long they will remain in the closet.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-rainbow-is-the-new-black,2022-04-20
"Squires: The debate rules established by radicals compromise truth, morals, and the public square","Saul Alinsky would be proud of how the left has fused the tactics he outlined in “Rules for Radicals” with their identity obsession to shield today’s revolutionaries from serious criticism.

Alinsky is a famed community organizer whose book was published in 1971. “Rules for Radicals” outlined a series of strategies to help organizers work in low-income communities with multiple stakeholder groups to effect social change. His work has been applied to political campaigns, and his ideology and tactics have been linked to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Examples of his rules include the following:

""Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.""

""Whenever possible go outside the expertise of the enemy.""

""A good tactic is one your people enjoy.""

Alinsky used symbols to create unity within community institutions that could be mobilized to fight a specific enemy. In a previous generation, that might have translated into a labor union fighting a construction company for higher wages or a local church working with residents to push their city council for a new playground.

As a self-described radical and man of the left, Alinksy has been frequently criticized by conservatives. He probably didn’t help his reputation by opening his book with an acknowledgement of “the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom — Lucifer.”

The left’s “Rules for Radical Identity Politics” draw on Alinsky’s work. They have a common enemy — straight white men — and multiple unifying identity symbols ranging from pink “pussy hats” to BLM and LGBT flags.

Unlike Alinsky, their primary focus is not a local community seeking tangible change. They have a much broader vision for social transformation. Weaponizing identity is one of their most effective strategies for fighting their enemy, and they have effectively implemented their tactics:

Use your identity to bludgeon your enemy and to shield yourself from criticism.

Don’t debate your ideas. Radicals seek surrender, not compromise.

The only problems with radical identity politics are the people who question it.

These rules cloud a person’s worldview and disrupt his moral compass. They also make it extremely difficult to have serious debates about important issues in this country.

Recent polls showing Vice President Kamala Harris with historically low approval ratings demonstrate these rules in action. Both White House press secretary Jen Psaki and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel — representing the dominant narrative in politics and culture — blamed racism and sexism. This has been a common response to any criticism of Harris, including an explanation of why she dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before the first primary.

Supporters of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s failed presidential campaign ran the same play. After failing to win any of the 18 state primary elections, Warren and her surrogates claimed the issue was gender. One political analyst appeared on MSNBC and said more men need to publicly declare they want to see more women in positions of power. The host, Craig Melvin, dutifully obliged and parroted her talking point. Neither of the other two men on the panel dared to question her analysis.

The charges of sexism leveled against Democratic primary voters seemed like an odd explanation considering Warren finished third in voting and third among women in her home state of Massachusetts, where more than half of the voters were women. Perhaps the female voters who voted her into the U.S. Senate had a temporary bout of internalized sexism during the presidential primary.

Politicians aren’t the only ones following these rules. Jussie Smollett, currently on trial for his hate crime hoax, claimed people would be more likely to believe his story if he said his attackers were Mexican or Muslim.

He believed anyone who expressed doubts about his tall tale was probably motivated by racism and homophobia.

The radicals know that they can press their advantage with an advocacy media establishment that is ready and willing to launder their preferred narratives. They also know many people will either accept the narrative or be too incapacitated with fear to challenge it.

America needs to break out of this cycle. We need to be able to question, challenge, and debate ideas in the public square. We should stop allowing fear of being called names to keep us from saying things that we believe to be true, especially when the radicals show no issue with attacking disfavored groups on a regular basis.

The authors of columns from “There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man” to “You Damn Karens are Killing America” to “Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People” clearly do not fear criticism from our cultural overlords.

Diversity is sold as our culture’s most precious commodity. We have created entire industries to mine for talented people who come from nontraditional backgrounds, but the elimination of high standards and public criticism had also created opportunities for people pushing mediocre ideas to thrive.

I have experienced this personally. My recent Twitter engagement with a self-described radical feminist professor included an allegation that I “know full well the sexist pugilism of the dudes who follow you and you incite the sh*t.”

I try my best to avoid personal attacks on people, because as a Christian I believe we are all created in God’s image and likeness. Even the people pushing the most destructive ideas can turn from their ways and have their minds renewed.

I also don’t do it because it is the easiest way for those advocating subversive ideas to deflect criticism. They would much rather focus attention on being attacked personally than actually having to defend their positions. When a person claiming to support the black family says she supports abortion laws that have kept black people at 13% of the population for decades, it is a lot easier to talk about receiving personal attacks than answer a question about whether human life has inherent value.

You can tell a lot about something’s composition by how it reacts to fire. Precious metals are shaped and hardened by it. Lesser materials are consumed by it.

The problem is not that black people and women aren’t subjected to criticism. The problem is that our cultural goldsmiths refuse to subject anyone other than straight, white men to sustained heat. They claim to be fighting for more opportunities for marginalized groups, but that behavior has created a different type of inequality. As soon as the temperature starts to rise slightly, they pull favored groups out of the fire.



The practitioners of radical identity politics claim to want equality, but anyone who thinks they are exempt from criticism desires charity, not parity.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-debate-rules-established-by-radicals-compromise-truth-morals-and-the-public-square,2021-12-07
Squires: Tony Dungy marches for life while his detractors demonize the Gospel,"If you believe Tony Dungy’s critics, the Hall of Fame NFL coach is really a closeted Exalted Cyclops who dreams of burning rainbow crosses in front of Planned Parenthood in order to keep trans kids from their puberty blockers and women barefoot and pregnant.



The treatment Dungy has received for publicly affirming the right to life is proof that corporate media likes prayers to unspecified gods, Christians with closed Bibles, black men who promote death, and activist athletes endorsing causes they support.

The reactions to the respected coach and NBC broadcaster’s March for Life appearance have been attempts to paint pro-life advocacy and biblical sexual ethics as forms of intolerant extremism. Dungy delivered a speech at last Friday’s March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., the first since the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade.

Dungy took a bold stand for the sanctity of life and the rights of the unborn. At one point he even stated that the lives of babies in the womb matter just as much as the life of Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills player who suffered cardiac arrest during a game in early January.

In doing so, the trailblazing coach morphed from a model of dignity, strength, and winsomeness into a right-wing bigot, spreading hatred of LGBT people and promoting white supremacy.

This was the argument put forth by several sportswriters and social commentators. Dave Zirin of the Nation penned an emotionally charged screed that described the March for Life as a “madhouse of right-wing gadflies, disinformation addicts, Qanon adherents, and, most disturbingly, class after class of teenage and tween-age children dragged there by teachers who abuse their authority in ways that would make Ron DeSantis smirk.”

I attended the march. Zirin’s vision is as deficient as his worldview. Zirin also tried to connect Dungy, and a now-deleted tweet about litter boxes, to threats against children’s hospitals and assaults against LGBT kids.

Nancy Armour of USA Today sang a similar tune. She claimed that Dungy’s advocacy for black coaches doesn’t excuse his “bigotry against the LGBTQ community.” Armour, who attended Catholic school, claimed Jesus never addressed homosexuality or gay marriage in the Gospels. Perhaps she was out sick the day Jesus said the following in response to a question about divorce: “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”

Armour might respond that this doesn’t address same-sex marriage directly. But that would be like saying a vegan restaurant doesn’t explicitly say it doesn’t sell ribeye steaks in its menu. The Bible, from Genesis to Revelation and every book in between, is crystal clear on the number of sexes and the definition of marriage.

Not to be outdone by the initial responses to Dungy’s “sin” of promoting life, Kevin Blackistone of the Washington Post tied Dungy's appearance at the March for Life to anti-abortion extremists, racist politicians, and Donald Trump. Blackistone, a supporter of Colin Kaepernick’s on-field protests, wondered how the NFL reacted to Dungy’s decision to “stand before anti-abortionists on a podium frequented by white supremacists and zealots.”

Even Dr. Harry Edwards, the sociologist who has made a career studying and advising black athletes, joined the fray. He tweeted that as someone with “friends, colleagues, neighbors, former students, contacts in every walk of life who are proudly 'out', active parts of their LGBTQ communities and who I treasure, I find Tony’s insipidly right wing bigotry disturbing or dangerous.”

In Harry Edwards’ world, living “out, loud, and proud” is for puppy play enthusiasts and leather daddies in San Francisco. Christians who believe in a biblical definition of marriage can practice their faith in the “closet” in their own homes.

Millions of Americans share Tony Dungy’s views on abortion and homosexuality. Many of those people are professing Christians. They see the Dobbs decision as a net good for society. Unlike Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, they did not tweet in somber reflection on what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe.

Chris Broussard, a veteran sports journalist and professing Christian, contrasted the backlash Tony Dungy received with the praise lavished on black men who use their platforms to promote violence and destruction. His cultural analysis was spot-on.

The NFL featured Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and 50 Cent during last year’s Super Bowl halftime show. In 2021, the league also promoted rapper Meek Mill’s work for “social equity” and congratulated him on his album ""Expensive Pain."" There wasn’t much interest in the album cover, which depicted the bare breasts, behinds, and private parts of black women. Good thing he didn’t say his money was “kosher” or compliment Jewish record executives on their business acumen. The NFL would never stand beside anyone using harmful language that perpetuates stereotypes.

Attempts to get Tony Dungy fired and cast out of polite society are not about tolerance. They are acts of punishment that should serve as a wake-up call to faithful believers everywhere.

The issue isn’t Tony Dungy’s tone or demeanor. It’s his message.

People who worship at the altar of abortion and pray to the gods of sexual preference and gender identity cannot allow heretics like Dungy to spread his view in the public square. They know the false gospel of sexual liberation is no match for the good news of Jesus Christ.

To the people who think men can “become” women, biology is bigotry. When the government attempts to change the definition of “marriage,” people who believe it remains the union of one man and one woman for one lifetime will be seen as regressive. And those who believe life has inherent value regardless of gestational stage or location will be cast as theocrats who want to take women back to the 1950s.



Black Christians have even more pressure to conform. Biblical teaching on issues of sex, sexuality, and life are now framed as (white) Christian nationalism. No amount of goodwill or cultural capital amassed fighting racism can make up for refusal to support killing babies in the womb or affirm drag queens in libraries and schools.

People whose identities are built on the foundation of skin color will not survive the coming storm. Neither will believers who are willing to compromise biblical truth for cultural acceptance. Christians need to accept the fact that publicly affirming what the scriptures say about sex, sexuality, marriage, and life – foundational Genesis issues – will get us labeled as “hateful” by people who believe they are more loving to other image-bearers than our Creator is. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trust in God and continue to speak the truth in love. That is our only option.

We’re all Klansmen now.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-tony-dungy-marches-for-life-while-his-detractors-demonize-the-gospel,2023-01-25
Squires: ‘What Is a Woman?’ proves godless hedonism – not Christian nationalism – is America’s biggest threat,"""What is a Woman?,"" the documentary film from Daily Wire podcast host and political commentator Matt Walsh is not primarily about women. It’s not even mainly about transgenderism or the excesses of leftist dogma related to sex and gender.



The documentary is about the nature of truth and as such, it's ultimately about theology more than biology. Walsh is an outspoken Catholic, but he never tackles the subject from a religious perspective. That may have been a strategic choice, given how left-of-center media outlets are trying to convince Americans that the biggest threat to the future of the republic is the growing number of conservatives who advocate for policies informed by their faiths.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The biggest problem our culture faces is godless hedonism, not Christian nationalism.

Matt Walsh asked a simple question – “what is a woman?”– to college professors, medical professionals, elected officials, activists, and ordinary citizens. Very few even attempted to give a straightforward, logical answer. It is hard to give an answer when your mind has been conditioned to think in terms of “your truth” or say that a person’s self-perception is “their reality.” One college professor in the film said Walsh’s use of the word “truth” itself was “transphobic,” “condescending,” and “rude.”

This is why our entire culture has come to believe that a person can change their sex simply by claiming they identify as the opposite sex. The reason Lia Thomas is a household name is because activists and journalists focus on hormone levels and fairness for trans athletes instead of basic definitions. If women’s sports are for women and men can’t become women, then there is no reason whatsoever for a man to be competing in women’s sports.

The elevation of the self above all rational objective thinking is also why there seems to be a sudden explosion of drag queens engaging with young children. The ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" programs in local libraries have morphed into drag queens reading and performing in public schools as well as drag events for young children in adult clubs. These events are posted online as if men twerking and gyrating in front of young children is perfectly normal and acceptable, but only if those men are dressed up as women.

The modern left has no limit on the types of content and activities adults can introduce to children in the name of LGBT progress. That became crystal clear by how liberal entertainers, lawmakers, and journalists responded to a bill prohibiting schools from discussing matters of sex, sexuality, and gender identity with young children. They said “gay” for weeks in their state houses, on news broadcasts, and at awards shows because they believe the desires of adults should always take precedence over the needs of children.

The denial of objective truth is a rejection of God. There is a straight line from biological evolution to political revolution to cultural devolution.

If human beings have no creator who provides our standards of morality, then human flourishing is a function of having the right people in power to control our lives, not a matter of spiritual health. Societies don’t suffer from too much sin; their problem is not enough Caesar.

The problem with that worldview is that chaos ensues when the concept of objective truth is rejected, people believe they can create their own realities and feelings become the final arbiters of good and evil.

What we are seeing in the West is the inevitable collapse of this way of thinking. Leftist dogma regarding the value of life, the human body, biological sex, human sexuality, and the definition of family are all part of the same death spiral. According to the Bible, God wants humanity to “be fruitful and multiply” and build order into our world that allows us to fulfill that command. Reproduction requires male and female participation. Marriage provides the ideal context for the provision and protection of women and dependent children. The scriptures declare the value of human life is inherent because of our common creator.

The practitioners of progressive politics disagree. They believe abortion up until birth of is a human right and think toddlers can change their genders. The family structures they prefer promoting cannot reproduce offspring without external assistance. Their command to fellow humans is, “be fruitless and destroy.”

This is the dystopian future of butchered babies, harvested eggs, rented wombs, and sterilized adolescents. Charles Darwin would probably describe this entire agenda as “artificial selection” because there is nothing natural about a species that sees the death and destruction of its young as a sign of social progress.









We live at a time where we have more financial resources, technological advances, and access to knowledge than at any point in history. We also seem more despondent, depressed, nihilistic, disconnected, and narcissistic than ever. That’s because material wealth does not give life meaning, and education is not the same as wisdom.

A lifetime of expensive formal education from the most elite institutions is worthless if it makes a person deny objective truth. None of the Maasai tribesmen Matt Walsh encountered studied medicine, law, or philosophy at Harvard, yet they understand the difference between men and women better than the people who have.

The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:19, “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: 'He catches the wise in their craftiness.'”

Our inability and unwillingness to answer the question “what is a woman?” has caught us in a trap we can’t escape with more worldly wisdom. Only time will tell whether we will continue following the path of man’s wisdom or embrace the peace that accompanies God’s truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-what-is-a-woman-proves-godless-hedonism-not-christian-nationalism-americas-biggest-threat,2022-06-06
Squires: Where are the men willing to defend women and children from cultural depravity?,"Protecting his children is a significant part of a father’s job. This is why everyone who has watched the film ""Taken"" likely saw Bryan Mills, the retired CIA officer played by Liam Neeson, as a hero for going across the globe to save his daughter from a sex trafficking ring.

One person who may disagree is Andrew Aoyama, an editor at the Atlantic. He saw something very different in Liam Neeson’s character. Aoyama shared his perspective in a short post about books on fatherhood.

“If today it’s hard to watch Taken without at least some disgust at the glorification of Neeson’s bloodshed, perhaps it’s because the traditional conception of fatherhood his character embodies has begun to fall out of step with shifting understandings of masculinity.”

He’s right. The understanding of what it means to be a man has shifted significantly over the past 30 years, but as is often the case, change is not synonymous with progress. The demonization of masculinity in this country has saturated the culture so thoroughly that men now view heroism with disdain.

You don’t need a particular set of skills to be a brave man in today’s world. Just a few good men willing to stand on the front lines of the culture war would go a long way. Unfortunately, too many are AWOL.

Every viral video on social media of a mother putting her son in a dress or taking her daughter to a “kid-friendly” drag show prompts the same question from me: “Where is this child’s father?”

I ask that question because I assume no man who cares about the propagation of his family line would stand idly by while his child is being tenderized to accept a distorted sense of gender and sexuality.

The absence of fathers willing to stand up in support of their daughters is also one of the most glaring omissions from the stories involving boys being allowed to compete in girls’ sports. I’m sure many do, but so far it seems like many of the female athletes are having to defend themselves against the gender radicals.

This is why many speak anonymously to reporters and distort their voices when they are on camera. This is a fight that requires fathers on the front lines. For some men, that means leading a march to the local school district. Others may choose to testify at school board meetings. Some fathers may get media attention by protesting at games or hijacking local news stories to stand up for their daughters.

Liam Neeson was willing to die to rescue his daughter. There are fathers in America today who wouldn’t risk being called a bad name to defend their children. These are the men who should be looked at with disgust, not the man willing to risk life and limb for the child he loves.

We need more men like Chris Elston (aka “Billboard Chris”) who are willing to speak the truth with boldness and courage. Elston goes across North America wearing a billboard that says, “Children Cannot Consent to Puberty Blockers” and speaking out against the dangers of transgender ideology. He’s not afraid of being called a bigot by people who hate his values and want to shatter the innocence of his children.

Billboard Chris understands a key element of the natural world: Weak or absent men make women and children more vulnerable to the predations of men who want to abuse and exploit them.

This is why the average teenage boy with testosterone coursing through his body will pursue a girl with no father or male figures in her life over one with a present dad and a few older brothers. Most people take the path of least resistance.

Such is the case in our culture. The forces seeking to pervert our children's minds have advanced this far because men have allowed them to do so.

Our culture has devolved to the point that corporations, politicians, journalists, and entertainers claimed the LGBT community was under attack because legislators in Florida said teachers couldn’t talk to young children about gender identity and sexuality. These people think it is their right to talk to children they didn’t birth, raise, or support about the preferred pronouns of a non-binary pansexual.

A culture that doesn’t respect and honor the role of parents is playing with fire. It is only a matter of time before we read a story about a man who reacts to a teacher who helps guide his child into “transitioning” with a punch in the face, not a sternly worded email.

You don’t have to be Liam Neeson to understand that one of the things that helps maintain order in any social setting is the underlying threat of violence aimed at people who transgress bedrock social norms. One of those norms is not talking to other people’s children about sexual matters without parental consent.

Many men have accepted the lie that they are in a throuple with the government, so they assume they are helpless in the face of bureaucrats who have claimed more and more power over American families.

The chaos and disorder we see in every area of our culture testify to this new norm. These men don’t have to fly all the way to Europe to find what they have lost. The quickest and surest way for them to find themselves is to ask their Creator.

The Bible is clear that fathers are to love and provide for their children, discipline and disciple them, and protect them. Part of the reason our country is in a state of steep moral devolution is because men have abdicated these duties.

They would rather be seen as inclusive “allies” by readers of the Atlantic than tell their sons, “No, you can’t have that one – because boys don’t wear dresses.”



That type of response would have been automatic 40 years ago. Men today have been ground down by the forces of feminism and gender inclusion so thoroughly that they are afraid to speak plainly to their own children. Too many have been stripped of their boldness and courage – the metaphorical embodiment of what C.S. Lewis called “men without chests.”

It is time to reclaim what has been taken from American men. Future generations are depending on us.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-where-are-the-men,2022-08-09
Squires: Sam Brinton and Rachel Levine are the 'impossible women' leading the second-wave DEI movement,"A picture of Dr. Rachel Levine and Sam Brinton, two of the most visible officials in the Biden administration, went viral last week. Levine, a man who believes he is a woman, is the assistant secretary for Health. Brinton is a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Energy who identifies as “non-binary,” dresses in drag, and is public about his puppy role-play fetish.

Like Levine and Brinton, Lia Thomas also made news last week. Thomas is the male swimmer from the University of Pennsylvania who won an NCAA national championship in the women’s 500-yard freestyle in March. His school decided to honor that accomplishment by nominating him for the NCAA’s 2022 “Woman of the Year” award.

These three men have something very important in common. They are all prominent leaders in the second-wave DEI movement.

First-wave DEI was mainly focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace and academia based on race and sex. Affirmative action, coding camps for black teenagers, and government set-aside programs for women-owned businesses are all part of first-wave DEI. These policies and initiatives have always faced varying levels of opposition, but people are generally more supportive of programs that widen the net of participation rather than lower the bar of performance in a particular field.

Second-wave DEI builds on its predecessor but has a very different set of goals. It uses demoralization, extortion, and intimidation to force social change on an unwilling public. The primary beneficiaries of the second-wave are “gender and sexual minorities,” but supportive nonwhite and female allies benefit from the scraps that fall from the rainbow table.

The unofficial start of the second-wave DEI movement was July 15, 2015. That was the night Caitlyn Jenner was given the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs. Jenner was described as “courageous” and “stunning” by the person who introduced him that night, but not everyone was in full support.

NBC Sports commentator Bob Costas expressed his opinion at the time during an appearance here on ""The Dan Patrick Show"":

“It strikes me that awarding the Arthur Ashe to Caitlyn Jenner is just a crass exploitation play, a tabloid play. In the broad world of sports—and this is not anything against Caitlyn Jenner—I am pretty sure they could have found someone who was much closer to actively [being] involved in sports who would have been deserving of what that award represents.”

It is unlikely that any active broadcaster of Costas’ stature would say anything close to that now. Even the most outspoken, politically incorrect sports personalities have evolved with the times.

Charles Barkley pledged his love for the beneficiaries of second-wave DEI at a recent event in Nevada. Barkley’s public gesture is a reflection of the impact men like Sam Brinton have had on the second-wave DEI movement. Brinton is a “handler” in the puppy-play fetish scene. He teaches his “pups'' how to submit and obey his commands. They are bound by leather and chains but claim to be “free” in their alternate identity as long as he is in charge. In puppy parlance, Charles Barkley rolled over and showed his belly.

Brinton’s position in the Biden administration may focus on nuclear energy, but he plays a much more significant role as an activist. UPenn’s women’s basketball team helped craft a plan of action after George Floyd’s death. None of those players would dare utter a word in defiance of Thomas or his second-wave brethren. His female teammates and opponents know that. The lack of support is demoralizing, which is why they would rather keep quiet than risk being ravaged by an angry mob for protesting.

Not their will, but his be done.

Second-wave DEI activists have also mastered the art of using fear and emotional manipulation to assert their dominance. Throughout history, extortion has always taken the form of “give me what I want or something bad will happen to you.” In second-wave DEI, it generally means “give me what I want or something bad will happen to me.”

This is how trans activists back most people into a corner. The average person would rather play the personal pronoun game than be linked to threats of suicide or physical harm. This is why “I’d rather a living daughter than a dead son” and “so, are you saying trans men don’t exist?” have become commonplace in our political discourse.

Like all dominant members of a social hierarchy, people like Sam Brinton and Khiara Bridges are trained to exploit any signs of weakness. Bridges is the University of California Berkeley Law School professor who told Senator Josh Hawley that his rejection of “pregnant men” was tied to violence against trans people.

Macy Gray showed a moment of weakness and whimpered through an interview where she apologized for correctly defining womanhood. She went from biology to “vibes” in less than one week. Black women like her were pioneers in first-wave DEI, but white men can reassert their dominance in the social hierarchy by claiming to be what Macy Gray has been her entire life.

The second-wave DEI movement is the first time in human history when a fake commodity is perceived as more valuable than the real thing. No one pays more for cubic zirconia than diamonds, but an obedient society values Impossible Women over the XX chromosome variety.









Caitlyn Jenner, Lia Thomas, Rachel Levine, and Sam Brinton are the poster boys for the new DEI regime, but the father of all lies has been at this for much longer than 2015.

The Bible describes Satan as the “accuser of the brethren.” Christians who struggle with sin know the feeling of drowning under the weight of guilt and shame. We hear the inner voices that say “everyone will abandon you if they find out who you really are or what you’ve done in the past. I’ll protect you if you bow down and worship me.”

Fear is a powerful tool for forcing compliance. Left to our own strength, it can cast a true believer back into bondage to sin. Second-wave DEI is the commercialization of psychological warfare. Its leaders know whoever owns the mind can control the man. God demonstrates the priority He puts on our thinking in Romans 12:2 that says:

“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”

The only thing that can withstand the current wave — and all the ones to come — is a renewed mind firmly rooted in biblical truth. No other ideology can assure victory. Liberals have become libertines and conservatives don’t know what they want to conserve. The choice is simple. Our culture will submit to Christ or we will have chaos. The waves will continue to crash, but believers can stand firm in the knowledge that the battle has already been won.

"Whitlock: New York Mayor Eric Adams, the Dragged King, wears the LGBTQ wedding dress the left requires","The political left has been planning the wedding of black people to the LGBTQ movement since the days of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.



Bayard Rustin, a gay man, helped organize Dr. King’s march on Washington. Huey Newton, the national leader of the Black Panther Party, argued as early as 1970 for an alliance between black people and gays. In the last two decades, American academia exaggerated and elevated the profoundness of the writing of James Baldwin, a gay novelist in the 1950s.

During his second term as president, Barack Obama gave black voters permission to drop the religious pretense and come out of the closet as bi-political and supportive of same-sex marriage. At the close of Obama’s presidency, black people were officially engaged to the LGBTQ+ movement.

Post-Obama, three black lesbians, the founders of Black Lives Matter, married black people to the LGBTQ community, forming the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.

Now, gay is the new black. We’re the mascots, the internationally recognized symbol, for the gay movement and all forms of biblical sexual immorality.

Yesterday, my ""Fearless"" colleague Delano Squires texted me an internet billboard promoting Drag Queen Story Hour as an event celebrating Juneteenth, the newly federalized national holiday celebrating the end of slavery. The poster references Juneteenth and, of course, includes a reference to Black Lives Matter.

Is there any other racial ethnic group as closely aligned to the gay and trans community as black Americans? What does Juneteenth have to do with drag queens? Nothing. The underlying message is that black people are connected to drag queens and gender dysphoria.

We’re mascots for the Alphabet Mafia.

This is the deal black political elites have cut.

New York Mayor Eric Adams symbolizes the bargain that has been made. Since last Wednesday, Adams has been tweeting up a storm about Juneteenth, LGBTQ issues, and drag queens. As of early this morning, 17 of Adams’ last 30 tweets related to Alphabet Mafia issues. The mayor of America's largest city is obsessed with race and sexuality.

Adams is the second black mayor in the history of New York. He’s a former 20-year New York police officer. He grew up going to church. He previously supported Louis Farrakhan’s vision of black male masculinity and self-responsibility.

New York has a multitude of high-profile issues, including a rise in crime. Eleven tweets about Juneteenth and six about sex and/or drag queens? His priorities are not in proper alignment. Neither are his values.

Eric Adams, like most black political elites, is a Dragged King. His allegiance to leftist ideology has dragged him away from his values.

“Drag storytellers, and the libraries and schools that support them, are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces” Adams tweeted Wednesday.

Black people are locked in an unholy political marriage. We swore matrimonial vows to a movement that directly contradicts biblical values.

“To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.”

We’re financially broke, mentally and medically sick, and dying in the womb, at the hospital, and in our communities. The marriage to progressive ideology and secular values is killing us. We’ve had to abandon everything we say we believe to remain loyal to a political ideology that has not improved our condition.

The political left define who we are and what we believe. The regime now requires us to serve as the mascots for gays, trans, and drag queens. I’m not homophobic. But I’ll never support men dressed as women reading books to school children. That’s grooming. I’ll never support biological men competing in sports against biological women. It’s not fair to women or girls. I’ll never support surgeries or puberty blockers that stop young girls and boys from developing naturally. That’s abuse. I’ll never support same-sex marriage. It’s inconsistent with what’s taught in the Bible, no different from how my previous promiscuity made me an inappropriate candidate for marriage.



I’m a Christian. I’m not going to abandon what I believe and join a movement that violates my beliefs because a narrative has been spun that opposition to leftist values is anti-black.

I’m not wearing the clown suit the left has stitched for black people. It’s a wedding dress. I don’t wear dresses. Eric Adams does.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-adams-lgbtq-wedding-dress,2022-06-21
Whitlock: Dave Chappelle’s Netflix special channels Patrick Henry and Malcolm X and lays bare the war between black men and the Alphabet Mafia,"The society that outlaws personal offense suppresses truth and freedom. This is the danger of criminalizing thoughts and ideas, including abhorrent ones.

Comedian Dave Chappelle is currently the number-one target of the thought police. His latest and allegedly final Netflix comedy special violated the left's thought policies. He cracked jokes and made points that allegedly deeply offended the LGBTQ wing of the Alphabet Mafia, the ruling family of the New Underworld Order.

GLAAD, the gay lesbian alliance against defamation, has called for Netflix to remove ""The Closer"" from its streaming service. A group called the National Black Justice Coalition added its voice to GLAAD's. The NBJC is a Washington, D.C.-based black crew of LGBT soldiers.

Chappelle is a wanted man, a fugitive accused of transphobia, homophobia, toxic masculinity, anti-Semitism, and truth-telling.

GLAAD tweeted: ""Dave Chappelle's brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities. Negative reviews and viewers loudly condemning his latest special is a message to the industry that audiences don't support platforming anti-LGBTQ diatribes. We agree.""

Netflix platformed a comedian who thinks the wrong thing.

What does Chappelle think?

He thinks that the Alphabet Mafia has created a world where we care more about hurting a gay person's feelings than about the murder of a black man. He thinks sexual identity and gender identity have an outsized influence over American culture. He expressed this opinion by pointing out that the rapper DaBaby did more damage to his entertainment career with his criticism of gay people than he did shooting and killing a black man inside a Walmart.

The truth is, Chappelle's thought crimes in ""The Closer"" are deeper than gay and trans jokes.

""The Closer"" challenged the entire orthodoxy of the ruling establishment. And it issued the challenge using the ruling establishment's weapon of choice — race.

A black man from middle America declared war against the left's evisceration of masculinity in general and black, male, heterosexual masculinity in particular. Chappelle argued and quipped that Jews, feminists, and the LGBTQ movement are standing on the backs and necks of black men — preferably dead ones — to seize power.

I want to restate that, because most reviewers are intentionally mischaracterizing or mis-informationing the point of ""The Closer."" A black reviewer for NPR, Eric Deggans, wrote a piece saying that Chappelle is ""using white privilege to excuse his own homophobia and transphobia.""

The Alphabet Mafia is clearly feeding Deggans a steady diet of buttered biscuits or Deggans is a made man in the Alphabet Mafia. Those are the only plausible explanations for a black man this badly missing the point of Chappelle's message.

Chappelle cleverly and correctly argued that Jews, feminists, and the LGBTQ movement have seized power by covertly camouflaging their power-grabs as selfless fights for racial equality. Chappelle used DaBaby as a proxy for heterosexual black men. He demanded that the Alphabet Mafia remove its foot from DaBaby's neck. Chappelle was talking about his own neck, my neck, Kevin Hart's neck, and the neck of anyone else who identifies as male, black, and straight.

I'm a writer. I can recognize literature even when it's delivered verbally from a stage. Chappelle conveyed an essay, a letter from the prison cell social justice warriors have built for straight black men.

""The Closer"" should be renamed ""I Can't Breathe."" You're choking me.

Chappelle touched several third rails. That's why Alphabet Mafia soldiers have been dispatched to kill the messenger and distort his message. Chappelle is being accused of anti-Semitism for his two ""Space Jews"" jokes that imply Jewish people rule the world and that they have gone from oppressed to oppressor. In the New Underworld Order, you can only crack those kinds of jokes on American white men. Chappelle cannot generalize about the executives who asked him to wear a dress and sit atop a music industry that lavishly rewards rappers for denigrating black people.

I risk being accused of anti-Semitism for daring to properly interpret Chappelle's comedy and for arguing his point of view is worthy of discussion. I'm not anti-Semitic. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, either.

I'm frustrated. I want to identify whatever secular forces are being used to castrate heterosexual Christian men, particularly black ones. The gatekeepers of popular culture, the executives at the top of Hollywood and the music industry, seem to be hostile toward me. They seem obsessed with protecting the feelings of feminists and the LGBTQ and casting me as a self-defined immoral thug with fantasies of bedding Billy Porter.

""The Closer"" captures the battle between black straight men and the feminist and LGBTQ movements. The left argues feminists, LGBTQ, and black men are all allies, natural allies in the war against Donald Trump and his supporters. Reality is quite different. Dave Chappelle doesn't hate Trump or his supporters. As he admitted in his comedy special, Chappelle goes to bars in rural Ohio and drinks with Trumpers. He lives among them.

Great comedians cut through false narratives and expose the truth. Ministers and comedians are supposed to be guardians of truth. They're given permission to speak uncomfortable truths. They open the door for the rest of us to engage in difficult conversations.

""The Closer"" is the most important comedic sermon ever delivered. It's equal parts Patrick Henry's ""give me liberty or give me death"" speech at the second Virginia convention and Malcolm X's ""the ballot or the bullet"" speech at Cleveland's Cory Methodist Church.

BLM-LGBTQ-CRT — the Alphabet Mafia — and its megaphone, Twitter, have jeopardized free speech in America by outlawing personal offense. The price of uttering the wrong word or thought is so high in our new safe space culture that speaking the truth is too risky for too many Americans.



In order to maintain a free and just society, we must tolerate people saying and thinking whatever they please, including things we find rude and offensive.

"Whitlock: ESPN is sleeping with your enemy, and so are you","American essayist Charles Dudley Warner coined the phrase “politics makes strange bedfellows.” It was written as an observation in the mid-1800s. Christians should have interpreted it as a warning.

The adoption of a political identity will eventually align you with your enemies and inevitably detach you from your faith.

We can see this process unfolding in the sports world in real time. The ultimate example of American meritocracy and exceptionalism, competitive sports, is no match for politics’ ability to divide, corrupt, and conquer. Politics is always about power and money. It cannot coexist on equal footing with faith. Politics is about the rulership of earth and has no concern with salvation in an afterlife. It is short-sighted, greedy, and unethical.

It obeys Caesar’s creed: “If you must break the law, do it to seize power; in all other cases observe it.”

Just six short years ago, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made arenas and stadiums platforms for political expression of dissatisfaction. He said he kneeled during the national anthem because police officers killed black men without consequence.

Soon after, soccer star Megan Rapinoe and others joined Kaepernick in protest. And soon after that, on-field protests were about far more than the value of black lives. It was about equal pay for female jocks, LGBT rights, Trump resistance, LGBTQ rights, MAGA resistance, LGBTQ+ rights, voter ID laws in Georgia, and now, finally, LGBTQIA+ rights.

Late last week, ESPN employees called for a moment of silence because Florida governor Ron DeSantis plans to sign a law that, among other things, places limits on what Florida schools can teach young students about gender and sexuality. HB 1557 is the Parental Rights in Education bill. Its critics claim it discriminates against the LGBTQIA+ community. Critics call it the “don’t say gay” bill.

ESPN anchor Elle Duncan, aka light-skin Jemele Hill, took to the airwaves to express displeasure with Florida lawmakers.

“We understand the gravity of this legislation and also how it is affecting so many families across this country, and because of that our allyship is going to take a front seat. And with that, we’re going to pause in solidarity.”

ESPN basketball broadcasters Carolyn Peck and Courtney Lyle were up next.

“There are things bigger than basketball that need to be addressed at this time,” Lyle said. “Our friends, our family, our coworkers, the players, and coaches in our community are hurting right now. Our LGBTQIA+ teammates at Disney asked for our solidarity and support.”

Parents having authority over what their kids are taught in public schools is a threat to the LGBTQIA+ community? Let’s say that it is. Why is this threat being analyzed, discussed, and combatted on Disney’s sports network? Why can't it be covered exclusively on Disney’s ABC news network?

Are there any Disney employees who see abortion as a threat to babies in the womb? And will those employees be allowed to call for a moment of silence?

Sports and religion used to be partners. Teams took knees together in pre- and postgame prayer. Churches sponsored baseball, basketball, and football leagues. The best coaches saw their profession as ministry.

Politics does not leave room for religion. Coaches now prioritize making political statements rather than religious ones. Nick Saban appearing in a Black Lives Matter commercial is good for recruiting. So is hiring female assistant football coaches. In the not-so-distant future, Saban will need to appear in a commercial vowing support for the LGBTQIA+ community.

BLM and LGBTQIA+ are the same organization, the Alphabet Mafia. They’re making offers ESPN, Nick Saban, Gregg Popovich, the NFL, and the NBA can’t refuse.

Black Lives Matter was a Trojan horse for imposing secular values on popular culture. Sports had been the most powerful tool supporting traditional, Judeo-Christian values in American culture. Men’s sports celebrated the patriarchy. That is no longer the case. Kaepernick led the invasion of politics into sports. He gave Disney and ESPN the excuse they needed to overhaul sports culture into something that pleases the Alphabet Mafia by disavowing Christian principles and values.

Securalizing American sports is the gateway drug to overthrowing the U.S. Constitution. That’s a big statement. Let me explain.

Like sports, our Constitution is infused with Christian principles and values. Live sports programming is the strongest content force in American culture. The NFL is the most popular show on five different TV networks – CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN, and the NFL Network. If you want to communicate with a large audience, football (college and pro) is the only product that works consistently at a high level. Basketball works to a lesser degree.

Changing sports to a celebration of secular and Marxist values is preparing American minds for politicians to call for a reimagining of our Constitution. We’re deep into the process. Over the past month, corporate media pundits have called anyone who questions our strategy related to war in Ukraine as “treasonous.” How can an opinion about a war between Ukraine and Russia be treasonous for an American?

The definition of America and American sovereignty is being redefined right now. If an American doesn’t criticize Vladimir Putin loud enough, corporate media says you’re committing treason. But Elie Mystal can go on national TV and call our Constitution trash without being labeled a traitor.



It does not make sense. Unless you recognize that the social engineers are intentionally manipulating the American mind. All things infused with Christian values are under attack. Sports are a battlefield for the attack. A political identity, whether red or blue, will put you at odds with a Christian identity.

Our bedfellows aren’t strange. They’re evil.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-espn-is-sleeping-with-your-enemy-and-so-are-you,2022-03-21
Whitlock: Jussie Smollett and his grandmother believe he is Nelson Mandela,"Inside a Chicago courtroom early Thursday evening, the man Jesse Jackson described as a “well-known, nonviolent, black, gay man of Jewish heritage” cast himself as Nelson Mandela.

As sheriffs escorted civil rights actorvist Jussie Smollett to a Cook County jail cell, the convicted felon thrust his half-black fist into the air, declared his innocence, and shouted “I am not suicidal.”

Bizarre does not adequately describe the courtroom proceedings that ended with a judge sentencing Smollett to 150 days in jail and 30 months of probation and the former TV star emphatically posturing as a political prisoner, America’s Mandela.

Smollett arrived at his sentencing “fashionably” late, like a celeb taking his NBA Finals courtside seat minutes after tipoff. On the way into the courtroom, Smollett, his entourage, and bodyguards shoved their way past members of the media, knocking one man to the ground. Once inside, Smollett’s nightmare team of lawyers and character witnesses constantly relitigated the five guilty verdicts from his race-hoax trial, condescendingly lectured the judge, and displayed a level of arrogance, entitlement, and cluelessness that would embarrass an off-the-wagon Hunter Biden.

Apparently there’s no stronger delusion than half-black privilege.

Smollett’s 92-year-old white grandmother hammered that point. Ninety minutes before her grandson began his long walk to freedom, Smollett’s granny took the witness stand and threw herself into the role of Winnie ManKaren. She blasted the media for failing to properly investigate the events that turned her spoiled heir into a five-time felon. She wagged her finger at the judge, telling him:

“I ask you, judge, not to send him to prison. And if you do, send me along with him, okay?”

Judge James Linn scolded and berated Smollett for half an hour before rendering Smollett’s sentence for premeditating an elaborate, buffoonish, and farcical racial hate-crime hoax and repeatedly lying about it to police, a jury, and the judge.

“You’re just a charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime, and that’s shameful,” the judge said. “You’re profoundly arrogant and selfish and narcissistic.”

The description applies to many of Smollett’s high-profile supporters, particularly Jesse Jackson and Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP. Jackson, Johnson, and Smollett exemplify the pervasive exploitation, perversion, and commercialization of the 1950s and '60s civil rights movement. A righteous, dignified movement that fought for freedom and opportunity for everyday black people has been turned into a branding hu$tle for celebrities and other elites. They stand on the necks and backs of dead career criminals, feign outrage, enhance their brands and/or move up the corporate ladder, and use their growing wealth to move closer to white people, white neighborhoods, white schools, and so-called white supremacy.

Jussie Smollett made it to the promised land, the land where Barack Obama, Colin Kaepernick, Brian Flores, Meghan Markle, Trevor Noah, Don Lemon, and other elite BIPOCs are told the truth doesn’t apply to them. They exist in a bubble of delusion and confusion created specifically for them by their liberal political puppet masters and policed by corporate media.

Smollett was groomed for this bubble since birth. His family clearly nurtured and fed the arrogance, selfishness, and narcissism Judge Linn found “astounding.” There’s no other explanation for Smollett’s family’s unhinged desperation to shield him from the consequences of his race hoax. Had Smollett’s grandmother and brother been motivated by love, they would have been far less defiant, angry, and smug at Thursday’s sentencing. Guilt explains their tone and behavior.

They created Frankenstein. They’ve been the supporting actors in Jussie’s Nelson Mandela cosplay for four decades. They simply stayed in character after hearing the sentence, claiming Smollett’s 150-day verdict was another example of the discrimination American black men face in the criminal justice system.

Smollett melted down.

“I am innocent, and I’m not suicidal,” Smollett declared after initially declining to speak. “If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBT community. Your honor, I respect you and I respect the jury. But I did not do this, and I am not suicidal. And if anything happens to me when I go there, I did not do it to myself. And you must all know that.”

Smollett definitely did it to himself. No one is denying that. He destroyed his name, reputation, and career three years ago when he foolishly claimed white, MAGA-hat-wearing thugs lassoed him with a noose and tried to harm him. Smollett destroyed his chance at avoiding jail time by instructing his army of lawyers to behave as though their client was the last innocent man and a victim of political revenge.

In the immediate aftermath of his hoax, Smollett told NBC’s Robin Roberts that he was the target of violence because of his criticism of the sitting president, Donald Trump. Smollett’s posse of enablers – his family, Jesse Jackson, and social media – convinced the B-list actor that Trump represented American apartheid and that Jussie was the half-black, gay Nelson Mandela.



Smollett is a victim. He’s a victim of CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, Twitter, and Facebook. Corporate and social media radicalized Smollet. They did the same thing to half of America. They developed and released the Trump derangement virus that ignited a five-year-and-still-counting pandemic of irrational behavior. The same platforms radicalized a significant number of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol. One of the president’s supporters – Ashli Babbitt – was murdered; many others remain in jail or have been handed long prison sentences.

Smollett may never realize how easy he got off.

Ashli Babbitt has far more in common with Nelson Mandela than Jussie Smollett. And she wasn’t suicidal, either.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-jussie-smollett-and-his-grandmother-believe-he-is-nelson-mandela,2022-03-11
Whitlock: Dave Portnoy and Andrew Tate are the natural outgrowth of a culture hostile to masculinity,"Dave Portnoy and Andrew Tate are the Al Capone and Lucky Luciano of masculinity prohibition. Portnoy and Tate bootleg moonshine masculinity across the internet.



Their wealth and fame are byproducts of America’s misguided masculinity temperance movement.

We’re living in the third wave of masculinity prohibition. Each wave popularizes and enriches a new breed of masculinity bootleggers.

Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, and Tate, a kickboxing champion turned TikTok influencer, are the latest undeserving benefactors of an unholy mission Democrats and feminists devised 60 years ago to demonize manhood.

Portnoy built a sports media empire pretending to be a fearless ESPN disruptor standing against the wokefication of sports and American culture. It’s now clear he’s a total fraud and sellout. His lone interests are money and access to barely legal women. He sold Barstool to a gambling company for hundreds of millions of dollars, and now Barstool is every bit as woke as ESPN.

Monday night, Portnoy engaged in a Twitter beef with comedian Alex Stein, a truly fearless internet disruptor. Stein, a contributor to BlazeTV, mocks local and national politicians – of all political parties – with viral videos. Barstool’s Twitter feed posted a hilarious video of Stein trolling members of the Las Vegas City Council. Within hours, Barstool deleted the post. Stein called out Barstool’s cowardice, tweeting:

“It’s so cute that @barstoolsports is owned by Stool Presidente who is accused of the most heinous things, but they are too afraid to keep my content up.”

Portnoy struck his tough-guy pose, responding:

“Buddy shut the fuck up. We are owned by a gambling company. We’ve had roughly 9,000 training sessions not to post shit like this cause regulators don’t like it… Go back to whatever hole you crawled out of.”

Via DM, Portnoy offered to have Stein on a podcast, but quickly changed course.

Portnoy is a fraud. He has no core values. No defined set of beliefs. He has no redeeming qualities other than his wealth. Remove his money, and he wouldn’t have a friend in this world.

If we weren’t living in an era completely hostile to masculinity, Portnoy would be broke in Boston delivering pizza. The prohibition of masculinity is what made heroes and millionaires of men like Portnoy and Tate.

Tate is a former contestant on the TV show “Big Brother.” He started something called Hustler’s University on TikTok, posting relationship and life advice to young men. He’s the pornographic version of Kevin Samuels, the now-deceased popular relationship YouTuber.

Masculinity is like air and water. We need it for survival. The world was built by male energy. Thank God, Jesus was masculine. Thank God, men were willing to die in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the World Wars for our freedom.

The demonization of masculinity has caused a shortage and inflated the value of it. The shortage has created a market for impostors and moonshiners.

If ESPN wasn’t hostile to masculinity, there would never have been a market for Portnoy’s brand of masculine sports talk. The out-of-control, believe-all-women #MeToo movement created the market for Andrew Tate.

Alcohol prohibition was bad. Alcohol isn’t a necessity. Masculinity is. The ramifications of the prohibition of masculinity are far worse than the repealed 18th Amendment.

We’ve lowered the standard and behavior for manhood so low that idiots believe puberty blockers and surgery can make men. We’re so desperate we’ll now accept any form of masculinity. It can be profane, stupid, obscene, criminal, and godless.

Let me walk you through a brief history of how we arrived at this level of insanity.

The masculinity temperance movement started in earnest in the 1960s, shortly after it became obvious that Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement would deliver full American citizenship to black people. In reaction, feminists partnered with President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society initiative to emasculate men.

White men failed to strongly object to this diabolical partnership because they mistakenly believed feminists and Democrats planned to only castrate black men.

The first wave of this prohibition primarily damaged black men, particularly black men of faith. The first wave spawned celebrity poverty pimps such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, the Milli Vanilli of civil rights. They pretended to be fearless freedom fighters while doing the bidding of feminists, Democrats, and the LGBT crowd.



The second wave of this prohibition popularized gangsta rappers. Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, and N.W.A. pretended to speak truth to power while promoting degeneracy, criminality, drug use, materialism, and hedonism.

The third wave has brought us Portnoy and Tate. Internet bullies posing as masculine men. Their success has spawned imitators. The next iteration will be worse.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-portnoy-tate-masculinity,2022-08-23
Whitlock: Respect for Marriage Act outlaws your religious beliefs,"The Silicon Valley-generated social media apps elevated the importance of feelings and diminished the value of beliefs.



The engineers of Twitter and Facebook laughed off Ben Shapiro’s facts-don’t-care-about-your-feelings declaration and retorted with “our feelings don’t care about your religious beliefs.”

Shapiro’s slogan burnished his brand as the voice of establishment conservatives. Social media’s retort empowered a movement that legalized same-sex marriage, justified Black Lives Matter, and normalized kid-friendly drag queen shows, children choosing genders, and doctors prescribing puberty blockers and surgical mutilation.

The engineers of social media won in a landslide. They’re in the process of taking another victory lap.

Chuck Schumer, the majority leader of the Senate, has gathered enough votes to federally codify same-sex marriage into the law of the land. Twelve Republicans joined 50 Democrats in pledging to federalize marriage and make gay people a protected class of American citizens.

They’re calling it the Respect for Marriage Act.

After the overturn of the left’s abortion golden calf, Roe v. Wade, the uniparty (the undercover alliance of Republicans and Democrats) wants to take steps to protect its same-sex golden calf, Obergefell v. Hodges. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas insinuated that the 2015 decision is unconstitutional.

The truth is, the uniparty believes religious beliefs are unconstitutional and immoral. The establishment has partnered with northern California’s tech companies to outlaw beliefs and set up a system that protects feelings.

You follow me?

I’ve argued from the outset of social media that Twitter and Facebook prioritize thoughts and feelings above beliefs. There’s a major difference between what a human being thinks or feels and what he believes.

I wake up most days thinking I’m as handsome as Idris Elba. The truth is, I believe I more closely resemble Cedric the Entertainer.

Our thoughts aren’t nearly as important as social media makes us believe. Humans think and feel all sorts of stupid and inaccurate things. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are great places to test what we think and sharpen what we believe. They’re practice facilities.

The devil resides in our thoughts. Our beliefs should reflect God’s wisdom. The founders understood this and designed a system that granted us the freedom to think and say whatever we want while respecting the self-evident truths of the equality of man and unalienable rights granted by our Creator.

Social media is the devil’s pulpit. We’re building a culture that protects thoughts and feelings and criminalizes beliefs.

The Respect for Marriage Act criminalizes biblical scripture. The concept of marriage is taken directly from the Bible. Marriage is explicitly explained in the Bible. It’s a covenant between man and woman.

I get that two men or two women think and/or feel they should be allowed to marry. That’s their American right to think, feel, and express whatever they want. But people of religious faith have the right to believe what God and the Bible teach.

Believers run the risk of loss of employment or lawsuits for acting on their beliefs. If a cake baker refuses to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, he can be sued.

Seven years ago, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed fired the city’s fire department chief, Kelvin Cochran, because he distributed a book he wrote that contained his religious views on homosexuality. Reed classified the book as discriminatory against the LGBT community.

It’s a mistake to maintain a culture that has more reverence for feelings than for beliefs. That’s where we are. Social media trained many of us to feel that the police were randomly killing black men across the country. Statistics and facts did not and do not support that feeling. We ignored the facts and worked to assuage feelings. We demonized and defunded law enforcement.



It’s foolish to act on emotion and feelings. Emotions and feelings change at a whim. The 7-year-old little girl who feels like a little boy is likely going to feel like a girl in a year or two. We shouldn’t confirm her misguided feelings.

We shouldn’t confirm the misguided feelings of two men or two women who want to marry. Marriage isn’t for them, just as marriage isn’t for men and women who refuse to practice monogamy.

Social media drives our overemphasis of feelings and our hostility toward religious beliefs. Emotion powers feelings. You arrive at beliefs after years of deliberation and more deliberation.

Our society was more unified when we judged beliefs and were less concerned with protecting feelings. Social media turns everything into a slogan or hashtag. Slogans burnish brands and manipulate truth.

The Respect for Marriage Act disrespects marriage and the faith that created the institution.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-respect-for-marriage-act-outlaws-your-religious-beliefs,2022-11-17
Whitlock: Secular values and daddy issues destroyed Colin Kaepernick’s NFL career,"Colin Kaepernick’s sense of entitlement is a byproduct of America’s embrace of secular values.

Entitlement is the antithesis of gratitude, the spirit of thankfulness promoted by traditional religious faith. Christians believe Jesus died on the cross so that we don’t have to. Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback, has spent the last six years advancing the idea that NFL ownership crucified and banished him for protesting white supremacy. Based on his alleged crucifixion, he has developed a religious following that includes fervent disciples.

Earlier this week, on their ""I Am Athlete"" podcast, former NFL stars Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson, and Pacman Jones sat at Kaepernick’s feet, sought his wisdom, and then preached the gospel of Kap.

The gospel of Kap says the NFL owes the quarterback a job. His career must be resurrected to save the souls of racist league owners. Kap is the chosen one. The salvation of his career is critical for the salvation of man.

The gospel of Kap is consistent with the bible of secular values popular in modern America. As America has embraced secularism, the spirit of the age rejects gratitude and makes idols of narcissists who nail themselves to crosses.

Kaepernick is not the only self-appointed chosen one. His mindset of entitlement is pervasive. Nearly everyone with a social media platform believes they’re an undiscovered god or that they’re the debt collector for their idol.

An idol is anyone or anything viewed as worthy of blind worship, admiration, or devotion. America is sick with idolatry. The debt Christians believe we owe Jesus has been transferred to the LGBTQ, feminists, transgender, and people of color. Under the guise of seeking social justice, many religious leaders have surrendered to race idolatry, LGBTQ idolatry, the idolatry of women.

Idolatry is often referred to by code names such as diversity, inclusion, equity, the matriarchy.

The popular Twitter feed Libs of TikTok is in the crosshairs of the Washington Post and the secular movement because it exposes the depravity of LGBTQ idolators. Libs of TikTok posts videos of LGBTQ teachers explaining the necessity of teaching LGBT sexuality and transgenderism to young children.

Tuesday, the Washington Post published a story revealing the identity of the woman who runs Libs of TikTok. The purpose of the story was to intimidate and silence the woman. Libs of TikTok has been highly effective at alerting parents to the gender and sexuality grooming happening inside classrooms.

Parents are responsible for grooming and educating children about sex and gender, not schoolteachers.

Christian ministers are responsible for preaching the gospel as spelled out in the Bible. Unfortunately, many ministers have surrendered to the idolatry of race. Their sermons analogize the actions of Jesus to Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Ketanji Brown Jackson, or even Colin Kaepernick.

Kaepernick’s delusion isn’t difficult to understand. Idolatry breeds entitlement. The culture of entitlement fuels Kaepernick’s lack of self-awareness. He’s completely oblivious that his entitled attitude is the primary reason he hasn’t worked in the NFL the past five seasons.

Racism did not undercut Kaepernick’s career. Had Kaepernick embraced a spirit of gratitude, he might have reached all of his NFL aspirations. He’d certainly still be employed in the league.

NFL ownership is not at the root of Kaepernick’s problems. He can’t let go of the bitterness he feels about being abandoned by his biological father and mother. His mother gave him up for adoption. His father has never been identified.

That’s a difficult scar for any individual to overcome. A Christian spirit of gratitude would compel Kaepernick to focus on the blessing of his adoptive parents, the Kaepernicks. Rather than believing the world wronged him, Kaepernick would believe the world blessed him with two parents who overlooked their race and unconditionally loved a child who was not theirs by birth.

That is not Kaepernick’s mindset. You could see his lack of gratitude in the way he allowed Netflix to portray his parents in the ridiculous movie about his upbringing.

In the movie ""Colin in Black and White,"" Kaepernick portrayed his parents and the NFL as racist. He analogized the NFL to a slave planatation and insinuated that his parents did not want him to date black women.



You could argue that no one has done more for Kaepernick than his parents and the NFL. His attitude suggests that neither his parents nor the NFL have done enough for him.

Colin Kaepernick is the embodiment of America’s secular values. He’s clueless and entitled.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-secular-values-and-daddy-issues-destroyed-colin-kaepernicks-nfl-career,2022-04-20
Whitlock: Soccer star Megan Rapinoe benefits from ‘Alphabet Mafia’ triple-protection coverage,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe lives in the protected space created by social media's glorification of the BLM-LGBTQ+, the Alphabet Mafia.

Rapinoe is untouchable. She can't be criticized or questioned without fear of social media retribution. Her actions and motives are all assumed to be pure and driven by a purpose much greater than your own.

That's why most of the mainstream media summarily rejected and/or ignored Hope Solo's recent critique of Rapinoe. On Monday, Solo, a former member of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, claimed that Rapinoe subtly forced other soccer players to kneel during the national anthem. Solo said Rapinoe ""almost bullied"" her teammates to support Colin Kaepernick's kneeling publicity stunt.

""I think the kneeling thing can be very divisive,"" Solo said during a podcast interview. ""I've seen Megan Rapinoe almost bully players into kneeling because she really wants to stand up for something in her particular way.""



The purple-haired Rapinoe is a darling of corporate media. She's engaged to WNBA star Sue Bird. In the sports world, they are the ultimate power couple, a symbol of LGBTQ perfection.

Only a homophobe or a bigot would dare question the actions, motives, and agenda of Megan Rapinoe. So few people do. And certainly no one who aspires to work in corporate media would even consider taking Solo's allegation seriously. So few people did.

Instead, the immediate reaction was to point out that Solo was booted off the USWNT months before Kaepernick and Rapinoe began kneeling during the fall of 2016, the inference being that there was no way for Solo to know or see what Rapinoe did to win the support of her teammates. Yesterday, USA Today published a story hammering this point.

Yep. No way Solo has communicated with any of her former teammates over the last five years. Former teammates don't gossip and chat. I get that Solo said ""I've seen."" She's speaking loosely during an informal podcast interview. It's easy to misspeak or exaggerate in that setting.

Beyond that, anyone who has been following the Kaepernick controversy the last five years knows that many kneeling participants have been bullied. The threat has been clear: Kneel or be labeled racist.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was bullied into kneeling. Jones is an old billionaire. How much easier is it to bully a young athlete who lacks Jones' financial security? What percentage of NFL and NBA players do you think authentically believed in taking a knee during the national anthem?

The BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia stuck a gun to everyone's heads and made athletes offers they couldn't refuse. Everyone saw what happened to Saints quarterback Drew Brees when he offered tepid resistance. He was shot in the streets like Sonny Corleone in the original ""Godfather"" movie.

We've created a world where Alphabet Mafia members can't be questioned at all, but athletes such as Tim Tebow can be ridiculed with impunity. ESPN, the self-proclaimed ""Worldwide Leader in Sports,"" has spent the past decade analyzing and criticizing Tebow's motives and actions. The devout Christian knelt in prayer after big plays and touchdowns. He was the anti-Kaepernick long before Kaepernick became a polarizing figure and household name.

Tebow's cult of personality was much larger than his on-field performance warranted and a problem for his coaches to corral. His NFL career flamed out nearly a decade ago. This year, Tebow and his former college coach, Urban Meyer, resuscitated the Heisman Trophy winner's football career. At 34 years old, Tebow signed a deal to be a backup tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Both Tebow's and Meyer's motives were critiqued and questioned. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith accused Tebow and Meyer of exemplifying white privilege. Other broadcasters thought so little of Meyer's character that they claimed Meyer would give Tebow a regular-season roster spot whether he deserved it or not.

On Monday, Tebow was among the first players cut by the Jags and Meyer. Stephen A. Smith again claimed ""white privilege"" benefitted Tebow.

Would any of this be said about Megan Rapinoe? She's white.

If Tebow championed homosexuality, atheism, and Black Lives Matter, would any ESPN broadcasters have the courage to criticize him?

The U.S. women's soccer team turned in an embarrassing performance in the Tokyo Olympics, finishing in third place. It was supposed to be the Dream Team of women's soccer, arguably the most talented team ever assembled. Hope Solo strongly insinuated the team failed to win the gold medal because Rapinoe's agenda interfered with team chemistry.



""I think that's really hard being on the main stage right now with so many political issues for athletes,"" Solo said. ""There's a lot of pressure, and ultimately at the end of the day, our number one focus should and has always been to win first.""

Did the U.S. women lose because they were focused on politics rather than competition? It's a fair question. It makes sense. No country has spent more money on developing female soccer players than the United States.

Had the men's basketball team lost, the members would have been pilloried 24 hours a day, because they don't have the kind of triple Alphabet Mafia protection as Megan Rapinoe. She's female, gay, and pretends to worship Saint George Floyd.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-soccer-star-megan-rapinoe-benefits-from-alphabet-mafia-triple-protection-coverage,2021-08-18
"Whitlock: The NFL’s diversity, inclusion, and equity Super Bowl will be remembered as the ‘Roger Goodell Bridge’ to chaos and racial division","In the pop culture war raging across America, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will be remembered as the modern-day Ambrose Burnside.



Union Major General Burnside is widely regarded as the most inept soldier of America’s Civil War. His behavior and tactics during the Battle of Antietam were so incompetent that a bridge at the battlefield – Burnside Bridge – was named in his honor.

Yesterday’s Super Bowl LVI was Goodell’s Antietam. Rebel forces bullied Goodell into turning television’s largest platform and sports’ greatest meritocracy into a showcase for the Left’s tokenism and quota system that is cleverly branded as diversity, inclusion, and equity.

The actual game was reduced to a prop, a stage to promote the Left’s vision of equality, a utopia where a handful of powerful elites select winners and losers based on skin color, sexuality, and gender.

The diversity, inclusion, and equity coronation was kicked off by President Joe Biden’s pregame interview. The president blasted the league for not hiring more black head coaches.

“They haven’t lived up to what they committed to and lived up to being open about hiring minorities to run teams,” Biden told NBC News anchor Lester Holt. “The whole idea that a league that is made up of so many athletes of color as well as so diverse, that there’s not enough African American qualified coaches to manage these NFL teams, it just seems to me that it’s a standard that they’d want to live up to. It’s not a requirement of law, but it’s a requirement that I think of just some generic decency.”

Biden got the ball rolling. Goodell and NBC took it from there. Approximately 30 minutes before kickoff, singers Mary Mary performed the so-called black national anthem in the parking lot of SoFi Stadium. Minutes later, tennis legend and LGBT icon Billie Jean King entered the on-field festivities. She narrated a video about Title IX and inclusion. She then did the pregame coin toss. Before Sunday, I was unaware of any connection between King and football.

Greeting King for the coin toss was the game’s lead referee, Ron Torbert, the third black referee to oversee a Super Bowl. After the coin toss, a mixed-race singer, Jhene Aiko, performed America the Beautiful. Aiko was followed by black female country music singer Mickey Guyton, whose claim to fame is a George Floyd-inspired song. Aiko and Guyton are not household names. No one is going to compare them to Whitney Houston. We were then introduced to NBC’s two female sideline reporters, the great Michele Tafoya and Kathryn Tappen.

So far, by my estimation, Tafoya is the only person I feel confident was there based on merit. Everyone else feels like an agenda.

The Pepsi Halftime Show put the exclamation point on the diversity, inclusion, and equity agenda.

Let me be clear. I enjoyed the halftime show. I grew up listening to rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop, Eminem, and 50 Cent and soul singer Mary J Blige. But gangsta rappers are not appropriate for Super Bowl halftime. Gangsta rap is lyrical pornography. It’s to be ingested in the privacy of your headphones.

Dr. Dre is Hugh Hefner. Snoop is Johnny “The Wadd” Holmes. Eminem is Ron “The Hedgehog” Jeremy. 50 Cent? Well, he’s 250 Cent now.

I get that rap music is the best-selling, most popular form of music. It’s dumbed down. If you can talk, you can perform it. Popularity does not signify greatness. In this era, it signifies perversion. Porn is the most popular form of movie-making. Nothing is downloaded more on the internet. That doesn’t mean pornography should be placed on our largest platforms.

Dre and Snoop hosted a gangsta party, a celebration of gang culture on the Super Bowl stage. It was billed as the mainstreaming of black culture. Do white people claim Hefner, Holmes, and Jeremy as beacons of white culture?

Super Bowl LVI is what Roger Goodell’s leadership has wrought.

Off the field, the NFL is adhering to a script dictated by the diversity, inclusion, and equity gods. The league is adding female coaches to every staff. It is pushing out established referees to make room for women and black men. Soon, it will adopt new measures to further pressure ownership to hire black head coaches.

General Goodell keeps saying diversity, inclusion, and equity are the league’s highest priorities. It’s a deadly script that will erode the integrity of the game.

The erosion is happening on the field. Seven straight NFL playoff games were decided by three points or less or in overtime. NBC called it the “Super Seven.”

Football fans are growing more and more concerned with the suspect officiating that made it all happen. “Rigged” is the adjective of choice over “super.”

The Bengals led by four points late in Sunday’s Super Bowl. The Rams drove 71 yards and then stalled at the Cincinnati 8-yard line. On third down, Los Angeles quarterback Matt Stafford threw incomplete to Cooper Kupp. The refs bailed out the Rams by ignoring a false start penalty on three L.A. linemen and calling Cincy linebacker Logan Wilson for defensive holding.

The non-call and call changed the ending of the game. The Rams now had first and goal at the Cincinnati 4. The refs put Los Angeles in position to win the game. The Rams took advantage.

When you embrace a script off the field, eventually you have to embrace a script on the field. When you bite the poisonous fruit, the whole garden is corrupted.



Under General Goodell’s leadership, the NFL has rejected the values that made it the strongest force in popular culture. Football is now in the business of manipulating and controlling outcomes off the field. A handful of powerful elites ignore merit and decide who officiates, who tosses the coin, who sings, and who reports on the games. It sounds harmless and inconsequential.

It’s the “Goodell Bridge” to chaos and racial division. Merit has been replaced by agenda. Suspect officiating and close scores will not mask the decline in competition and performance forever.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-nfls-diversity-inclusion-and-equity-super-bowl-will-be-remembered-as-the-roger-goodell-bridge-to-chaos-and-racial-division,2022-02-14
First transgender designer debuts non-gender clothing line at New York Fashion Week,"Pierre Davis has become the first openly transgender designer to present a non-gender clothing line at New York Fashion Week, Agence France-Presse reported.

The 29-year-old designer from Los Angeles debuted the No Sesso brand Monday at Pier59 Studios in Chelsea. Davis reportedly describes the line as ""agender."" Launched in 2015, No Sesso translates as ""no gender"" in Italian.

""The show is inspired by business wear and evoking the spirit of the Glamazon regardless of gender,"" she told the Council of Fashion Designers of America, according to AFP.

Transgender models have regularly appeared at Fashion Week for the last several years.

What's the story?

Davis, who was born as a man, doesn't want the line to be seen as a gimmick, the outlet reported.

""I just want to show the work,"" Davis said.

The collection featured a mix of dresses, vests and sports attire worn by men and women models.

Davis hopes the clothes ""will inspire people to be more community-minded and to realize not everything is just about aesthetics or commerce. It's also about humanity,"" AFP reported.



It's important ""that people of all intersectional identities are given a fighting chance regardless of their identity. The playing field isn't level in the world, and it is even more difficult in fashion,"" Davis added.

What else?

Fashion Week started Monday with a focus on men's wear. Women's wear begins Thursday.

Kevin Hart should probably tell the Hollywood elite to go pound sand,"Hey, remember when comedian Kevin Hart made those jokes many years ago that offended a whole lot of people in 2018?

No, neither do I, because he mainly made them when he wasn't one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. Frankly, few entertainment fans care about what struggling actors/comedians are doing if it doesn't have something to do with the Kardashians.

At any rate, Hart made LGBT-related jokes, and people sure were mad about those LGBT-related jokes. After Hart had already been named host of the 2019 Oscars, people started dragging his name through the mud.

As a result of social media's take-no-prisoners mob — as well as the Academy's desire to pacify every last person who has any kind of feeling about anything in a post-Harvey Weinstein world — Hart stepped down from his hosting duties.

The Academy reportedly told Hart that he'd have to publicly apologize for the offending tweets (something he said he'd already done in the past) if he wanted to remain as the show's host.

Hart, sticking to his principles, said that he'd already addressed these tweets once before, and had apologized for them.

Instead of issuing redundant apologies, he resigned.

On Friday, openly gay fellow comedian Ellen DeGeneres hosted Hart on her daytime talk show and revealed that she spoke to Academy execs about the matter.

Those executives said that they absolutely wanted Hart to resume his hosting duties, and chalked the entire debacle up to a misunderstanding.

For his part, Hart said that he'd have to do some deep soul-searching before committing to any relevant decisions about the Oscars.

Frankly, though, Hart should stick to his principles, set the example, and remove himself from the toxic soup that is Hollywood's ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" culture that trashed the industry in the first place.

Hart's star is rising higher than ever — he doesn't need to kiss up to the Academy in order to make it anymore.

The 2019 Oscars are set to air on Feb. 24.

Here's to hoping Hart tells them to go pound sand at least 51 different times between now and then.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/kevin-hart-should-probably-tell-the-hollywood-elite-to-go-pound-sand,2019-01-04
Exxon Mobil will not allow LGBT or BLM flags to fly outside its office buildings,"Exxon Mobil will no longer allow its offices to fly flags expressing adherence to or membership of “outside organizations” on company flagpoles, the New York Times reported.

The new policy, which prevents employees from hanging LGBT+ pride and BLM flags on the flagpoles on company premises, is angering some of Exxon Mobil’s employees who in the past have flown gay pride flags outside of Exxon Mobil offices.

Exxon Mobil will only be allowing governmental, company, and employee resource group (ERG) flags to fly outside of its facilities. The Times said that ERGs are “employee-led affinity organizations that are generally blessed by employers.”

ERG flags that celebrate certain group identities may still be flown on company premises during months that coincide with those group identities.

Tracey Gunnlaugsson, vice president of human resources at Exxon Mobil, said, “It’s a longstanding practice at our facilities around the world that E.R.G. flags can be flown during signature months. The flags are directly related to our business and company support of our E.R.G.s.”

For instance, the company’s ERG logo for LGBT+ employees features bubbles filled with several colors around the word “PRIDE.” This logo has been flown at Exxon Mobil offices and is used on T-shirts that employees wear during gay pride parades.

J. Chris Martin, a former employee of Exxon Mobil, who previously had led the LGBT+ ERG group said that a different flag that featured the Exxon Mobil on a rainbow background “was flown at many company locations last year without question” and that he had been told that his ability to display this flag had been revoked “without explanation.”

Martin said, “I’m also told that the employee resource groups were consulted only in a perfunctory way regarding this matter, based on momentary discomfort with displaying a symbol of open-mindedness and support for long suppressed voices.”

He added, ""While they may say nobody has lost anything, the symbolism is unmistakable.”

The Human Rights Campaign, a leftist organization that advocates for the LGBT+ agenda under the guise of civil rights activism, lambasted Exxon Mobil’s policy. The group said, “There’s no such thing as ‘neutrality’ when it comes to our rights. Our flag isn’t just a visual representation of our identities. It is also a staple of allyship.”

The Human Rights Campaign has also aggressively come out against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education legislation that was recently signed into law by the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis.

In early March, the Human Rights Campaign said that it would refuse to accept donations from the Walt Disney Company until it took “meaningful action” against the then Parental Rights in Education Bill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657205737,2022-04-24
Report: Recent years see a sharp rise in youth transgenderism,"The number of American youth who identify as transgender has almost doubled in recent years.

A new report conducted by the UCLA Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy relied on government health surveys conducted from 2017 to 2020, and estimated that 1.4% percent of 13- to 17-year-olds and 1.3% of 18- to 24-year-olds identified as transgender whereas 0.5 percent of all adults identify as such.

The Williams Institute’s data concluded that 18% of all people who identify as transgender are between the ages of 13 and 17-years-old, and there are 1.6 million people aged 13 and up in the U.S. who identify as transgender.

There are roughly 700,000 people between the ages of 13- and 24-years-old who identify as transgender. In the American South, there are 102,200 transgender youth between the ages of 13- and 17- years old; in the Midwest, there are 54,500; in the North East, there are 61,700; and in the American West, including Alaska and Hawaii, there are 81,700.

The New York Times reported that this new data from the Williams Institute’s previous report in 2017 marks a significant rise specifically in youth transgenderism.

Experts on transgender youth believe that children now have the advanced language skills and capacity for social acceptance that emboldens them to explore their gender identities whereas older adults may feel more constrained.

Dr. Angela Geopferd, the self-identifying nonbinary medical director of the Gender Health Program at Children’s Minnesota hospital, indicated that exploring gender identity is merely an aspect of being a young person.

She said, “It’s developmentally appropriate for teenagers to explore all facets of their identity — that is what teenagers do. And, generationally, gender has become a part of someone’s identity that is more socially acceptable to explore.”

The nonbinary children’s physician said that young people exploring their gender identities is a phenomenon for which society must “make space.”

Geopferd said, “We as a culture just need to lean into the fact that there is gender diversity among us, and that it doesn’t mean that we need to treat it medically in all cases, but it does mean that we as a society need to make space for that.”

Data from the Williams Institute indicates that young people account for a disproportionately large share of the American transgender population while older adults had a “disproportionately small” share.

Only 10% of the transgender population consists of people over the age of 65.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657495368,2022-06-11
1 in 6 from America's youngest adult generation identify as LGBT,"Approximately one in six from America's youngest adult generation now identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, headlining a trend of increased LGBT identification in the country, according to a new Gallup survey.

The survey, conducted throughout the last year, found that 16% of U.S. adults from Generation Z identify as something other than heterosexual. Those surveyed were born between 1997 and 2002. Generation Z is defined as those born between 1997 and 2012; the survey did not include those who have not reached age 18. Of those 18- to 23-year-olds who identify as LGBT, 72% of them classified themselves as bisexual.

""Thus, 11.5% of all Gen Z adults in the U.S. say they are bisexual, with about 2% each identifying as gay, lesbian or transgender,"" Gallup stated.

Additionally, the percentage is poised to grow, since many individuals from Generation Z have not yet reached adulthood and thus were not surveyed.

Generally, the survey found that individuals from younger generations were ""far more likely"" to consider themselves to be something other than heterosexual than were those from older generations. However, that's not surprising considering the cultural shift American society has undergone in recent decades toward a more liberal view of gender and sexuality and a more open stance toward sexual experimentation.

What is notable, perhaps, is the rapidity with which LGBT identification has increased among Generation Z adults in comparison to those from America's second youngest adult generation — Millennials — who were born between 1981 and 1996. The survey found that LGBT identification among Generation Z adults was nearly double the LGBT identification among Millennials, of whom 9% identified as LGBT.

Under 4% of adults in Generation X, or those born between 1965 and 1980, identified as LGBT in the survey. That percentage dropped even lower for previous generations.

Overall, the percentage of of U.S. adults identifying as LGBT jumped to 5.6%, up from Gallup's previous estimate of 4.5% in 2017.

Gallup noted that the ""pronounced generational differences"" in LGBT identification ""raise questions about whether higher LGBT identification in younger than older Americans reflects a true shift in sexual orientation, or if it merely reflects a greater willingness of younger people to identify as LGBT.""

Indeed, major changes in society's stance on gender and sexuality have occurred in recent history, perhaps the most prominent among them being the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 2015 which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. In the years since then, an increasing number of Americans have begun to question traditional gender and sexuality, and societal institutions have increasingly affirmed such a person's ability to choose their gender or sexual orientation.

Undoubtedly, these changes have had a pronounced effect on America's youngest generation of adults.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/1-in-6-gen-z-lgbt,2021-02-25
Family claims 15-year-old was expelled from Christian school over LGBT birthday cake — school says there's more to the story,"The family of a 15-year-old says she was expelled from a private Christian school in Louisville, Kentucky, over a Facebook post from her birthday party, but the school claims the media is misrepresenting the story.

""I feel judged, she feels judged, very just devastating for us,"" said Kimberly Alford, the mother of Kayla Kenney.

The family says that she celebrated her fifteenth birthday with a rainbow colored cake while wearing a rainbow design on her shirt. They posted video of the celebration on Facebook and it was shared with staff of the Whitefield Academy.

That's when she was expelled from the school.

The family says the cause was the rainbow colored cake and the shirt, which are taken as symbols of support for the LGBT political cause, but the school says that was the tip of the iceberg.

While they did cite the rainbow cake and shirt as being contrary to the values of the school, they added that Kenney had violated their code numerous times previous to her birthday, and that they had spoken to the family about the issue.

The family claims they did not intend the cake to be about sexual orientation.

""I do not think Kayla should be held accountable for a cake that I purchased with no intention of promoting a posture of morality and cultural acceptance that contradicts that of Whitefield Academy,"" Alford said.

""The only celebration that was taking place was my daughter's 15th birthday,"" she added.

"2 conservative Supreme Court justices bash attempt to force religious groups to hire LGBT employees, warn they could be 'extinguished' from public life","Two conservative justices on the Supreme Court this week voiced their support for the hiring rights of religious organizations, arguing that such organizations should not be compelled to employ individuals who do not share their religious views.

""To force religious organizations to hire messengers and other personnel who do not share their religious views would undermine not only the autonomy of many religious organizations but also their continued viability,"" Justice Sam Alito argued in a statement he and Justice Clarence Thomas issued Monday.

The comments from Alito and Thomas came as the court declined to take up a dispute involving the Seattle Union Gospel Mission, a Christian nonprofit that was sued after refusing to hire an LGBT applicant to serve in its legal aid clinic.

In an original ruling on the matter, King County Superior Court Judge Karen Donohue dismissed the suit filed against the mission by bisexual attorney Matt Woods, claiming the nonprofit was within its rights to refuse to hire Woods since, as a religious group, it was exempt from the state's anti-discrimination law regarding sexual orientation.

But last year, the Washington Supreme Court reversed the ruling and sent the case back down to the lower court, specifically to review whether the nonprofit's religious exemption applies to all positions of employment.

TheBlaze reported at the time that the ruling could open the door to forcing religious organizations to hire LGBT individuals and other employees who do not share their beliefs. In their Monday statement, Alito and Thomas seemed to agree that such a ruling would not only ""undermine"" the autonomy of religious organizations but could also lead to their extinction.

""If states could compel religious organizations to hire employees who fundamentally disagree with them, many religious non-profits would be extinguished from participation in public life — perhaps by those who disagree with their theological views most vigorously,"" the justices warned.

That, they said, would not only infringe on the groups' rights to freely exercise religion but would ""greatly impoverish our nation’s civic and religious life.""

Though the justices agreed that the case had not yet reached a ripe enough stage for the high court to grant a review, they foreshadowed a future ruling in the dispute.

""Because of the interlocutory posture of this case, [we] concur in the denial of certiorari at this time,"" Alito wrote. ""But the day may soon come when we must decide whether the autonomy guaranteed by the First Amendment protects religious organizations’ freedom to hire co-religionists without state or judicial interference.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2-conservative-supreme-court-justices-bash-attempt-to-force-religious-groups-to-hire-lgbt-employees-warn-they-could-be-extinguished-from-public-life,2022-03-22
2020 Dems call for repeal of laws requiring disclosure of HIV-positive status to sex partners,"Several Democratic presidential candidates called for the repeal of laws that require HIV-positive individuals to disclose their status to sexual partners during last week's CNN town hall on LGBTQ issues, according to the Washington Examiner.

These HIV disclosure laws exist to make it illegal for someone to expose another person to the virus without them knowing about it and having an opportunity to give informed sexual consent with knowledge of the risk.

Candidates such as Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as host Anderson Cooper, opposed the laws.

Cooper presented the issue to Buttigieg by pointing to drugs that exist now which make the virus ""undetectable""—meaning, it can't be transmitted to someone else. That treatment advancement, Cooper argued, means laws criminalizing HIV nondisclosure are ""antiquated"" and ""based on old science.""

""It's not fair, and it needs to change,"" Buttigieg said of the laws.

Buttigieg didn't go into much detail about the implications of repealing these laws, however. It's one thing to say that someone who can't transmit the virus should not be subject to prison for not disclosing it, although even that is not as black-and-white as he makes it seem.



But, if you take those laws off the books and make it legal for someone with HIV to withhold the fact that they have the virus to a sexual partner, you're applying that both to people with who have ""undetectable"" status and those who can transmit the potentially life-threatening virus. Is it wise to trust that everyone with HIV will do the right thing in these scenarios?

This one shouldn't be extremely complicated. Are these candidates saying they would be perfectly fine with a sexual partner concealing HIV-positive status from them? Wouldn't they feel entitled to this information so they can give truly ""informed consent?"" That's a question that, even if candidates refuse to answer, voters will have to.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/2020-dems-call-for-repeal-of-laws-requiring-disclosure-of-hiv-positive-status-to-sex-partners,2019-10-13
A 9-year-old was found dead and stuffed into a duffel bag in Oregon. Police arrested her mother and her mother's girlfriend a year later.,"Oregon police worked for almost a year to solve the murder of a 9-year-old who was found stuffed into a duffel bag and left near a rest stop on the Oregon coast. They arrested the girl's mother and the mother's girlfriend on Tuesday.

The remains were discovered in Lincoln County in Dec. 2020. Investigators estimated that she had died between 30 and 60 days before her remains were found.

""It was very difficult to identify who the child was,"" said Captain Stephanie Bigman to KGW-TV. She said that more than 150 tips did not help the investigation, and they were afraid it would turn into a cold case with no suspects.

Then, through the use of DNA evidence and genealogy databases, police were able to identify the girl as Haley Mae Coblentz in October.



""As a law enforcement officer, you're horrified, and really just want to do everything you can to find those who are responsible for this,"" said Bigman.

Police were able to locate the girl's biological mother with the help of the FBI. On Tuesday, law enforcement officials arrested Shawna Browning (29) and her girlfriend Lauren Harrison (34) at a traffic stop in Detroit, Michigan.

Police say that Haley had been born in Colorado but had been travelling with Browning and Harrison in the Pacific Northwest since 2015.

Investigators say that the girl had never been reported missing by her mother or the mother's girlfriend.

The couple are being held without bail in Wayne County awaiting extradition to Oregon. Both are charged with aggravated murder.

A church in Florida held an LGBTQ+ conference for children 12 to 18,"A church in Naples, Florida hosted an LGBTQ+ conference for children and young adults aged 12 to 18.

The event was held at the Naples United Church of Christ and was put on by the Collier County chapter of GLSEN. GLSEN is a national nonprofit organization that, according to its website, “was founded by a group of teachers in 1990” so that educators could “play key roles in creating affirming learning environments for LGBTQ youth.”

The organization focuses on “activating supportive educators” and conducts “extensive and original research to inform our evidence-based solutions for K-12 education.” According to its website, the group will “advise on, advocate for, and research comprehensive policies designed to protect LGBTQ students as well as students of marginalized identities.”

The conference’s Eventbrite page proclaimed that the event was a “one-day conference” that “will provide students with the opportunity to engage in LGBTQ-related issues facing them today while empowering them to be confident in all their identities.”

The church’s conference held a series of seminars featuring topics like “Forbidden Queer Literature,” “Political Action & Advocacy,” and “Inclusive Sex Education.”

GLSEN also hosted a “drag show from some of our local drag queens” and a panel discussion “with former high school students talking about life in the LGBTQ community after high school.”

The Post Millennial reported that there was some local concern about the event, especially since it appeared that many children attending the conference would be bused in directly from school without their parent’s knowledge.

According to a spokesperson for the local school district, Collier County Public Schools (CCPS), the school’s facilities may not be used as “transit points for the pickup and drop-off of students for this event.”

Florida’s Voice reported that the conference’s young attendees were asked to enter their pronouns and provide other personal information prior to registering for the event.

The spokesperson said, “The District was never informed nor contacted about this event. CCPS is not a sponsor of the event, which is being held at a private facility. CCPS also neither authorized nor approved the transportation of CCPS students to and from district school sites by the event organizers. Any inference to the contrary is fully rejected by CCPS.”

The spokesperson continued, “To this end, CCPS has spoken with the event organizer and explained that the information on the registration form, and any associated flyer must be immediately corrected to reflect that CCPS is not a co-sponsor nor will it allow its school sites to be used as transit points for the pickup and drop-off of students for this event.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-church-in-naples-florida-held-an-lgbtq-conference-for-children-12-to-18,2022-05-22
A Kansas public school teacher is suing school officials for requiring her to address students by their preferred names and pronouns,"A public school teacher in Kansas is suing the principal of her school, the district’s superintendent, and members of the school board after being suspended for not using a student’s preferred name.

Pamela Ricard taught math at Fort Riley Middle School. She says that she refused to use the preferred names and pronouns of transgender and nonbinary students because it violates her religious beliefs, CNN reported.

After being disciplined multiple times for refusing to refer to students by their preferred names, Ms. Ricard filed a lawsuit against the Geary County Schools Unified School District.

In the lawsuit, Ms. Ricard argues that school administrators preventing her from ignoring students’ preferred names and pronouns “deprived her of due process and equal protection of law” and violated her First Amendment rights to free speech and exercise of religion.

Her lawsuit maintains that her decision to ignore students’ preferred names and pronouns does not harm her students, but several LGBTQ-sympathetic organizations throughout the country disagree with this.

Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, the executive director of GLSEN, a national organization that emphasizes the LGBTQ+ agenda throughout the country’s K-12 schools, says that misgendering a child can have a serious impact on his or her confidence and mental health.

According to Ms. Ricard’s lawsuit, after the first time she ignored a student’s preferred name, the principal sent an email addressing all of the school’s teachers that said, “When we have a student that requests to go by a preferred name that is different than their given name, our district honors the request. Once you are aware of a preferred name, use that name for the student.”

Ms. Ricard also received several reminders to use a student’s preferred name and pronouns after referring to a biologically female student as “Miss [student’s last name].”

In April of 2021, Ms. Ricard was suspended for three days with pay. Her suspension alleged that she violated 11 district polices, including rules on bullying and diversity and inclusion.

She appealed the suspension several times to no avail.

“Ms. Ricard’s faith teaches her that God immutable creates each person as male or female,” her lawsuit states.

“Any policy that requires Ms. Ricard to refer to a student by a gendered, non-binary, or plural pronoun (e.g. he/him, she/her, they/them, zhe/zher, etc.) or salutation (Mr., Miss, Ms.) or other gendered language that is different from the student’s biological sex actively violates Ms. Ricard’s religious beliefs,” the lawsuit stated.

Despite the pending litigation, Ms. Ricard said that she enjoys her job.

She said, “I continue to enjoy teaching my students day in and day out, but the stigma of being officially labeled a ‘bully’ for simply using a student’s enrolled last name has been disheartening. I love all of my students, but I shouldn’t be forced to contradict my core beliefs in order to teach math in a public school.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-kansas-public-school-teacher-is-suing-school-officials-for-requiring-her-to-address-students-by-their-prefered-names-and-pronouns,2022-03-13
Abbott directs Texas agencies to investigate 'sex-change' procedures for trans youths as ‘child abuse’,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state agencies to investigate reports of gender-dysphoric children undergoing ""sex change"" procedures as child abuse, in accordance with an opinion released by the state attorney general's office earlier this week.

In a letter to the Department of Family and Protective Services sent Tuesday, Abbott noted the agency is ""responsible for protecting children from abuse."" The governor said that under Texas law, ""doctors, nurses, and teachers"" are required to report instances of alleged abuse and that there are ""criminal penalties"" for licensed professionals who fail to do so.

“Texas law imposes reporting requirements upon all licensed professionals who have direct contact with children who may be subject to such abuse, including doctors, nurses, and teachers, and provides criminal penalties for failure to report such child abuse,” Abbott said.

His letter was copied to several other state agencies, including the Health and Human Services Commission, Texas Medical Board, and Texas Education Agency.

The Dallas News first reported Abbott's letter, which was sent one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released an opinion that determined certain medical and chemical procedures recommended for transgender people constitute illegal abuse when performed on children. The attorney general's opinion is not legally binding, but former officials told the Dallas News there is a general expectation that agency directors will follow them.



The specific ""sex-change procedures"" identified in Paxton's opinion include castration, surgery to remove male genitals, surgeries to remove the female reproductive system, plastic surgeries to construct artificial genitals, so-called ""top surgery"" to remove female breasts, or any procedure that removes a ""healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue"" from children when not medically necessary.

Paxton also said that providing cross-sex hormones to children including puberty blockers, unnatural doses of testosterone for females, and unnatural doses of estrogen for males potentially constitutes child abuse.

These determinations are qualified with the acknowledgement that in rare circumstances some of these procedures are medically necessary for children with a ""medically verifiable genetic disorder of sex development"" or who ""do not have the normal sex chromosome structure for male or female"" as determined by medical testing.

""This opinion does not address or apply to medically necessary procedures,"" Paxton said.



The effect of Abbott's order is yet to be determined. It has drawn immediate opposition from transgender advocates, and some progressive prosecutors have said they will not follow the attorney general's interpretation of the law.

“My office will not participate in these bad faith political games,” said Harris County Attorney Christian D. Menefee in a statement Tuesday. ""As the lawyers handling these cases, we owe a duty of candor to the courts about what the law really says. We’ll continue to follow the laws on the books — not General Paxton’s politically motivated and legally incorrect ‘opinion.’”

The Travis District and County Attorneys also told the Dallas News they will not prosecute child abuse cases when gender dysphoric children are given so-called ""gender-affirming"" treatment.

“The Republican leadership of this state is trying to turn loving and supportive parents into criminals, and this office will play no part in it,” said County Attorney Delia Garza.

The office of District Attorney Jose Garza said they will likewise decline to prosecute cases based on Paxton's guidance.

State agencies have mostly remained silent since the governor sent his letter.

“We will follow Texas law as explained [by Paxton’s opinion],” said DFPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins in a statement to the Dallas News. ""At this time, there are no pending investigations of child abuse involving the procedures described in that opinion.”

The guidance from Paxton and Abbott contradicts the medical advice from national medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics, which believe the best way to care for transgender children is to affirm their self-proclaimed gender identity.

The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a group that recommends the standards of care for people experiencing gender dysphoria, says that sex-change surgeries are not recommended until a patient has reached the legal age of maturity and has lived continuously for at least a year in the gender role they identify with.

The group's standards recommend that cross-sex hormones should only be given to youth after the onset of puberty and after mental health evaluation. Children who have not reached puberty are recommended to seek mental health care to treat gender dysphoria, but care that attempts to help gender dysphoric children accept and identify with their biological sex has been likened to ""conversion therapy"" and is opposed by medical groups.

There are serious risks to cross-sex hormone therapies, which include decreased sexual function, increased health risks, sterility, and more.



WPATH blasted the governor's action in a statement.

“Targeting trans youth, their parents, and their health care providers for political gain is unconscionable. We strongly denounce this alarmist and misguided opinion which could obstruct access to medically necessary care,” WPATH told the Dallas News.

The LGBT advocacy group Equality Texas characterized what Abbott and Paxton have done as ""campaign stunts"" meant to fend off primary challengers from the right in the upcoming election on Tuesday.

“We urge all Texans to be skeptical about campaign stunts disguised as legal opinions from a corrupt politician who has no expertise in healthcare and who has built their career spreading disinformation about marginalized communities,” said Equality Texas CEO Ricardo Martinez in a statement.

On the other side, social conservative groups applauded Paxton's opinion.

""Children cannot consent to taking drugs and undergoing surgeries that can permanently sterilize them and radically alter the course of their lives. And any person who assists or encourages minors in pursuing these ends is committing child abuse, period,"" said Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project.

""APP strongly commends AG Paxton for courageously standing up for Texas’ children in the face of these attacks. And we urge other state attorneys general to follow his lead to protect the innocence of our nation’s kids from the woke ideologues and Big Pharma executives eager to exploit them,” he added.

Grieving mother claims LA County school pushed transgender treatments on her teenage daughter who ultimately committed suicide: 'Why did they play with her life?',"A California mother is speaking out against the government of Los Angeles County, which she claims encouraged her daughter to identify as a male, sign up for transgender treatments, and be put in foster care instead of her mom's house. The grieving mother asserts that her daughter's L.A. County school didn't properly treat her depression, which ultimately may have contributed her to committing suicide.

Abigail Martinez immigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador at age 18. Martinez, now 53, had four children, including Yaeli Martinez. Of her three daughters, Yaeli was ""the girlie girl in the house,"" who loved dressing up as a princess and talking about the boys she liked at pre-school, Martinez said.

However, Yaeli was bullied in middle school over her looks. By the eighth grade, she began showing signs of depression, according to her mother. Around the age of 15 or 16, Yaeli started questioning her sexuality.

Earlier this month, Martinez participated in a Heritage Foundation event titled: ""Protecting Our Children: How Radical Gender Ideology is Taking Over Public Schools & Harming Kids.""

Martinez painfully recounted her daughter's situation, ""When she started high school, the doors opened to what she was talking about, like transgender, going to meetings, going to all the support that they think they have for these children ... which is not.""

""The school counselor was involved, DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) was involved, LGBT was in there too, trying to 'help' my daughter on the transition of being transgender,"" Martinez explained. ""I was accused that I didn't want to open my eyes since she felt since she was a little girl that she was a boy which was not true. She was not even close to a tomboy ... she was the girlie girl in the house.""

Martinez asserts that instead of proper treatment for mental illness, her daughter was encouraged to receive hormone treatments and gender reassignment surgery by school staff and an LGBTQ support group.

She remarked, ""I knew that the hormones wouldn't work.""

The Daily Mail reported, ""Yaeli was allegedly told by her trans peers that the only way she could get it paid for by the state was if she was in foster care. Martinez claims Yaeli's trans friend 'coached' her to tell social workers she was abused so the state would pay for her gender reassignment.""

Yaeli ran away from home in July 2016 and then told the Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) that her mother slapped her in the face.

Martinez emphatically denied the accusations, ""I never was abusive to my children. I love my children. I never slapped her. But she was coached by this family what to tell the authorities so they cannot send her back home with me.""

A Los Angeles family court judge ruled Yaeli would be placed in foster care, and the mother would only be allowed to have brief and monitored visits. Despite the ruling, Martinez was still able to keep custody of her three other children and could continue to work as a nanny.

Martinez shared text messages sent to her by her with the Daily Mail.

""I can be difficult sometimes but I really love you Mama,"" Yaeli wrote to her mother in a text message. ""I love you lots,"" another message said.

""I love you and remember you are strong. I’m so proud of you for everything you've done. … I’m really happy to have you as my mom. You mean the world to me. … You're the best mom anyone could ask for. You constantly sacrifice yourself for others,"" Yaeli told her mother.

""The school psychology and LGBT told DCFS that my daughter would be better off out of the house,"" Martinez said. ""They took away my daughter when she was 16-years-old. I tried my best to get her back... going to court every single month.""

""On the visit days, when she came to my house, I was told not to talk about God,"" the bereaved mother stated. ""They told me if you do that, you'll never see your daughter.""

""But I brought meals to share with her on Saturdays, and we prayed before eating,"" Martinez noted. ""She would close her eyes and bow her head.""

By this time, Yaeli Martinez transitioned to a male and changed her name to ""Andrew Martinez.""

""I didn't like the idea [of transitioning]. But I just wanted her to find out what was leading her to go that way,"" Martinez told the outlet.



""I explained to the social workers it's not going to work,"" she advised. ""My daughter needs mental health help. You have to go from the inside out. If she's happy with herself that's all we need. Focus on that.""

Martinez revealed that her 19-year-old daughter committed suicide on Sept. 4, 2019.

""I didn't feel good, I felt a pain in my chest the whole day,"" Martinez said. ""I wanted to run and cry, it was a weird feeling I'd never felt before. I got a phone call, they said it was Pomona Police.""



""Around 9:30 p.m. that night, she walked in front of the train tracks facing a train,"" Martinez expressed. ""She went on her knees, raised her arms up and just laid on the tracks.""

The mourning mom painfully details her daughter's tragic death, ""I couldn't see her for the last time. I was told if I wanted to see her I needed to sign a form because there was not much to see.""

""She was taken away from my house because they wanted to save her life,"" the grieving mother said. ""My question to all of them is where is my daughter now? Why did they play with her life?""

Martinez declared with tears rolling down her face, ""I want everyone to know the truth because it didn't have to happen. I don't want this to happen to any other family or to go through all this pain. There's a lot of pain.""

In 2020, Martinez filed a civil lawsuit against Los Angeles County and its Department of Child and Family Services.

The Los Angeles DCFS acknowledged that it had ""aggressively pursued the implementation of inclusive, gender-affirming laws, policies, and supportive services for LGBTQ+ youth."" The agency noted that LGBTQ children ""face significant disparities in physical and mental health outcomes, including higher rates of suicide.""

The Arcadia School District has denied encouraging hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery on any students.

""We share in the sorrow and grief of the Martinez family and continue to offer our sincerest condolences,"" Ryan Foran – spokesperson for a spokesman for the Arcadia School District – told the Daily Mail.

""Furthermore, a claim suggesting our school or a staff member did not properly treat a student's severe depression is both completely inaccurate and troubling as our schools and staff would not be authorized or medically qualified to treat clinical depression,"" Foran continued. ""However, our staff works tirelessly to provide and suggest resources, when appropriate, to help connect students and families with licensed mental health professionals to treat conditions such as clinical depression.""



""We have a very caring staff that is dedicated to providing a safe, nondiscriminatory school environment for all students,"" he added. ""We also continually provide resources to promote the healthy mental, emotional, and social well-being of all students.""

"Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield rejects strict representation in acting roles, says it kills 'empathic imagination'","Actor Andrew Garfield rejected the idea that people should only portray people of their own demographics and explained that it kills ""empathic"" imagination.""

Garfield made the comments in an interview with The Telegraph when he was questioned about controversy over his portrayal of a gay character when he is straight.

""I think it's two different conversations getting conflated,"" Garfield replied.

""One is about equality of opportunity, and I'm completely in on that. Because we should want a world in which no matter your sexual orientation, your color or your heritage, everyone gets a fair whack,"" he explained.

""But the other is about empathic imagination, and if we only allow people to be cast as exactly who they are, it'll be the death of it,"" Garfield continued. ""So, the two separate conversations have to happen simultaneously. Because I'm not willing to support the death of empathic imagination. It's what we need most as a culture, and it's beautiful. It's the only thing that's going to save us right now.""

Garfield had previously addressed the controversy in 2017 by claiming that he was a gay man ""just without the physical act."" Many on the left were outraged at his comment and lashed out angrily on social media.

Among the actors who were criticized for casting outside of their demographic is Scarlett Johansson who was forced to drop a role portraying a transgender person in 2018. She was initially defiant against the uproar from the left but later apologized.

Still later, she lashed out at critics and said that it was not her job to play politics in her acting roles.

""Your job is to reflect our experience to ourselves; your job is to be a mirror for an audience, to be able to have an empathetic experience through art. That is what your job is,"" Johansson explained. ""The other stuff is not my job.""

Garfield is best known for his portrayal of Peter Parker in the wildly successful Spider-Man superhero franchise.

Actress Debra Messing doubles down on wishing violence on Trump following backlash,"Actress Debra Messing attempted to do some damage control on Monday after facing backlash for a social media post wishing violence on President Donald Trump. But the far-left thespian simply clarified that her ill-will was not homophobic, before doubling down on praying for the commander in chief to be imprisoned and raped.

What are the details?

Last week, Messing tweeted a message directed to the president that read, ""@realDonaldTrump you are a weak, scared, stupid, inept, negligent, vindictive, narcissistic, criminal. I hope you live a long life in prison where you become the most popular boyfriend to the all inmates.""

The Daily Wire reported on her post, noting that the ""proud and open LGBT activist"" delivered what the outlet referred to as a ""homophobic insult.""

In reaction to the story, Messing attempted to clear up any confusion about what she meant, tweeting, ""Let me be clear: I said nothing about LGBTQI/queer LOVE. Rape is an act of violence. Trump has perpetrated violence on hundreds of millions of people. My hope is (and this is the first time in my life) that the tables are turned and he is the victim of perpetrators.""

The actress added the hashtag, #LGBTQIAAlly.""

What happened next?

The post earned Messing more headlines and more negative feedback online.

The Washington Examiner's Jerry Dunleavy tweeted, ""Debra Messing's clarification here is her saying she has nothing against gay men — she just hopes Trump gets raped in prison.""

The Hill described Messing as ""one of Hollywood's most vocal Trump critics,"" and pointed out that in 2019, ""Trump said that NBC should fire her after its star said the names of the commander in chief's donors who attended a fundraiser should be publicly identified.""

Messing was a star in ""Will & Grace,"" an award-winning sitcom that debuted in 1998 and was considered groundbreaking for featuring a gay character in a leading role. The show ran for eight seasons and was reupped in 2017. Its second stretch ended earlier this year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/actress-debra-messing-doubles-down-on-wishing-violence-on-trump-following-backlash,2020-12-14
Adults throw dollars at 11-year-old drag kid who performed at gay nightclub,"An 11-year-old boy dressed in drag performed on stage at a gay nightclub in Brooklyn, New York, earlier this month. Desmond Napoles donned a blonde wig, high heels, a girl's crop top, and full make-up while he danced provocatively to No Doubt's ""Just a Girl"" anthem at the 3 Dollar Bill club, the Daily Wire reported.

Adults in the audience threw dollar bills at the child drag queen known as ""Desmond is Amazing.""

TheBlaze has confirmed the performance, which was shared on various social media platforms.

The club promoted the event through Eventbrite.

""Only in New York... a nightclub that makes you go WHOA!!!,"" the promotion read, according to the Daily Wire. ""FEATURING: Upcoming Legend from Television and the Runway: DESMOND IS AMAZING!!! PERFORMING LIVE! ... This stage, this dance floor, this house ... is ours as long as we protect it.""

Where are Desmond's parents?

Desmond's parents have not only supported their son's interest in dressing in drag, but they have also promoted his choices by allowing him to be featured in magazines and on websites, social media, and national television.

The boy started dressing in girls clothing at a young age, but when he wanted to wear dresses outside the home the parents consulted a therapist who advised them to ""allow Desmond to develop naturally,"" according to information on the Desmond is Amazing website.

Therefore, rather than ostracize, punish, or shame him, force him to play with certain toys, or restrict him to boys only costumes and clothing while playing dress up, Desmond's parents allowed him to inherently progress, explore, and choose his tastes in clothing, toys, and activities on his own. He had developed his gender identity as non-conforming, or gender fluid, as a young child. He is not, nor has the desire to become, transgender. From early on, he has said that he is a boy who enjoys dressing up as a girl.

The young boy, who says he's openly gay, was recently a guest on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

""Desmond is already a notable LGBTQ activist and advocate,"" according to his website.

Four years ago, he danced in Jinkx Monsoon's music video called ""The Bacon Shake."" Monsoon was the winner of the fifth season of ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""

RuPaul has reportedly called Desmond the ""the future of America,"" according to CNBC.

Desmond gave a speech the NYC Pride Rally last year.

What else?

Desmond is the founder of the Haus of Amazing, a drag house for kids.

He's also developing a magazine for LGBT youth that he plans to call The Amaziest, and he hopes to launch a cosmetic line for drag kids, according to his website.

Agenda PAC will target foes of the LGBT agenda,"In a bid to promote the LGBT movement, the aptly named Agenda PAC will seek to target political foes of the LGBT agenda while supporting the left-wing cause's political allies.

The group plans to target GOP Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano first, according to Politico and NBC News. Mastriano, who is currently a member of the Keystone State senate, is running against the Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro, a Democrat.

In addition to Mastriano, Agenda PAC's website lists Republican Reps. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Ken Calvert of California, and Yvette Herrell of New Mexico as ""2022 Action Targets,"" though the site misspelled Herrell's name as ""Harrell.""

""Agenda PAC will run aggressive, accountability-driven independent expenditure campaigns against anti-LGBTQ+ politicians in winnable races at the federal, state and local levels, as well as defend LGBTQ+ allies in races where our support can turn the tide,"" the website states. ""A long-term goal of Agenda PAC is to act as a deterrent for anti-LGBTQ+ lawmakers – giving them a reason to think twice before pushing their anti-LGBTQ+ agendas.""



Politico reported that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis represents a target for Agenda PAC in the long run, but that the outfit is not expected to spend cash on Florida's 2022 gubernatorial election contest. DeSantis, who is currently running for re-election in the Sunshine State, has not announced any plans for a presidential bid, but many political watchers consider him to be a potential future GOP presidential contender.



""It's not a shock to anybody that DeSantis is thinking about running for president and we're prepared to crap on him the whole way,"" Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who is Agenda PAC's board chair, said, according to Politico — Kenyatta is a Democrat

He told the outlet that counting pledges, Agenda PAC had raised ""six figures"" and that it has plans to shell out ""seven figures"" amid the midterm election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/agenda-pac-promote-lgbt-agenda,2022-09-02
Air Force recognizes Transgender Day of Visibility,"The U.S. Air Force, which claims that its mission statement is ""To fly, fight, and win…airpower anytime, anywhere,"" faced blowback Thursday on Twitter for peddling radical leftist gender ideology by recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility.

""Today is #TransDayofVisiblity,"" the Air Force tweeted, inviting people to watch a video of Under Secretary of the Air Force Gina Ortiz Jones interviewing Lt. Col. Bree Fram, a member of the Space Force — the tweet calls Fram the ""highest-ranking openly transgender"" Department of Defense officer.

The tweet comes as Russia, a nuclear-armed power, is invading Ukraine. It also comes as the U.S. faces the ongoing threat posed by an ever-ambitious communist China that continually seeks to expand its power on the world stage.

Responding to the Air Force's post, Blaze Media's Jessica O'Donnell questioned, ""how does this help us with war and stuff.""



""The enemies of America are laughing at us,"" Todd Starnes tweeted.

""We are going to lose a major war,"" Benny Johnson declared.



""When do we need to learn Chinese?"" someone else tweeted.

""Im just going to state the obvious here. It defies common sense for the USAF to promote such utter nonsense,"" another person noted.

The tweet links to a post that declares, ""The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning Initiatives Team (LIT) of the Department of the Air Force Barrier Analysis Working Group (DAFBAWG) highlighted and observed Transgender Day of Visibility (TDoV) on March 31.""

""Today is a day to step back and reflect on the obstacles the trans community has overcome, recognize the work left to do, while celebrating all transgender and non-binary DAF personnel who are serving and thriving as their authentic selves,"" LIT Transgender Policies co-lead Master Sgt.

"Alabama legislature approves bills to protect kids from radical leftist gender ideology, including measure that makes it a felony to provide gender reassignment surgery or meds to people under 19","The Alabama state legislature has passed a bill that would make it a felony to prescribe or administer puberty blockers or gender transition hormones to individuals younger than 19 — it would also make it a felony to conduct gender reassignment surgeries on individuals in that age range.

The bill also states that teachers and others at public and private schools may not hold back information from a parent related to a child's feelings that their gender identity does not align with their biological sex.

While many Americans would support this type of legislation as a common sense way of protecting children, not everyone shares that view.

The Associated Press reported that Democratic state Rep. Neil Rafferty, who is gay, seemed to struggle to restrain his anger and keep his composure as legislators headed to the vote.

""This is wrong,"" Rafferty said, according to the AP. ""Y'all sit there and campaign on family being the foundation of our nation ... but what this bill is doing is totally undermining that. It’s totally undermining family rights, health rights and access to health care.""

The state legislature has also approved another piece of legislation that would mandate that pubic K-12 schools require people to utilize multiple occupancy bathrooms that align with their biological sex. The measure would also prohibit teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through fifth grade.

The pieces of legislation now head to Republican Gov. Kay Ivey.

Liberals around the country have recently been in an uproar over a Florida law that includes a provision that prohibits teaching students about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

Florida state Rep. Randy Fine (R) has said that in the next session he plans to push legislation to outlaw the provision of gender reassignment surgery and drugs to minors.



""I've had enough of this nonsense. Next session, I will help shepherd legislation to make it illegal to provide drugs or surgery to a minor for the purpose of alleged 'gender assignment.' The legislation will make it felony child abuse punishable by prison and loss of medical license,"" Fine noted on social media.

""If an adult wants to self-mutilate their body in pursuit of the fiction that they can defy both G-d and science, more power to them -- so long as they don't expect me to pay for it. But no child should be put in the position of making fundamentally life-altering decisions before they are of the age of majority,"" Fine declared.

Alaska Airlines employees sue after allegedly being fired for voicing opposition to the LGBT 'Equality Act' on an internal message board they were invited to comment on,"A pair of former Alaska Airlines flight attendants have sued their employer, claiming they were fired for voicing opposition to the company's embrace of the LGBT ""Equality Act"" on an internal message board.

Marli Brown and Lacey Smith argued in a federal lawsuit filed this week that they were the targets of religious discrimination when they were terminated from their jobs in August 2021 solely on the basis of their religious beliefs.

In early 2021, as Congress was debating the passage of the controversial Equality Act, Alaska Airlines announced its support for the measure on an employee message board and asked employees to comment.

The Equality Act, if passed, would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination or segregation — which currently include race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.

According to their law firm, First Liberty Institute, both Brown and Smith felt ""compelled by their Christian faith"" to weigh in.

Smith asked: ""As a company, do you think it’s possible to regulate morality?""

Brown added a lengthier statement seeking further explanation from Alaska Airlines about its support of the measure:

Does Alaska [Airlines] support: endangering the Church, encouraging suppression of religious freedom, obliterating [women’s] rights and parental rights? This act will [force] every American to agree with controversial government-imposed ideology … or be treated as an outlaw.



The Equality Act demolishes existing civil rights and constitutional freedoms, which threatens constitutional freedoms by eliminating conscience protections from the Civil Rights Act.



The Equality Act would affect everything from girls’ and women’s showers and locker rooms to women’s shelters and women’s prisons, endangering safety and diminishing privacy.



Giving people blanket permission to enter private spaces for the opposite sex enables sexual predators to exploit the rules and gain easy access to victims. This is Equality Act …

The remainder of her question was cut off due to character limitations.

Both Brown and Smith's comments were later removed for being ""discriminatory,"" ""hateful,"" and ""offensive."" The company then launched an investigation into the employees, which eventually resulted in their termination.

According to court documents, Alaska Airlines told the flight attendants: ""Defining gender identity or sexual orientation as a moral issue, or questioning the Company’s support for the rights of all people regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation, is not a philosophical question, but a discriminatory statement. Your posting was offensive, discriminatory, and did not align with Alaska Airline’s values.""

Following their termination, the two reported charges to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and have since been granted ""right-to-sue"" letters by the department.



In the lawsuit, the women also claim that the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) did little to defend them despite its stated duties to help members being discriminated against on the basis of religion.

""Alaska Airlines 'canceled' Lacey and Marli because of their religious beliefs, flagrantly disregarding federal civil rights laws that protect people of faith from discrimination,"" said Stephanie Taub, Senior Counsel for First Liberty Institute, in a press release.

She added: ""It is a blatant violation of state and federal civil rights laws to discriminate against someone in the workplace because of their religious beliefs and expression. 'Woke' corporations like Alaska Airlines think that they do not have to follow the law and can fire employees if they simply don't like their religious beliefs.""

Several American embassies defy orders from Trump administration to honor 'Pride Month',"After the Trump administration formally denied requests from multiple United States embassies to hoist the LGBT flag in honor of ""Pride Month,"" several U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions are defying their orders.

The Washington Post reported that several U.S. diplomatic outposts are finding ways to defy, or at least show opposition to, orders handed down from Washington.

From the Post:

The facades of the U.S. missions in Seoul and Chennai, India, are partially hidden behind large rainbow flags, while the embassy in New Delhi is aglow in rainbow colored lights. The website for the embassy in Santiago, Chile, shows a video of the chief diplomat raising a rainbow flag last month for the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.



The Vienna embassy's website features a photo of a rainbow flag flying below Old Glory on a mast jutting from the building, a statement by Diplomats for Equality and a story about a professor lecturing on the visibility and growth of LGBT rights.

""This is a category one insurrection,"" one anonymous diplomat told The Post.

Image source: Screenshot

Several embassies — including in Israel, Germany, Brazil, Latvia, among others — requested permission to honor ""Pride Month"" by flying rainbow flags. The requests, however, were denied.



American embassies have had official guidelines for honoring LGBT ""Pride"" events since 2011, when the Obama administration directed U.S. agencies involved in foreign policy to begin promoting LGBT rights. But the official State Department policy was changed last year by Mike Pompeo, a practicing Christian who became secretary of state last April.

Now, if an embassy or American diplomatic outpost wants to promote LGBT rights, such as by flying a rainbow flag, they must obtain permission from the State Department's Office of Management.

Despite the policy change, President Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to recognize ""Pride Month"" with an official statement.

"Superman is getting a new motto: 'Truth, Justice and a Better Tomorrow'","The iconic character Superman is getting a new motto, but while many may be familiar with the phrase ""truth, justice and the American way,"" the new motto, ""Truth, Justice and A Better Tomorrow,"" does not mention America.

""To better reflect the storylines that we are telling across DC and to honor Superman's incredible legacy of over 80 years of building a better world, Superman's motto is evolving,"" DC Chief Creative Officer and Publisher Jim Lee said. ""Superman has long been a symbol of hope who inspires people, and it is that optimism and hope that powers him forward with this new mission statement.""

A 2006 opinion piece by Erik Lundegaard says that according to Mark Waid, the familiar ""American way"" phrase first showed up on a radio program. That piece also said that the phrase was later used in a television program which aired during part of the 1950s.

""The new motto, which will be used in main continuity for Clark Kent's Superman, will be featured across all mediums including comic books, film, TV, video games and more. As comic book fans already know, the DC Multiverse has featured multiple Supermen over the years, sometimes even at the same time,"" according to DC Comics.

""In honor of the real-world superheroes who are striving to make this world a better place, the next generation of Superman characters like Jon Kent will be fighting for ""Truth, Justice and a Better World"", as first introduced in SUPERMAN: SON OF KAL-EL #1,"" the company said.



The announcement comes after the company recently revealed that Jon Kent, the son of Lois Lane and Clark Kent, will be bisexual. Actor Dean Cain, who more than two decades ago played the Man of Steel during a 1990s television series, described that announcement as ""bandwagoning.""

""After initially striking up a friendship with reporter Jay Nakamura, he and Jon become romantically involved in the pages of SUPERMAN: SON OF KAL-EL #5 from writer Tom Taylor (DARK KNIGHTS OF STEEL) and artist John Timms (HARLEY QUINN),"" DC Comics announced earlier this month.



The revelation regarding Jon Kent will occur in the Nov. 9 issue, according to Variety.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-way-is-being-dropped-from-superman-s-iconic-motto-replaced-by-the-new-motto-truth-justice-and-a-better-tomorrow,2021-10-19
Only all-male historically black college in US to admit biological females who identify as males,"America's only all-male historically black college — Morehouse College — will admit biological females who identify as males starting in the fall 2020, which the Associated Press said is a ""major shift"" for the Atlanta institution where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other famed figures attended.

But biological men who identify as women won't be allowed in, the policy states.

In addition, the policy ""affects students who transition while enrolled at Morehouse. Once admitted, students are expected to continue to self-identify as men throughout their matriculation at Morehouse. If a student transitions from a man to a woman, that student will no longer be eligible to matriculate at Morehouse.""

'Masculine pronouns'



The policy also said that the school ""will continue to use masculine pronouns, the language of brotherhood, and other gendered language that reflects its mission as an institution designed to develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership and service.""

What did Morehouse's president have to say?



""I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today's environment is important,"" Morehouse College President David Thomas told the AP. ""For 152 years, the world has, in some way, seen Morehouse as the West Point of black male development.""

Controversial filmmaker Spike Lee and former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson also are alumni of the school, the outlet said, adding that about two dozen historically black colleges have adopted transgender policies of some form.

What did an LGBT equality group have to say?

A spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign — the largest LBGT equality group in America — told the AP it's a step in the right direction.

""Young people are incredibly supportive of LGBT equality, including transgender equality,"" Sarah McBride told the outlet. ""Schools are responding in kind. In many ways, our college campuses look like the country we'll have in 10 or 15 years. There are a lot of reasons for hope.""

More from the AP:

Morehouse has had challenges around LGBT issues, most notably the 2002 attack of a 19-year-old student accused of beating a fellow student with a baseball bat who he mistakenly thought was making a sexual advance.



Gregory Love's skull was fractured in the beating. Aaron Price was found guilty of assault and initially sentenced to 10 years in prison.



The incident was widely seen as reflective of a larger and pervasive attitude toward the LGBT community among African Americans.



Thomas acknowledged that historically black colleges and universities — mainly established after the Civil War with the help of religious institutions like the Baptist and Methodist churches — face added challenges in addressing issues of gender and sexuality because of opposition in black churches.



""I can't speak for all HBCUs, but we know in the black church there has largely been silence on this issue,"" Thomas added to the outlet. ""I can imagine there may be people who would say, 'Why would you even raise this?' I say to those people we live in an era now where silence on these issues is actually not helpful. For us, as a school for men, it's important for us to set clear expectations about what that means. That's what we're trying to do with this policy.""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls Straight Pride Parade 'white supremacist parade' — but photos seem to tell a different story,"Far-left U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called a Straight Pride Parade held in Boston over the weekend a ""white supremacist parade"" and urged her Twitter followers to help bail out violent protesters of the parade.

""One way to support the local LGBTQ community impacted by Boston's white supremacist parade?"" she noted on Twitter. ""Contribute to the Bail Fund for the activists who put themselves on the line protecting the Boston community.""

Ocasio-Cortez also shared a link to the ""Solidarity Against Hate Legal Defense Fund,"" which said its now-completed campaign raised over $24,000 — 164 percent of its $15,000 goal.

How did folks react to AOC's 'white supremacist' accusation?

As you might expect, a number of Twitter users ripped Ocasio-Cortez for conflating the Straight Pride Parade with white supremacy — and Chad Felix Greene, senior contributor to the Federalist, offered some photographic evidence to douse her claim:

Greene's tweet included photos showing people of color marching in the Straight Pride Parade, which might lead one to view the event as a rather awkward white supremacist gathering.

What else?



Ocasio-Cortez's tweet piggybacked on a post from fellow Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who also asked her followers to contribute to the bail fund and called the Straight Pride Parade an ""LGBT hate march.""

In response, Michael Leary — president of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association — rebuked Pressley: ""Your actions in support of these individuals serves only to encourage criminal and disruptive behaviors such as those suffered by my members this weekend."" He added that his officers ""were screamed at, abused and fought by these so-called peaceful protestors.""

The Washington Examiner reported that 36 activists were arrested at the Boston parade, and nine of them were charged ""with assault and battery on a police officer. Other charges included resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and assault by means of a dangerous weapon.""

""Four officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries as they attempted to prevent the antifa-fueled crowd of about 1,000 counter-protesters from mixing it up with an estimated 200 parade participants,"" the Washington Times noted. ""It was unclear how many of those arrested were affiliated with antifa, but photos posted online showed a black-clad antifa activist being carried off by police. Antifa protesters attempting to block a road scuffled with officers, as shown on video.""

A judge on Tuesday upheld many of the charges against the arrested protesters:

AOC invokes her faith and Jesus Christ in screed saying religious freedom is used for 'discrimination' and 'bigotry' against LGBT people,"Any religious person whose faith does not align with ""progressive"" orthodoxy on matters like human sexuality, marriage, or basic human biology has probably heard at some point or another that their beliefs are actually bigoted and that their faith is merely subterfuge for that kind of animus. Well, they would have heard something similar if they tuned into a House Oversight Hearing on religious freedom this week.

At the hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) invoked her personal faith, claiming that Jesus Christ would be maligned in Congress, and accused traditional believers of using religious freedom to defend ""bigotry and discrimination.""

The hearing, ""The Administration's Religious Liberty Assault on LGBTQ Rights,"" was designed to ""examine the Administration's actions to erode LGBTQ rights in multiple areas, including healthcare, employment, adoption, and foster care.""

""I'm experiencing this hearing and I'm struggling whether I respond or launch into this question as a legislator or from the perspective of a woman of faith,"" Ocasio-Cortez began.

The far-left freshman even went as far as to compare religious freedom claims regarding sexual morality and human biology to scriptural arguments made in favor of slavery and white supremacy.

""I cannot, it's very difficult to sit here and listen to arguments in the long history in this country of using scripture and weaponizing and abusing scripture to justify bigotry,"" she said. ""White supremacists have done it, those who justified slavery did it, those who fought against integration did it, and we're seeing it today.""

The congresswoman then went on suggest that her colleagues would go as far as driving Jesus Christ out of Congress.

""Sometimes, especially this body, I feel as though if Christ himself walked through these doors and said what he said thousands of years ago, that we should love our neighbor and our enemy, that we should welcome the stranger, fight for the least of us ... he would be maligned as a radical and rejected from these doors.""

One of the witnesses was Evan Minton — a biological female who identifies as male — who is suing a Catholic hospital in California for not performing a hysterectomy ""because the surgery was related to my gender transition,"" according to the witnesses' prepared testimony. Minton also described how ""the Trump Administration singled me out"" by citing the case in a health care conscience-rights rule first proposed in 2018.



""There is nothing holy about rejecting medical care of people, no matter who they are on the grounds of what their identity is; There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital,"" Ocasio-Cortez said during her remarks.

""My faith commands me to treat Mr. Minton as holy because he is sacred, because his life is sacred, because you are not to be denied anything that I am entitled to,"" the congresswoman later said. ""That we are equal in the eyes of the law and we are equal — in my faith — in the eyes of the world.""

While Ocasio-Cortez has previously claimed to be Catholic in the past when advocating for criminal justice reforms, despite her public positions on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and transgender ideology, which don't quite align with where the church stands, to say the least.

Toward the end of her remarks, the now-visibly angry New York Democrat said that she was ""tired of communities of faith being weaponized and being mischaracterized because the only time religious freedom is invoked is in the name of bigotry and discrimination. I'm tired of it,""

She later went on to accuse the Trump administration of advancing ""the idea that religion and faith is about exclusion.""

Of course, the congresswoman's arguments here stem from the common assumption that not condoning or participation a person's actions somehow implies hatred or bigotry toward that person or a group of people.

In reality, the argument that any serious conscience rights advocate will offer about these kinds of situations goes like this:

When a religious hospital says that they cannot conduct a transgender medical procedure that goes against the tenets of their belief, the resistance is to the procedure rather than an active prejudice toward the person asking for it. When a Christian baker or florist can't serve as a vendor for a same-sex wedding ceremony, the issue at hand for them is not being able to participate in an action they believe to be sinful, rather than a desire not to associate with a class of people they don't like. When a pro-life doctor or hospital won't perform an abortion, it's not because of some secret desire to control a woman's organs, but because their conscience won't allow them to facilitate the taking of unborn life.

But while those may be a critical distinctions to the people who sincerely hold those beliefs and expect the First Amendment protection to live them out, to others, it's all merely deception for the sake of ""bigotry and discrimination.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-invokes-her-faith-and-jesus-christ-in-screed-saying-religious-freedom-is-used-for-discrimination,2020-02-28
AOC outrages LGBT activists with plan to rename post office that honors LGBT hero: 'Is it that she doesn’t know our history?',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has unleashed the wrath of LGBT activists over a proposal from her office to rename a Queens post office that is named in honor of an LGBT hero.

What are the details?

Ocasio-Cortez's congressional office is soliciting suggestions to rename the Jeanne and Jules Manford Post Office Building in Jackson Heights, the New York Daily News reported.

The building currently honors Jeanne Manford, who is considered to be the first American parent to march with their LGBT child in a gay rights parade. Manford and her husband, Jules, also founded Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, a LGBT advocacy organization.

Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Ocasio-Cortez, said the congresswoman will ""consider all community input"" and explained Ocasio-Cortez is ""very open"" to keeping the current building name. Hitt said Ocasio-Cortez began considering renaming the post office building after a community member suggested honoring Lorena Borjas, a prominent LGBT and immigration activist who passed away in 2020.

Ocasio-Cortez is soliciting naming recommendations through an online form.

""Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is looking to introduce legislation that would rename the Jackson Heights and Corona Post Offices after two individuals who represent the diversity and tenacity of New York's 14th congressional district,"" the form says. ""We'd love to hear from you: who are the community leaders from these neighborhoods that have inspired you?""

What was the reaction?

Daniel Dromm, a former Democratic member of the New York City Council, told the Daily News that changing the name of the building would ""erase our history"" and condemned Ocasio-Cortez.

""Is it that she doesn’t know our history? Did they not check to see who the post office is named after right now? Does she not know who Jeanne Manford was?"" Dromm reacted. ""You don’t take one pioneer of the LGBT movement and pit them against another person.""

LGBT activist Allen Roskoff agreed.

""How dare she put our community’s heritage up for a popularity contest or a vote,"" Roskoff told the newspaper. ""We are outraged.""

Dromm added that Ocasio-Cortez's push to rename a post office building that currently honors an LGBT hero is indicative of disconnect between her and Queens residents.

""I like her policies, but this is typical of her not being connected to the community,"" Dromm said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-outrages-lgbt-activists-with-plan-to-rename-post-office-that-honors-lgbt-hero,2022-02-23
Elon Musk trolls AOC with her own words in Twitter battle,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) bellyached about billionaires in several Twitter posts on Friday, but went silent after Elon Musk used the Democratic congresswoman's own words against her.

AOC wrote on Twitter, ""Billionaires be like 'the extreme far left is taking over' when the 'extreme far left' in the US is 'medicine shouldn’t bankrupt you,' 'wages should cover rent,' & 'maybe it’s bad that Wall St companies profit off mass surveillance, manufactured housing crises, and caging people.'""

""The number of billionaires in the US couldn’t even fill an apartment building, but the number of people they negatively impact is only growing,"" the democratic socialist wrote. ""All the US billionaire votes combined couldn’t even come in 2nd for an NY city council election. That’s why they stay pressed.""

""Tired of having to collectively stress about what explosion of hate crimes is happening bc some billionaire with an ego problem unilaterally controls a massive communication platform and skews it because Tucker Carlson or Peter Thiel took him to dinner and made him feel special,"" AOC ranted.

AOC did not name any billionaires by name, but some of her remarks could have been alluding to Musk since he recently railed against the far left and progressives.

Musk tweeted on Friday, ""The far left hates everyone, themselves included! But I’m no fan of the far right either. Let’s have less hate and more love.""

On Thursday, Musk shared a cartoon on how he is a liberal, but progressives have gone so far to the left that it makes him appear to be conservative.

Musk fired back at AOC's vague attacks by weaponizing the congresswoman's own words against her.

Musk simply replied, ""Stop hitting on me, I'm really shy.""

Musk's trolling comment references AOC's defense when she was called out for hypocritically vacationing maskless in mandate-free Florida while pushing COVID-19 restrictions in New York.

""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet. Ya creepy weirdos,"" Ocasio-Cortez deflected in January,

""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" AOC dodged the criticism. ""These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.""

AOC reportedly responded to Musk, ""I was talking about Zuckerberg but ok."" However, the reply has been deleted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-rants-about-billionaires-then-elon-musk-dismantles-the-congresswoman-with-her-own-words,2022-04-29
"Fully vaxxed and boosted AOC tests positive for COVID, is experiencing symptoms after partying maskless at crowded Miami bar","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has tested positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing symptoms, a statement from her office announced on Sunday evening.

The news comes just days after the New York Democrat was seen in Miami, partying maskless at a crowded bar.

What are the details?

The statement announced that Ocasio-Cortez is recovering at home.

""Representative Ocasio-Cortez has received a positive test result for COVID-19. She is experiencing symptoms and recovering at home,” the statement said. “The Congresswoman received her booster shot this fall, and encourages everyone to get their booster and follow all CDC guidance.”

At the time of this reporting, the CDC recommends that Americans who test positive for coronavirus and who develop symptoms as a result for the illness isolate for at least five full days. After five days, the CDC recommends that people stop isolating so long as they are free of fevers for 24 hours and other symptoms have improved.

""If an individual has access to a test and wants to test, the best approach is to use an antigen test towards the end of the 5-day isolation period,"" the CDC recommends. ""Collect the test sample only if you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.""

What else is there to know about this?

The announcement comes just one week after she was seen partying with her boyfriend Riley Roberts — sans mask — in Miami.

She raised eyebrows after former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes mocked her boyfriend's ""gross pale male feet"" in ""hideous sandals.""

He wrote, ""1. If Leftists like AOC actually thought mandates and masking worked, they wouldn't be frolicking in free FL. 2. Her guy is showing his gross pale male feet in public (not at a pool/beach) with hideous sandals. 0 for 2.""

The 32-year-old lawmaker fired back, ""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet. Ya creepy weirdos[.]”

She later added, ""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women,& LGBT+ people in general.

Applause breaks out when DeSantis buries reporter for 'pushing false narrative': 'It’s why people don’t trust people like you',"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) clashed with a reporter Monday over controversial legislation that Democrats and LGBT advocates are fiercely protesting.

What is the background?

The bill at the center of the controversy, HB 1557, is designed to bolster parents' rights in public education.

For example, one provision of the legislation reinforces the ""fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing & control of their children,"" while another prohibits schools from adopting policies permitting school officials to withhold information from their parents or policies encouraging students to withhold information from their parents, especially information related to ""critical decisions affecting student's mental, emotional, or physical well-being.""

But the bill also ""prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels"" — which has outraged LGBT advocates and Democrats.

The exact text of bill says:

Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.

What happened with DeSantis?

To generate opposition to the bill, critics of HB 1557 labeled it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — despite the bill not once using the word ""gay."" Instead, the bill only prohibits young children, whose brains are extremely malleable, from being indoctrinated with progressive LGBT ideology at school.

On Monday, WFLA-TV reporter Evan Donovan asked DeSantis about HB 1557, invoking the dishonest framing critics have pinned on it. But DeSantis had none of it.

""Can I ask you about [inaudible] rights in education, what critics call the 'Don't Say Gay' bill is on the [Florida] Senate floor —""

""Does it say that in the bill?"" DeSantis shot back. ""Does it say that in the bill?""



""I know that you support —"" Donovan responded.

""I’m asking you to tell me what’s in the bill, because you are pushing false narrative,"" DeSantis fired back. ""It doesn’t matter what critics say.""

""It bans classroom instruction on sexual identity and gender orientation,"" Donovan responded

“For who? For grades pre-K through three. So 5-year-olds, 6-year-olds, 7-year-olds,"" DeSantis responded. ""And the idea that you wouldn’t be honest about that and tell people what it actually says — it’s why people don’t trust people like you, because you peddle false narratives.""

The audience in the room then broke out in applause.

""So we disabuse you of those narratives,"" DeSantis continued. ""And we’re going to make sure that parents are able to send their kid to kindergarten without having some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/applause-breaks-out-when-desantis-buries-reporter-for-pushing-false-narrative,2022-03-08
Apple removes Christian ministry app following complaints by LGBT activists,"Apple removed a Christian ministry's app from its store after an LGBT group claimed it implied being gay was a sickness, according to published reports.

A gay rights group, Truth Wins Out, got the so-called ex-gay app removed after it convinced the tech giant that the app was ""dangerous,"" ""bigoted"" and ""hateful.""



""The app falsely portrays being gay as an 'addiction', 'sickness', and 'sin,'"" the group argued in a Change.org petition, which had 356 supporters.

Living Hope Ministries of Arlington, Texas, told The Christian Post in an email that it was disappointed, but will continue its work.

""We are saddened by Apple's and Microsoft's removal of our app because of a single person's false accusations. Regardless of their decision we will continue to make the app and our services available to those who seek them,"" said Ricky Chalette, executive director of the ministry.



""We are a ministry that for nearly thirty years has helped individuals resolve their feelings they deem incongruent with their faith,"" he continued. ""We help people deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ through Bible study and accountability. We walk with them to align their lives with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Through support groups they realize they are not alone and are able to share honestly and openly in a non-condemning atmosphere about their struggles, passions, and victories. From chaos and confusion they often find peace, hope, and a deeper sense of personal wholeness. Our ministry is free and strictly voluntary.""



He added, ""In a day when diversity and tolerance is celebrated I would hope it would be extended to issues of faith and practice.""

In an NBC report, Chalette said the ministry only helps people who contact them first. They serve as a discipleship ministry and function much like a church, he said.

The Change.org petition read, in part: “This is not the first time Apple has had to confront this issue. In 2011, Truth Wins Out launched a Change.org petition that gathered almost 150,000 signatures to successfully remove the Exodus 'ex-gay' app from the Apple Store. Let's demand that Apple does the right thing again, so LGBT youth won't be tormented by hateful bigots and bullies.""

Truth Wins Out Executive Director Wayne Besen said in a statement: “We thank Apple for exemplifying corporate responsibility and taking swift action to remove a dangerous app that stigmatizes and demeans LGBT people,""

He also said he believes groups such as Living Hope Ministries harm people they claim to be helping.

In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became one of the first Fortune 500 company leaders to announce he was gay. Additionally, during an interview with CNN, he declared that being gay was ""God's greatest gift to me.""

Chalette said the ministry plans to appeal Apple's decision. Its app was developed three years ago, according to reports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/apple-yanks-christian-ministry-app-from-store-following-complaints-from-lgbt-activists,2018-12-29
"Arizona Democrats want to get rid of ‘In God We Trust’ license plates, claim they fund ‘hate group’","Arizona Democrats want to get rid of ""In God We Trust"" license plates, which they claim supports a conservative ""hate group,"" the Arizona Republic reported.

A portion of the proceeds from the specialty plate goes to the Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom group, which the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a ""hate group"" because it doesn't support same-sex marriages. ADF's mission is ""to keep the doors open for the Gospel by advocating for religious liberty, the sanctity of life, and marriage and family.""

State Sen. Juan Mendez (D) proposed legislation that would prevent the state's department of transportation from selling the plates.

""State dollars should not be funding an organization that works to strip residents of our state of their human rights and human dignity,"" Mendez told the newspaper. ""It's appalling that we've already sent over a million dollars to this extremist hate group.""

ADF has received $900,000 in proceeds from the sale of the license plates since 2014, the Republic confirmed with the transportation department.

""We were appalled by it,"" said Tory Roberg, director of government affairs for the Secular Coalition for Arizona. ""People really need to know where their money is going.""

The plates help promote the national motto, First Amendment rights, and the heritage of state and nation, according to ADOT's website.

What did ADF say?

Senior Vice President of U.S. Legal Division Kristen Waggoner defended the group's mission in a statement published on the group's website.

""It's disappointing to see elected officials become uncritical pawns in these ugly propaganda campaigns,"" Waggoner said.

Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel for ADF, told the Republic that the state hasn't violated any laws with the plates.

""Arizona is well within its rights to offer its citizens an opportunity to voluntarily purchase license plates affirming the First Amendment and contributing to ADF's work on behalf of the freedom of all Americans to live and work according to their beliefs,"" Tedesco said.

What else?

ADOT contributes $17 of the $25 purchase price of specialty plates to various causes and groups, according to the report.

Mendez proposed a second bill that would require more transparency by the transportation department about the groups receiving proceeds from specialty plates.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-democrats-want-to-end-in-god-we-trust-license-plates,2019-02-12
Arizona law banning pornography in public schools goes into effect,"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey approved Republican Rep. Jake Hoffman's proposed House Bill 2495 on July 6. It went into effect this past weekend, meaning public schools in the state can no longer subject students to pornography.

While some opponents of the bill suggested that by preventing children from engaging with works depicting sodomy, masturbation, oral sex, and other sex acts, Arizona Republicans have effectively censored ""LGBTQ+ stories,"" Hoffman underlined that his objective, now realized, was the protection of ""kids from sexually explicit material.""

The law

The law prohibits children's use of or referral to textual, visual, or audio materials that contain graphic depictions — literal or simulated — of sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sexual acts (e.g., normal sex, sodomy, and masturbation).

Notwithstanding suggestions from early critics of the bill that kids would be precluded from reading books like ""The Canterbury Tales,"" the bill states that materials may be exempted if they possess serious educational value for minors or possess serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. Exempted material can be used and referenced on the condition that the school obtains parental consent in advance.



In the event that exempted material is the subject of an assignment or curricular learning and parental consent is not secured, an alternative assignment not containing explicit material must be provided.

Lisa Fink, the president of the Protect Arizona Children Coalition and supporter of the bill, identified a book that had been in circulation in Maricopa County libraries, which would qualify for removal. ""Beyond Magenta,"" a book about transsexual teens, reportedly features ""descriptions of children performing sex acts with adults.""

Republican Rep. Jake Hoffman introduced the bill, keen not to hamper lessons on human anatomy (he indicated biology can still be taught), but rather to shield children from ""the same types of materials that are currently prohibited under our criminal code.""

When arguing for his law, Hoffman cited a National Institute for Health study, which suggested exposure to sexually explicit material was dangerous for children and resulted in adverse outcomes.

Corresponding with his campaign to see the bill through the state house, there was a campaign to ""stop sexual grooming in Arizona schools.""



Whereas some supporters of the bill characterized the fight as one against the sexualization of minors, Democratic state Rep. Daniel Hernandez suggested the dual effect of the law would be an end to the promotion of a ""homosexual lifestyle"" and a resuscitation of the so called ""no promo homo"" law repealed in 2019.

Hoffman said Hernandez had mischaracterized the bill. Depictions of homosexuality are not prohibited, but as in the case with depictions of straight sex, ""the act of homosexuality, so the act of sexual intercourse between two people of the same gender,"" would be prohibited.



State Sen. Christine March (D) said the bill might prove a ""logistical and bookkeeping nightmare for teachers,"" who might altogether avoid teaching books with sexually graphic material.

The response

The gay and transsexual activist group Equality Arizona suggested in March that the bill would ""censor LGBTQ+ stories from both history and literature.""

The group condemned the law, suggesting it pares ""education down to nothing more than 'reading, writing, and arithmetic'.""

One of the group's members, activist Gaelle Esposito, stated: ""We're very concerned about the impact that this ... would have on teachers and students who are trying to access new materials that reflect their perspective.""

He noted further that ""It's unclear what the consequences are for a teacher that violates the statute and what they may face.""

Jeanne Casteen, executive director of Secular AZ, claimed that the law's prohibition of pornography in schools constituted a ""whitewashing of literature."" She intimated further that much would be lost by no longer being able to share books containing characters navigating their sexuality with students, ""when the magic really happens.""

Arizona Education Association President Marisol Garcia told KPHO, ""There's just no reason why policy makers should be passing these types of laws.""

The nationwide campaign to protect children

There have been a number of recent initiatives taken across the U.S. to protect American children from sexually graphic content and overt sexualization.

On August 2, residents of Jamestown Township, Michigan, overwhelmingly voted ""no"" to a 10-year millage renewal and increase for the Patmos Library, largely over its inclusion of alleged LGBT pornography in its catalog.

Missouri's Senate Bill 775 went into effect on August 28, prohibiting sexually explicit materials in both public and private schools.

On March 28, Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill into law, reinforcing parents' rights to make decisions regarding the upbringing of their children. It also prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through 3rd grade, along with the dissemination of age inappropriate materials.

Utah's House Bill 374, signed into law by Gov. Spencer Cox (R) on March 24, prohibits sensitive materials in public schools.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-law-banning-pornography-in-public-schools-goes-into-effect,2022-09-27
AZ proposal to require parental permission for pronouns,"Arizona state senator-elect John Kavanagh, a Republican who is currently a state representative, is pushing a measure that would require parents to provide permission in order for school employees to refer to a student using pronouns that do not match that student's biological sex.

""An employee or independent contractor of a school district or charter school may not knowingly address, identify or refer to a student who is under eighteen years of age by a pronoun that differs from the pronoun that aligns with the student's biological sex unless the school district or charter school receives written permission from the student's parent,"" the legislation states.

The measure also states that school districts and charter schools may not demand that workers refer to an individual with pronouns that do not comport with that individual's biological sex if doing so would contradict the worker's religious or moral beliefs.

According to the Arizona Mirror, the state lawmaker also plans to include a provision to require parental consent for teachers to refer to pupils using a name other than a student's given name.

""Under my bill you can call a person by a different pronoun or you can even call the person by a name associated with the opposite biological gender, so long as the parents have given permission,"" Kavanagh said, according to the outlet.

""Transgender students are often under psychological stress,"" he said. ""In fact there's a term ... called gender dysphoria and that type of condition needs parental assistance and perhaps even medical attention that the parents refer the student to. This cannot happen if the school keeps the parents in the dark.""

Even if the measure clears the state legislature next year, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who will become the state's new governor, could potentially oppose it.

""I'm not willing to assume that Gov. Hobbs would want to keep parents in the dark, especially when the children have a condition that results overall in higher suicide rates,"" Kavanagh said, according to the outlet. ""I think parents need to know, they need to get help for the children (and) counseling. I'm not going to assume the governor would oppose that.""



Bridget Sharpe, the director of the state chapter of the Human Rights Campaign, which is a pro-LGBT advocacy organization, opposes the proposal.

""It's incredibly disappointing that Senator-Elect John Kavanagh and his extremist allies have chosen to prioritize attacking children and their families as their first priority for this session,"" Sharpe said in a statement, according to the outlet. ""By introducing SB1001 they are simply using their power to ostracize children for their pronouns…With so many other real, not made up issues plaguing Arizonans, this piece of legislation shows the point of their politics is simply cruelty, not legislating.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-pronouns-parental-permission-school,2022-12-30
'What I believe is right for my state ... for the country': Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is leaving Democratic Party,"Republicans may have missed an opportunity to pick up a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia this week, but Democrats will soon be missing a senator.

Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema has announced that she is leaving the Democratic Party, driven out by ""extreme voices"" driving the party ""toward the fringes.""

Rather than caucus with Republicans, Sinema, who started out with the Green Party, is registering as an independent — a move that will not bereave Democrats of their majority, but may nevertheless change certain dynamics in the Senate.

A Senate shake-up

Sinema posted a video to Twitter on Friday, noting that she has ""joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington and formally registering as an Arizona Independent.""

The prospective independent penned an op-ed in the Arizona Republic, saying, ""There’s a disconnect between what everyday Americans want and deserve from our politics, and what political parties are offering.""

""Everyday Americans are increasingly left behind by national parties’ rigid partisanship, which has hardened in recent years,"" wrote Sinema.

The senator suggested that both parties have failed to demonstrate ""much tolerance for diversity of thought"" and that ""payback against the opposition party has replaced thoughtful legislating.""

A liberal by any other name

After Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) won Tuesday's runoff election, the Democrats imagined they'd have 51 seats against Republicans' 49 in the Senate, plus Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Now, at least on paper, they're back down to 50.



Despite the ostensible power change, it may not prove too destabilizing for the Democrats.

Sinema, elected to the U.S. House in 2012 and the Senate in 2018, intimated in her op-ed that this change is cosmetic, suggesting that her work in the Senate won't be altered and that her ""service to Arizona remains the same.""

Along the same lines, Sinema told Politico, ""Nothing will change about my values or my behavior.""

""I don’t anticipate that anything will change about the Senate structure,"" she said, adding that she intends ""to show up to work, do the same work that I always do. I just intend to show up to work as an independent.”

Sinema also intends to continue in her present committee assignments.

""I keep my eye focused on what I’m doing right now. And registering as an independent is what I believe is right for my state. It’s right for me. I think it’s right for the country,"" she said.

It is presently unclear whether Sinema will caucus with Democrats like independent Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Angus King (Maine), reported The Hill.

Despite dropping the Democratic Party, Sinema made sure to reiterate her support for abortion, illegal so-called ""Dreamers,"" and LGBT activism in her Arizona Republic piece.



After clarifying that she would maintain her liberal bona fides, Sinema noted also that she will prioritize securing the southern border.

In response to the news, one White House official told CNN that Sinema's departure ""doesn't change much"" besides the senator's own reelection calculations.

“We’ve worked with her effectively on a lot of major legislation from CHIPS to the bipartisan infrastructure law,” the unnamed official said, adding that the Biden White House has “every reason to expect that will continue.""

Politico reported that Sinema, up for reelection in 2024, will now avoid a primary challenge from Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), but may ultimately face a ""chaotic"" general-election fight against both Republican and Democrat challengers.

The 46-year-old's current term ends on Jan. 3, 2025.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-sen-kyrsten-sinema-leaving-democratic-party,2022-12-09
Arizona Supreme Court rules that Christian company does not have to make invitations for LGBT weddings,"On Monday, the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that two women who run an invitation company do not have to create content for LGBT weddings.

What happened?

Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski started and run their wedding invitation company, ""Brush and Nib,"" in Phoenix. Through this company, they sell hand-drawn invitations.

While other Christian companies only entered a legal battle once they were personally sued by people who had been refused service for their same-sex weddings, Duka and Koski decided to preemptively bring their case before the courts themselves.

Alliance Defending Freedom, who is representing the women, said in a statement that Duka and Koski were faced ""with an impossible choice."" A non-discrimination law in the city required them to accept work orders from all weddings or face fines of up to $2,500 and a maximum six months in jail.

""They didn't want to go to jail and pay $2,500 for each day they failed to comply,"" ADF said. ""They didn't want to close the business they poured so much into. But the alternative wasn't doable. They could not compromise their artistic and religious beliefs. They could not accept sitting down in their studio and hand-drawing artwork that contradicted who they are and what they hold dear.""

What did the courts say?

Duka and Koski lost their initial bid in a lower court, but that setback was reversed when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the law violated their free speech. However, this ruling was narrow and applied only to the hand-made invites, which the court said fell under freedom of speech, and not anything else they might do.

""Duka and Koski's beliefs about same-sex marriage may seem old-fashioned, or even offensive to some,"" the majority in the court wrote, according to The Associated Press. ""But the guarantees of free speech and freedom of religion are not only for those who are deemed sufficiently enlightened, advanced, or progressive. They are for everyone.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-supreme-court-rules-that-christian-company-does-not-have-to-make-invitations-for-lgbtq-weddings,2019-09-17
Arkansas state House passes protections for teachers who refuse to use transgender students' preferred pronouns,"On the heels of enacting into law the nation's first ban on sex-change hormone treatments or mutilating surgeries for transgender minors, the Arkansas House on Thursday passed a bill that would protect teachers from repercussions if they offend a student by refusing to use that student's preferred pronouns or name.

The bill, HB 1749, states, ""An employee of a public school shall not be required to use a pronoun, title, or other word to identify a public school student as male or female that is inconsistent with the public school student's biological sex."" The legislation would enable an employee of a public school who faces ""adverse action"" for calling a student by the wrong name or pronoun to file a legal claim for relief.

Republican state Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill's sponsor, said during debate on the House floor that the bill's purpose is to protect teachers who fear litigation for refusing to use a transgender student's preferred name.

""It's not compelling anyone's speech, it's not prohibiting anyone's speech,"" Bentley said. ""It's helping those professors and teachers in our schools that do not want to be used for not using a certain person's pronoun.""

She said that while the legislature needs to do more to protect parents and teachers, this bill is a necessary first step.

""Districts definitely need to look at this and do more. This bill is a simple bill. It has already been affirmed by the appeals court and the sixth district. All this is, is protecting our teachers, and they do feel threatened,"" she said.

Democratic members of the state House spoke out in opposition to the bill.

""This bill is protecting and therefore emboldening teachers who are intentionally misgendering students and therefore are intentionally severing their relationship,"" said Rep. Megan Godfrey.

Rep. Fred Love said that calling a transgender person by their preferred name or pronouns is simply the right thing to do if you want to be polite and respectful.

""Refer to someone as they choose to be referred to,"" he said. ""That's not hard. That's not difficult. That's just a bit of decency and a bit of respect, and I think that's what we need to do.""

The bill passed the House mostly along partisan lines, 62-21. Two Republican lawmakers joined Democrats in opposition to the legislation, which now proceeds to the state Senate.

Earlier this week, the Arkansas Legislature overrode Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson's veto to enact into law a ban on sex change operations or hormone treatments for transgender minors in the state.

In opposing the bill, Hutchinson argued that preventing doctors or counselors from prescribing puberty-blockers or cross-sex hormones to troubled transgender youths was tantamount to denying children health care. He also claimed that a limited government, conservative approach to governing means lawmakers should not interfere with the recommendations of medical professionals who believe administering drugs to children that can delay puberty and irreversibly alter their bodies is good medicine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arkansas-state-house-passes-protections-for-teachers-who-refuse-to-use-transgender-students-preferred-pronouns,2021-04-09
Army policy proposal would allow soldiers 'compassionate reassignment' if they feel discriminated against by local laws: Report,"The Army is reportedly editing a personnel policy to allow soldiers to request reassignment if they believe state or local laws discriminate against them.

What are the details?

The proposed policy would allow soldiers to request reassignment if they believe local laws discriminate against them on the basis of ""gender, sex, religion, race or pregnancy,"" according to Military.com.

The news outlet described the policy as one of the ""most progressive policies"" under consideration by the military, which would essentially allow ""soldiers to declare that certain states are too racist, too homophobic, too sexist or otherwise discriminatory to be able to live there safely and comfortably,"" Military.com noted.

If adopted, the policy would change under which circumstances soldiers can be granted a ""compassionate reassignment."" Army guidelines explain compassionate requests are granted for matters that ""cannot be resolved through the use of leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or the help of Family members or other parties.""

Senior Army leaders have not yet been briefed about the proposed policy change.

Lindsay Church of Minority Veterans of America praised the proposal as being necessary because of alleged anti-LGBT environments.

""Some states are becoming untenable to live in; there's a rise in hate crimes and rise in LGBT discrimination,"" Church told Military.com. ""In order to serve this country, people need to be able to do their job and know their families are safe. All of these states get billions for bases but barely tolerate a lot of the service members.""

What did the Army say?

""The Army does not comment on leaked draft documents,"" said Army spokeswoman Angel Tomko. ""AR 600-100 and 600-200 establish the criteria for which soldiers may request for a compassionate reassignment. The chain of command is responsible for ensuring Soldiers and Families' needs are supported and maintain a high quality of life.""

The proposal was reportedly dispatched through military wires before the leak of a Supreme Court opinion draft indicating the court had voted to overturn abortion precedents.

Whether the policy proposal would apply to so-called ""reproductive health care,"" i.e., the ability of women to obtain an abortion, is not clear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/army-considering-policy-reassignment-discrimination-local-laws,2022-05-20
"Army investigating viral photos of officers posing in 'puppy play' kink masks, BDSM gear while in uniform","The U.S. Army confirmed Monday it is investigating two commissioned officers for wearing their official military uniforms while adored with BDSM gear and dog masks.

The disturbing photos surfaced on social media last week. They show the officers, one colonel and one captain, flaunt their apparent LGBT relationship using anonymous social media accounts under the names ""PupRavage"" and ""HonuPup."" The photos show the men engaged in an LGBT sex kink known as ""puppy play.""

""Puppy play (aka pup play) is a form of consensual, adult role-play popular in the gay leather community, where people dress up and embody the characteristics of a dog,"" Men's Health magazine explains.

What did the Army say?

Army spokesman Maj. Jonathon Lewis confirmed that military officials are investigating the incident.

""U.S. Army Pacific is aware of content found on social media reflecting soldiers' activities while wearing uniforms,"" Lewis said in a statement. ""The incident is currently under investigation.""

The military, however, is not disclosing details about the nature of the investigation.

Don Christensen, the former chief prosecutor for the Air Force, told USA Today that the officers could be subject to military discipline under Article 133 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, which governs behavior unbecoming of a military officer.

The spirit of Article 133 is whether the ""officer’s conduct disgraces him personally or brings dishonor to the military profession such as to affect his fitness to command so as to successfully complete the military mission."" And ""because officer behavior is so important, criminal liability for conduct unbecoming does not depend on whether conduct actually effects a harm upon a victim, but rather on whether the officer possessed the general intent to act indecorously, dishonestly, or indecently.""

Thus the behavior could result in a court-martial.

""All U.S. Army soldiers are expected to uphold high standards of personal conduct and to avoid discrediting the service and the uniform, both in person and across social media,"" said Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/army-investigating-officers-dog-masks,2022-12-14
The Army has just 7 weeks to meet its recruitment targets this year. It's only 52% of the way there.,"The U.S. Army is projected to fall well short of its annual recruitment goal this year, having met only a little more than half of its target for fiscal year 2022.

Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told NBC News Friday that the Army has recruited only 52% of its goal for FY 2022 and is expected be short by as many as 15,000 recruits.

“We are right now at about 52% of the mission that we had originally set for ourselves. So we’ve got a ways to go, and obviously we’ve only got about a month or so until the fiscal year ends,” Wormuth said. “I would say we’re [going to be] about 12,000 to 15,000 recruits short this year.”

The current fiscal year will end on September 30. The Army had initially sought to add 60,000 active-duty enlistments this year, but has since downsized that target amid dismal recruitment shortfalls.

NBC News reports that while the Army is authorized to have as many as 485,000 total troops, it recently lowered that number to 476,000. Wormuth warned that long-term recruitment shortages could impact military readiness.

U.S. military and defense officials have said every branch of the military is facing recruitment shortfalls amid both a record low percentage of young Americans eligible to serve and even fewer willing to. In June, Pentagon officials announced that annual recruitment goals across all military branches were down 23%.

An internal Defense Department survey reported by NBC News found that only 9% of Americans eligible to serve in the military had any desire to do so, the lowest number since 2007. More than half of survey respondents (57%) said they would have emotional or psychological issues after their service. Nearly half believed they would have physical problems.

At the same time, fewer young Americans are eligible to join the military, with many being disqualified for obesity, drug use, or criminal records. Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville testified in May that only 23% of Americans ages 17-24 are qualified to serve without waivers to join, down from 29% in recent years, according to NBC News.



The military has attempted to address the shortfalls by offering more financial benefits for service and through advertising campaigns.

In May, the Army launched a recruitment campaign, ""The Calling,"" which emphasized the branch's commitment to diversity. The first ad released for the campaign told the story of Cpl. Emma Malonelord, who was raised by a lesbian couple.

""It begins in California with a little girl raised by two moms,"" Malonelord narrates in the video. ""Although I had a fairly typical childhood, took ballet, played violin, I also marched for equality. I like to think I've been defending freedom from an early age.""

EMMA | THE CALLING | GOARMY youtu.be

The ""woke"" ad was harshly criticized by conservatives who said focusing on LGBT social justice issues instead of defending the country made the Army look weak.



The Army also provoked controversy in June when it announced a policy that would have permitted recruits to enlist without a high school diploma or GED. The proposal backfired, as people online mocked the military for being so desperate for recruits that officials lowered their standards. The old standards were reinstated just one week after the policy change was announced.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/army-recruitment-shortfall,2022-08-12
The media are trying to smear Amy Coney Barrett for being a Christian again — this time labeling her as 'anti-gay',"In another apparent hit piece on the Supreme Court nominee, the Associated Press published a lengthy story Wednesday ominously warning that Amy Coney Barrett has served on the board for private Christian schools with ""anti-gay"" policies.

The story is the latest in a stringofreports published in recent weeks by the Associated Press, along with several other news outlets, which aim to cast Barrett's Christian faith in a negative light.

Earlier this month, Senate Republicans torched the Washington Post for publishing a ""religious smear"" of Barrett ahead of her confirmation hearings.

What are the details?

This most recent story takes aim at Barrett's position as a board member from July 2015 to March 2017 at Trinity Schools Inc., which has established institutions in Indiana, Minnesota, and Virginia, and is reportedly associated with the group, ""People of Praise.""

Here's what the article said (emphasis added):

Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett served for nearly three years on the board of private Christian schools that effectively barred admission to children of same-sex parents and made it plain that openly gay and lesbian teachers weren't welcome in the classroom.



... The AP spoke with more than two dozen people who attended or worked at Trinity Schools, or former members of People of Praise. They said the community's teachings have been consistent for decades: Homosexuality is an abomination against God, sex should occur only within marriage and marriage should only be between a man and a woman.



A 2018-19 enrollment agreement obtained by the AP says ""the only proper place for human sexual activity is marriage, where marriage is a legal and committed relationship between one man and one woman."" It goes on to say that activities such as ""fornication, pornography, adultery and homosexual acts, and advocating or modeling any of these behaviors"" are at odds with the school's core beliefs.

While the school's purported views on sexuality seen above in bold may be surprising to some, they are certainly not inconsistent with the historic teachings of Christianity.



Furthermore, the AP quoted ""experts"" as saying ""the actions are probably legal"" and noted that Barrett was ""not involved in the formulation or passage of any policies pertaining to homosexuality,"" according to Trinity Schools President Jon Balsbaugh.

""Trinity Schools does not unlawfully discriminate with respect to race, color, gender, national origin, age, disability, or other legally protected classifications under applicable law, with respect to the administration of its programs,"" Balsbaugh added in an email to the AP.

What else?

The story went on to highlight in further detail instances in which the school's opposition to homosexuality or LGBT individuals appeared more hostile, but the details of those instances were repudiated by Balsbaugh — and more importantly, were in no way connected to Barrett.

Barrett has been targeted for her conservative Christian faith ever since she was put forward as a potential Supreme Court nominee in 2017. During her confirmation hearing to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) infamously told Barrett she was ""controversial,"" adding ""the dogma lives loudly within you.""

Yet despite objection from Senate Democrats, Barrett is expected to be confirmed to the nation's highest court Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/associated-press-amy-barrett-anti-gay,2020-10-21
Attorney General Barr orders investigation into possible LGBT discrimination at the FBI,"Attorney General William Barr has ordered the Department of Justice to investigate claims of rampant LGBTQ discrimination at both the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons, the AP reported Friday.

Here's what we know

DOJ Pride, a gay rights group for Justice Department employees, sent a letter to Barr on March 27 asking him to investigate accusations that the department was discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The group said it had surveyed its members in October, and found that only 10 percent thought that ""the Department of Justice attracts and retains the best LGBTQ talent"" and 43 percent said ""the Department of Justice does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.""

It also cited instances of LGBTQ people at the Department of Justice who reported being discriminated against. In one comment that the group said was ""representative,"" a respondent said that ""[a]gents attend[ing] the FBI academy that are gay and/or latino are definitely discriminated against and in many cases evaluated more harshly than other agents or dismissed from the academy.""

One respondent wrote that ""[t]here are many gay agents [at the FBI] that are dismissed because they are not 'bro-y' or masculine enough."" Another said that they were ""leaving the DOJ in part due to the DOJ's treatment of its LGBTQ employees.""

""These statistics and statements point toward a set of issues the Department must address, including morale, recruitment, retention, and fair treatment,"" DOJ Pride wrote. The group called on Barr to issue an Equal Employment Opportunity statement.



What did Barr say?

Following this letter, Barr decided to take action. In a letter of his own to Jason Lee, the president of DOJ Pride, Barr wrote:

I was troubled by the concerns you raise about low morale and in particular about discrimination against LGBTQ employees. I have shared your letter with the FBI and BOP and have directed them to take appropriate action to investigate and address allegations of discrimination and to prevent it going forward. I hope that DOJ Pride can help in identifying issues when they arise and in working with Department leadership on solutions.

Barr said he realized that ""these steps are not a cure-all,"" but said he thought that they were ""important.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/attorney-general-lgbt-investigation-at-fbi,2019-04-08
Authorities investigating Finnish politician for a hate crime. Her 'crime?' Sharing a Bible verse on Facebook.,"A Finnish politician is under investigation for a hate crime — because she shared a Bible verse on her Facebook page.

What are the details?

Police are investigating former Interior Minister Päivi Räsänen, a Christian Democrat MP, after she shared the Bible verse.

The verse, Romans 1:24-27, accompanied a criticism of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland over its participation in the Helsinki LGBT Pride events that took place in June.

The New International Version translation of Romans 1:24-27 reads:

24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

Räsänen, whose husband is a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church, captioned her post, ""How can the church's doctrinal foundation, the Bible, be compatible with the lifting up of shame and sin as a subject of pride? #LGBT #HelsinkiPride2019.""

The Finnish police are now investigating Räsänen as part of an investigation on incitement against sexual and gender minorities.



A spokesperson for the Helsinki Police Department told the Helsinki Times that further details on the investigation are forthcoming.

""The pre-trial investigations have not yet been completed. Police will provide more details once the investigations have been completed or presented to a prosecutor for consideration of charges,"" the spokesperson said.

In August, Räsänen tweeted, ""I am not concerned on my part, as I trust this will not move on to the prosecutor. However, I am concerned if quoting the Bible is considered even 'slightly' illegal. I hope this won't lead to self-censorship among Christians.""

What else?



In an interview with Faithwire, Räsänen insisted that her faith is in God and nothing and no one else.

""I was shocked that the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, which I am a member of, announced its official affiliation to Helsinki LGBT Pride 2019,"" she told the outlet.

""Our Church Act states that 'All doctrine must be examined and evaluated according to God's Holy Word.' Pride events celebrate acts and relations that the Bible calls sinful and shameful. Based on these Scriptures, I asked: 'How can the church's doctrinal foundation, the Bible, be compatible with the lifting up of shame and sin as a subject of pride?'"" she continued.

Räsänen insisted that she was not attempting to insult sexual minorities.

""As I prayed, I was convinced that now is the time to try to wake up the sleeping ones, not to jump out of a sinking boat,"" she explained. ""My purpose was in no way to insult sexual minorities. My criticism was aimed at the leadership of the church.""

""Only people who recognize their sins need Jesus, the forgiveness of our sins,"" she added. ""This is why we also must have the courage to call homosexual relations sinful.""

Räsänen said that she is concerned with potential impacts on Christians being able to freely express their beliefs.

""I am worried that the police investigation has had a chilling effect among Christians,"" she admitted. ""It seems that many Christians in my country are now hiding and going to the closet now that the LGBT-community has come out to the public.""

She concluded, ""We must obey God rather than man. Trusting that the Bible is God's Word is a solid foundation for the Gospel to bring forth new life and win hearts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/authorities-investigate-politician-for-a-hate-crime-her-crime-sharing-a-bible-verse-on-facebook,2019-09-05
"Barack Obama slapped with reality check after he denounces 'trumped up culture wars,' 'fake outrage'","Former President Barack Obama was slapped with a reality check Saturday after urging Virginia voters to ignore what he called ""fake outrage"" and ""trumped up culture wars"" that he claimed are being peddled by ""right-wing media.""

What did Obama say?

While campaigning for Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, Obama denounced focusing on cultural issues, instead saying that Americans should be concerned with recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We don't have time to be wasting on these phony trumped up culture wars, this fake outrage that right-wing media peddles to juice their ratings,"" Obama said.

Obama appeared to be speaking about McAuliffe's opponent, Republican Glenn Youngkin, whose campaign platform includes supporting parents to have a voice over decisions made by school boards.

""Instead of stoking anger aimed at school boards and administrators, who are just trying to keep our kids safe, who are just doing their jobs, stoking anger to the point where some of them are actually getting death threats,"" Obama said. ""We should be making it easier for teachers and schools to give our kids the world-class education they deserve, and do to so safely while they are in the classroom.""

What was the response?

Obama's comments generated sharp rebuke.

Critics pointed out that children's education is not part of the ""trumped up culture war"" as Obama claimed, especially considering that McAuliffe has said parents shouldn't have a say in school board decisions.

As many others pointed out, Loudoun County Schools also stands accused of ""covering up"" two sexual assaults as they pushed controversial LGBT policies.

""Sorry, but McAuliffe saying that parents shouldn't be in charge of their children's education and the Loudoun County school board lying to parents about sexual assaults in bathrooms isn't 'trumped up cultural wars,'"" Ben Shapiro said.

""Let's be clear: THEY are waging the culture war. WE are fighting back. Covering up a sexual assault in school restrooms to push a transgender policy in gov't schools is the definition of waging a culture war,"" radio host Larry O'Connor said.

""Barack Obama is telling parents they have fake outrage over school boards covering up sexual assaults and teaching critical race theory,"" Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) reacted.

""The 'right-wing media' tricked Terry McAuliffe into telling parents they should influence school boards. @GlennYoungkin is surging because he's got answers for Virginia's public education's failures,"" radio host Hugh Hewitt pointed out.

""Two girls were sexually assaulted on school property, and school admin officials publicly lied about their knowledge of it to parents,"" reporter Susan Crabtree pointed out.

""Two girls were sexually assaulted on school property, and school admin officials publicly lied about their knowledge of it to parents,"" reporter Susan Crabtree pointed out. ""My child's education is not a trumped-up culture war,"" Michael Needham, chief of staff to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), fired back.

""Here in WA: I was fired for refusing an experimental vaccine, I saw the COVID pts. Vax passes start Monday in Seattle. An elementary school has a gender unicorn on the wall. A high school handed out a sexual survey asking when kids first had anal. But sure, it's Trumped up anger,"" another person said.

""Gaslighting at its finest,"" one person observed.

""Zero self-awareness. Zero accountability,"" another person said.

""Schools cover up sexual assault. That's not trumped up. That's not culture war. That's a dereliction of public duty. The failure to address it is a failure of leadership. Saying otherwise is a deflection,"" another person said.

Obama is the latest high-profile figure to stump for McAuliffe. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have also been campaigning for McAuliffe, which signals the race to become Virginia's next governor is much tighter than Democrats anticipated.

HHS secretary indicates Biden supports using taxpayer money to fund 'gender-affirming' care for minors,"The Biden administration approves of using taxpayer dollars to fund sex-change surgeries on adolescents, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra disclosed this week.

What is the background?

During a House Committee on Education and Labor hearing in April, Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) asked Becerra whether taxpayer dollars should fund ""chemical castration and sex-change operations.""

""[The Biden administration] will continue to comply with the law and provide people with the protections they need to get the medical services they are entitled to,"" the secretary responded.

At the time, Becerra did not provide clarifying details.

What happened now?

On Tuesday, Becerra submitted complete explanations to questions related to that hearing. Contained within the document was an unequivocal statement of support for taxpayer-funded sex change operations — even for minors.

""The Biden-Harris Administration supports the upcoming release of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care Version 8 and believes that all children and adults should be afforded life-saving, medically necessary care,"" the document said.

""Payers, both public and private, should cover treatments which medical experts have determined to be medically necessary,"" it added.

The cited guidance, the WPATH 8, not only recommends ""gender-affirming"" care for adolescent children, but states that medical professionals should provide such services even if the children's parents oppose it.

""We recommend when gender-affirming medical or surgical treatments are indicated for adolescents, health care professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents involve parent(s)/guardian(s) in the assessment and treatment process, unless their involvement is determined to be harmful to the adolescent or not feasible,"" the guidance states.

While the guidance does not define ""harmful,"" in the context of LGBT ""gender-affirming"" care the word refers to any opinion that does not unquestionably affirm people in their expressions of gender and sexuality.

The Daily Caller first reported on Becerra's detailed answers.

Anything else?

Last month, President Joe Biden condemned states that ban ""gender-affirming"" medical care for minors.

""I don’t think any state or anybody should have the right [to ban gender-affirming health care] as a moral question. As a legal question, I just think it’s wrong,"" Biden said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/becerra-taxpayer-funded-trans-care-minors,2022-12-01
"Ben & Jerry's bows to anti-Israel activists, won't sell ice cream in 'Occupied Palestinian Territory'","Ben & Jerry's, the politically activist Burlington, Vermont-based ice cream company, released a statement Monday announcing that its ice cream would no longer be sold in ""Occupied Palestinian Territory"" belonging to Israel.

""We believe it is inconsistent with our values for Ben & Jerry's ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT),"" the company said, referring to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, ancestral Israeli territory that Palestinians claim is illegally occupied by the Jewish state.

The announcement was posted on the company's Twitter account and is the first social media post Ben & Jerry's issued in nearly two months. According to the Boston Globe, Ben & Jerry's social media page went silent in May after pro-Palestinian activists started a campaign to pressure the company into disavowing its ties to Israel following a the outbreak of renewed violence in the Gaza Strip.

At the time, Hamas terrorists targeted Israeli civilians with rocket attacks, and Israeli Defense Forces responded with airstrikes in Gaza. Over 11 days of violence, more than 230 Palestinians were killed, including 65 children, and at least 12 Israelis died, including two children. The disparity can attributed in part to the success of Israel's Iron Dome defense system, which protects Israeli citizens from Palestinian rockets, and also in part to Hamas hiding military targets behind civilian shields.

Outraged pro-Palestinian activists demanded that Ben & Jerry's speak out against Israeli violence, observing that the company has a long track record of being outspoken for other progressive causes including LGBT rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform, and racial issues.

A local Vermont group, Vermonters for Justice in Palestine, criticized the company for being silent on the conflict and for licensing a factory in Israel, which produces and distributes ice cream throughout the country, including in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The license agreement was ""born out of a friendship between Ben & Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen and Israeli businessman Avi Zinger in the 1980s"", the Globe reported.

In 2013, Vermonters for Justice in Palestine (VTJP) prepared a report for Ben & Jerry's executives that documented how the company distributed ice cream in ""Occupied Palestinian Territory,"" but it went unnoticed.

""We've tried to appeal to them based on their mission of love, peace, equality. But they ignored us,"" said Wafic Faour, who led VTJP's Ben & Jerry's campaign. ""Now, public opinion is changing, especially due to the younger generations who have taken to social media and protests and come to our aid. They can no longer ignore us.""

Monday's statement from Ben & Jerry's acknowledges the partnership with an Israeli licensee and commits to making changes.



""We have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region. We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year,"" the company said.



""Although Ben & Jerry's will no longer be sold in the OPT, we will stay in Israel through a different arrangement. We will share an update on this as soon as we're ready,"" the statement concluded.

Reacting, the anti-anti-Semitism group StopAntisemitism.org criticized Ben & Jerry's for kowtowing to the radical Boycott, Divestment, Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.

'Ben Sasse is a**': Students give Nebraska senator hostile reception as he interviews for University of Florida job,"Students and faculty at the University of Florida gave Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) a hostile reception at their campus in Gainesville after he was announced as a finalist to be the university's next president.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Emerson Alumni Hall, where Sasse was scheduled to participate in a Q&A forum with students on Monday. Minutes after the forum started, an estimated 300 anti-Sasse demonstrators entered the building and began chanting and banging on the hallway walls outside the President's Ballroom, where Sasse was trying to answer questions.

""Hey hey, ho ho, Ben Sasse has got to go,"" the protesters yelled. They carried signs reading, ""Keep Sasse out of our swamp"" and ""Ben Sasse is ass.""

The demonstration was filmed by reporters for the Alligator, a campus newspaper.

The shouting from the protesters drowned out Sasse's responses, and the Q&A session was cut short 15 minutes ahead of schedule, according to the Alligator.

“Obviously, I wish they didn’t have the position they have, but I strongly support the right of people to protest,” Sasse said. “I don’t precisely welcome the protesters, but I intellectually and constitutionally happily welcome the protesters.”

The protest was reportedly organized by the Alachua County Labor Coalition, Graduates Assistants United, the UF Young Democratic Socialists, United Campus Workers UF, UF College Democrats, and Take Action Florida.



After the forum ended and Sasse and the moderator, student body President Lauren Lemasters, left the room, the protesters entered and took the stage.

“If you see Ben Sasse, shout at him,” a protester said from the stage. “Scare the s**t out of him.”

“Get the f**k out of our swamp,” they gleefully chanted.

Sasse went on to participate in another Q&A session with staff and the presidential search committee, though this one was livestreamed and there was no audience. The protests continued until this final session ended.

The two-term senator was later seen being escorted into a waiting car by the University Police Department, the Alligator reported.



Sasse was announced as the sole finalist to be the University of Florida's next president on Thursday. He was the unanimous choice of the university's presidential search committee. News of his possible resignation from the Senate was first reported by KFAB-FM radio host Ian Swanson, who was employed by the Nebraska senator's office from October 2020 to February 2021.

In a statement last week, Sasse expressed admiration for the University of Florida and said the school was ""uniquely positioned to lead this country through an era of disruption.""

But students objected to Sasse's conservative voting record and statements defending traditional marriage. They also criticized him for only taking pre-approved questions at the Q&A forum.

“I think he’s a coward,” public relations junior Grace Smith, 20, told the Alligator. ""As a queer student, I think his presence is a threat to my well-being here, and if he actually becomes president, he won’t live a day of peace.”

“He doesn’t represent who we are,” 19-year-old design sophomore Jazlyn Rivero said. “That’s why I’m here to protest the ridiculousness of this candidate.”

In 2015, Sasse criticized the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which established a constitutional right of same-sex marriage. He called the decision a ""disappointment to Nebraskans who understand that marriage brings a wife and husband together so their children can have a mom and dad"" and said the court had overstepped its authority.

Dr. Paul Ortiz, a history professor, spoke at the protest and condemned Sasse for comments he made in August raising concerns about Chinese espionage in America to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Sasse, an expert on Chinese theft of intellectual property and cybersecurity, has called the Chinese Communist Party an ""unparalleled security threat to the American people.""

Ortiz characterized Sasse's position as anti-Asian and accused him of failing to draw a distinction between the Chinese state and individuals.

“The senator invokes the principle of collective punishment to imply that no one from China can be trusted,” Ortiz said.

Freshman chemical engineering student Joshua Zeffren, 18, said the protest was a success because it forced Sasse to leave.

“He’s gone,” he told the Alligator. “It means we as a student body accomplished something. It means when we get together we can show administration that our voice matters.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ben-sasse-protested-u-florida,2022-10-11
Left-wing member of Loudoun County School Board abruptly resigns as district faces scrutiny over sexual assault cases,"Beth Barts, a prominent left-wing member of the Loudoun County School Board, abruptly announced Friday that she was stepping down from her position.

The development comes as the Loudoun County School Board faces intense criticism over its handling of two sexual assault cases. The school board has also generated national attention in recent months as parents fight back against COVID-19 policies, transgender issues, and controversial lessons about race.

What did Barts say?

Barts announced her resignation through her Facebook page Friday afternoon.

""This was not an easy decision or a decision made in haste. After much thought and careful consideration, it is the right decision for me and my family,"" Barts wrote.

Barts added that she is ""grateful to have had a role in empowering students"" and is ""especially proud to have participated in helping steer the Loudoun County School System through the uncharted waters of educating students throughout a global pandemic.""

Barts said her resignation will be effective Nov. 2.

What is the background?

Barts was elected to the school board in November 2019, meaning she served almost half of the four-year term. Despite school board elections being nonpartisan, Barts had received support from the Loudoun County Democratic Committee.

Barts' tenure was controversial, and she had faced censure from other board members. The Washington Post explained:

The board voted first to reprimand, then to formally censure Barts — and finally to remove her from school committees — for violating school board rules during some of her interactions with county residents and through her posts on social media. Other board members called her behavior inflammatory.



In a school board document from early this year, chair Sheridan wrote that Barts ""fail[ed] to put student interest first"" and ""to show respect for fellow board members.""

As the Post further noted, Barts' resignation came ""shortly before she was due to face a trial in the recall campaign against her.""

Barts, in fact, found herself at the center of a recall effort that sought to remove several school board members over their membership in an online group that tracked parents who opposed the inclusion of critical race theory in school curriculum and parents who supported in-person learning.

Ian Prior, the executive director of Fight for Schools — the group leading the recall effort — praised Barts' resignation.

""This could not have been an easy decision for Ms. Barts. We have made known our displeasure with her actions as a school board member over the past several months, but today she has done the right thing,"" Prior said in a statement. ""Her former colleagues should take notice.""

""The community should know, however, that the problems at Loudoun County Public Schools and on the school board go well beyond one school board member. We will continue to shine a light on Loudoun County Public Schools and will keep fighting until we have a school board of common sense, non-partisan members and a superintendent who is accountable to parents and tells the truth,"" Prior added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beth-barts-resigns-loudoun-county-school-board,2021-10-16
Beto O'Rourke rolls out LGBTQ plan that would force schools to allow boys onto girls' sports teams,"Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke has unveiled a comprehensive plan aimed at helping the LGBTQ community. Within it, he endorses a law that would — in the name of ""equality"" — force public schools into allowing biological male athletes to compete against girls in team sports.

What are the details?

O'Rourke's LGBTQ platform lays out a framework for granting special treatment to LGBTQ individuals through a laundry list of executive, legislative, and global initiatives. In order ""to ensure full equality,"" the plan states, the Equality Act must become law.

The House of Representatives passed the Equality Act in May. According to the Daily Caller, ""among other things, the bill would force public schools to expand female athletic teams to include biological males who identify as transgender girls.""

But several female athletes say that provision of the Equality Act actually makes things less equal for girls and women in sports. Tennis Hall of Famer Martina Navratilova, Olympic gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross, and former track star Doriane Coleman wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in April pointing out that allowing biological men to compete athletically against women defeats the purpose of having separate competitions for male and female genders.

""The reality is that putting male- and female-bodied athletes together is co-ed or open sport,"" the women wrote. ""And in open sport, females lose.""

Navratilova, Richards-Ross, and Coleman argued that passing the Equality Act would effectively dismantle hard-fought equal rights for female athletes under Title IX, which requires schools to provide the same opportunities for girls as they do for boys.

Those rights are already being chipped away, as males who identify as females have started dominating in high school athletics where they are allowed to compete against biological girls. O'Rourke's plan would strip that longstanding gender division in sports.

The O'Rourke campaign refused to comment on the issue when asked by the Daily Caller.

Anything else?

In addition to endorsing passage of the Equality Act, O'Rourke's comprehensive LGBTQ plan would ""allow migrants seeking asylum to qualify as a 'vulnerable population' if they are gay,"" Reuters reported.

The former lawmaker would also create ""a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTQ+ people with the Department of State,"" according to his campaign.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-lgbtq-plan-boys-on-girls-teams,2019-06-13
Beto O'Rourke promises to strip churches of tax-exempt status if they don't support gay marriage,"Long-shot Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke made an admission during a CNN town hall event on LGBTQ policies that is sure to be featured on many Republican political ads.

O'Rourke affirmed that he would strip churches and other organizations of their tax-exempt status if they refused to support the LGBT cause by opposing same-sex marriage.

CNN's Don Lemon asked O'Rourke how far the government should punish organizations for following traditional religious beliefs about marriage.

""This is from your LGBTQ plan, and here's what you write, here's a quote, 'Freedom of religion is a fundamental right but it should not be used to discriminate,'"" Lemon said.

""Do you think religious institutions, like colleges, churches, charities, should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?"" Lemon asked.

""Yes,"" O'Rourke said simply to a loud applause from the LGBTQ audience.

""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for any one or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,"" O'Rourke added.

""And so as as president, we're gonna make that a priority,"" he said, ""and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the civil rights of our fellow Americans.""

Fans turn on Bette Midler when she defends women from 'inclusive' trans agenda: 'Don't let them erase you!',"Actress Bette Midler sent her woke fans into an outrage on Monday when she defended women against the onslaught of the transgender agenda that says biological men can be women.

What did Midler say?

Declaring independence from the increasingly aggressive trans agenda, Midler said that women are ""being stripped"" of everything that makes them unique.

""WOMEN OF THE WORLD! We are being stripped of our rights over our bodies, our lives and even of our name! They don’t call us 'women' anymore; they call us 'birthing people' or 'menstruators', and even 'people with vaginas'!"" Midler tweeted.

""Don’t let them erase you! Every human on earth owes you!"" she added.

Midler did not specify whom she meant by ""they,"" but she was presumably referring to activists and organizations that demand everyone uses ""inclusive"" language. Such language claims that biological men can also be women and undergo the same experiences that are unique to women.

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood made it clear they believe that ""abortion care"" is not limited to women.

What was the reaction?

Midler's tweet generated fierce backlash from people who believe she is promoting discrimination and — gasp — ""transphobia.""

The actress was even accused of being a ""TERF,"" or trans-exclusionary radical feminist, a term that pro-trans advocates call women who believe that calling a biological man/transgender woman a ""woman"" erodes the true meaning of femininity.

""Bette. Don’t be a TERF. Don’t make us boycott Hocus Pocus 2,"" journalist Kris Vire said.

""SAD NEWS: Macy Gray & Bette Midler have come out as TERFs. Unfollow, un-support, and unsubscribe,"" journalist Ernest Owens said.

""F*** Bette Midler too. It’s all of us or it’s none of us. We don’t get there with transphobic nonsense,"" Imani Barbarin said.

""No one is trying to erase women with inclusive language about people who need abortion care. No one is calling you anything but what you prefer. You should extend that courtesy in return,"" author Roxane Gay reacted.

""No one is trying to erase women with inclusive language about people who need abortion care. No one is calling you anything but what you prefer. You should extend that courtesy in return,"" author Roxane Gay reacted. ""Suddenly I don’t want Hocus Pocus 2 anymore…… Really shocked to see she has fallen into this Voldemort way of thinking,"" YouTuber Roly West said.

""Oh Christ almighty you bought this bulls***,"" journalist Katelyn Burns complained.

""Of course she's a TERF,"" activist Wagatwe Wanjuki said.



Transgender journalist India Willoughby even accused Midler of promoting ""fascist propaganda"" disseminated by foreign intelligence agencies and claimed Midler has adopted tactics used by Joseph Stalin and chief Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bette-midler-defends-women-trans-agenda,2022-07-05
Bible museum puts up transgender Jesus exhibit,"A German bible museum has created a controversial exhibit that displays Jesus Christ as being transgender.

""For some years now, society has been opening up to non-binary gender concepts. We sometimes have heated debates about gender-equitable language. It seems to be one of the burning issues of our time. Take a look at the diversity of gender identities from biblical and modern times and find a divine answer that fits all questions: You are good as you are,"" the museum's website says.

The Bibelhaus Frankfurt displays three artifacts from its transgender Jesus exhibit on their website including a 3,000-year-old clay statue of the Sumerian goddess Asherah, an image of the ""new Adam,"" and a statue of Austrian drag queen singer Conchita Wurst, real name Thomas Neuwirth, according to Fox News.

The artifacts are presented to suggest the more gender-fluid attitudes of ancient societies during biblical times.

""Is what we call God fluid between the sexes?"" Angela Dorn, Hessian minister for science and art, asks in the museum's greeting to visitors.

In addition to the exhibit, the Bible museum also hosted a play entitled ""Jesus Queen of Heaven"" on Dec. 15, according to the Bibelhaus website.

Grußwort von Angela Dorn zur Ausstellung ""G*tt w/m/d - Geschlechtervielfalt seit biblischen Zeiten"" youtu.be

Originally written by English playwright Jo Clifford in 2009, the play tells the story of Jesus Christ, but through the lens of being a transgender woman.

""I had been brought up as a Christian and taught that when you’re unsure of what to do, you should try to think, ‘What would Jesus do?’ I thought, ‘Well, what would Jesus do if Jesus came back to earth now and was me, a trans woman? What would she do and what would she say?’ That was the origin of the play,"" Clifford said in an interview with Dazed.

The museum has drawn some harsh criticism from world-famous evangelist Franklin Graham, who blasted the idea of a transgender Jesus.

The Samaritan's Purse founder called the idea of LGBT- friendly themes in the Bible a lie.

""When homosexuality is mentioned in the Bible, it is sin — rebellion against God and associated with His judgment. Any suggestion that Jesus Christ is transgender is not only false, it’s just sick,"" Graham said in a statement to Fox News on Wednesday.

Graham concluded that there could be no confusion that God chose to reveal himself to humanity as a man based on the biblical accounts found in the Gospels.

""The Bible doesn’t leave any confusion or uncertainty over how God has revealed Himself to us,"" Graham told Fox News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bible-museum-puts-up-transgender-jesus-exhibit,2021-12-17
Passports go woke: Biden admin will begin issuing gender-neutral passports with 'X' as gender,"United States passports are becoming inclusive.

Beginning in April, American citizens will be able to select ""X"" for their gender on applications for U.S. passports, the Biden administration announced Thursday.

What are the details?

According to the State Department, nonbinary American citizens or those who do not conform to traditional gender expression will be able to select ""X"" as their gender for their passport beginning April 11.

""We are committed to promoting the freedom, dignity, and equality of all people — including LGBTQI+ individuals,"" the State Department's website states. ""We are taking further steps toward demonstrating this commitment to better serve all U.S. citizens, regardless of gender identity.""

Jessica Stern — the U.S. special envoy to advance the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons — claimed the ""issuance of X gender markers on U.S. passports does not create new definitions nor rights"" because the policy change ""recognizes the true identity of the passport holder.""

""The lived realities of transgender, intersex, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming persons reflect that there is a wider spectrum of humanity than is represented by a binary sex designation on passports,"" Stern claimed.

However, passports, which are property of an issuing government, are not designed to be a form of self-expression. Rather, they are issued by countries to verify the identity of international travelers and provide critical information about the passport holder.

Anything else?

The announcement about passports was made as the Biden administration celebrated March 31 as ""Transgender Day of Visibility.""

Coinciding with the rollout of gender-neutral passports, the Biden administration announced the Transportation Security Administration would implement numerous changes to promote gender inclusivity, including enhanced security screening technology to ""improve the experience of travelers, particularly those who are transgender and non-binary travelers.""

The administration also disclosed that officials are pushing airlines to use and accept the ""X"" gender designation.

Aside from travel, the Department of Health and Human Services also released a document promoting ""gender-affirming"" health care for children, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and irreversible surgeries on genitals and reproductive organs.

Top Biden official says admin supports forcing businesses to 'engage in speech' they 'disagree' with,"The White House admitted Monday that the Biden administration believes the government should be allowed to compel businesses to express speech they disagree with.

At the White House press briefing, a reporter asked press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, the case that the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for on Monday. The case centers on whether public accommodation laws that compel artists to violate their religious beliefs violate the First Amendment.

At first, Jean-Pierre claimed the Biden administration supports both free speech and anti-discrimination. But she followed up by endorsing government-forced speech.

""The administration believes that every person — no matter their sex, race, religion, or who they love — should have the equal access to society, including access to products and services on the same terms as other members of public,"" she said.



Then, noting that the Justice Department believes ""non-discrimination public accommodations laws have coexisted with the First Amendment,"" she claimed, ""We can require businesses open to public to service people, regardless of their backgrounds, even when that means businesses must incidentally engage in speech which they disagree upon.""

Jean-Pierre added that there ""is no reason to upend this balance right now.""

12/05/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

The final remark suggests the Biden administration wants the Supreme Court to rule against the Colorado website developer who is seeking the protection of her religious expression under the First Amendment.

But the truth is that, in Colorado at least, there is no balance between public accommodation laws and First Amendment protections.

This is the second case on the issue from Colorado to make it to the Supreme Court. In the first case, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of cake baker Jack Phillips. The ruling, however, was narrow and did not directly address the broader questions related to public accommodation laws. The case now before the court will (probably) finally provide an answer.

At any rate, the First Amendment's free exercise and establishment clauses generally protect Americans from government interference in their expressions of religious freedom. The Supreme Court permits only narrow exceptions.

And if oral arguments on Monday are any indication of how the court will rule in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, Colorado's public accommodations law and others like it do not make the cut.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-speech-businesses-disagree-with,2022-12-06
Biden admin threatens Texas after Gov. Abbott calls pro-trans procedures for minors 'child abuse',"The Biden administration threatened Texas on Wednesday with “immediate action” over the state’s decision to investigate parents who permit children to undergo life-altering procedures to affirm transgender identity.



What is the background?

Last month, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) directed the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to conduct an investigation into parents who allow their minor children to undergo ""so-called 'sex change' procedures.""

""Texas law imposes reporting requirements upon all licensed professionals who have direct contact with children who may be subject to such abuse, including doctors, nurses, and teachers, and provides criminal penalties for failure to report such child abuse,"" the directive stated. ""There are similar reporting requirements and criminal penalties for members of the general public.""

Abbott's directive came after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton determined that such medical procedures ""constitute child abuse under existing Texas law.""

What is Biden doing?

President Joe Biden released a statement on Wednesday claiming Texas has launched ""a cynical and dangerous campaign targeting transgender children and their parents.""

""This is government overreach at its worst,"" Biden claimed, before regurgitating the left's view of child transgender identity.

""Affirming a transgender child’s identity is one of the best things a parent, teacher, or doctor can do to help keep children from harm, and parents who love and affirm their children should be applauded and supported, not threatened, investigated, or stigmatized,"" Biden said.

The Department of Health and Human Services then issued new guidance that said placing restrictions on health care that affirms children who believe they are transgender likely violates federal civil rights laws.

""HHS will take immediate action if needed,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. ""I know that many youth and their supportive families are feeling scared and isolated because of these attacks. HHS is closely monitoring the situation in Texas, and will use every tool at our disposal to keep Texans safe.""

Becerra did not disclose what that ""action"" may be. However, the HHS simultaneously published more guidance on patient privacy, the illegality of denying health care based on gender identity, and a memorandum demanding states to ""use their child welfare systems to advance safety and support for LGBTQI+ youth.""

In the world of COVID restrictions enacted by governments on children, guidance also published by HHS' Office of Civil Rights ironically said that blocking parents from making health care decisions creates a ""chilling effect."" The ""chilling effect"" apparently only applies to LGBT issues.

Anything else?

Pro-LGBT forces in Texas have already notched a win in their battle against Abbott's order.

Biden administration allows LGBTQ flags at US embassies,"The Biden administration has given blanket authorization to fly LGBT pride flags at U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. The rainbow flag — a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride — will be permitted to fly on the same official flagpoles that fly the American flag.

The new policy was announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which repeals the decision by his predecessor Mike Pompeo during former President Donald Trump's tenure at the White House.

U.S. diplomatic outposts are given ""blanket written authorization ... to display the Pride flag on the external-facing flagpole, for the duration of the 2021 Pride season,"" the cable said, according to ABC News. The cable was reportedly sent out this week, a little more than a month before Pride Month is celebrated in June and only weeks before International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia on May 17.

According to the cable, the Biden administration recognized that the LGBT gesture could be seen as inflammatory in certain countries.

""The cable contained a hedge, though, saying the authorization is not a requirement and chiefs of mission who run each embassy or consulate can choose whether to fly the Pride flag or showcase other symbols connoting support for LGBTQ rights based on what is 'appropriate in light of local conditions,'"" as reported first by Foreign Policy.

""As a matter of policy, the United States does not advocate for or against same-sex marriage abroad,"" the confidential cable reportedly stated, adding that American outposts are encouraged to back ""efforts to advance the fundamental freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly, and association ... Discussions of same-sex marriage may result in backlash against LGBTQI+ communities in certain contexts hence posts should consult with local advocates on messaging and outreach on this issue.""

During his confirmation hearing in January, Blinken said, ""I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQ people is something that the (State) Department is going to take on and take on immediately,"" At the time, Blicken also promised to quickly fill the empty position of LGBTI envoy, which he declared to be ""a matter, I think, of some real urgency.""

The State Department provided a comment to the New York Post on the policy reversal, ""President Biden believes that America's strength is found in its diversity. America is stronger, at home and around the world, when it is inclusive.""

""Recognizing that each country context is different, U.S. embassies and consulates develop individual plans to raise awareness of violence, human rights abuses, and discrimination targeting LGBTQI+ persons, including appropriate exterior displays,"" the statement said.

The Trump administration permitted U.S. outposts to display LGBT signaling on other parts of the properties after getting permission from the State Department's Office of Management, but forbid any flags from flying on the same pole as Old Glory. In 2019, several American embassies defied the Trump administration's order and flew LGBT flags in honor of Pride Month. The U.S. embassy in South Korea hung a massive LGBT flag and Black Lives Matter flag on the facade of the building, but later removed them after orders from the State Department.

In 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence defended the adjudgment to not allow the sexuality-related flag to be flown next to the Stars and Stripes. ""As the president said on the night we were elected, we're proud to be able to serve every American,"" he told NBC News. ""We both feel that way very passionately, but when it comes to the American flagpole, and American embassies, and capitals around the world, one American flag flies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-lgbtq-flags-embassies,2021-04-24
Biden blasted at LGBT forum for previously calling Vice President Pence a 'decent guy',"Democratic presidential frontrunner and former vice president Joe Biden was called out during an LGBT forum on Friday, when a moderator questioned how the community could trust him after he referred to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

What are the details?

Biden was participating in an Iowa candidate's forum sponsored by GLAAD when he was questioned by Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist Lyz Lenz, who said, ""In 1994 you did voted for 'don't ask don't tell,' and in 1996 you voted for the Defense of Marriage Act. You did vote to repeal both of those, but you have also praised Vice President Mike Pence as a 'decent guy.'""

The audience booed in reaction to Lenz's last line. Biden responded to her, ""You're a lovely person.""

""I'm just asking the questions that people wanna know,"" Lenz replied, gaining loud applause.

""Alright, fire away,"" Biden responded. To which Lenz said, ""So, I guess it goes without saying Pence is opposed to LGBTQ rights, so, the question that arises from these is, how can LGBTQ people trust that you won't compromise on issues that put them at risk, in order to cross the aisle to people like Pence.""

Biden went on to tout his credentials as ""the first person nationally to come out"" in support of gay marriage.

Lenz bragged later on Twitter, ""As I was walking off the stage with @JoeBiden he said to me dryly, ""You're a real sweetheart."" She then told her followers, ""This is why,"" posting footage of their exchange.

On social media, folks were quick to note the fact that the forum's audience considered calling a political foe a ""decent guy"" was worthy of ridicule. T. Becket Adams of The Washington Examiner tweeted, ""I love that calling Mike Pence a 'decent guy' is lumped into the same category as voting for Don't Ask, Don't Tell and DOMA.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-blasted-at-lgbt-forum-for-previously-calling-vice-president-pence-a-decent-guy,2019-09-21
Biden says overturning Roe is a slippery slope to segregating LGBTQ kids in schools,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday suggested that if the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision is overturned and abortion rights are returned to the states, other rights could be next, including the right of LGBTQ students to attend school with straight kids.



In comments to reporters after delivering remarks on the economy, Biden addressed the leaked draft court majority opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization authored by Justice Samuel Alito that would overturn Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey — two landmark abortion cases. In his draft, Alito argues that abortion rights are ""not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions"" and cannot be found in the text of the Constitution.

The president criticized Alito's reasoning and made a slippery slope argument about how if ""extreme"" Republicans pass a law segregating LGBTQ children in schools, the court's draft opinion would presumably allow that.



""This reminds me of the debate with Robert Bork. Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights is because the government gave them to you,"" Biden told reporters.



Referring to his questioning of President Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in 1987, Biden said, ""I said, I believe I have the rights that I have not because the government gave them to me, which you believe, but because I'm just a child of God. I exist. I delegated, by joining this union here, to delegate some rights I have to the governments for social good.""

He claimed that Alito's draft opinion rejects an ""inherent right"" to privacy and suggested that overturning Roe could lead to other important court precedents being overturned. An example he reached for was Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 case where the court ruled 7-2 that a constitutional right to privacy is inferred from the Bill of Rights and that this right prevents states from making the use of contraception by married couples illegal.

""Griswold was thought to be a bad decision by Bork and my guess is the guys on the Supreme Court now,"" Biden said. ""What happens if you have [a state change] the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can't be in classrooms with other children? Is that legit under the way the decision is written?""

""What are the next things that are going to be attacked?"" Biden asked. ""Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history, in recent American history,"" he said.

In his draft opinion, Alito answers Biden's concerns, which were previously raised by Biden administration Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. In her brief for Dobbs — the case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban — Prelogar argued that overturning Roe could ""threaten the Court's precedents holding that the Due Process Clause protects other rights, including the rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage.""



Alito rejected this complaint. ""This is not correct for reasons we have already discussed,"" he wrote. ""As even the Casey plurality recognized, 'abortion is a unique act' because it terminates 'life or potential life.'"" Alito emphasized that ""abortion is 'inherently different from marital intimacy,' 'marriage,' or 'procreation.'""

""And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,"" Alito wrote.

Biden begins launch of promised commission to 'reform' the Supreme Court,"President Joe Biden has begun staffing his promised commission to ""reform"" the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary, an undertaking he vowed in October would go on to address court packing as well as ""a number of other things.""

What are the details?

The commission — which is to be housed under the purview of the White House Counsel's office and chaired by Biden campaign lawyer Bob Bauer — ""is indeed moving ahead [with] some members have already been selected,"" Politico reported Wednesday.

Those reportedly added to the commission so far include Cristina Rodríguez, a Yale Law School professor and a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Obama Justice Department; Caroline Fredrickson, the former president of the American Constitution Society; and Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and a former assistant attorney general in the Bush Department of Justice.

Politico noted that while Rodríguez's opinions on court reforms are ""less clear,"" Fredrickson, on the other hand, has been rather vocal about her support for ideas like court packing.

""I often point out to people who aren't lawyers that the Supreme Court is not defined as 'nine person body' in the Constitution, and it has changed size many times,"" she reportedly told Eric Lesh, the executive director of the LGBT Bar Association, in 2019.

Goldsmith, for what it's worth, may serve as a check on any radical progressive agenda. According to Politico, though he was not a Trump supporter, he did back Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination.

What's the background?

Back in October when Biden announced his intentions to launch the commission, he was embroiled in controversy due to his refusal to answer whether or not he would pack the Supreme Court in response to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's nomination.

""It's not about court packing,"" Biden claimed regarding the forthcoming commission during a ""60 Minutes"" interview. ""There's a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated and I've looked to see what recommendations that commission might make.'

""There's a number of alternatives that go well beyond packing,"" he added. ""The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football — whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.""

Whether or not adding seats to the Supreme Court will come as a result of the commission remains to be seen, but conservatives may still be concerned over its formulation in the first place.



As Hot Air's Ed Morrissey aptly points out, despite Biden's insistence that the commission will be bipartisan, ""there's only party demanding changes to the top court's structure"" — and it's not the Republican Party.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-staffing-court-reform-commission,2021-01-27
Biden administration considering adding a third gender option for federal IDs,"The Biden administration expressed openness Monday to the idea of adding a third gender option for federal identification documents, an action pushed by the American Civil Liberties Union so as to not discriminate against nonbinary people.

During Monday's White House press briefing, Jennifer Klein, executive director of the newly launched Gender Policy Council, signaled that the move could soon be in the works and may not require an executive order for implementation.

""Speaking of executive orders on gender equity, the president and the vice president campaigned during the election on giving a third gender option on federal government IDs to individuals who want them,"" a reporter asked. ""Does the president see value in signing an executive order to make that happen?""



In response, Klein said, ""I haven't looked yet to see whether that requires an executive order. I mean, I would note that we are very inclusive in our definition of gender, and we intend to address all sorts of discrimination and, you know, fight for equal rights for people, whether that's LGBTQ+ people, women, girls — men. So, you know, that's certainly something that we will look at. But I honestly don't know whether that requires an executive order.""

""It sounds like we'll have to just look into it a little bit more and see what's required, but it's a good question,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki then interjected.

The ACLU has pushed for the addition of a third gender option on federal IDs, in the form of an ""X"" designation, as a way to make nonbinary people feel ""safe"" and accepted. At least 14 states already offer a third gender option on state-issued driver's licenses.

The exchange came following the announcement that President Joe Biden intended to issue two more executive orders, adding to his ever-growing list of executive actions, and with them seeking to advance gender equality both domestically and globally.



The first order allows for the creation of the Gender Policy Council within the executive branch of government, while the second directs the Department of Education to review policies and guidelines changed by the Trump administration.

The Gender Policy Council, the White House explained in a fact sheet, is tasked with recommending to the president a ""government-wide strategy to address gender in policies, programs and budgets, and an annual report to measure progress on implementing the strategy.""

Its aim is the removal of ""systemic bias and discrimination"" from society, in general, by addressing ""structural barriers to women's participation in the labor force"" and decreasing ""wage and wealth gaps,"" along with several other actions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-third-gender-option-id,2021-03-09
Biden admin ties funds for school lunches to compliance with transgender mandates,"President Joe Biden's administration has moved forward with a new interpretation of Title IX anti-discrimination laws that could potentially strip federal funding for school lunches from schools that do not let transgender students use their preferred bathrooms or play on preferred sports teams.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it will interpret federal anti-discrimination law ""to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity."" Its decision is based on an executive order Biden signed after assuming office in January 2021, as well as the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which found that Title VII protections against sex discrimination extend to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

“As a result, state and local agencies, program operators and sponsors that receive funds from FNS must investigate allegations of discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation,” the USDA said in a May 5 statement, first reported by the Center Square. “Those organizations must also update their non-discrimination policies and signage to include prohibitions against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.”

What this means is that any recipients of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Services child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program, could lose federal funding if they do not comply with Biden's new interpretation of Title IX.

If, for instance, a school does not permit a boy who identifies as a girl to use the girls' restrooms or locker rooms, the school may lose access to the lunch program as a consequence. The same goes for school sports teams. This would be in line with the stated intention of the White House.

""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,"" the president's Jan. 20, 2021executive order reads.



The federal government is already receiving pushback from Republican governors. In a statement on Thursday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem accused Biden of holding school lunch money ""hostage"" and vowed to take legal action.



“President Biden is holding lunch money for poor Americans hostage in pursuit of his radical agenda. He is insisting that we allow biological males to compete in girls’ sports or else lose funding for SNAP and school lunch programs,” Noem said. “South Dakota will continue to defend basic fairness so that our girls can compete and achieve. I would remind President Biden that we have defeated him in litigation before and are ready to do so again. Mr. President, we’ll see you in court.”

""It is appalling that the Biden Administration is threatening to withhold food from disadvantaged children in order to advance a deranged political agenda – that Floridians have rejected. Sadly, this would not be the first time that Biden has pursued petty political score-settling to the detriment of Americans’ well-being,"" said Christina Pushaw, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).

She continued: ""We will not allow Biden to force Floridians to choose between children’s food and parents’ rights. That is the kind of 'decision' that a totalitarian regime would force upon its citizenry.

""The federal government has no authority to follow through on these threats, but Governor DeSantis will always remain vigilant in protecting Floridians from unconstitutional federal overreach.""

DeSantis, Noem, and other conservative governors have championed so-called Fairness in Womens Sports legislation, which prohibits gender-dysphoric males from competing in women's sports leagues.



The Biden administration maintains that LGBT people need protections from discrimination to ensure that all Americans have an equal and equitable access to government assistance.

“USDA is committed to administering all its programs with equity and fairness, and serving those in need with the highest dignity. A key step in advancing these principles is rooting out discrimination in any form – including discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,” Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a May 5 statement. “At the same time, we must recognize the vulnerability of the LGBTQI+ communities and provide them with an avenue to grieve any discrimination they face. We hope that by standing firm against these inequities we will help bring about much-needed change.”

The Department of Education is expected to release its own regulatory proposal on Title IX sometime in June. Politico reported that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will unveil new discrimination protections for transgender students as well as new rules for how schools must respond to sexual misconduct complaints. The Biden administration is also expected to reverse due process protections for those accused of sexual harassment enacted by the Trump administration.

Biden's 'non-binary' nuclear official who allegedly stole woman's suitcase accused once again of luggage theft,"Biden energy official Samuel Brinton has broke new ground this week by becoming the first openly so-called ""gender fluid"" government official to have been twice accused of stealing luggage.

Brinton, already scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 19 for having allegedly stolen a woman's designer suitcase in Minneapolis, has now been accused of stealing luggage at a Nevada airport.

What are the details?

Samuel Brinton is a nuclear engineer who serves as deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy at the Department of Energy.

Just days after a group of House Republicans demanded the Biden official's resignation, a felony warrant was issued for Brinton.

KLAS reported that Brinton has been charged with grand larceny with a value between $1,200 and $5,000. The Biden official allegedly stole luggage at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.

If convicted of this category B felony, Brinton could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000, reported Newsweek.

A 'weird kind of Batman'

According the the Biden Energy Department's website, Brinton identifies ""as gender-fluid and use[s] the pronouns they, them, and theirs.""



Brinton told an MIT publication that his ""husband"" thinks of him as a ""weird kind of of Batman. Why, you might ask? Because by day I work to save lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth from suicide, and by night I work to save the world from nuclear waste related environmental disaster.""

Only a ""weird kind"" of Batman would allegedly steal luggage on multiple occasions.

TheBlaze previously reported that Brinton admitted to taking a woman's Vera Bradley luggage, valued at around $2,325, from a baggage claim carousel at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in September.

The ""non-binary"" Biden official, who initially denied taking the woman's luggage, later claimed he had taken the suitcase accidentally on account of exhaustion.

Despite Brinton's suggestion that the alleged felony theft was accidental, the criminal complaint indicated that airport surveillance cameras caught the Sept. 16 incident on tape.

According to the complaint, footage shows Brinton taking ""a navy blue hard-sided roller bag"" from the carousel.

Although supposedly exhausted, Brinton then ""removed the blue bag's tag and put the bag tag in the handbag they were carrying"" and ""left the area at a quick pace.""

Investigators reportedly indicated that Brinton was also seen using the woman's suitcase on at least two other occasions.

Brinton faces five years for this particular crime if convicted.

On leave but not altogether gone

After the initial accusation, Brinton was quietly put on leave.

An Energy Department spokesman told Fox News in November that ""Sam Brinton is on leave from DOE, and Dr. Kim Petry is performing the duties of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition.""

Petry reportedly told coworkers she had been asked to stay on ""for the foreseeable future.""

The New York Post reported that a group of House Republicans called for Brinton's removal Tuesday in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.

The letter notes that the department ""issued notice that Sam Brinton was placed on leave without providing crucial context clarifying that Brinton's recent employment status was the result of a felony charge.""

The Republicans suggested that as ""an appointed official, Sam Brinton represents both your Department and the United States. It is simply not possible for an individual to represent American values and simultaneously violate the felony laws of the land.""

""Brinton’s actions, along with your Department’s lack of transparency when dealing with this matter, reflect poorly on the Department of Energy, and they raise concern as to the Biden Administration’s priorities when appointing high-ranking officials. It is imperative that we do not allow a person charged with a felony to influence America’s policies,"" they added.

The letter concluded with a demand for Brinton's resignation and a plea for the department to ""set aside petty politics and appoint only the most qualified and dedicated individuals to influence America’s energy sector.""

The Daily Mail reported that Brinton has found ways to occupy himself in the meantime.

In late November, Brinton reportedly presented a seminar in Los Angeles entitled, ""Spanking: From Calculus to Chemistry.""

Brinton's profile on CLAW Corp.'s website reportedly noted that he had been teaching his ""Physics of Kink"" class on campuses across the country for years. According to his bio, Brinton has ""been active in the kink world since 2013, host monthly kink parties in their dungeon in Washington, DC, and estimate they have spanked over 2,000 cute butts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bidens-non-binary-nuclear-official-who-allegedly-stole-womans-suitcase-accused-again-of-luggage-theft,2022-12-09
Bill could make California a sanctuary state for 'gender-affirming health care' for kids,"A California legislative committee is currently considering a bill that would make California a sanctuary state for children throughout the country otherwise forbidden to receive transgender treatment and surgery in their home states.

The bill, introduced by state Senator Scott Wiener back in March, would prohibit health care providers — including contractors and insurance companies — from cooperating in interstate legal battles regarding the transgender care of a child.

""This bill would prohibit a provider of health care, a health care service plan, or a contractor,"" the bill reads, ""from releasing medical information related to sensitive services or related to a person or entity allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health care in response to a criminal or civil action, including a foreign subpoena, based on another state's law that authorizes a person to bring a civil or criminal action against a person or entity that allows a child to receive gender-affirming health care.""

The bill also expressly prohibits state law enforcement agencies from ""intentionally"" apprehending individuals wanted in other states for helping children receive transgender treatment.

Because such cases are so often intertwined in contentious child custody battles, the bill would also require law enforcement to disregard court orders issued in other states that authorize ""a child to be removed from their parent or guardian based on that parent or guardian allowing their child to receive gender-affirming health care.""

In such cases, the bill claims that a state court would ""take temporary jurisdiction because a child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care.""

Though the state Senate passed the bill earlier this year, the state Assembly has not, thus sending the bill back to committee, where it was discussed on Tuesday.



Back in 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that created ""a nonbinary gender category on California birth certificates, drivers' licenses, identity cards, and gender-change court orders"" and made the application for gender identity changes much easier, according to the University of California San Francisco LGBT Resource Center. Now, the state legislature will determine whether to expand those gender identity changes to children who cross state lines to receive transgender care in California.

Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the idea. Chloe Cole, 17, testified to the committee that the so-called gender transition care she received to transition her into a male earlier in her teens instead left her scarred for life.

""I will never be able to breastfeed a child. I have blood clots in my urine. I am unable to fully empty my bladder. I do not yet know if I'm capable of carrying a child to full term,"" Cole, who has since detransitioned, said.

She then pleaded with the committee not to pass the bill: ""SB 107 is circumventing states' laws that have needed safeguards in place so my story is not repeated. Children cannot consent.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-california-transgender-kids,2022-06-29
"Progressives blast Bill Maher as 'transphobic' for saying it's 'trendy' to be LGBTQ, declaring children transitioning to transgender is not science-based","Bill Maher dared to discuss the sacred cow of transgenderism – which instantly caused progressives to attack the liberal talk show host.

During Friday night's episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" the HBO host discussed a Gallup poll about the increase of Americans identifying as LGBT.

The survey found, ""The percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or something other than heterosexual has increased to a new high of 7.1%, which is double the percentage from 2012, when Gallup first measured it.""

The Gallup poll published in February said that each generation had increased by around double from the previous generation. There were 0.8% who identify as LGBT in the Silent Generation, 2.6% of Baby Boomers, 4.2% of Gen X, 10.5% of Millennials, and 20.8% of Generation Z.

Maher hypothesized that some of the massive increase in people identifying as LGBTQ could be because it is currently ""trendy"" to be considered as such.

“Yes, part of the rise in LGBT numbers is from people feeling free enough to tell it to a pollster and that’s all to the good, but some of it is — it’s trendy,” Maher said.



Maher said, ""I'm just saying when things change this much, this fast, people are allowed to ask, 'What's up with that?' All the babies are in the wrong bodies?""

Maher questioned a recent statement by the American Civil Liberties Union that listed groups that would suffer ""disproportionately harm"" by abortion bans. The ACLU did not name women, but did mention ""black, Indigenous, other people of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, young people, those working to make ends meet, and people with disabilities.""

Maher asked, ""Abortion rights affects gay and trans people more than you know – breeders?""

""I'm happy for LGBT folks that we now live in an age where they can live their authentic lives openly, and we should always be mindful of respecting and protecting,"" Maher stated. ""But someone needs to say it. Not everything's about you.""

Maher moved on to children transitioning – which he described as ""literally experimenting on children.""

He noted, ""Maybe that's why Sweden and Finland have stopped giving puberty blockers to kids because we just don't know much about the long-term effects, although common sense should tell you that when you reverse the course of raging hormones, there's going to be problems.""

Maher then listed the potential health risks of puberty blockers for children.

Maher then highlighted that no gay men were selected as a Grand Marshall for the upcoming New York City Pride Parade. ""That’s where we are now – gay men are not hip enough for a Gay Pride Parade,"" he said.

Maher pointed out that the ""prime directive"" of teens is to do ""anything to shock and challenge the squares who brought you up. It’s why nobody gets a nose ring at 56.""

""If you attend a small dinner party of typically very liberal, upper-income Angelenos, it is not uncommon to hear parents who each have a trans kid having a conversation about that,"" Maher stated, then asked, ""What are the odds of that happening in Youngstown, Ohio?""

Maher inquired, ""If this spike in trans children is all-natural, why is it regional?""

""Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them,"" he continued. ""If we can't admit that in certain enclaves, there was some level of trendiness to the idea of being anything other than straight, then this is not a serious, science-based discussion. It's a blow being struck in the culture wars using children as cannon fodder.""



Maher cited Dr. Erica Anderson – a ""prominent"" transgender clinical physiologist – who believes some children are identifying as transgender due to the ""influence of their peers and social media.""

Maher explained that children are not just ""gender-fluid,"" but ""fluid about everything."" He added, ""If kids knew what they wanted to be at age 8 – the world would be filled with cowboys and princesses.""

Maher joked, ""If you are a man who wants to experience life without a pair of balls, you do not have to get surgery, you can get married.""

New Rule: Along for the Pride | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO) www.youtube.com

According to multiple Twitter reactions, Maher's monologue about LGBTQ enraged progressives. They lashed out and labeled the liberal talk show host ""transphobic"" and a ""transphobe.""

A Twitter user accused Maher of spreading ""Gay Replacement Theory.""

One activist said Maher was ""spewing dangerous and hateful rhetoric.""

Some progressives demanded that HBO cancel ""Real Time with Bill Maher.""

There was at least one Twitter user insinuated that Maher be sentenced to death for the crime of being a transphobe.













Meanwhile, conservatives such as Jason Whitlock and Steve Deace applauded Maher's nuanced take on the dangers of children transitioning.

Biological male up for Emmy award for Best Lead Actress in a drama series: 'I feel so seen',"For the first time ever, a transgender actor is set to be considered for an Emmy award for a lead acting role in a prime-time series.

Mj Rodriguez, who was born a biological male but now identifies as a female following a gender transition, was nominated this week for Best Lead Actress in a Drama.

Should Rodriguez win the award when the winners are announced in September, it would mark the first time that a transgender actor has won an acting Emmy.

Rodriguez was nominated for a performance as ""house mother"" Bianca Rodriguez in the FX series ""Pose,"" a dramatization of New York City's underground drag ballroom culture in the 1980s and 1990s amid the rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The show, which has been celebrated for casting transgender actors to play transgender characters, scooped up 11 Emmy nominations over its first two seasons and this year is up for Best Drama Series.



In an interview with the Associated Press following the nomination, Rodriguez said, ""I felt so seen.""

""I felt represented and I felt seen,"" added the actor. ""And ... more accepted than I have felt in a long time. I felt like my colleagues now see me, my acting colleagues see me, and the people who are surrounded by the arts see me, and how much I want to give the world the love to my craft and my art.""

Rodriguez expressed similar sentiments during an interview with ExtraTV, saying, ""I feel so seen ... I cried something hard.""

""Additionally, the show's nomination for outstanding drama series, as well as Billy Porter's third nomination for outstanding lead actor in a drama series, mark a historic show that undoubtedly raised the bar for trans representation on television and changed the way viewers around the world understand the trans community,"" Ellis continued.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biological-male-emmy-lead-actress-nomination,2021-07-14
Catholic priest stands by Christian teachings after being condemned for rejecting Pride Month,"Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, triggered an avalanche of outrage over the weekend after he advised Christians against participating in events related to Pride Month because they promote a culture antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.

Now, Tobin has responded to outrage — and he is not backing down.

What triggered the outrage?

""A reminder that Catholics should not support or attend LGBTQ 'Pride Month' events held in June. They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Catholic faith and morals. They are especially harmful for children,"" Tobin wrote on Twitter.

The seemingly innocuous tweet that echoes traditional Christian values immediately generated outrage online, amassing nearly 100,000 responses by Tuesday.

What was the response?

The internet, along with Hollywood celebrities and politicians, rallied together to rebuke Tobin. Many voiced frustration over Tobin's claim that LGBT culture is ""harmful for children.""

""You know what's proven to be actually harmful to children..? The Catholic Church,"" one person said.

""A reminder of why religion is dangerous, sad & divisive. Doesn't your 'God' love everyone? And the track record of children being safe in the company of priests is hardly solid,"" another person said.

""Annnnd we wonder why there's a crisis in the Catholic Church. The countless accounts of sexual abuse by your priests is HARMFUL TO CHILDREN,"" another person wrote.

Actress Mia Farrow wrote:

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Hawaii) even chided Tobin:

While the vast majority of responses were of outrage toward Tobin, not all were negative.

""The Apostles were not silenced by the sin of Judas. All but one gave their lives for the sake of the Truth of Jesus Christ. His Excellency, Bishop Thomas Tobin has the courageous heart of the first Bishops. I stand with you, Your Excellency!"" one supporter wrote.

What is Tobin saying now?

In a statement, Tobin expressed regret that his tweet sowed division and became a national controversy. But he explained that his duty as priest is before God — not to abandon Christian teachings in order to capitulate to the whims of popular western culture.

Tobin wrote:

I regret that my comments yesterday about Pride Month have turned out to be so controversial in our community, and offensive to some, especially the gay community. That certainly was not my intention, but I understand why a good number of individuals have taken offense. I also acknowledge and appreciate the widespread support I have received on this matter.



The Catholic Church has respect and love for members of the gay community, as do I. Individuals with same-sex attraction are beloved children of God and our brothers and sisters.



As a Catholic Bishop, however, my obligation before God is to lead the faithful entrusted to my care and to teach the faith, clearly and compassionately, even on very difficult and sensitive issues. That is what I have always tried to do — on a variety of issues — and I will continue doing so as contemporary issues arise.



As the gay community gathers for a rally this evening, I hope that the event will be a safe, positive and productive experience for all. As they gather I will be praying for a rebirth of mutual understanding and respect in our very diverse community.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bishop-stands-strong-outrage-pride-month,2019-06-04
Black conservative student leader reportedly slapped several times by white student described as 'deranged leftist and LGBT activist',"A conservative student was repeatedly slapped by a fellow student at California State University, Sacramento, on Friday — an incident that was captured on video and stemmed from a dispute over an anti-abortion social media post, the Sacramento Bee reported.

The conservative student is black, and the student who reportedly slapped him is white.

What's the background?

Floyd Johnson II — a member of the Sacramento State College Republicans and its past president — said Keaton Hill on Thursday night commented on a mutual friend's anti-abortion Facebook post, saying, ""I hope that kid on your page dies of whatever cancer they have,"" the paper reported.

Johnson and Hill argued online, the Bee said, adding that Hill allegedly told Johnson to say whatever he had to say face-to-face.

As you wish

Johnson told the paper they had class together Friday morning — they're both seniors and political science majors — and that Hill said ""f*** you"" to Johnson while walking by him during class.

Johnson added to the Bee that he and a friend, Henry Seufert, confronted Hill just before noon in an academic building lobby — which is when Johnson started recording the showdown.

""What have I done?"" Johnson asked Hill, who also was holding a cellphone and apparently recording the interaction. Hill responded, ""You're harassing me,"" before making an angry face and slapping at Johnson.

""Whoa, that is not OK!"" Johnson told Hill. ""That is not OK! You cannot do that, that is battery, that is assault!""



The Bee said Seufert restrained Hill, who appeared to threaten Johnson.

""You're gonna end up f***in' dead!"" Hill hollered. The Bee said Hill slapped Johnson at least twice before walking away.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

The incident caught the attention of conservative figure and Second Amendment activist Kaitlin Bennett — known for posting a photo on Twitter the day after she graduated from Kent State University walking with an AR-10 on campus while carrying her ""Come and take it"" cap.



Bennett posted video of the altercation on Twitter and called Hill a ""deranged leftist and LGBT activist.""

Content warning: Language:

In response, Hill apparently recorded a disturbing video addressed to Bennett, calling her a ""bitch"" and saying he doesn't ""give a f*** about any of you Republicans who want to shame me for being the proud gay man that I am ... and you can kiss my butthole.""

Content warning: Language:

What did Hill have to say about the incident on campus?

""I felt a little intimidated and scared,"" Hill told KCRA-TV by phone. ""I think maybe my emotions got the best of me, and I tried to swipe the phone out of Floyd's hand. I never tried to hit him or anyone else. I just wanted him to stop recording me and leave me alone.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Hill also told student newspaper the State Hornet, ""I apologize for lunging at Floyd's phone, although I strongly emphasize that it was not without provocation.""



Johnson filed a report with university police against Hill, KCRA reported, adding that an email from the college says Hill has been directed by the school to not contact Johnson.

What else did Johnson have to say?

""I like the no-contact order because I do have class with him,"" Johnson told the station. ""I will have to go back into class and take a final. Thankfully, he's not going to be in the class with me to take that final. He'll be taking it in a different location. So I'm happy with that. My safety is protected in that regard.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

As for the incident with Hill, Johnson told the Bee he ""didn't choose to fight back because I'm 6-foot-5 and he's 5-foot-6 or 5-foot-7 or something. It really would have been unfair. And anyway, the way he was hitting me was open-handed. If he was connecting and actually hurting me, then I would have engaged with him, but in that moment I was more focused on videoing the incident and recording what was going on.""



More from the Bee:

Hill and Johnson were also involved in an altercation last year at a College Republicans event in response to the Stephon Clark shooting. In a video, Hill tried to slap the person recording a video and called him a homophobic slur while Johnson attempted to restrain an incensed student.

Hill told KCRA that the no-contact order also applies to Johnson: ""At this point, I would hope to never to see him again and that would be my resolution.""

"Black Lives Matter protests in Georgetown, Washington DC","Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrated in the residential and mostly liberal neighborhood of Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night. The demonstrators harassed people eating dinner, yelled homophobic slurs, and purposely tried their best to wake up every resident in the neighborhood. Not exactly the best recruiting methods to get people to support your cause.

Black Lives Matter protesters marched down the streets of residential Georgetown slightly before midnight on Saturday night and screamed, ""Wake your ass up!"" One person is seen using a megaphone and shrieking, ""If we don't get no justice, then you don't get no sleep!"" Others are banging metal pots to wake people up.









The group threatened to stay in front of the homes until the residents listened to them. The protesters called one of the residents a racist, and the resident replied, ""I am a person of color.""



The demonstrators protested in front of a strip of mostly LGBT-centered bars in Dupont Circle. Elijah Schaffer, BlazeTV host of ""Slightly Offens*ve"" and reporter, wrote, ""BLM protesting the gays. You can't make this stuff up.""



Reporter Ford Fischer, who was on the streets during the Black Lives Matter protests, said the demonstrators are the They/Them Collective, a self-described ""anarchist abolitionist"" group.

The protesters demanded people who were dining outside to raise their fists to ""declare your loyalty"" to black lives. A majority of diners raised their fists as the mob looked on. However, some of the diners did not raise their hands, and the group's leader attempted to intimidate them by calling them out. The group's leader said those who didn't raise their fists were ""racists"" who would be ""voting for Trump.""

The group also shouted a homophobic slur at people dining outdoors.

The leader instructed restaurants to kick out customers who don't align with the tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The situation escalated between the group's leader and a resident to the point a shoving match broke out.









The group even blocked a black man from going to his own home.



This isn't the first time that we've seen Black Lives Matter-affiliated groups use intimidation tactics. Last week, a Cuban immigrant said an activist group is threatening Louisville business owners with possible repercussions if they fail to submit to their list of social justice-related demands.

The Blacks Organizing Strategic Success organization created a ""Social Justice Rating System,"" where businesses are given a grade for how many of the demands they submit to.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-lives-matter-protests-georgetown-dc-video,2020-08-09
'We as a society have failed if we stand by': BlazeTV's Sara Gonzales shuts down Disney-themed drag show for kids,"A bar in Denton, Texas, had planned an all-ages drag event for September 11 entitled ""Cool Beans Drag Brunch: Disney Edition."" The event, open to children, would feature men dressed as scantily clad female Disney characters to whom children could give cash. The event was canceled owing to the initiative taken by BlazeTV's Sara Gonzales.

Upon looking into the event, Gonzales, the host of ""The News & Why It Matters,"" recognized that the Disney theme reflected a choice ""to immerse young children into drag queen culture by merging it with something all children love: Disney.""

Gonzales told TheBlaze that ""we as a society have failed if we stand by and watch mentally ill parents expose their children to these shows and think it's none of our business.""

The event and ones like it aren't merely unacceptable. Gonzales reckoned the exposure of ""young children to sexually explicit shows where men dress up like women and dance provocatively for money [to be] child abuse. And child abuse is everybody's business.""

Keen not to stand idly by, Gonzales took to Twitter on September 8, writing ""Cool Beans Bar and Grill in Denton, TX is hosting an ALL AGES drag show THIS SUNDAY. Who's coming with me to shut it down?""

Gonzales' post garnered thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets, generating sufficient pressure on the bar to cancel the event.

Among those who circulated Gonzales' call to action was former state Senator Don Huffines (R-Texas), who wrote ""The devil is coming for your kids. What are you going to do to stop this madness?""

Turning the tables: a successful protest

A Denton city council staff report indicated that on September 8, Mayor Gerard Hudspeth had sought information regarding the rights of businesses and what precisely the city could regulate. His office was reportedly advised that ""the City would not regulate an event such as this unless it met the definition of a special event under the code"" and that the Disney drag event was not ""a sexually oriented business under the City's zoning.""



While authorities could not have prevented the event, they did not necessarily help facilitate it amidst growing protest.

The Texas GOP suggested in a tweet that Sheriff Tracy Murphree had refused to provide security for the event, helping to ensure its cancellation.

Safety concerns were cited in the bar's Friday Facebook announcement as cause for the event's cancellation. ""Having a safe space that day, or any day, takes precedence over all else ... Our drag brunch has caught a lot of attention from certain political groups who have made it very clear that they aren't happy about this event,"" read the release. ""To those of you who have forced us to make this decision, shame on you! ... This is not a 'win' for you.""



The bar further alleged that it had received ""aggressive phone calls and hateful comments.""

What Cool Beans attributed to hatred, Gonzales characterized as justified moral outrage. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans do NOT agree with the sexualization of children,"" she said, ""but too many are scared of being called 'phobic' of something.""



She indicated further that the successful shutdown of this event is replicable, given the courage. ""Stop being afraid. We are the majority and we have to speak up and make it known before it's too late.""

What it took in this instance is what it will take every time: ""Call the businesses and let them know. Send them emails. Protests the events. Show up.""

Line in the sand

Drag shows involving and targeting children have become a new front in the culture wars.

The Idaho GOP suggested last week that these events, involving the ""imposition of adult sexuality & adult sexual appetites on children,"" are tantamount to ""the sexualization of children.""

Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar (R) wrote on Thursday that drag shows for kids are ""child sex abuse, plain and simple.""

While a host of Republicans have condemned the embroilment of children in drag events, some Democrats have gone beyond passively supporting them.

Scott Wiener, the Democratic state senator in California who introduced a bill keeping those who sodomized minors ten years their junior off of sex offender lists, quipped about incorporating ""Drag Queen 101"" into the K-12 curriculum.

New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) seriously endorsed drag queen story hour for kids in June.

The leftist magazine Salon published an article on June 30 that recommended exposing children to drag shows, because doing so ""starts the conversation about queer history, oppression, and activism"" and ""normalizes this diversity.""

""The left knows the way you make long-lasting, multi-generational changes in culture is to indoctrinate the youth,"" said Gonzales.

The normalization and exposure advocated in the Salon article is par for the course. ""Once they expose young children to the LGBT community, to being gender fluid, to men wearing dresses and appropriating women, they can normalize all of it.""

Gonzales referenced the influx of pornographic materials into schools and noted such material serves as a prong of the same attack on children.

As evidenced by the successful shutdown of the Disney drag event, the problem may be political in nature, but the solution is left up to individuals. ""If you want to save the morality this country has left for your children and your children's children, you have to speak out and you have to show up. Don't expect someone else to do it for you. The time is now.""

Neither the first nor the last to be shut down

This is not the first drag event targeting children that has been canceled due to protest and pressure in recent months.



A drag show planned for June 24, in which everyone including children were encouraged to bring money to give to the performers, was canceled after the Libs of TikTok account drew attention to the event.

After significant backlash, the Boise Pride Festival noted last week that it it would postpone its planned taxpayer-subsidized drag show sexualizing child performers.

Gonzales hinted on Twitter that after shutting down the Disney drag event in Denton, she would be turning her attention to Katy, Texas. On September 24, in Katy, Texas, the First Christian Church will be hosting an all-ages ""drag bingo"" event.

Phoenix denies Black Lives Matter street mural after request for a pro-police mural reading 'No one is above the law',"The city of Phoenix was considering allowing a Black Lives Matter mural to be painted, until they received a request for a massive pro-police mural too, and instead denied them both.

BLM activist Gizette Knight, who helped design the mural, is upset that the mural was denied, and organized a media briefing on Monday to pressure the city to reconsider the decision.

Two protesters appeared to signal their disapproval of the BLM mural proposal.



""What is important to note is that throughout my correspondence with either the mayor's office or with her administration, no one expressed to me verbally, electrically, or in writing, that non-standard markings on city streets are not allowed or present safety concerns,"" Knight said at the briefing.

The mural design would include the visages of civil rights leaders Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., César Chávez and John Lewis. Knight collected 2,500 signatures in support for her mural.

The denial came after the city received a similar request for a mural from Mark Spencer of Judicial Watch. Spencer, who is also a former president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, requested a mural to read, ""No one is above the law,"" painted in front of the Phoenix Police Department headquarters in downtown Phoenix.

The city denied both requests and told Knight that they did so because of safety considerations.

Knight said her group is preparing to sue Phoenix, and implied that the denial was motivated by racism.

""Every time Black people go to do something down here, we face adversity,"" she said, according to the Arizona Republic.

She said that the City Council should take a vote on whether to allow her mural and points to an LGBT crosswalk as precedence for the vote.

New book claims 80 percent of Vatican priests are gay,"An explosive new book claiming that the majority of Vatican clerics are gay is scheduled to be released on the same day that Pope Francis' sex abuse summit is set to begin in Vatican City.

The 570-page manuscript titled, ""In the Closet of the Vatican,"" written by French journalist Frederick Martel, alleges that 80 percent of the priests working at the Vatican are gay, although not all are sexually active.

Martel, who spent four years researching, reveals in his book, an unspoken code with ""one rule of thumb being that the more homophobic the cleric was, the more likely he was to be gay,"" The Guardian reported.

The book is a ""startling account of corruption and hypocrisy at the heart of the Vatican,"" according to its publisher Bloomsbury.

What are some of the book's claims?

""In the Closet,"" exposes the ""celibacy of priests, the condemnation of the use of contraceptives, countless cases of sexual abuse, the resignation of Benedict XVI, misogyny among the clergy, the dramatic fall in Europe of the number of vocations to the priesthood, the plotting against Pope Francis – all these issues are clouded in mystery and secrecy,"" Bloomsbury wrote on its website.

Martel claims that some gay priests have accepted their sexuality, while others have lived double lives while hiding their relationships with men or seeking high-risk encounters with male prostitutes. Still, others remain in denial about their homosexuality.

The book describes ""a clerical culture of secrecy which starts in junior seminaries and continues right up to the Vatican itself.""

However, it doesn't conflate the sexual of abuse of children with the homosexuality of the clerics.

Who did Martel interview for the book?

Martel reportedly completed 1,500 interviews with dozens of cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors or diplomatic officials, Swiss guards, and more than 200 priests and seminarians.

The author, who's openly gay, also spent about a week each month in Rome while conducting his research. He sometimes stayed in residences inside the Vatican or on Holy See property, according to the Catholic website, The Tablet.

What else?

The book is set to be released Feb. 21, in eight languages and across 20 countries.

The Vatican said its main aim of the summit Feb. 21-24 is to guarantee that bishops around the world ""clearly understand what they need to do to prevent and combat the worldwide problem of the sexual abuse of minors.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/book-claims-80-percent-vatican-priests-gay,2019-02-13
Boston City Council approves petition to allow juveniles to vote amid Democrat campaign to capture impressionable voting bloc,"Democrats continue to seek new voting blocs amid their declining support from working-class voters. Extra to looking for ways to confer voting rights upon illegal aliens and foreign nationals, some Democrats are seeking ways to add high-schoolers to their ranks.

The Boston City Council approved a petition last week to allow juvenile residents to vote in municipal elections. Critics have suggested that the petition, which may still be killed at the state level, may be less about suffrage and more about potential partisan gains.

What are the details?

In a 9-4 vote with leftists composing the majority, the Boston City Council approved a petition on Nov. 30 that would allow 16- and 17-year-old residents to vote in municipal elections.

The petition was sent to Democrat Mayor Michelle Wu's desk for approval.

The Boston Globe reported that the proposed law would grant local — not federal or state — voting rights to teenage citizens without felony convictions.

In addition to getting to vote in local elections, 16- and 17-year-old registrants will also be pre-registered to vote in state and federal elections upon turning 18.

The measure will go to the Massachusetts legislature for approval, which is anything but guaranteed. Previous attempts to give juveniles the vote in the state have failed in the state House.

Councilor Julia Mejia, a co-sponsor of the petition, told WGBH that ""young people are often the ones who are educating their parents and their peers and their family members about what is at stake when it comes to elections.""

Mejia also suggested that teens ""are working — oftentimes two jobs — just to help support their families, paying taxes and on the front lines protesting and trying to find ways to have their voices heard. And every day we make decisions on their behalf.""

She previously pointed to BLM as an example of what she regarded as positive politicking on the part of young people, illustrative of their ability to do more.

According to Mejia, teenagers not old enough to get into R-rated movies should not be denied a say on public policy.

According to Public School Review, public schools in Boston School District — full of the city's potential voters — have an average math proficiency score of 35% and reading proficiency score of 37%. The district's average testing ranking is 2/10.

Towards a possible Democrat pedocracy

Paul Craney, spokesman for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, told the Boston Globe that lowering the voting age ""just doesn't make sense.""

""You're asking adults to weigh their ballot compared to children. ... Even if you have some children that are really mature for that age, everyone can acknowledge that 16-, 17-year-olds are still developing,"" said Craney.

Craney flipped the progressive rhetoric, suggesting that he is ""all for getting them immersed in the democratic process,"" but as campaign volunteers rather than determiners of regional fate.

""I think there is a big, distinct difference [between that and] throwing ballots in front of them and asking them to make these decisions when they're minors,"" Craney added.

Hans von Spakovsky, former member of the Federal Election Commission and senior legal fellow in the Heritage Foundation's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told Just the News, ""This is a foolish, cynical move by Boston and other jurisdictions.""

""Under the law, 16- and 17-year-olds are minors. They can't sign contracts or leases, buy alcohol, join the military, serve on a jury, or engage in a host of other activities that only legal adults are qualified to engage in because we as a society have judged that they have not yet developed the experience and judgment to make such decisions,"" said Spakovsky. ""They aren't even treated as adults when they commit crimes, except under exceptional circumstances, for the very same reason.""

City Councilor Erin Murphy voted in the minority against the measure, suggesting that kids are more easily influenced than adults and that involving them at a younger age may compromise their privacy, since registered voters' records become public.

""I worry that certain kids would be influenced into voting for a certain candidate instead of really coming up with their own opinion,"" Murphy told WBTS.

At a hearing in March, Murphy expounded on this concern, reported WGBH.

""I worry as a parent. I’ve lived through raising three teenagers. They have a lot to offer. I think they’re full of wisdom and have lots of ideas and thoughts, but I also think that they’re very impressionable,"" said Murphy.

Murphy also intimated that the ability to vote at this age may not be so much a concern of 16- and 17-year-olds but rather of those keen to reap their votes.

""I have never heard from any 16- or 17-year-old directly. ... I am hearing from voting rights advocates who are adults, but I'm never hearing directly from children who say they want it,"" she added.

To benefit from naivety

The Deccan Herald reported that in the November 2022 election, youth voter turnout was huge, with 63% of the national youth vote choice for the U.S. House of Representatives going to Democrats.

Tufts' Center for Information and Research on Civic Leaning and Engagement recently broke down youth vote choice by sex and LGBT identification in the 2022 midterms: 71% of women and 53% of men ages 18-29 voted for a Democratic candidate.

Edison Research National Election Pool exit poll data showed that while youths were disproportionately inclined to vote Democrat, voters ages 30-44 were near-evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, and older voters favored Republicans.



It is therefore understandable why outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Rep. Nikema Williams (Ga.), and other federal Democrats have endeavored to find or introduce legal ways to register teenagers under the age of 18 to vote.

Boston promotes porn literacy program aimed at educating teens about healthy relationships,"The Boston Public Health Commission is promoting its Porn Literacy program aimed at educating teens on how to interpret easily-accessible X-rated content in order to teach what's real — and what's not — when it comes to adult relationships.

What are the details?

WBZ-TV hosted a segment Monday hailing the program, noting that some studies say up to 80 percent of kids see pornographic material by the time they reach the age of majority. The answer, they claim, is parent-approved classes that can teach adolescents about how to decipher such role-plays with a realistic lens.

The course is taught through BPHC's Start Strong program. Director Jess Alder explained to WBZ that the Porn Literacy program was the brainchild of a Boston University professor who first saw the need for such classes, and the curriculum has now been pared down to be ""palatable for our younger audience.""



Porn Literacy Program Educates Teens About Healthy Relationships www.youtube.com

Earlier this year, the New York Times Magazine covered the course and teens' thoughts on pornographic footage with great detail. Student participants shared their anxiety over measuring up to the adult performances played out on a screen, and discussed their feelings with peer participants along with a reporter.

The program isn't limited just to porn studies, however, the outlet clarified. It teaches students about ""healthy relationships, dating violence, and LGBT issues, often through group discussions, role-playing and other exercises.""

Anything else?

Part of the discussion surrounding pornography and kids is the fact that graphic content can crop up amid even the most innocent of internet searches. Acknowledging that reality, sites like Wired have oh-so-delicately declared: ""Your kids will see internet porn. Deal with it.""

Despite how crass that statement may be, it also might carry some truth and wisdom. In 2016, the Huffington Post reported that in one survey ""70 percent of 15- to 17-year-old boys said they watched porn."" Accurate or not, kids' access to infinite knowledge from the worldwide web leaves youths vulnerable to seeing material neither they nor their parents might have bargained for.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-pron-literacy-program-for-teens,2019-06-04
"Boston — which has raised LGBT flag at City Hall — doesn't have to raise Christian flag, judge rules","A judge ruled that the city of Boston — which has raised an LGBT flag at City Hall Plaza — isn't required to raise a Christian flag as requested by a religious group, the Boston Herald reported.

What are the details?

U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper on Tuesday denied a summary judgment for Harold Shurtleff and his Camp Constitution organization that claimed discrimination in a lawsuit after the city rejected their request to fly a Christian flag on a City Hall flagpole, the paper said.

While the city has maintained that flying a Christian flag would be akin to favoring a particular religion, Camp Constitution's 2019 federal complaint stated that Boston several times has flown the Turkish flag — which has Islamic symbolism — as well as the Vatican flag.

Other flags that would seem to reflect ideological stances — such as the Communist Chinese, transgender, and LGBT flags — reportedly were among 284 previously permitted flags.

More from the Herald:

An attorney for Boston argued in case documents the city is allowed to have control over the City Hall Plaza flagpoles because they're considered government speech. Shurtleff argued the city's 284 flag raisings between 2005 and 2017 were evidence the city had not previously denied a request, while Boston rebutted that most of the flags were of other countries and some civic symbols, such as the LGBT flag.



The City Hall Plaza flagpoles fly the United States and Massachusetts flags, a Prisoner of War/Missing in Action flag and the city of Boston's flag on the third pole, which is replaced by requested flags.

""There are no additional facts in the record that would suggest any improper preference for non-religion over religion or selective treatment of any person or group based on religion,"" the judge wrote, according to the paper.

The Herald added that the only other flag the city refused to fly was a ""straight pride"" flag before the controversial ""straight pride"" parade last year.

What did Boston's mayor have to say?

Boston's Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh — characterized by Politico as an ""intense defender of Obamacare, immigrants and unions, and a vocal supporter of full equality for LGBTQ Americans"" — said in a statement that ""we have never raised a religious flag on City Hall Plaza. Everything is either a national flag raising (the vast majority) or flag raisings dealing with issues of social or public policy, or historical significance,"" the paper reported.

Walsh added that ""Camp Constitution's request to fly the 'Christian' flag (as it is labeled by the organization), which bears the Latin cross ... should be denied, because ... the flag sends an overt religious message, and could reasonably be construed to be an endorsement of Christianity by the City, which would be a violation of the Establishment Clause,"" the Herald added.

How did Camp Constitution react?

""We are appealing the decision and will take it all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary,"" Shurtleff told paper.

Camp Constitution describes itself as a Christian group that seeks to ""enhance understanding of our Judeo-Christian moral heritage, our American heritage of courage and ingenuity, including the genius of our United States Constitution,"" according to its website, the Herald said.

The first commercial brain-computer interface is starting human trials,"The first clinical trials testing a human brain-computer interface will soon take place in the U.S.

The company developing the interface, Synchron Inc., is a competitor of Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp. Synchron Inc. beginning clinicals puts the company on a path toward mainstreaming controversial technology that could have wider use in helping people overcome disabilities and paralysis.

Bloomberg reported that the company’s early feasibility study to determine whether the product is even practical is being funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study is supposed to determine how the device can be integrated with the human brain safely. If all goes according to plan, the clinical trial will be able to assess how people with disabilities or paralysis can control digital devices hands-free.

This trial represents a landmark in that it will be the first clinical trial conducted by a startup working on brain-machine interfaces; should the clinical trial be successful, Synchron will begin working to sell the product.

Synchron’s clinical puts the company ahead of Musk’s Neuralink. Last year Neuralink raised $205 million, while Synchron raised $70 million.

It is believed that brain-computer interfaces have the ability to empower millions of disabled people to more easily communicate with other people and engage in modern life. According to data gathered by the CDC, paralysis affects more than five million people in the U.S. Brain-computer interface technologies theoretically could alleviate some of the difficulties in these people’s lives.

Synchron’s device, once implanted, travels to the brain through the body’s vascular system, whereas Musk’s Neuralink is implanted directly into the receiver’s skull. Once Synchron’s device reaches the brain, parts of the device translate brain activity into signals that allow text messaging, emailing, online shopping, or other various activities using a paired external device.

In the past, brain-computer interfaces have received regulatory approval to treat patients on a temporary basis, but if Synchron’s trial is successful, the company would secure approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for long-term use. If the clinical trial is successful, this technology will take a giant step forward toward commercial availability.

The Synchron study will involve six American patients in New York City and Pittsburgh. The first patient was enrolled this week at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. The patient’s identity and demographic information are being kept private.

Should this clinical trial be successful, the next step forward for Snychron will be conducting a wider trial to test for efficacy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brain-computer-interface-elon,2022-05-04
Fox News anchor abruptly shuts down Dem senator who claims Florida law was designed to 'target gay kids in schools',"Fox News anchor Bret Baier called out Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday after he made a dishonest claim about Florida's Parental Rights in Education law.

The dishonest claim was made in response to highly divisive remarks President Joe Biden made last week when he claimed the ""MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history.""

What happened?

While speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Murphy claimed that Florida lawmakers have engaged in a campaign to ""target gay kids in schools.""

""I am very concerned about the sort of very quick, hateful, divisive turn that the Republican Party has taken,"" Murphy claimed. ""This effort in Florida to sort of target gay kids in schools, I just think is mean-spirited and something that I had not seen from the Republican Party when I first started out in politics 20 years ago.""

Baier immediately interjected.

""Hold on, I’m going to interrupt you. To target gay kids in schools? The bill is about not talking about sexual identity from K through third grade. That’s not targeting gay kids,"" Baier pushed back.

""Yes it is. It is absolutely is,"" Murphy shot back. ""It is sending a message to these kids that they are not worthy, that they should be ashamed of their identification.""

Sen. Murphy: This will push a lot of people to the polls youtu.be

When Baier attempted to explain what the law says, Murphy claimed the Florida law tells students who identity as LGBT that they ""are not worthy of existence in that school.""

""Senator, do you talk to your kindergartner about sexual identity?"" Baier then asked.

Murphy, however, did not answer the question, but began repeating the leftist narrative that advocates for young children to be taught about sexual and gender identity.

""Half of trans kids in this country have contemplated suicide, and that’s because of the effort to bully them for their identity by adults in this country,"" Murphy claimed. ""So I absolutely do think that there’s a message sent to these kids when you suggest that a conversation about their identity is somehow threatening the education of kids in our schools.""

""With your children, did you talk about sexual identity as a kindergartner?"" Baier pressed. ""I mean, you don’t talk about the birds and the bees, let alone the birds and the birds, at that age, kindergarten through third grade.”

Murphy did not answer the question.

What is the truth about the Florida law?

As Baier correctly noted, the Florida Parental Rights in Education law does not ""target gay kids"" as Murphy claimed.

Instead, the law mostly reinforces parental rights in education; hence its name. Regarding classroom instruction, the law prohibits teaching on sexual orientation and gender identity for students K-3. Opponents of the law falsely called it the ""don't say gay"" bill. The law neither prohibits the use of specific vocabulary nor uses the word ""gay.""

Brooklyn's first-ever Chick-fil-A opens with 'a line around the block — and it’s not even 7 a.m.' But at least one hipster is fuming.,"Chick-fil-A opened its first restaurant in Brooklyn on Thursday morning — and one observer noted, ""I'll be doggoned if there isn't a line around the block — and it's not even 7 a.m.""

The left has targeted Chick-fil-A for years due to ownership's pro-traditional family and Christian views — which opponents have incorrectly equated to an anti-gay stance.

Although it appears Tamara Nay's sentiments better reflected the overall mood along Flatbush Avenue, as she noted to the outlet: ""I went by at around 7 in the morning and the line was way too long.

"Brunei won't enforce death penalty for homosexuality, after global outcry","The sultan of Brunei has announced that he is halting his country's law mandating the death penalty for homosexuality.

Here's what we know

In March, Brunei approved measures that would have mandated stoning and whipping to death as punishments for homosexuality, adultery, and rape. The country also added amputation as a penalty for theft, even if the culprit was a child.

Brunei adopted Shariah law in 2014, and has enacted additional laws since then to bring them more closely inline with Shariah.

World governments protested the move, as did celebrities like George Clooney and Elton John who called for a boycott of hotels owned by the Brunei's sultan and prime minister, Hassanal Bolkiah.

On Sunday, the sultan backed down from these harsh punishments and announced that he was placing a moratorium on these penalties.

""I am aware that there are all sorts of questions and misconceptions on the implementation"" the sultan said, according to the Washington Post. ""For that, we have given clarification. We are conscious of the fact that these misconceptions may cause apprehension.""



It does not appear that the moratorium applied to the law allowing for amputation as a punishment for those convicted of theft.

But the sultan also defended the laws: ""Both the common law and the Shariah law aim to ensure peace and harmony of the country. They are also crucial in protecting the morality and decency of the public as well as respecting the privacy of individuals.""

Brunei had a population of 450,565, according to the CIA World Factbook. Most of the population (78.8 percent) is Muslim, although there are significant Christian (8.7 percent) and Buddhist (7.8 percent) minorities. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has ruled the country since 1967.

Even with Brunei halting this rule, homosexuality is still punishable by death in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brunei-no-death-penalty-for-homosexuality,2019-05-06
Bryan Cranston defends role as quadriplegic in 'The Upside'; others argue part should've gone to disabled actor,"Actor Bryan Cranston — widely known for playing a high-school-teacher-turned-meth-dealer in ""Breaking Bad"" — is defending his latest role as a quadriplegic in new movie ""The Upside"" while others argue the part should have gone to a disabled actor.

Cranston — who is not disabled — told Sky News he's aware of the latest debate in Hollywood over ""the need to expand opportunities"" for minority actors, but that him landing the role as a quadriplegic was a ""business decision.""

""As actors, we're asked to be other people, to play other people,"" he told the outlet. ""If I, as a straight, older person — and I'm wealthy, I'm very fortunate — does that mean I can't play a person who is not wealthy? Does that mean I can't play a homosexual? I don't know; where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that? I think it is worthy for debate to discuss those issues.""

The actor — who stars opposite comedian Kevin Hart in the new flick — added to Sky News that the situation is a ""case of catch-22.""

Bryan Cranston poses at the premiere of 'The Upside' at the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario, Sept. 8, 2017. GEOFF ROBINS/AFP/Getty Images

Cranston added in an interview with Yahoo Movies UK that him getting the part in ""The Upside"" underscores ""the lack of diversity in disabled actors and the lack of opportunity in order to be even considered to play the lead role in a film like this. Are there any actors who have reached any kind of star status to be able to be considered? I think by not coming up with an answer to that is the answer to that. There is a dearth of opportunity for actors with a disability.""

What are detractors saying?



But others are saying Cranston essentially stole a role from a disabled actor.

A Vice writer said Cranston ""prevented a lesser-known disabled actor from getting the opportunity to play the role and gain celebrity. It's no wonder, then, that disabled actors in Hollywood have a hard time landing enough roles to amass the name recognition of a franchise leader like Cranston.""

Maysoon Zayid — a comedian, actor, and disability advocate who has cerebral palsy — told BBC News that too many disabled actors are left out of productions.

""We are by far the largest minority in the world,"" Zayid said. ""We are 20 percent of the population, and we are only 2 percent of the images you see on American television — and of those 2 percent, 95 percent are played by non-disabled actors.""

An amputee actress criticized Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson last year for his role as an amputee in ""Skyscraper"" — which came on the heels of Scarlett Johansson bowing to social media pressure and pulling out of a movie in which she was to play a transgender character.

Sky News added that Johansson in 2017 faced criticism after being cast as the lead in ""Ghost In The Shell,"" a remake of a Japanese anime classic, as over 100,000 people signed a petition saying the part should have gone to a Japanese actor.

More from the outlet:

Straight actor Darren Criss, who is known for playing gay characters including Blaine Anderson in ""Glee"" and killer Andrew Cunanan in ""American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace"" — for which he picked up a Golden Globe award earlier this week — recently ruled himself out of playing another homosexual part so as not to deprive an LGBT performer of a job.

"Another major city bans Chick-fil-A from opening restaurant in airport, lawmaker says CFA spreads 'hate'","Yet another airport has banned Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant due to the Christian company's alleged ""anti-LGBTQ"" views.

The development comes just one week after San Antonio, Texas, made national headlines for a similar decision. The San Antonio City Council blocked Chick-fil-A from operating at its airport, claiming the city does ""not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.""

What are the details?

On Thursday, Delaware North, the hospitality company that manages food operations at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, and the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority approved tentative plans to allow a Chick-fil-A restaurant to open at the airport, according to New York Upstate.

But the plan was met with immediate opposition from progressive lawmakers who claim Chick-fil-A is a discriminatory organization, despite the company's continual re-affirmation that it, in fact, does not discriminate against any customer, even those who identify with the LGBT community.

After NFTA's decision, New York Assemblyman Sean Ryan (D) released a statement blasting the NTFA for doing business ""with corporations who fund hateful and divisive groups.""

Ryan said:

I don't believe the leadership of the NFTA intends to help spread hate and discrimination, but allowing a corporation like Chick-fil-A to do business at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport will help to fund continued divisive anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. New York is a welcoming state that celebrates diversity.



The views of Chick-fil-A do not represent our state or the Western New York community, and businesses that support discrimination have no place operating in taxpayer-funded public facilities.

On Friday, Ryan announced via Twitter that Chick-fil-A would not be allowed to operate a location at the Buffalo airport.

""I applaud the decision that has been made to remove Chick-fil-A from plans for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport,"" he said. ""We hope in the future the NFTA will make every effort to contract with businesses that adhere to anti-discrimination policies.""

The NFTA confirmed the development to local media outlet WKBW-TV. The Chick-fil-A was slated to open in the fall of 2019.

What did Chick-fil-A say?

The company told WKBW: ""Recent coverage about Chick-fil-A continues to drive an inaccurate narrative about our brand. We do not have a political or social agenda or discriminate against any group. More than 145,000 people from different backgrounds and beliefs represent the Chick-fil-A brand. We embrace all people, regardless of religion, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/buffalo-airport-bans-chick-fil-a,2019-03-30
Businesses push Senate to pass Respect for Marriage Act,"Well over 100 businesses have signed on to a letter urging the U.S. Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.

The bill, which cleared the House of Representatives last week, would advance the LGBT agenda as it pertains to gay marriage.

While the Supreme Court previously steamrolled states' rights regarding same-sex marriage in its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, the Respect for Marriage Act would enshrine into law a prohibition against states declining to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.

The measure would prohibit states from denying ""full faith and credit to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State pertaining to a marriage between 2 individuals, on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individual."" The bill would bar states from denying ""a right or claim arising from such a marriage on the basis that such marriage would not be recognized under the law of that State on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals.""

The measure would also stipulate that when it comes to federal laws, rules, and regulations, a person should be viewed as married provided that their marriage is valid in the state where it occurred.

Last week, 47 House Republicans joined 220 Democrats in voting to approve the measure.

Major businesses such as the Walt Disney Company, Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Bank of America, Comcast NBCUniversal, General Mills, General Motors, Harley Davidson, Intel, Microsoft, Pfizer, PepsiCo, Starbucks, Target, Twitter, Tesla, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Zillow are just a few of the many companies that have signed onto the letter urging senators to back the bill.



""No person, including same-sex couples and interracial couples protected by this bill, should fear their marriage will not be recognized by the federal government or their employment benefits threatened,"" the letter says. ""Our businesses strongly embrace diversity and inclusion because we want everyone who works for us or does business with us to feel included and welcomed as their true, authentic selves. Inclusive business practices improve our bottom lines and lead to more productive and engaged employees, increased customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, improved competitiveness and financial performance.""

The Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBT advocacy organization, is behind the letter.

Buttigieg campaign facing criticism from LGBT lobby after dispute over stripper pole,"The Buttigieg campaign is facing criticism from the gay community after it cancelled a campaign event at a gay nightclub over the presence of a stripper pole.

The owners of the nightclub said the disagreement highlights how Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, doesn't respect the trials and tribulations of gay rights activists who came before him.

""We guess this is what the gay candidate does to the gay community! #downonthepoles #dancersforanyoneelse,"" the owners said on Facebook.

""We're open, we're here, we're queer, get over it!"" they added.

The campaign faced other criticism over the cancellation, including that of 2010 American Pole Fitness Champion Steven Retchless.

""The pole stigma is associated with sex work, but sex workers whether they're on a pole or not are humans, too, and shouldn't be discriminated against for providing a service as old as time,"" Retchless told the Washington Blade. ""Get over it and support the whole gay community.""

The Buttigieg campaign denied snubbing the gay community in a statement released about the cancellation.

""Our commitment to LGBTQ+ spaces is strong and we always strive to hold events in inclusive spaces,"" the statement read. ""Pete and [his husband] Chasten know first-hand how important it is for members of the LGBTQ+ community to have a safe space to gather and our campaign would never do anything to intentionally disrespect such a space.""

BuzzFeed posts list of LGBTQ children's books 'every kid deserves in their life': 'It's never too early to teach kids that being queer is totally normal',"Popular digital media company BuzzFeed is known for pushing a left-wing agenda, and it exemplified such a reputation once again over the weekend by publishing a listicle with the social media headline ""17 LGBTQ Children's Books That Every Kid Deserves In Their Life.""

""It's never too early to teach kids that being queer is totally normal,"" the subhead for the article states.

And in case the article's intentions were not obvious already, an alternate headline for the listicle posted on Facebook made it clear that ""every kid"" should read the books.

Among the titles, which were submitted by members of the BuzzFeed Community as well as by the article's author, are ""Julián is a Mermaid,"" ""Prince & Knight, ""Santa's Husband,"" and ""It Feels Good to Be Yourself: A Book About Gender Identity.""

According to Google Books, ""Julián is a Mermaid"" tells the story of a young boy who is captivated after spotting three magical women dressed up as mermaids on his way home one day. When he gets home, all he can think about is dressing up just like the women in his own mermaid costume, but he worries about what his grandma will think. In the end, he finds that he ""is ultimately supported in being his true mermaid self,"" BuzzFeed said.

In ""Prince & Knight,"" a prince in line to take the throne travels the world to find a princess to be his bride, but he never quite finds what he is looking for. Then, a dragon attacks the kingdom and the prince rushes back fight the beast. There he meets ""a brave knight in a suit of brightly shining armor ... together they fight the dragon and discover that special something the prince was looking for all along.""

Many commenters on BuzzFeed's Facebook post applauded the list, with some saying they planned to add the books to their local libraries or intended to pick up the books for their kids to read.

One commenter, who apparently works at an elementary school, noted that they read one of the books in class.

Caitlyn Jenner backs ban on transgender swimmers competing against biological women — 'What's fair is fair!' — and leftists go nuts,"On the heels of swimming's international governing body banning transgender women from competing against biological women if they don't transition by age 12, former Olympic champion and transgender woman Caitlyn Jenner backed the ban.

“It worked!” Jenner tweeted Sunday in response to the FINA ruling. “I took a lot of heat — but what’s fair is fair! If you go through male puberty you should not be able to take medals away from females. Period.”

How are folks reacting?

Jenner being an outspoken and controversial figure means the former world champion's tweet got a lot of attention — and as you might guess, leftists hated Jenner's take. Here are some examples:

""How do you identify as a female after this statement?"" one Twitter commenter wondered.

""Breaking News - Transgender Celebrity is anti LGBTQI,"" another user declared.

""You are happy about removing your own people from something. Wow,"" another commenter said.

""You’re out of date, Caitlyn,"" another user stated. ""Celebrating a blanket-ban on your own is dreadful.""

""You are a traitor and a fraud. Don't expect a warm welcome at any trans or LGBT thing ever,"" another commenter warned. ""You are despicable.""

""Can we please ban @Caitlyn_Jenner? She's done more to stir hatred against the trans community than anyone on earth,"" another user said. ""But at least she's joined the 1%...vote-wise ...""

""You are a true jackass; I am sure the Republicans will give you the same respect they gave the Log Cabin Republicans,"" another commenter predicted. ""Stay in your wealthy, not-caring-about-anything lane, Caitlyn.""

""How is it that you are trans yourself, but you are a transphobe and a homophobe?! I don't get it,"" another user asked. ""Don't you play on a women's golf team, too?? Maybe you should be banned from that ... No wonder why your kids want nothing to do with you; I'd feel the same way.""

""You are an asshole who doesn’t understand medical suppression or basically human biology,"" another commenter exclaimed. ""You are no friend or ally to the community you claim to be a part of. Shame on you!""

But also a surprising number of commenters agreed with Jenner:

""Speaking as a trans woman, we all understand this truth,"" one user noted. ""Acceptance is vital but not at the cost of defying logic. Unfortunately the political arm of the trans movement doesn't see it that way.""

""Never thought a day would come where I’ll be supporting a transgender woman’s statement,"" another commenter stated. ""I’m glad there are still sane ones amongst them.""

""Thank you for helping so much with this. I know you took a lot of heat, and I know you are NOT anti LGBTQ. You knew from personal experience that this was wrong and you fought to stop it,"" another user said. ""You've become a good role model for the trans community. Thank you!""

FINA's ruling means headline-grabbing transgender female swimmer Lia Thomas can't compete against women in elite events. In March, Thomas became the first transgender individual to win a NCAA Division I title after a victory in the women's 500-yard freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Championships. Thomas told Sports Illustrated in March that swimming at the 2024 Olympic trials is a goal.

In conjunction with its ruling, FINA proposed a new ""open competition policy"" that would allow transgender athletes to compete in another category.

"Caitlyn Jenner mulling bid for California governor, in talks with GOP operatives: report","Former Olympian turned reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly plotting a run for governor of California with the help of Republican operatives, as embattled Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom faces a recall effort.

What are the details?

Axios reported Tuesday that according to three sources, Jenner, 71, ""is talking with political consultants as she actively explores a run for governor of California.""

The outlet added that ""Jenner is being assisted in her consideration by Caroline Wren, a longtime GOP fundraiser"" who ""initially met Jenner through her work with the American Unity Fund, a GOP nonprofit focused on LGBT issues.""

Jenner, a longtime Republican, is a transgender activist who transitioned in 2015.

Wren also raised money for President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign, Axios noted. Jenner and Wren declined to comment on the story.

According to The Hill, Jenner's manager, Sophia Hutchins, earlier this year dismissed claims that Jenner was looking at a gubernatorial run, saying in February that Jenner ""has never considered running for governor and is very happy doing the work that she is doing to promote LGBT rights and spending time with her 18 grandchildren and 10 children.""

However, Jenner, did consider running to unseat Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) in 2017. Although that bid never materialized, Jenner might now see an opportunity for statewide office with the California's Democratic governor in a vulnerable position amid a campaign to have him ousted.

An effort to recall Newsom was launched amid outrage over the governor's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state, particularly his high profile visit to The French Laundry restaurant with a large group of people — which was in violation of his own coronavirus restrictions.

The recall campaign collected 2.1 million signatures that are currently being reviewed by election officials in the state for certification. With only 1.5 million valid signatures needed to put the recall on the ballot, the recall is expected to be certified — in which case an election on the recall could happen as early as October.

What did the former governor say?

Newsom has blamed the effort on Republicans, but former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger warned the Democrat last week that the recall scenario looks very similar to the one that made the Hollywood megastar the state's chief executive.

Schwarzenegger won election in 2003 after a statewide energy crisis that sparked a recall effort against then-Gov. Gray Davis (D). Schwarzenegger won, and the rest is history. But he says it could happen again, this year.

""It's pretty much the same atmosphere today as it was then,"" Schwarzenegger told Politico. ""There was dissatisfaction, to the highest level [in political leadership]. It's the same vibe.""

Schwarzenegger argued that the recall against Newsom is not as partisan as Democrats are making it out to be. The former governor says the Republican Party in California doesn't even have the power to get people elected, and that ""these are the signatures of the ordinary folks that have signed on"" to boot out Newsom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/caitlyn-jenner-mulling-bid-for-california-governor-in-talks-with-gop-operatives-report,2021-04-06
Caitlyn Jenner labeled 'traitor' after saying women's sports must be protected from transgender athletes,"Caitlyn Jenner, one of the most famous transgender people, said Saturday that transgender biological boys should not be allowed to compete in women's sports.

Jenner commented on the controversial issues about one week after announcing she was running for governor of California. Jenner is seeking the office as a Republican in a special election that was triggered after activists gathered more than 2 million signatures to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).

What did Jenner say?

Speaking with TMZ, Jenner said the issue boils down to fairness and protecting the integrity of women's sports.

""This is a question of fairness,"" Jenner, who won the gold medal for men's decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, said.

""That's why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls' sports in school. It just isn't fair. And we have to protect girls' sports in our schools,"" Jenner added.

Jenner declined to answer a follow up question asking whether her perspective was ""delegitimizing"" of a transgender person's identity.

However, Jenner later said on Twitter that her position is ""clear.""

""I didn't expect to get asked this on my Saturday morning coffee run, but I'm clear about where I stand. It's an issue of fairness and we need to protect girls' sports in our schools,"" Jenner tweeted.

In response, Jenner was labeled a ""traitor.""

""You are such a traitor @Caitlyn_Jenner So we need to 'protect girls sports' from other girls now? And fairness? Don't you know how testosterone blockers work?"" one person said.

""Can you please stop pretending to speak for anyone but yourself and your financial interests? Thanks,"" another person said.

""Can you please stop pretending to speak for anyone but yourself and your financial interests? Thanks,"" another person said. ""The only trans girl who shouldnt be allowed to run with everybody else is you lol,"" another person told Jenner.

""'Equality for me, inequality for thee' — Caitlyn Jenner,"" another person mocked.

What are states doing?

Most LGBT activists say that gender identity, rather than biological sex, should be the determining factor for kids who play sports. However, there is widespread disagreement about that — and states are taking action to protect the integrity of women's sports.



This year, numerous states have passed bills prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity, including: Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Florida will become the fifth state enact such a law, while South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) enacted an executive order on the issue.

Dozens of other states are considering similar legislation.

In response, LGBT activists are pressuring corporations to affirm their view of sexuality and gender, denouncing opposition to their perspective as ""discrimination."" The Human Rights Campaign, for example, is even pressuring the NCAA to not hold events in states that enact legislation that protects women's sports.

However, as the Associated Press noted, there has not been actual backlash against the bills, indicating the bills have won overall approval. Still, LGBT activists promise future repercussions.

""A lot of Americans are still getting to know trans people and they're learning about these issues for the first time,"" Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told the AP. ""Over time, they get to know their trans neighbors, they get outraged by these bans, and corporations respond ... It's just a matter of time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-sports,2021-05-02
California approves sex ed guidelines for discussing LGBT issues with students as young as kindergarten,"The California State Board of Education approved a controversial overhaul of the state's sex education curriculum on Wednesday, providing guidance to teachers and encouraging discussions of several LGBT topics in the classroom from kindergarten through eighth grade.

Nearly 200 protesters gathered to oppose the new plan, with several parents claiming it includes sexually explicit material.

What are the details?

According to the Associated Press, the curriculum empowers teachers ""to talk about gender identity with kindergartners and give advice to LGBT teenagers for navigating relationships and having safe sex.""

The framework also gives pointers on how to discuss masturbation with middle-schoolers, as well as guidance on talking about puberty with transgender teens in a way that creates ""an environment that is inclusive and challenges binary concepts about gender.""

While the core tenets of the plan passed, the board did agree to scrap a number of books that had been in the original proposal, which several parents and organizations claimed were ""sexually explicit.""

California Department of Education spokeswoman Kinda Britt defended the changes in a statement, saying, ""After rising levels of sexually transmitted diseases in teenagers nationwide, this framework was created to help provide necessary education to ensure that students are equipped to make informed and educated decisions when it comes to their sexual health,"" The Sacramento Bee reported.

""It was also designed to take the needs of our LGBTQ youth into consideration to make sure they feel safe and supported while at school,"" Britt added.

Greg Burt, director of the California Family Council told The Bee, ""There are all kinds of alternatives, but they want to teach sex ed with the guise that they were trying to prevent sexual transmitted diseases and prevent teen pregnancy.

""Now,"" he said, ""we are teaching kids how to have a robust sex life. Not everything under the sun needs to be taught to our kids with no moral judgment.""

Patricia Reyes, a mother of six, traveled 400 miles with her 4-year-old daughter in tow to protest the board's new framework.

""It's just scary what they are going to be teaching,"" she told the AP. ""It's pornography. If this continues, I'm not sending them to school.""

Anything else?

A number of teachers praised the new guidelines for their focus on inclusivity, but educators from across the state also expressed concern.

Teacher and school board member Brenda Lebsack spoke up at the hearing, saying, ""Teachers are afraid they will be forced to teach concepts that go against their conscious, and use nonbinary terms or else they could lose their jobs.""

Elementary school teacher Tatyana Dzyubak told the panel, ""I shouldn't be teaching that stuff. That's for parents to do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-approves-sex-ed-guidelines-for-discussing-lgbt-issues-with-students-as-young-as-kindergarten,2019-05-09
California bans state travel to Florida and four other states over Fairness in Women's Sports laws,"California has now banned state employee travel to Florida and four more states because of laws that purportedly discriminate against LGBTQ Americans, the state attorney general announced Monday.

Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta restricted state-funded travel to Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia, adding these states to a list that now includes 17 states where state-sponsored travel is prohibited.

""When states discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans, California law requires our office to take action,"" Bonta said. ""These new additions to the state-funded travel restrictions list are about exactly that. It's been 52 years to the day since the Stonewall Riots began, but that same fight remains all too alive and well in this country. Rather than focusing on solving real issues, some politicians think it's in their best interest to demonize trans youth and block life-saving care.

""Make no mistake: We're in the midst of an unprecedented wave of bigotry and discrimination in this country — and the State of California is not going to support it.""

The laws Bonta claims ""demonize trans youth and block life-saving care"" are fairness in women's sports bills, legislation that would prevent men who identify as transgender women from competing on sports teams associated with their self-proclaimed gender identity. California lawmakers banned nonessential travel to states that adopted or are considering such laws in 2016, a list that includes Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas.

Bonta's office identified fairness in women's sports laws in Florida, Montana, Arkansas, and West Virginia as cause for the travel ban.

The attorney general also called out Arkansas for passing a law that makes transgender surgeries and cross-sex hormone prescriptions illegal for minors and North Carolina for adopting a law that permits certain publicly funded student organizations, say a religious group, to restrict LGBT students from joining by citing conscience rights without losing funding.

Reacting to the announcement, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' office ridiculed California and accused ""politicians in Sacramento"" of failing to stand up for women's rights.

""Congratulations to California for somehow managing to create a new way to politicize its bureaucracy,"" DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw said. ""The bill Governor DeSantis signed is not discriminatory; in fact, it's the opposite — the legislation ensures that women's sports remain fair. On the contrary, allowing biological males to compete in women's sports is discriminatory, because it puts girls and women at a disadvantage based on immutable, innate characteristics.

""It is disappointing that the politicians calling the shots in Sacramento are not willing to stand up for women and girls in California.""

Pushaw added that despite the ban on state-funded travel, Florida will continue to welcome any Californians who wish to travel for tourism or to become new residents.

""In fact, I am originally from California myself — but I am thrilled to live in Florida now, because progressive dogma has turned my home state into a nightmare of crime, unemployment, closed schools, failing businesses, and high taxes,"" Pusahw said. ""I respectfully suggest that California's government focus on fixing the problems in their own state instead of worrying about Florida.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-bans-state-travel-florida,2021-06-29
Proposed California bill would fine stores that segregate kids' toys and apparel into boys' and girls' departments,"A proposed California bill would assess $1,000 fines to retailers who don't create a unisex, gender neutral space in its toys and apparel sections and more, if passed.

The policy would apply to all California retail stores with more than 500 employees if passed.

What are the details?

According to a Tuesday report from Reason, the proposed bill from Assembly Members Evan Low (D) and Cristina Garcia (D) would require retail stores to have ""one unisex section"" for children's products and apparel and face fines of $1,000 if stores refused to comply.

The outlet noted, ""Brick-and-mortar shops would have to display the majority of their products and clothing aimed at children in one undivided, unisex area on the sales floor. They'd also be barred from putting up signage that would indicate whether a product was intended for a boy or girl.""

Company websites, according to the bill — dubbed AB 1084 — would also need revamping to show that the sections were divided into ""kids,"" ""unisex,"" or ""gender neutral.""

According to the California Globe, ""The bill would specify legislative findings and declarations that there are unjustified differences in similar products that are traditionally marketed either for girls or for boys can be more easily identified by the consumer if similar items are displayed closer to one another in one, undivided area of the retail sales floor. In addition, keeping similar items that are traditionally marketed either for girls or for boys separated makes it more difficult for the consumer to compare the products and incorrectly implies that their use by one gender is inappropriate.""

What else?

In 2020, Low — who is also chair of the Legislative LGBT Caucus — introduced a bill that was nearly identical, but put the movement on hold in May to prioritize COVID-19 work.

At the time, he told Politico, ""This is an issue of children being able to express themselves without bias.""

If the bill passes, stores that violate the bill could be assessed a $1,000 fine. The bill is set to be heard at a committee in March.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-bill-fine-stores-boys-girls-departments,2021-02-25
"California city approves program to provide transgender, nonbinary residents with guaranteed income","A California city plans to a launch a program that will guarantee monthly income to transgender and nonbinary residents.



What are the details?

Palm Springs, a desert city in southern California, will allocate $200,000 to start a program giving transgender and nonbinary residents between $600 and $900 of monthly income, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The Palm Springs City Council unanimously approved a plan to develop the program last Thursday.

The program will give 20 residents the monthly income and, as is typical with guaranteed income programs, the money will be distributed with no strings attached, meaning individuals can spend the money however they see fit. The program is expected to last 18 months.

Palm Springs councilwoman Christy Holstege (D) said after the program was approved that she was ""incredibly proud"" that her city is coming down on ""the right side of history and supporting our trans and nonbinary, gender-nonconforming community,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.

The city will give the $200,000 to DAP Health, an advocacy health center based in Palm Springs, and Queer Works, an LGBT advocacy organization based in the Coachella Valley, to manage the program and apply for state funds set aside for guaranteed income programs. California has budgeted $35 million for basic income pilot programs.

David Brinkman, CEO and president of DAP Health, claimed transgender people are ""one of the most marginalized populations in our city who face some of the highest levels of housing insecurity, joblessness and discrimination.""

Jacob Rostowsky, CEO of Queer Works, said the problem is critical because ""people who are Trans and Non-Binary are highly marginalized in our society in general, especially economically.""

For the program to be fully funded, Rostowsky said the city of Palm Springs would need to match any funds provided by the state.

""Our project's budget is estimated at about $1.8 million,"" he said, the Desert Sun reported. ""And so when we look at what other [programs] that have been successfully funded have done, their local cities have provided nearly a match to that funding.""

California lawmakers pass resolution calling on all 'religious groups' — including Christians — to 'embrace' LBGT worldview,"California lawmakers passed a resolution this month telling ""religious groups"" — including Christian pastors and churches — to ""embrace"" the LGBTQ worldview, even if it contradicts the moral values of those religious groups.

Assembly Concurrent Resolution 99, introduced by Democratic Assemblyman Evan Low, also mentions what many believe are problems with so-called ""conversion therapy,"" or counseling for people struggling with same-sex attraction.

The resolution calls on ""all Californians,"" including religious groups, to ""embrace"" the ""individual and social benefits of family and community acceptance"" of LGBTQ people.

""[T]he Legislature calls upon religious leaders to counsel on LGBTQ matters from a place of love, compassion, and knowledge of the psychological and other harms of conversion therapy,"" the resolution states.

The resolution also blames ""religious groups"" for causing high rates of harm and isolation among the LGBTQ community.

""The stigma associated with being LGBTQ often created by groups in society, including therapists and religious groups, has caused disproportionately high rates of suicide, attempted suicide, depression, rejection, and isolation amongst LGBTQ and questioning individuals,"" the resolution declares.

The resolution overwhelmingly passed the California Senate and House this month. It did not require Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D) signature because it has no legal force. Instead, the resolution simply states the position of the California Legislature.

While Democratic lawmakers do not believe the resolution amounts to religious discrimination, Republican lawmakers have a much different perspective.

Republican state Sen. Andreas Borgea said the resolution's passage should ""concern all of us"" because it is ""treading into freedom of speech territory.""

""When an individual seeks therapy or guidance before a religious leader, whether it be a mosque, a temple, or a church, that's a private setting. … To disallow or create the pathway where we tell individuals they cannot say certain things should give us pause,"" he said, according to the Christian Post.

Indeed, Greg Burt of the California Family Council told the Epoch Times the resolution gives the government power to ""coerce"" people who disagree with the LGBTQ lifestyle.

""We believe in free speech. They [the legislators] have every right to criticize our position, but the state government does not have the right to use its power to coerce us to change. And that's where we believe this resolution is heading,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-lawmakers-resolution-religious-groups-embrace-lbgt-worldview,2019-09-18
California passes bill to soften criminal penalty for LGBT adults who have sex with underage teens,"The California General Assembly — comprised of a Democratic supermajority — has advanced legislation that could ease the criminal punishment for LGBT adults who have sex with underage teenagers.

What are the details?

The bill — SB 145 — was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), an openly gay man, and seeks to prevent gay adults who sodomize or perform oral sex with underage teenagers from being automatically assigned to California's sex offender registry.

The legislation calls for a judge to use discretion on assigning an individual to the sex offender registry if their victim was between the ages of 14 to 17 and the age difference between the offender and the victim is less than 10 years.

The bill passed the California state Senate by a 23-10 vote and passed the Assembly by a 41-18 vote, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported.

Wiener claims the bill ""eliminates discrimination against LGBTQ youth in our criminal justice system.""

More from the Chronicle:

Under current law, a judge can decide whether to place a man who has vaginal intercourse with an underage teenage girl on the sex offender registry based on the facts of the case. But if anal or oral sex, or vaginal penetration with anything other than a penis is involved, the adult must register as a sex offender — a relic of a penal code that criminalized those acts until 1975, even between consenting adults.



The California Supreme Court upheld the legal difference in 2015, arguing that because vaginal intercourse can lead to pregnancy, forcing a father to register as a sex offender would subject him to social stigmatization that could make it difficult to find a job and support his child.

The bill will next head to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), where it will likely become law.

What did opposition say?

State Rep. Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat, said, ""I cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registrable offense. We should never give up on this idea that children should be in no way subject to a predator.""

California is paying reparations to those the government sterilized against their will while protecting those now sterilizing children,"California is simultaneously paying reparations to those sterilized by the government in the 20th century while officially giving sanctuary to those now sterilizing minors.

Paying off old victims while creating new ones

The Associated Press reported that the state has approved 51 out of 310 applicants for reparations.

Unlike racial reparations programs under way in the state, this initiative is paying at least $15,000 to persons either sterilized during the so-called eugenics movement or sterilized in state prisons.

The eugenics movement, of which the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, was a major proponent, sought to sterilize by force or other means. In Sanger's own words, ""morons, mental defectives, epileptics,"" along with criminals, the poor, illiterates, and the unemployed, were unfit to breed and should therefore be precluded from doing so.

This movement was widespread, especially popular in Britain as well as in Canada. In fact, Tommy Douglas, touted as the father of socialized medicine in Canada and dubbed ""Greatest Canadian,"" once supported the sterilization of ""mental defectives and those incurable diseased.""

California had the largest forced sterilization program in the United States, beginning in 1909. It victimized over 20,000 people.

According to Paul Lombardo, a law professor at Georgia State University and eugenics expert, California's practice of ensuring ""human improvement by better breeding"" reportedly inspired similar practices in Nazi Germany.

""The promise of eugenics at the very earliest is: 'We could do away with all the state institutions — prisons, hospitals, asylums, orphanages,'"" said Lombardo. ""People who were in them just wouldn’t be born after awhile if you sterilized all of their parents.""

Mary Franco was one such victim of this thinking. Franco was sterilized at the age of 13 in 1934, as she was deemed ""feeble minded"" and a sexual deviant.

Stacy Cordova, Franco's niece, indicated that contrary to the state's suspicions, she had in fact been molested by a neighbor. Ostensibly punished by ideologues for another person's crime, Franco was denied the ability to have and raise biological children — an injustice that ruined a marriage and left her utterly alone.

California approved its reparations program for forced sterilizations in 2021, after North Carolina and Virginia had similarly done so.

While 51 have since been approved, state officials denied 103 people reparations and are processing 153 others.

The California Victims’ Compensation Board, which oversees the program, recommends on its website that to demonstrate victimhood, applicants are to provide documentation of the claimant's sterilization; sterilization recommendation; surgical consent forms; relevant court or institutional records; and/or other pertinent documentation.

Lynda Gledhill, executive officer of the Compensation Board, told the Associated Press, ""We try to find all the information we can and sometimes we just have to hope that somebody maybe can find more detailed information on their own. ... We’re just sometimes not able to verify what happened.""

Gledhill added, ""Nothing we can do can make up for what happened to them.""

While the state is finally making amends for sterilizing people ""who lived in state-run hospitals, homes and institutions through 1979,"" it has recently become a safe haven for doctors, activists, and others who confer on minors drugs previously used to sterilize pedophiles and other sex offenders.

Sanctuary state for sterilization

TheBlaze previously reported that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed into law a bill designating California a ""sanctuary"" for gender-dysphoric children and teens seeking so-called ""gender-affirming care.""

The bill, introduced by the leftist state Sen. Scott Wiener (D) — who also introduced a bill softening punishments on LGBT adults who commit sex crimes against minors — ensures that transsexual youths can receive hormone prescriptions, puberty blockers, and genital mutilations banned in other states.

The law also ""prohibits the arrest or recognition of any demand for extradition of an individual that criminalizes allowing a person to receive or provide gender-affirming health care where that conduct would not be unlawful under California’s law.""

A study published on Sept. 19 in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy indicated that puberty blockers, also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or GnRHa drugs, are not just creating sexless adults, although GnRHa is a drug ""licensed to chemically castrate men."" They are depleting victims' bone density; hampering their cognitive development; and producing a myriad of deleterious emotional effects.

According to the American College of Pediatricians, GnRHa agonists ""arrest bone growth, decrease bone accretion, prevent the sex-steroid dependent organization and maturation of the adolescent brain, and inhibit fertility by preventing the development of gonadal tissue and mature gametes for the duration of treatment.""

Not only is California protecting those who prescribe drugs that sterilize children whom Dr. Michael Biggs, a professor of sociology at the University of Oxford, claimed might have otherwise turned out to be sexually functional gays or lesbians, but it is also enabling clinicians and activists to endanger the lives of minors — kids who consequently may not live long enough to one day receive reparations.



The FDA noted that 6,379 people died between 2013 and June 2019 after taking the hormone blocker Lupron. There were also 41,213 adverse events and 25,645 ""serious"" reactions reported. Lupron is one of the drugs given to children diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

Just as Planned Parenthood was tied to eugenics in the 20th century, it is playing a leading role in the sterilization of children today.

Calif. school district under fire after group claims students learn pedophilia as a sexual orientation. Here's why the school changed its materials.,"A conservative group claimed that students in a California school district were being taught that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. While the school does teach about pedophilia in history, it does not teach it as a sexual orientation.

What are the details of this report?

According to the Freedom Project, a ""top official"" for the Brea Olinda School District told parents that students were learning about pedophilia and pederasty from a historical perspective.

The group went on to accuse the district of teaching the concepts as a sexual orientation.

The information purportedly came to light during a March parent information meeting with the district. The district held the meeting to inform and review with parents the state's Healthy Youth Act. The California Healthy Youth Act requires that students in grades seven through 12 receive ""comprehensive"" sexual health education, including education on HIV/AIDS. Lawmakers passed the act in 2015.

In the video, Stephanie Yates, who is founder of Informed Parents of California, asked district officials why they were ""teaching pedophilia in school to ninth graders.""

District Assistant Superintendent of Curricula Kerrie Torres explained that the district taught about pedophilia and pederasty when discussing ""historical perspectives of how gender relations and different types of sexual orientations have existed in history"" with regard to a portion on LGBTQ history.

Yates interrupted, ""So sex between a man and a boy is a sexual orientation?""

Torres circumvented Yates' question, and responded, ""It's something that occurred in history, and so this is really important for us to include.""

What did Snopes find?

Snopes reported that a district representative told them that pedophilia and pederasty was previously mentioned in a slideshow bullet point on the district curriculum, but noted that they pulled the verbiage from the slide because of its ambiguous nature.

""After careful review of the curriculum, the district determined it [the bullet point] posed more questions than answers,"" the spokesperson said.

Snopes also reported that the concept in question was included in an ""outdated version"" of the district's Healthy Youth Act-compliant curriculum that mentioned pederasty ""in a section about LGBT history, but neither endorsed the practice nor described or presented it as a discreet, legitimate sexual orientation.""

The portion in question, according to the outlet, is titled ""Introduction to Sexual Orientation,"" which features a slideshow discussing ""LGBTIQ in History,"" and addresses references to homosexuality in ancient times.

The outdated version said, ""The practice of pederasty (an older upper middle class man would make a young free boy his partner and become his mentor) is mentioned in Homer's Iliad, and is evidenced to have existed at least 4500 years ago in ancient Egypt.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-school-district-accused-of-teaching-pedophilia-orientation,2019-04-30
CNN anchor left stunned by development in Club Q massacre that undermines media narrative: 'I don't know what to say',"CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota expressed shock on Tuesday over a new development in the Club Q massacre that undermines the narrative blaming Republicans for the incident.

Democrats and the media are suggesting that partial responsibility for the massacre falls at the feet of Republicans and conservative media because they oppose the progressive LGBT agenda.

What did Camerota say?

While speaking on ""CNN Tonight,"" Camerota broke news to a panel that the perpetrator of the Club Q massacre identifies as ""non-binary"" and uses ""they/them"" pronouns.

""Attorneys for the accused shooter ... say in new court filings tonight that the suspect now identifies as non-binary,"" Camerota explained. ""In a footnote to a motion asserting legal privileges the public defenders say, quote, '[The perpetrator] is non-binary. They use 'they/them' pronouns, and for the purposes of all formal filings, will be addressed as mix-[perpetrator's name].""

The news left Camerota speechless.

""I mean, you know, I don't know if— I don't know what to say about that,"" she said.

By inserting the word ""now"" into her commentary, Camerota framed the development in a way that suggested the perpetrator only recently made the change to his gender identity. The legal filing to which she referred does not use the word ""now.""

Still, her framing prompted CNN political commentator Errol Louis to claim the change was made as a legal defense against hate crime charges.

""It sounds like they're trying to prepare a defense against a hate crimes charge,"" Louis claimed without evidence.

""That's the least of his problems legally speaking. But it looks like they're trying to build some kind of sympathy or at least confusion on the question of whether or not this was purely motivated by hate,"" he added.

Anything else?

The perpetrator faces first-degree murder and hate crime charges.

He was released from the hospital on Tuesday and was due in court on Wednesday, according to the Denver Post.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/camerota-speechless-club-q-nonbinary,2022-11-23
"Canada, Germany move to ban gay 'conversion therapy' — Canadian bill is so broad it could outlaw Christian counseling and evangelism of LGBT people","The Canadian and German governments have taken significant steps toward ending controversial gay ""conversion therapy"" practices in their countries this week.

Germany bans conversion therapy for minors

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, announced the new ban for minors Wednesday, telling reporters the practice, which intends to make patients heterosexual, has no scientific basis and often causes psychological harm.

""The government's goal is to protect people's right to sexual self-determination,"" Seibert added.

According to The Associated Press, in a Facebook post titled, ""Homosexuality is not an illness,"" the German government said anyone violating the ban could face punishments ranging from fines to prison.

Canada moves to criminalize any attempts to change one's sexual orientation

In a mandate letter setting out his government's policy objectives Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instructed his attorney general to ""amend the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy"" and take other necessary steps ""to end conversion therapy in Canada.""

Trudeau's directive comes just one week after Bill S-202 was introduced in Canadian Parliament aiming to make punishable by up to five years imprisonment the act of knowingly advertising or material benefitting, whether directly or indirectly, from conversion therapy practices.

According to the bill, conversion therapy means ""any practice, treatment or service designed to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity or to eliminate or reduce sexual attraction or sexual behavior between persons of the same sex.""

The bill's broad definition of 'conversion therapy' could put Christians in danger

Critics of the Canadian bill point to how broad and sweeping the language of the bill reads and say it is a strike against religious liberty. They fear that many various attempts by Christians to help LGBT people change could be considered or eventually become punishable by law.

The broad definition could include ""Christian counseling, prayer, and evangelism directed at the LGBT community,"" David Cooke, campaigns manager for Canadian pro-life organization Campaign Life, suggested to LifeSite News.

""In other words, if you publicly proclaim ('advertise') the message that homosexuals can be saved and changed, you will go to prison,"" he added. ""And if a young homosexual (under age 18) is converted at your church and starts contributing to the offering (providing a financial 'benefit'), your church leadership will go to prison.""

LifeSite News notes that Campaign Life has launched a petition against the bill, calling it ""absurd and totalitarian"" to jail people for ""helping someone overcome unwanted same-sex attractions or gender dysphoria.""

Conversion therapy is a controversial issue

Unhelpful to Campaign Life's cause is the present and historical controversy surrounding conversion therapy practices.

The Human Rights Campaign categorizes conversion therapy as ""a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity or expression"" that can ""lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide.""

The American Psychological Association has taken a less dogmatic stance, offering simply that ""there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation.""

While many Christian and conservative organizations have distanced themselves from the practice, some argue that ""while there is no doubt that some people have been hurt"" by certain since-discontinued conversion therapy practices — such as electric shock treatment — there is also ""no doubt that the harm has been exaggerated.""

To date, conversion therapy for minors has been banned in 18 U.S. states.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/canada-germany-debate-ban-on-conversion-therapy,2019-12-18
"Catholic diocese lays down the law in Iowa: No made-up pronouns, no boys in girls' sports, students to use bathrooms corresponding with their real sex","The Catholic Diocese of Des Moines has taken a significant stand against woke ideology and LGBT activism. As of Monday, the southwestern Iowa diocese — headed by 60-year-old Bishop William M. Joensen — will be enforcing new rules in 17 schools, four Catholic hospitals, and 80 parishes, thereby buttressing old common sense and enraging radical leftists.

New rules

The diocese's ""Gender Identity Guide and Policies"" document sets out seven policies, all binding for diocesan parishes, schools, organizations, and other institutions of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Des Moines. They do not apply, however, to passersby, occasional vendors, and others who ""may be on church-related premises who are not acting in an official capacity.""

The rules are as follows:

All documentation that requires the designation of a person's sex must reflect the person's real biological sex. So-called ""preferred pronoun[s]"" are not permitted, since the embrace of made-up pronouns, ""while intended as an act of charity, instead promotes the disassociation of biological sex and 'gender' and thereby confuses or denies personal integrity.""

All persons must use the bathroom or locker room that matches their biological sex. However, buildings are permitted to have individual-use bathrooms.

""All persons are to ordinarily present themselves in a manner consistent with their God-given dignity."" This rule primarily pertains to uniform dress, whereby girls are to wear girls' uniforms and boys are to wear boys' uniforms in schools.

With the exception of co-ed sports, males are to play in male sports and females are to play in female sports. There is to be no crossover.

Single-sex schools, buildings, and other programs or institutions (e.g., women's shelters) are restricted to members of the designated sex.

Kids aren't allowed to take ""puberty blockers"" on parish or school property, and ""medications for the purpose of gender reassignment"" cannot be distributed or stored on site.

Counsel given to vulnerable persons afflicted with gender dysphoria will be in ""accord with the directives and teachings of the Church.""

The Diocese of Des Moines made clear that those who disagree with these practices can leave: ""We acknowledge their freedom of conscience to withdraw or absent themselves from situations they find objectionable. Concomitantly, they must likewise respect the Church's mission to witness to truths accessible to reason and faith if they are to fully participate in our faith communities, including our Catholic schools.""

The diocese told KCCI that these policies are ""part of a lengthy process ... to address questions that have come forth by leaders in [their] parishes and schools.""

Old wisdom



While the rules stand in the face of LGBT conventions and social constructivist illogic, the diocese's policy document makes clear that it ""fervently hopes that all persons experiencing gender dysphoria know what the Catholic Church tirelessly affirms, that they are unconditionally loved by Jesus Christ and by the Church, and that they are vital members of the Body of Christ who have a home in the family of God.""



The church may love them unconditionally, but it evidently can do without their made-up pronouns and leftist customs.

The new guidelines underscore how ""any response that merely ratifies and reinforces the perceived disconnect between biological sex and gender-affiliation is not genuine compassion.""

Instead of mutilating or conferring puberty blockers to children afflicted with gender dysphoria, parents are instructed to ""genuinely assist the child by acknowledging the suffering involved and to accompany him or her along the path to personal healing, self-acceptance, integration, and peace.""

""Integration"" entails understanding that the ""human person is a body-soul union, and the body—as created male or female—is an essential aspect of the human person. There is a complex reality tied to the sex of a person involving the physical (i.e., in the gonads and other evident characteristics), psychological, and social constituents. A healthy person is one in whom these dimensions are integrated.""

The diocese and the Catholic Church reject LGBT activists' proposed alternative to integration.

""The Catholic Church teaches that the disruption of normal sexual development, or more dramatically, the removal or destruction of healthy sexual and reproductive organs, is a type of 'mutilation' that is medically and morally harmful,"" the document states. ""Procedures, surgeries, and therapies designed to assist a person in 'transitioning' his or her gender are morally prohibited.""

The document references Scripture as justification for this and other claims, but also Pope Francis' indication that ""biological sex and the socio-cultural role of sex (gender) can be distinguished but not separated.""

Faddish outrage



Democratic state Senator Claire Celsi expressed her outrage that the Catholic Church in Iowa would stand by its values.

Celsi tweeted, ""Diocese of Des Moines codifies ostracism of transgender kids. These schools want public dollars and want to treat kids in a way that might cause them to commit suicide. This is not what Jesus would do.""

The Democrat state senator suggested that the purpose of the new policies was to ""implicitly exclude LGBTQ students and staff.""

Celsi has a track record of ridiculing the church and suggesting that Catholics whose politics she finds disagreeable are un-Christian.

Celsi recently suggested that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's busing of illegal aliens to sanctuary cities puts his faith in doubt. She also lambasted a Catholic school for asking a teacher to remove an LGBT activist flag from a classroom.

The Daily Mail reported that the leftist Interfaith Alliance of Iowa slammed the diocese's policies as ""dangerous,"" claiming they advanced ""bigotry"" towards transsexuals in the state.

Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for the LGBT activist group One Iowa, suggested that the diocese's policies sound ""like conversion therapy,"" despite the rules preventing children from undergoing transsexual conversion therapy on diocesan property.

Courtney Reyes, also an activist at One Iowa, said, ""You cannot pretend to be compassionate while mis-gendering people and denying them access to any and all spaces under your control.""

"Catholic priest becomes transgender woman, leaves priesthood: 'I've still got God's support ... I can feel that'","Alisha Cacace often felt like a female trapped in a male's body, BarcroftTV reported.

The 37-year-old who hails from Basingstoke in England grew up in a Catholic family and — despite the internal gender conflict — decided to enter the priesthood as an adult, the outlet said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

""God calls you and you like and love it, and you then experience it, you look more into it, deeper into it,"" Cacace told BarcroftTV. ""The deeper you look the more prayer you do, the better you feel. My whole life was devoted to the church.""

'The best thing I've ever done was change over'

The outlet said Cacace visited an LGBT bar with a friend and saw how happy the people were there.

""I knew I was a female trapped in a male's body from a very young age; I was just pushing it to one side,"" Cacace added to BarcroftTV. ""Seeing others happy was great, and that really set a spark off in my mind.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And with that, ""after six years of struggling"" with gender identity, Cacace came out as transgender and left the clergy, the outlet said.

""Once you face that fear and do it, you feel a lot better in yourself,"" Cacace told BarcroftTV. ""The best thing I've ever done was change over; I don't think I could ever kind of go back.""

The former priest has been on hormone replacement therapy for a year and has never been happier, the outlet added.

'I've still got God's support'

""I'm kind of out of that frame of mind of being a clergy member and into the frame of mind of being a transgender girl and focusing on the new life,"" Cacace added to the outlet

But even as a transgender woman, Cacace regularly practices the Catholic religion, BarcroftTV said.

""I've still got God's support, definitely still have God's support. I can feel that,"" Cacace also told the outlet. ""I'm at that point in my life where this is my life.

Catholic priest prays for God to 'open our hearts' to unborn children in DNC closing prayer,"A Catholic priest mentioned the sanctity of life and prayed for hearts to be opened to unborn children at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, a message that aligns with Catholic beliefs but is rarely, if ever, espoused by members of the Democratic Party establishment.

Father James Martin, a Jesuit, prayed for a variety of people, asking God to ""open our hearts to those most in need.""

""Loving God, open our hearts to those most in need,"" Martin began. ""The unemployed parent worried about feeding his or her children. The woman who is underpaid, harassed or abused. The black man or woman who fear for their lives. The immigrant at the border, longing for safety. The homeless person looking for a meal. The LGBT teen who is bullied.""

""The unborn child in the womb,"" Martin continued. ""The inmate on death row. Help us to be a nation where every life is sacred, all people are loved, and all are welcome. Amen.""

A Catholic priest advocating for the sanctity of unborn life isn't, or at least shouldn't, be surprising. However, the Democratic Party's stance on abortion has gotten increasingly liberal in recent years, to the point where a politician who advocates for any limitation on abortion rights faces criticism from the left.

Abortion rights have been rebranded in the Democratic Party platform under the label ""reproductive health, rights, and justice.""

""Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice,"" the party's 2020 platform reads. ""We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.""

The platform goes on to advocate for restoring full federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, and repealing the Hyde Amendment, which currently prohibits the use of federal funding for abortion in most cases.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who publicly professes to be a Catholic, said in June 2019 that he supported the ban on federal funding for abortion. The revelation kicked off a firestorm of criticism from other Democrats and pro-abortion advocates, so one day later, he totally flipped his stance to support repeal of the Hyde Amendment.

In October 2019, Biden was denied communion at Saint Anthony Catholic Church over his abortion advocacy. The priest, Father Robert Morey, said ""any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching,"" CNN reported.

Biden has said he personally opposes abortion, but doesn't believe he has the right to tell women what to do on the matter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/catholic-priest-unborn-children-dnc-prayer,2020-08-21
"Catholic priests vow to defy teaching on same-sex marriage, denounce Pope Francis: 'Deeply appalling'","A group of Catholic priests announced Tuesday they would not abide by guidance from the Vatican that says priests cannot bless same-sex couples.

What is the background?

Controversy erupted Monday when the Vatican published guidance reaffirming what has been the Christian teaching on sexual ethics for the entire existence of the Christian church: Same-sex relationships violate God's ideal vision for marriage and human sexual expression.

Therefore, the Vatican advised, priests cannot bless such unions.

[I]t is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex. The presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator's plan.

The guidance was widely panned because Pope Francis is seen the ""woke pope.""

As pope, Francis has placed great emphasis on social justice and care for the vulnerable. Such positions — although considered ""liberal"" by many in the West today — are central to the Christian faith, and have been since the ministry of Jesus.

What did the priests say?

The Parish Priests Initiative — a dissident group of Catholic priests — essentially expressed dismay that Catholic teaching on sexual ethics will not conform to the standards of the secular world.

""We members of the Parish Priests Initiative are deeply appalled by the new Roman decree that seeks to prohibit the blessing of same-sex loving couples. This is a relapse into times that we had hoped to have overcome with Pope Francis,"" the group said in a statement, Reuters reported.

""We will — in solidarity with so many — not reject any loving couple in the future who ask to celebrate God's blessing, which they experience every day, also in a worship service,"" the statement added.

Founded in 2006, the PPI has voiced opposition to several key Catholic teachings, including celibacy among priests and forbidding women from becoming ordained.

The group, which reportedly has about 350 priests among its membership in addition to thousands of lay supporters, also supports giving communion to divorced persons and Protestants.

What does Jesus say?

When confronted by scribes and Bible teachers about divorce, Jesus grounded his teaching about marriage — and sexuality overall — in the Genesis creation narrative.

Matthew 19:3-6 (NIV) says:

Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, ""Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?""



""Haven't you read,"" he replied, ""that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,' and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.""

Christian marriage, then, is meant to reflect the unique ""oneness"" of humanity — one male and one female covenantally uniting — just as God eternally exists as multiple persons in a unique, inseparable, and unified relationship (Christian doctrine refers to this as the ""Trinity"").",https://www.theblaze.com/news/catholic-priests-defy-pope-teaching-on-same-sex-marriage,2021-03-17
Focus group stuns CBS News host with bipartisan agreement on nearly every issue: 'None of you are very optimistic',"Margaret Brennan, moderator of CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" was shocked Sunday that a bipartisan focus group agreed woke policies are bad news for children.

In fact, the focus group essentially agreed with one another on every issue.

What happened?

When Brennan asked the group for their biggest concern about raising children in America, they agreed it is far-left woke culture.

""All these elementary schools and middle schools having woke culture pushed on them from the LGBT+ community for sexual identity and gender. We should be pushing the actual school studies — math, social studies, science — not gender studies or sexual identification,"" John, a Republican, said.

Lashawn, a Democrat with eight children, agreed.

""I can also agree with some of his points. I really will say sex education — I feel like some things, you know, are brought to the children's attention they wouldn't even think about,"" Lashawn said. ""The children, they're really influenced. You can teach them one thing at home, but when they go to school, they're just as much influenced by their teachers and their surroundings. And we should have more input — the parents — of what we want them to learn.""

""I agree,"" Stephanie, an independent voter, responded.

Focus group: ""Pressured parents"" on their midterm priorities www.youtube.com

The group also raised concern over various other issues, especially the economy.

Stephanie described the state of the economy as ""scary,"" Lashawn called it ""unstable,"" and John condemned it as ""horrible.""

""You have to just adjust. It's not just the, you know, heating, the cost of living, the electricity, everything is just— it's just really hard,"" Lashawn said of high inflation and economic woes.

The panel also said crime, immigration, and the impacts of COVID lockdown policies are among their top concerns. Their feelings, in fact, confirm what polls show: The majority of Americans are not worried about abortion rights, but about the economy, crime, and immigration — issues that affect everyday life.

How did Brennan react?

The moderator expressed shock over the group's agreement despite their ideological differences.

""Often when we do these focus groups, we have people from different party affiliations disagreeing with each other,"" Brennan said.

""But I'm hearing all of you echo a lot of the same concerns and agreeing with each other,"" she observed. ""None of you are very optimistic about the country right now.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-news-focus-group-bipartisan-agreement,2022-10-24
CDC pushes teachers and administrators to facilitate spread of 'LGBTQ' propaganda in schools,"As its name suggests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tasked with preventing the spread of diseases. One CDC division is, however, working to help facilitate the spread of LGBT activists' radical social agenda in schools.

Exclusive inclusivity

The CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health purportedly ""promotes environments where youth can gain fundamental health knowledge and skills, establish healthy behaviors, and connect to health services to prevent HIV, STDs, and unintended pregnancy.""

The division also apparently endeavors to help schools stay engaged in LGBT activism and up to date with social constructivist terminology.

DASH has repeatedly pushed an October 2020 document entitled, ""LGBTQ Inclusivity in Schools: A Self-Assessment Tool,"" on teachers and school administrators alike.

Most recently, DASH tweeted on Dec. 27, ""School administrators: Our LGBTQ inclusivity self-assessment tool can help you quickly gauge inclusivity at your school. See your score today and learn ways to increase inclusivity,"" with a link to the document.

The document contains a self-assessment.

The purpose of the self-assessment is to approximate how close to conformity a teacher, classroom, or school is with the LGBT dogmas of the day.

Greater conformity means more ""inclusive school environments, policies, programs, and practices"" for ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning"" students.

According to the document, ""School and district staff who are interested in facilitating a more inclusive environment for LGBTQ students can use this tool to assess individual-level knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that foster inclusivity, in addition to determining strengths and weaknesses in current school-level inclusive policies, programs, and practices.""

Inclusivity, defined in the DASH document, does not mean accommodating all peoples, ideologies, or religious views, but instead entails ""the practice of elevating people and communities who, for cultural and historical reasons, may be been [sic] excluded or marginalized by dominant groups.""

School administrators or educators' responses in this assessment ""will be used to identify and provide resources and recommended action steps to improve inclusivity.""

The three camps

Those who use the tool to rate their educational environment can fall into one of three categories: ""Highly Inclusive,"" ""Moderately Inclusive,"" and ""Minimally Inclusive.""



Those in the first category (A) are minted ""Awesome All[ies].""

While told ""there is always more you can do,"" they are instructed to keep up the ""good efforts.""

Those in the second category (B) who have apparently made an effort to fall in line, but not uniformly so ""still have room to grow.""

They are told to ""work on broadening your horizons further, address your barriers, and expand your efforts further towards being an ally.""

Those in the third category (C) who have failed to meet the CDC's expectations for fidelity to LGBT activists' conventions ""are not yet well prepared to provide inclusive and supportive environments for LGBTQ students.""

They are told to ""commit to making changes.""

According to the document, those educators or administrators to whom the following statements apply ""minimally or not at all"" would fall into the third (C) category:

""I recognize that gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation can be complex, are unique to an individual, and can be experienced on a continuum"";

""I cannot assume a student’s gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation"";

""I use students’ chosen name(s) in all school environments, including abbreviations and pronouns [e.g., Jim vs. James; Natalie (she, her) vs Nathan (he, him)]"";

""I correct those around me if I hear them using incorrect, outdated, derogatory, or harmful language or terminology"";

""During sexual health education lessons, I describe anatomy and physiology separate from gender (e.g., “a body with a penis,” “a body with a vagina”)"";

""The policy(s) in place allows students to use the bathroom/locker room which aligns to their chosen gender"";

""My classroom or learning space includes visual labels (e.g., rainbow flags, pink triangles, unisex bathroom signs) marking it as a safe space for LGBTQ students""; and

""I ensure content and supporting materials are LGBTQ inclusive (e.g., ensure LGBTQ people, history, events, and resources are presented).""

DASH has suggested that an educational institution's success and inclusivity require, among other things, that educators sever biological sex from gender identity; display activist symbols in the classroom; hijack the curriculum with activist content; defer to dysphoric children on naming conventions; and actively censor speech regarded by activists as ""harmful.""

In addition to the content fleshed out in the document, DASH's ""LGBTQ Inclusivity in Schools: A Self-Assessment Tool"" cites as resources various lobby and activist groups' pages such as GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign and links to the ""LGBTQIA+ Glossary of Terms for Health Care Teams.""

This particular glossary suggests that ""Biological female/male"" are outdated terms and claims that ""Assigned female/male at birth"" should be used instead.

Another resource hyperlinked in the document is the PFLAG activist guide ""to being a straight ally.""

According to the guide, to be a ""Super Ally,"" a straight person must be keen to ""change some laws.""

The guide — which does not discuss health despite having significant real estate in the CDC's guide — expressly articulates the need for readers to transform the thinking and the conversations in their workplaces, schools, civic organizations, houses of worship, and families.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cdc-pushes-teachers-and-administrators-to-facilitate-spread-of-lgbtq-propaganda-in-schools,2022-12-29
CEO fired after confronting teenage boy who wore red dress to prom — but he says that's not the whole story,"A Tennessee man who was the CEO of a Tennessee-based telemedicine company was fired after a video went viral that showed him criticizing a teenage boy who wore a red dress to senior prom.

What are the details?

While gathering for pictures before the Franklin High School prom on Saturday, cell phone video showed Sam Johnson, the now-former CEO of VisuWells, confronting Dalton Stevens, a high school senior who was wearing a floor-length red dress with a thigh-high slit.

Stevens told WKRN-TV that Johnson used ""slander terms"" against him.

""Slander terms thrown towards me of like 'You look bad,' 'You've got hair on your chest, you shouldn't be wearing a dress,' 'You're not a man,' blah, blah, blah,"" Stevens told WKRN. ""The fact that he thought he had the audacity to come tell me what I was supposed to wear and what I was supposed to do because of his standards.""

Cell phone video captured by Stevens' boyfriend, Jacob Geittman, showed Johnson telling Stevens, ""You look like an idiot."" However, the video also showed Stevens using numerous expletives, and even Geittman seemingly further inciting Johnson.

""I chose what I want to wear so you can f*** off,"" Stevens told Johnson. ""F*** off. Get the f*** away from me.""

""You think he looks gross? Disgusting?"" Geittman said suggestively.

(Content Warning: strong language):

""I very much view clothes as genderless,"" Stevens later told WKRN. ""I was very confident. I knew that I felt beautiful, and I felt great.""

What did VisuWells say?

The company released a statement Monday announcing that Johnson had been terminated. The company also said it would announce ""concrete steps"" within the coming weeks to show its support for the LGBT community.

The statement said:

We unequivocally condemn the behavior exhibited by Sam Johnson in a recent video widely circulated on social media. After investigating the matter and speaking to individuals involved, the VisuWell Board of Directors has chosen to terminate Mr. Johnson from his position as CEO, effective immediately. Gerry Andrady, our President and COO, will lead the company through this important time.



VisuWell's culture emphasizes respect, kindness, and compassion, especially for those from traditionally marginalized communities, and we maintain a zero-tolerance policy for intolerance of any kind. Mr. Johnson's actions contradicted the high standards we set for ourselves in promoting the health of those who use our platform.



We share the concerns that so many have expressed on this matter and look forward to announcing concrete steps we are taking in support of the LGBTQ community in particular over the coming weeks.

The company was later forced to release a second statement clarifying that Johnson is no longer associated with the company in any way after critics claimed the initial statement did not ""acknowledge whether [Johnson is] still an employee.""

The second statement read, ""In response to those asking for additional clarity on Sam Johnson's termination as CEO, we can confirm that Mr. Johnson is no longer employed by VisuWell in any capacity. He no longer has a position on the Board of Directors or any informal advisory role. His behavior was not representative of our values, which include respect and compassion for all.""

What did Johnson say?

Johnson told Newsweek the video was deceptively edited and did not tell the entire story. He explained that he only interacted with the teenagers to ask them to tone down their ""obnoxious, loud behavior"" outside a restaurant.

Johnson said the incident ""wasn't anything personal or involving a dress.""

""We had just sat down for dinner at this restaurant that we frequent, and I was returning from the restroom when I was presented with their loud cursing,"" Johnson told Newsweek. ""Making it about the dress was their idea and they edited out most of the exchange.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ceo-fired-confronting-teen-boy-in-prom-dress,2021-04-28
Dave Chappelle will join 'Netflix Is a Joke' Fest despite LGBTQ controversy,"Dave Chappelle is having no problems finding work since the release of his Netflix special ""The Closer,"" and it doesn't seem he will be having the trouble any time soon, as his next gig was just announced.

""Netflix Is a Joke"" is a huge comedy festival that will play some of the biggest venues in Los Angeles and feature some of the biggest names in comedy today.

The festival had been initially scheduled for March 2, 2020, but had to be rescheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new dates for the festival are now set for April 29-May 8, 2022.

Along with Chappelle, the event will feature such big names as Kevin Hart, Jamie Foxx, Bill Burr, Amy Schumer, Gabriel Iglesias, David Letterman, Sebastian Maniscalco, Jerry Seinfeld, and a host of other comedians.

""We were so disappointed to postpone the event last spring and our line-up of comedians can’t wait to bring much needed laughs to audiences in LA and around the world on Netflix,"" said Robbie Praw, Netflix's stand-up and comedy formats director, to Deadline.

Since the release of Chappelle's latest special, ""The Closer,"" back in October, the world-famous funnyman has been the subject of some controversy, accused of being anti-LGBTQ. This same controversy appeared to cause some internal conflict within the staff at Netflix, which resulted in the firing of an employee who allegedly leaked confidential data pertaining to ""The Closer"" and organized an employee walkout in protest of Chappelle following accusations that the comedian was ""homophobic"" and ""transphobic.""

The accusations and controversy surrounding Chappelle and the LGBT community have not affected his relationship with the streaming service. Netflix CEO Tim Sandros defended Chappelle in a company memo, calling him ""one of the most popular stand-up comedians today"" and saying, ""As with our other talent, we work hard to support their creative freedom.""

Chappelle's headlining of the ""Netflix Is a Joke"" festival seems to be evidence that the platform is sticking by Chappelle and its commitment to work with him.

In addition to the Netflix gig, Chappelle just wrapped up a tour promoting his film ""Dave Chappelle: Live in Real Life."" The film was directed by Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, according to Deadline.



Tickets for the event will be on sale starting December 10, 2022.

The performances will be filmed to stream on Netflix at a later date, according to Deadline.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chappelle-will-join-netflix-is-a-joke-fest-in-spite-of-lgbtq-controversy,2021-12-07
Chasten Buttigieg claims bill outlaws recognizing 'existence' of LGBT people,"Chasten Buttigieg issued a tweet on Monday night claiming that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed legislation making it unlawful to recognize the ""existence"" of LGBT people.

""Every LGBTQ student, teacher, parent, nurse, astronaut, mechanic, soldier, etc in Florida is still LGBTQ. The governor can sign a bill making it illegal to acknowledge their existence, but he can’t make them disappear with a pen. Love will always win, friends. Onward,"" tweeted Buttigieg, the husband of U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

The Sunshine State's Republican governor signed the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill on Monday, though critics have been erroneously referring to the measure as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

One of the provisions included in the legislation prohibits teaching kids in kindergarten through third grade about sexual orientation and gender identity.

""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,"" the legislative text states.

Responding to Chasten Buttigieg's post, Karol Markowicz tweeted, ""The law absolutely does not make it illegal to acknowledge the existence of gay people. If this many Republicans we’re [sic] getting a law completely wrong, it would be a huge story.""

""Love has nothing to do with protesting a bill to protect small children from being inundated with sexuality. Read the bill, Sparky,"" Twitchy's Sam Janney tweeted.

""OK groomer,"" tweeted Sara Gonzales, host of BlazeTV's ""The News and Why It Matters.""

During remarks before signing the bill on Monday, DeSantis declared that, ""we will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida parents have a fundamental role in the education, healthcare and well-being of their children. We will not move from that. I don't care what corporate media outlets say. I don't care what Hollywood says. I don't care what big corporations say. Here I stand.

Chelsea Handler issues wild defense of Farrakhan video during off-the-wall interview — then immediately regrets it,"Chelsea Handler is expressing remorse for sharing a video of celebrated Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan despite an initially vociferous defense.



The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Nation of Islam as a hate group, writing that the group's ""theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""

What's a brief history?

Last week, Handler shared a video of Farrakhan discussing racism and white fear, captioning it, ""I learned a lot from watching this powerful video.""

According to various reports, a variety of celebrities endorsed the video, and some shared it themselves.

What's she saying now?

In a new interview with Handler, which recently aired on the Daily Beast's ""The Last Laugh"" podcast, Handler defended her decision to share a video of Farrakhan, apparently endorsing his sentiments.

""I don't want to take down the [post] because I felt the message was powerful,"" she insisted. ""[Critics] can go f*** themselves.""

During the interview, she added, ""I thought his message was really powerful. I wasn't thinking about the anti-Semitic thing, but I don't want to take the [post] down because I felt the message was powerful and a lot of people did. It was powerful for me the way he spelled it out.""

""That black people don't have a history of killing white people,"" she continued. ""White people have a history of killing black people, for hundreds of years. Over and over again, we kill black people in this country. So everyone needs to remember where the violence came from.""

The comedienne added, ""It's not from the black people, it's from the white people. I thought it was powerful. So, whatever, you know. Everybody can go f*** themselves.""

However, a very short time after the podcast went live, Handler got a major case of cold feet: She scrubbed the video from her social media platforms and retracted her initial defense in a lengthy apology shared with the Daily Beast.

In an email to the outlet's podcast team, Handler wrote, ""I want to sincerely apologize for posting the video of Louis Farrakhan. I didn't consider the context of his Anti-Semitic and homophobic rhetoric, that is of course contrary to my own beliefs and values.""

""Part of the process of educating ourselves during this pivotal time is recognizing and working through our mistakes,"" she said. ""This was definitely one of mine. I was wrong. It was offensive, and I apologize.""

Chicago elects its first black woman and openly gay mayor,"Chicago has elected its first black woman and openly gay mayor in Lori Lightfoot, a former assistant U.S. attorney who won by a landslide against Toni Preckwinkle in Tuesday's historic runoff election.

""Today, you did more than make history,"" Lightfoot told a crowd of supporters Tuesday night, NBC News reported. ""You created a movement for change.""

With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Lightfoot commanded 73.7 percent of the vote, according to the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners. Preckwinkle, 72, who is also a black woman, held 26.3 percent.

""Together, we can and will finally put the interest of our people — all of our people — ahead of the interests of a powerful few,"" Lightfoot said Tuesday night, CBS News reported. ""Together, we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn't determine your destiny.""

The 56-year-old mayor-elect succeeds Mayor Rahm Emmanuel who has served the city since 2011. He announced last fall that he would not seek a third term.



In February, Lightfoot came in first against a pool of 14 mayoral candidates with 17.5 percent of the vote. Preckwinkle, who served for nearly two decades on the Chicago City Council placed second with 16 percent of the vote.



During her campaign, she promised to end the corruption at City Hall where political scandals and insider deals have left low-income and working-class people ignored by the city's political ruling class, according to Fox News.

""We can and we will break this city's cycle of corruption,"" she said late Tuesday. ""We will not let politicians profit from their positions. We can and we will remake Chicago.""

Lightfoot earned a reputation as a police reformer when served as president of the Chicago Police Board and as chair of the Police Accountability Task Force, CBS News reported.

She led the task force that called out the department's history of ""racial disparity and discrimination"" and recommended an overhaul of the department.

As mayor, Lightfoot will be responsible for making sure the department meets the terms of the U.S. Justice Department's consent decree that took effect earlier this year.

The consent decree requires the department to produce monthly reports on its use of force incidents, it bans officers from using a Taser on suspects who are running away, stronger police accountability and discipline, and stronger community policing, among others.

What was the reaction from LGBT activists?

Brian Johnson, CEO of Equality Illinois, told CBS News that the organization was ""thrilled"" by Lightfoot's win. Equality Illinois is a civil rights organization for gay and lesbian people.

""This victory is historic, and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community,"" Johnson said.

What else?

Lightfoot's swearing-in is scheduled for May 20. She will become the second woman mayor in city's history.

She and her wife have one daughter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-elects-gay-black-mayor,2019-04-03
Chicago police question two 'persons of interest' in connection to alleged Jussie Smollett attack,"Chicago police on Thursday told TheBlaze they brought in for questioning two ""persons of interest"" in connection to the alleged attack on ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who told police the Jan. 29 incident was racist and homophobic in nature.

CPD public information officer Sally Bown added to TheBlaze that the two individuals have not been charged, but she said she wasn't sure when they were taken in or if they've been released.

CPD Director of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement, ""After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case.""

Bown also told TheBlaze there's no confirmation the two individuals in for police questioning are Chicago residents, or if they're the same individuals seen in a recently released surveillance photo taken minutes before the alleged attack.

The individuals are seen walking on New Street near Illinois, between 1:30 and 1:45 a.m. on Jan. 29 Image source: Chicago Police Department, composite

Smollett told ABC News' Robin Roberts that he believes the two figures seen in the surveillance image are his attackers.

When Roberts pressed for more information, asking how he's sure they're the same people — given the photo is dark, grainy, taken from a distance, and contains no identifying facial features — Smollett replied, ""'Cuz I, I was there.""

He added, ""I mean, for me, when [the photo] was released, I was like, 'OK, we're getting somewhere,' you know what I'm sayin'? So, yeah, I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did.""

&lt;br&gt;

'Pissed off'

Smollett also told Roberts he's ""pissed off"" at assertions his claims are a hoax:

It's like, you know at first it was a thing of like, ""Listen, if I tell the truth, then that's it, 'cuz it's the truth."" Then it became a thing of like, ""Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth."" And then it became a thing of like, ""Ohhh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth, you don't even want to see the truth.""

""I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,"" he added to Roberts, according to ABC News. ""And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.""



He also disputed a claim that he said his alleged attackers ""were wearing MAGA hats"" — the iconic red caps with President Donald Trump's 2016 ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan: ""I never said that.""

""For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know? And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing,"" Smollett added, ABC New said. ""I didn't need to add anything like that. They called me a f***ot, they called me a [N-word]. There's no which way you cut it. I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae.""

While at least one outlet, Forbes, reported the alleged attackers wore MAGA hats, numerous outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the Smollett was beaten up by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollet, who's openly gay, also said he was angered by claims the incident was ""a date gone bad, which I so resent ... I'm not gonna go out and get a tuna sandwich and a salad to meet somebody. That's ridiculous. And it's offensive. Yes, there's Grinder, yes, there's Jack'd, yes there's all of these things, which I have not been on in years. I can admit that I was on it back in the day. I was single. You know what I'm sayin'? But I haven't been on that in years.""

Anything else?

Smollett said he was on the phone with his manager, Brandon Moore, during the alleged incident. But Chicago police said the ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records Smollett turned over detectives ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation"" as cops continue looking into Smollett's claims, WBBM-TV reported.

Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Other curious details:

Police told ABC News Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building. CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Smollett's neighbor doesn't believe the story

A neighbor of Smollett cast doubt on his story.

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the actor, told the New York Post. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

Threatening letter, empty hot sauce bottle



A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

The Post said last week it traced Smollett's likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad, and that near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, the paper found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

Guglielmi told the Post that after police seized the bottle it was turned over to the FBI for analysis; the FBI declined to comment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-police-question-persons-of-interest-jussie-smollett-attack,2019-02-14
"After Chick-fil-A ends donations to 'anti-LGBTQ' charities, gay advocacy group says that's not enough","An LGBTQ advocacy organization called for Chick-fil-A to do more in support of LGBTQ rights within the company, a day after the restaurant chain announced it would no longer be donating to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Paul Anderson Youth Home.

GLAAD, which stands for Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said Chick-fil-A needs to address employee rights as its next step.

""In addition to refraining from financially supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations, Chick-fil-A still lacks policies to ensure safe workplaces for LGBTQ employees and should unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents,"" a GLAAD statement said.

Chick-fil-A has denied that the decision to stop funding the three aforementioned organizations had anything to do with outside pressure to withdraw support for organizations perceived to be antagonistic toward LGBTQ people.



Instead, the company said in a statement that it is attempting to focus its giving on three causes: hunger, homelessness, and education. Multi-year obligations to the Salvation Army and FCA have ended, and Chick-fil-A will now provide funding to organizations through grants that will be reviewed annually.

""Our goal is to donate to the most effective organizations in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger. No organization will be excluded from future consideration – faith-based or non-faith based,"" a spokesperson told the Christian Post.

Chick-fil-A has for years been a target of protesters and LGBTQ advocacy groups, dating back at least to 2012 when CEO Dan Cathy publicly affirmed a belief in traditional, heterosexual marriage at at time when same-sex marriage was being voted on across the country.

Despite that criticism, the chain has continued to thrive, becoming the third highest-selling chain behind McDonald's and Starbucks, even while only operating six days out of the week.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chick-fil-a-ends-donations-to-anti-lgbtq-charities-gay-advocacy-group-wants-more,2019-11-19
"Chick-fil-A goes international, opens pilot store in England. The backlash is predictable, but the company is prepared.","Chick-fil-A faced swift backlash after opening a restaurant in England.

What are the details?

The popular American chain restaurant has opened its doors across the pond, and was met with LGBTQ group protests in response.

The restaurant opened in The Oracle, a mall in Reading. Reading is about a 90-minute drive from London.

A statement from the company reads:

We can confirm we opened a pilot licensed location in the U.K. on October 10 and we are pleased to have already served several hundred customers in our first day. This location will help us understand more about consumer interest in our brand and signature menu items.

What was the response?

LGBTQ group Reading Pride has called for a boycott of the brand-new restaurant.

According to the group's Facebook page, the group plans to hold a Saturday protest against the mall's new tenant with goals to shut down the restaurant.

The event is called ""Get the Chick Out.""

In a Tuesday statement, Martin Cooper, CEO of Reading Pride, said, ""We are a progressive country and certainly a very progressive town. What we have here is a restaurant owned by a family that has very backward beliefs that actively promote anti LGBT charities … To have a company with such values in our town is abhorrent to us.

""We need to educate the community about what's happened,"" Cooper added. ""The feedback and support we have got is overwhelming, so a protest and demonstration seems appropriate.""

Has Chick-fil-A issued a response?

In a statement, the company said, ""We hope our guests in the U.K. will see that Chick-fil-A is a restaurant company focused on serving great food and hospitality, and does not have a social or political agenda.""

""We are represented by more than 145,000 people from different backgrounds and beliefs, and we welcome everyone,"" the statement added.

Texas AG is investigating San Antonio for religious discrimination against Chick-fil-A,"The attorney general for Texas is investigating whether the city of San Antonio violated the constitutional rights of Chick-fil-A when the city refused to allow them to open a restaurant at their airport.

The city council voted to keep the chicken burger chain out of the San Antonio International Airport over the conservative and Christian values that the founder espouses.

""We do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior,"" said councilman Roberto Trevino.



""Everyone has a place here,"" he added, ""and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport.""

Attorney General Ken Paxton responded by opening an investigation into whether the ban violates the First Amendment.

""The Constitution's protection of religious liberty is somehow even better than Chick-fil-A's chicken,"" Paxton wrote in a letter to the San Antonio city council.

""Unfortunately,"" he added, ""I have serious concerns that both are under assault at the San Antonio airport.""

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted in support of the move by the attorney general.

""Texas Attorney General will investigate San Antonio's ban on Chick-fil-A at their airport,"" tweeted Abbott. ""The ban has the stench of religious discrimination against Chick-fil-A.""

""Ironically, the city's efforts to be 'inclusive' resulted in the exclusion of Chick-fil-A based on its religious beliefs,"" said Paxton in a letter to Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao asking her to probe whether San Antonio violated any regulation as a recipient of federal funding.

Chick-fil-A sales have more than doubled since LGBT boycotts of the chain began in 2012,"Chick-fil-A is the left's most-hated fast-food chain. Progressives routinely boycottthe chain for being ""anti-gay"" despite never turning away LGBT customers. New data reveals the LGBT boycotts have actually been ineffective – in fact, the chain's sales have more than doubled in the wake of the protests.

The boycotts began in 2012 after a pro-LGBT blog accused Chick-fil-A customers of ""eating anti-gay."" In response, Dan Cathy, son of then-CEO S. Truett Cathy, affirmed the biblical vision for marriage and established the Chick-fil-A Foundation, a charitable organization that critics claim donates to groups that oppose same-sex marriage.

ROBYN BECK/AFP/GettyImages

In just 7 years since controversy began, Chick-fil-A's sales have more than doubled, a stunning accomplishment for any business, but even more significant considering the short timeframe and saturation of the restaurant market.



In 2012, Chick-fil-A sales totaled $4.6 billion. By 2018, total restaurant revenue eclipsed $10.4 billion. Beginning in 2014, revenue has increased by more than $1 billion each year, a trend that does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon.

Not only has revenue exploded, but Chick-fil-A has also opened nearly 700 new locations since the boycotts began. The combination of food quality and customer service also propelled Chick-fil-A to be the nation's favorite restaurant chain.

Chick-fil-A is now the nation's third-largest fast-food chain in terms of revenue, trailing behind Starbucks and McDonalds. However, Chick-fil-A has significantly fewer locations than either restaurant — just 2,400 — meaning they rake in significantly more revenue per location.

In fact, each Chick-fil-A generates an average of $4.6 million in revenue per year, more than double that of McDonalds, despite being closed on Sundays.

Fortunately for Chick-fil-A, the future looks even better as experts believe the restaurant's exponential growth will continue.

""I would be surprised if they didn't double that in the not-too-distant future,"" Kalinowski Equity Research founder Mark Kalinowski told Business Insider. ""Can they reach $30 billion?

Chick-fil-A says it has not caved to LGBTQ activists,"Chick-fil-A says it is not caving to political correctness and LGBTQ activism in its decision to restructure its philanthropic contributions.

On Monday, the restaurant chain announced that it would no longer be donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations — or organizations with traditional views on human sexuality — which apparently includes the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

You can read more about the stunning move here.

What are the details?

According to The Christian Post, the company insisted that it was not compromising its founding Christian beliefs.

“Beginning in 2020 the Chick-fil-A Foundation will introduce a more focused giving approach, donating to a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of hunger, homelessness and education,"" a spokesperson told the outlet. ""We have also proactively disclosed our 2018 tax filing and a preview of 2019 gifts to date on chick-fil-afoundation.org. The intent of charitable giving from the Chick-fil-A Foundation is to nourish the potential in every child.""

The statement added that the company aims to donate to the ""most effective organizations"" to help children.

""Our goal is to donate to the most effective organizations in the areas of education, homelessness and hunger,"" the statement continued. ""No organization will be excluded from future consideration — faith-based or non-faith based.""

The spokesperson continued, ""I also wanted to add that Chick-fil-A will not be opening on Sundays.""

What is GLAAD saying now?

For one organization, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, the move simply isn't enough.

The organization shared a statement Tuesday on Twitter following the restaurant chain's announcement.

""If Chick-Fil-A is serious about their pledge to stop holding hands with divisive anti-LGBTQ activists, then further transparency is needed regarding their deep ties to organizations like Focus on the Family, which exist purely to harm LGBTQ people and families,"" the statement read.

""Chick-Fil-A investors, employees, and customers can greet today's announcement with cautious optimism,"" the statement continued, ""but should remember that similar press statements were previously proven to be empty.""

The statement also pointed out the company still has a ways to go in ensuring ""safe workplaces"" for LGBTQ employees.

""In addition to refraining from financially supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations, Chick-Fil-A still lacks policies to ensure safe workplaces for LGBTQ employees and should unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents,"" the statement concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chick-fil-a-says-it-has-not-caved-to-lgbtq-activists-glaad-says-it-wants-the-company-to-go-even-further,2019-11-19
Chick-fil-A in Manhattan vandalized during Sunday's Pride Parade,"A Chick-fil-A in Manhattan was vandalized during a Pride Parade on Sunday, photos sent to the Daily Caller show, with messages scrawled on the glass and taped on the doors and windows.

There was no property damage nor any physical injury outlined in the report (Chick-fil-A is closed on Sundays), but the vulgar messages graffitied onto the fast food restaurant were designed to intimidate.



There are more photos at the above link.

Aside from the outright vandalism, there was plenty of hostility on display for the chicken sandwich joint during the parade.



The effort to silence -- or, in the case of Chick-fil-A perhaps ""starve"" -- the restaurant and its patrons is nothing new. it has happened time and again, with LGBT or other leftist groups attempt to drive the Christian-owned business off school campuses and out of towns.

July 30 marks the final day of Pride Month, and the parade in New York was celebrated by much of the mainstream media, as Daily Caller News Foundation's Virginia Kruta noted in her story.

In many ways the Pride movement has become indistinguishable from the #Resist Trump movement, which is itself increasingly seeing blurred lines with groups like Antifa, who infamously beat and robbed a journalist over the weekend.

Also this weekend we saw the owner of the Red Hen restaurant, which famously kicked then-press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family out after refusing to serve them, praising and defending a cocktail server in Chicago who last week spit on Eric Trump.

Chick-fil-A says it will no longer donate to 'anti-LGBTQ' charities — like the Salvation Army or the Fellowship of Christian Athletes,"Chick-fil-A will stop donating to organizations and charities that people consider to be ""anti-LGBTQ,"" according to an exclusive report by Bisnow.

What are the details?

Chick-fil-A will no longer make donations to charities with non-diverse views on human sexuality, the report states, ""after years of bad press and protests from the LGBT community."" Incidents, such as a variety of airports denying Chick-fil-A of prime real estate and mass protests against the restaurant chain, have been at the forefront of many Chick-fil-A headlines in recent years.

Kicking off in 2020, the company will ""move away from its current philanthropic structure,"" the report explains, and will instead ""focus on three initiatives with one accompanying charity each: education, homelessness, and hunger.""

""There's no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,"" Tim Tassopoulos, the company's president and COO, told Bisnow. ""There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.""

The Christian-founded company, under the new guidelines, will no longer donate to Christian organizations such as the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, or the Paul Anderson Youth Home. Instead, the company will begin giving sizable donations to organizations such as Junior Achievement USA, Covenant House International, and to local food banks.

Such a move, according to Tassopoulos, “provides more focus and more clarity"" on the business itself.

“We think [education, hunger and homelessness] are critical issues in communities where we do business in the U.S,"" he added.

What else?

Each donation will be provided on an annual grant basis and will be annually reviewed.

The outlet reports that ""the mission of the company is to serve all members of its many communities.""

“When there is a tension, we want to make sure we're being clear. We think this is going to be helpful,"" Tassopoulos explained. “It's just the right thing to do: to be clear, caring and supportive, and do it in the community.""

Mom of 11-year-old drag queen who danced in gay nightclub: Child protective services said abuse accusations 'unfounded',"Wendy Napoles — the mother of Desmond is Amazing, an 11-year-old drag queen who infamously danced in a gay nightclub recently as adults threw dollar bills at the boy — said child protective services ruled that others' accusations of child abuse are ""unfounded.""

Desmond at the 3 Dollar Bill club in December Image source: YouTube screenshot

Desmond donned a blonde wig, high heels, a girl's crop top, and full make-up while dancing provocatively to No Doubt's ""Just a Girl"" at the 3 Dollar Bill club in Brooklyn in December — and an outcry ensued after the performance was shared on social media. According to the Brooklyn Paper, Napoles said ""haters"" filed more than 150 complaints with the city's Administration for Children's Services.



""We have been accused of child abuse, exploitation & maltreatment to the point that we have been backed into a corner trying to defend ourselves,"" Napoles wrote earlier this week on the Desmond is Amazing Instagram page, which she administers. ""Recently a YouTube video was made stating that we should allow ACS (CPS) to investigate if we have nothing to hide. Which we have & we do not have anything to hide. We have been under a microscope since early December. I never thought I would have to breach my own privacy & confidentiality to provide proof that has been demanded of us out of malice.""

To underscore her point, Napoles posted 10 images on Instagram showing two letters and envelopes from authorities exonerating her and presumably her husband, Andy — Desmond's father — who also supports the boy's drag pursuits.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

More from Napoles' Instagram post:

ACS has investigated us thoroughly. Because of the number of reports they received, our case went all the way to the Governor's office. We had announced visits & unannounced visits to our home nearly daily & at all hours & Desmond's school. Our family was probed more intensely than any other case before. All allegations were ""unfounded"". Currently, we send screenshots of anyone encouraging others or admitting to contacting ACS to ACS to keep in our file. ACS is not a weapon. So many ACS resources could have gone to families that needed help. On the plus side, ACS has been offering us many support services.



In addition, we were investigated by the NYPD, the Child Advocacy Center, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Department of Labor, and the District Attorney's office. No abuse or maltreatment was found. No regulations for child performers were broken. No illegal activity has occurred.



We endured countless posts & videos slandering our family by people who have never contacted us for the truth or watched Desmond's videos where he has spoken for himself. We put up with lies & rumors. We daily clear social media of hateful comments & messages. Someone has been messaging Desmond's followers to convince them of alleged abuse. We deal with hate crimes & death threats perpetuated by ""concerned citizens"" & have been stalked. The NYPD is assisting us. Desmond has extra security measures in place at his school. All of this because we allow Desmond to be himself & do what he loves. We are a loving and supporting family. Anyone who knows us or met us can attest to that.

Fallout

Desmond's social media page claims he's been traumatized by the whole process, according to San Diego Gay & Lesbian News.

""Imagine starting a new school as a well known public figure and queer kid,"" the page says, according to the outlet. ""Then to have ACS, the NYPD, and other agencies show up to pull you out of class to talk to you several times a week. His grades have gone down ... He has cried many a night because he thought he did something wrong and blames himself for the constant hate and investigations. He feels so confused. ACS has provided him therapy.""

What else?



Wendy and Andy Napoles not only support their son's drag pursuits but also have let him be featured in magazines and on websites, social media, and national television.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Desmond started dressing in girls clothing at a young age, but when he wanted to wear dresses outside the home his parents consulted a therapist who advised them to ""allow Desmond to develop naturally,"" according to information on the Desmond is Amazing website.

Therefore, rather than ostracize, punish, or shame him, force him to play with certain toys, or restrict him to boys only costumes and clothing while playing dress up, Desmond's parents allowed him to inherently progress, explore, and choose his tastes in clothing, toys, and activities on his own. He had developed his gender identity as non-conforming, or gender fluid, as a young child. He is not, nor has the desire to become, transgender. From early on, he has said that he is a boy who enjoys dressing up as a girl.

Desmond ""is already a notable LGBTQ activist and advocate,"" according to his website, and also founded Haus of Amazing — a drag house for kids — and is developing a magazine for LGBT youth he plans to call The Amaziest.

He also was a guest on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" recently. Here's that clip:

"Children's Emmys show goes full woke with 'pansexual' host, performers in rainbow-colored outfits, celebration of 'LGBTQUIA' kids' shows","The first annual Children's and Family Emmy Awards show, which aired over the weekend, was saturated with woke ideology, including a heavy focus on LGBT+ themes in kids' television, Fox News Digital reported.



The awards show, which was targeted to children from ""infancy to age 15,"" was created by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

Approximately one in four awards were passed out to shows that featured some gender ideology themes. Similarly, several of the winners of those awards made references to gender or sexual orientation in their acceptance speeches.

On Saturday, the first day of the two-night event, the awards ceremony was hosted by 19-year-old JoJo Siwa, a dancer, singer, and actress who identifies as ""pansexual.""

To open the evening and introduce Siwa, a teen pop group performed a dancing and singing routine while wearing rainbow-colored outfits.

During Siwa's introduction, she stated, ""I'm a pop star, a reality TV star, a dancer, a singer, a choreographer, a social media influencer — some would even call me a gay icon.""

Of the television shows that received awards, several had released episodes with characters who question their gender identity.

""Muppet Babies,"" a series that includes baby versions of the Muppet characters, received an award for Outstanding Writing for a Preschool Animated Program. In particular, the award ceremony applauded an episode called ""Gonzo-rella,"" where Gonzo wears a dress, uses they/them pronouns, and identifies as non-binary.

""Friends with a Penguin,"" a Sesame Street program, received an award for the best original show. In one episode of the series, actor Billy Porter dresses up in a gown and sings about his friendship with a penguin. When accepting the award, song composer Kathryn Raio Rende gave a shout-out to ""all the LGBTQUIA kids.""

In an acceptance speech given by Kristi Reed, a voice director on Netflix's animated series ""CentaurWorld,"" she stated that, as a child, she was a ""queer kid in a small town."" She noted that television shows promoting LGBT+ themes can ""erase generations of hate"" and tell bullies to ""suck it.""

Another Netflix series, ""Heartstopper,"" received several awards. The show, which is targeted at young teens, follows the relationship between two high school boys.

During his acceptance speech, executive producer Patrick Walters stated, ""Most of all, with 'Heartstopper' we wanted the next generation of LGBTQUIA kids to see themselves in a story about queer joy, about love and about acceptance.""

Children's book series editor Bethany Mandel told Fox News Digital that the entertainment industry increased LGBT+ representation in children's television shows by 222% between 2017 and 2019.

""They want to promote this idea of introducing all of this content to children because they're trying to break 'generational hate.' And what it comes down to is they think that parents are not doing a good enough job, and they're not enlightened enough — they're not woke enough,"" Mandel stated. ""And it's their job and their mission to fix that and to fix children.""

The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences did not reply to a request for comment, Fox News Digital reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/children-s-emmys-show-goes-full-woke-with-pansexual-host-performers-in-rainbow-colored-outfits-celebration-of-lgbtquia-kids-shows,2022-12-16
Children's Court judge who once led group that sponsors Drag Queen Story Hour charged with possession of child pornography showing abuse of young boys,"A Milwaukee County Children's Court judge has been charged with seven counts of possessing child pornography showing the abuse of young boys, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

Brett Blomme also recently served as president and CEO of Cream City Foundation, an LBGTQ advocacy group that sponsors Drag Queen Story Hour — a controversial activity that's been in the news in recent years in which drag queens read stories to young children, typically in public libraries.

NY Library Brings Drag Queens to Kids Story Hour www.youtube.com

But some Drag Queen Story Hours have been under fire for things such as photos of children lying on top of a drag queen, a drag queen showing children how to twerk, and a drag queen in a miniskirt with an exposed crotch as children sat close by.



What are the details of the judge's arrest?

Blomme, 38, was arrested Tuesday, spent the night in jail, and made an initial appearance in a Dane County court Wednesday afternoon, the paper said. He was released by 4 p.m., the Journal Sentinel reported, adding that the conditions of his bond are that he cannot use social media or file-sharing services or have unsupervised contact with children except his own.

Each count carries a minimum mandatory sentence of three years and as much as 15 years in prison plus 10 years of supervised release, the paper said.

The criminal complaint says Blomme last fall uploaded as many as 27 images and videos of children being sexually abused using the messaging app Kik, the Journal Sentinel noted. The uploads occurred from a home he and his husband own in Cottage Grove, in Dane County, the paper added.

The couple has two adopted children, the Journal Sentinel said, but court records do not suggest they are part of any of the illegal images. Child Protective Services is involved with their current placement, defense attorney Christopher Van Wagner said during the hearing, according to the paper.

More from the Journal Sentinel:



The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General David Maas. He argued for a $2,000 cash bail, that Blomme not be allowed to have a cellphone or any unsupervised computer use (except for with his attorney) and no unsupervised contact with any children, even his own.



But Court Commissioner Brian Asmus noted Blomme's extensive contacts with the area, his lack of any criminal record and his husband's interest in protecting the couple's children in deciding on lesser conditions or release.



A preliminary hearing was set for May 29.



Later Wednesday, the state Supreme Court announced it was suspending Blomme from any judicial duties, without pay, per the high courts ""superintending and administrative authority"" over all courts in the state.

'DomMasterbb'

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children told investigators that a user called ""DomMasterbb"" used the Kik messaging and chat app to send suspected child pornography, the paper said, citing the criminal complaint.

Investigators tied the account to Blomme via his personal and work emails, the Journal Sentinel added, and searches were eventually conducted at his Cottage Grove home, another in Milwaukee, and at the judge's chambers.

The complaint says Blomme also uploaded images at a friend's home in Milwaukee, the paper noted, and the friend confirmed to investigators that Blomme was at his home on days that the friend's internet service showed child pornography uploads by DomMasterBB.

What about the Drag Queen Story Hour connection?

Cream City Foundation's website showcases Drag Queen Story Hour Milwaukee under its ""programs"" heading. But DQSH Milwaukee Executive Director Jonathan Hamilt told the Washington Examiner that his group ""has never been run by"" Blomme or Cream City.

Hamilt also told the paper that ""neither have ever participated in planning, organizing, hosting, or performing at any of our events"" and that Blomme ""has never held a title or position within our organization ever.""

""Cream City Foundation has only ever been a fiscal sponsor that allows DQSH Milwaukee to give & receive funds as a nonprofit. Asides [sic] from financials, they have had no part in DQSH Milwaukee & DQSH National,"" he also told the Examiner. ""As the leaders of DQSH Milwaukee & DQSH National we absolutely condemn pedophilia. We are angry and outraged by Brett's actions. Pedophilia has no place in the LGBT community and no place in society as a whole.""

The paper said Cream City Foundation didn't respond to its request for comment.

Anything else?

Blomme last year was elected to the circuit court and in August began as a judge in Children's Court in Wauwatosa, the Journal Sentinel said.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in 2019 went to bat for Blomme to get on the circuit court, saying he'd known Blomme for nearly 20 years, the paper added.

""I have had the opportunity to watch Brett grow into a leader and a strong advocate for Milwaukee, a person of impeccable integrity, and someone who has worked to make Milwaukee a more diverse and equitable place for all,"" Barrett wrote, according to the Journal Sentinel.

But on Wednesday Barrett called the child porn allegations alarming and Blomme's arrest ""a complete surprise,"" the paper reported.

Blomme was the first openly gay person to run for judge in the county, the paper said, adding that one of his opponents in the 2020 election said Blomme should resign.

""It appears that there have likely been many lives ruined by his actions. I also feel terrible for the children and families that have appeared in his court during the brief time he has been on the bench,"" Zach Whitney noted to the Journal Sentinel. ""Words fail me here, but those children and families obviously deserve better — as do the voters. He needs to immediately resign.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/childrens-court-judge-draq-queen-story-hour-child-porn,2021-03-18
"China censors popular sitcom 'Friends' to remove 'vulgar, immoral, and unhealthy' content","In its latest censorial crackdown on Western media, the Chinese government has censored content from the popular situational comedy ""Friends.""

Regional streaming services in China such as Bilibili, Tencent, Youki, Sohu, and iQiyi now enable Chinese audiences to view the popular sitcom after the series' reunion special on HBO Max, titled ""Friends: The Reunion,"" proved to be popular among Chinese audiences.

Largely, Chinese censors are altering and removing parts of the show that portray gay relationships, homosexuality, one-night stands, adultery, and underage love in accordance with content guidelines issued in 2016.

The guidelines stipulate that ""vulgar, immoral, and unhealthy"" content shall not be available to the public.

Scenes from the series' premier in which one character bemoans his ex-wife's adulterous lesbian escapades have been deleted.

Scenes throughout the series that show the characters discussing homosexuality have been altered, and sexually explicit conversations between characters have received subtitles that change the conversation's trajectory.

For instance, a sexually explicit conversation in which a character acknowledges the sexual uniqueness of women is accompanied by Chinese subtitles reading ""women have endless gossips"" instead of translating the actual, explicit statement verbatim.

Chinese fans of the series vented their frustrations online by using the hashtag ""#FriendsCensored."" This hashtag received more than 54 million mentions but was pulled down by state censors within hours of its first appearance.

According to CNN, the popular Chinese social media website Weibo took down the hashtag because it could no longer host the content ""according to relevant laws and regulations.""

According to online complaints, Chinese citizens viewed the censorship as an ""insult to our English language ability.""

Nevertheless, this censorship was required so the show could be available to the Chinese public in accordance with the law.

From 2012 to 2013, Chinese audiences could stream ""Friends"" without state censorship.

In late January, the Chinese government censored David Fincher's 1999 film ""Fight Club."" The Chinese streaming platform Tencent altered the movie by cutting out a dramatic end scene where the film's leads effectively cause a societal financial collapse. Instead of showing the film's original ending, Chinese censors inserted a caption telling viewers that the financial reset was foiled and that all of the complicit criminals were arrested.

The film was reportedly edited by its copyright holder for approval by the Chinese government prior to its circulation in China.

Similarly, last November, Disney caved to pressure from the Chinese government and removed a popular episode ""The Simpsons"" that mocks the Chinese government from the company's streaming platform in Hong Kong.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-censors-popular-sitcom-friends-to-remove-vulgar-immoral-and-unhealthy-content,2022-02-13
'Radical gender ideology has no place in our government': Rep. Chip Roy will reportedly introduce a bill to prohibit use of 'X' gender marker on US passports,"Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas will reportedly introduce legislation to ensure that the U.S. government cannot issue passports and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad that include a nonspecific ""X"" gender maker.

The Daily Caller reported that Roy plans to introduce the legislation — the outlet posted a copy of the bill, which would stop the State Department from carrying out a plan to allow people to select the alternative gender marker.

""There are only two sexes — male and female — and that’s what official government documents should reflect. Passports exist to serve our national security by verifying the identity of those who exit and reenter our country; they do not exist to undermine reality,"" Roy told the outlet. ""Radical gender ideology has no place in our government — whether in our education system or at the passport office. That’s why I introduced the Passport Sanity Act to put an end this madness,"" he noted.

In a press statement issued last year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the State Department planned to provide people with an alternative gender marker option. ""The Department has begun moving towards adding a gender marker for non-binary, intersex, and gender non-conforming persons applying for a passport or CRBA,"" the statement noted.

Later in 2021, the State Department announced that it had issued the first passport with the ""X"" marker.

""We anticipate the process of updating our passport forms will be completed in early 2022. After this process is completed, passport applications will offer the X gender marker,"" a State Department webpage says.

The legislation likely has no chance of becoming law as long as Democrats control Congress and the White House.

It has several co-sponsors, according to the Daily Caller: Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Ted Budd of North Carolina, and Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-passport-gender,2022-02-18
Media calls Gadsden flag a 'white supremacist' design in order to smear actor Chris Pratt,"Actor Chris Pratt was smeared by the media for wearing what they described as a ""white supremacist"" shirt, but it was the much more benign Gadsden flag design that gained popularity among Tea Party activists.

The actor, best known for his role as Peter Quill in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" franchise, was caught wearing the shirt while walking with his wife Katherine Schwarzenegger.



The image was posted on social media by Hunter Harris of Vulture.

Yahoo News then posted several tweets of random Twitter users who were offended by the sight of the historically important design under the misleading headline, ""Chris Pratt criticized for 'white supremacist' T-shirt.""

The article accurately describes the historical source of the design.

The writing and snake combo on its own is depicted on the Gadsden flag; a symbol created by Christopher Gadsden, a Charleston-born brigadier general in the Continental Army.



It came to prominence during the Revolutionary War of the US by colonists who wanted independence from Great Britain.

But it then goes on to claim that the design signifies the support of white supremacy, with only the opinion of a few random Twitter accounts as evidence.

Pratt was previously attacked by lesbian actress Ellen Page for attending a church that didn't live up to her liberal LGBT advocacy demands.

He responded to that controversy with a statement on his Instagram account.

""My faith is important to me, but no church defines me or my life, and I am not a spokesman for any church or any group of people. My values define who I am. We need less hate in this world, not more. I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from the judgment of their fellow man,"" he wrote.

""Jesus said, 'I give you a new command, love one another,'"" Pratt added.

""This is what guides me in my life,"" he concluded. ""He is a God of love, acceptance, and forgiveness. Hate has no place in my or this world.""

Here's Pratt talking more about his faith:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-pratt-gadsden-shirt-freakout,2019-07-17
Christian adoption agencies in Michigan will lose state funding if they turn away same-sex couples,"Adoption agencies in Michigan that refuse to place children with same-sex couples will no longer be able to receive state funding as a result of a legal settlement that could significantly hinder Christian agencies, according to the Associated Press.

What was the settlement? Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (a Democrat) and the American Civil Liberties Union agreed to settle a lawsuit filed in 2017 on behalf of two gay couples and one former Michigan foster child.

The lawsuit claimed that while adoption agencies could turn away LGBTQ people who wanted to adopt, they could not do so if they were contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services. Now, the department will end contracts with any agency found to turn away LGBTQ people, even if the rejection is based on religious belief.



What will this do to Christian agencies in Michigan? ""The result of that will be tragic, said Lori Windham, an attorney for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which was involved in the lawsuit on behalf of Christian charities. ""Thousands of children will be kept from finding the loving homes they deserve. This settlement violates state law protecting religious adoption agencies.""



St. Vincent Catholic Charities claimed in a 2017 court filing that it recruited more new families to adopt than seven out of the eight other adoption agencies in the region that work with unmarried or gay couples. St. Vincent may not be able to keep the adoption and foster program going without state funding, leaving it with two choices: end the program, or violate its Christian beliefs.

How did the plaintiffs respond to the settlement? ""[The settlement] will mean more families for children, especially those who have been waiting years for a family to adopt them,"" said two of the plaintiffs, Kristy and Dana Dumont. ""And we can't wait to welcome one of those children into our family.""

'Obvious and unconstitutional discrimination': Christian group asks SCOTUS to rule whether Boston can refuse to fly Christian flag,"A Christian organization whose request to have the Christian flag flown at Boston City Hall Plaza was denied by the city filed a petition this week asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule whether the city can refuse their request.

The city's decision was upheld by both a federal district court judge and a three-judge circuit court panel.

What's the background?

Boston City Hall Plaza features three massive flagpoles. Two of those poles always fly the U.S. flag and the Massachusetts state flag. The city flag usually flies on the third pole, but citizens are permitted to petition City Hall to raise other flags temporarily, the Christian Post reported.

In 2017, a Christian group led by Harold Shurtleff called Camp Constitution asked to have the Christian flag flown during a Constitution Day and Citizenship Day event. The city rejected their request, claiming that flying the Christian flag would be akin to favoring a religion.

Camp Constitution filed suit in U.S federal court and pointed out that the city had flown the Turkish flag (which bears Islamic symbolism) multiple times and the Vatican flag (which has multiple religious symbols), as well as other flags promoting ideological stances, including the Communist Chinese flag, the transgender flag, and LGBT flags. Also, Boston's city flag bears the City Seal. The seal states ""SICUT PATRIBUS, SIT DEUS NOBIS,"" which means ""God be with us as he was with our fathers.""

Nearly 300 different flags were permitted between 2005 and 2017, the suit said. The Christian flag was the only one the city rejected.

In February 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper ruled against Shurtleff's group, saying that the flagpoles constituted ""government speech,"" the Post said.

Shurtleff vowed to appeal the decision and take it to the Supreme Court if necessary.

That appeal was shot down by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in January. The three-judge panel ruled that the city is not required to treat the third flagpole as First Amendment-protected private speech.

SCOTUS petition

Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group that fights for evangelical issues, filed the petition with the Supreme Court on Monday.

The petition points out that the city rejected only the Christian flag over a 12-year period, and claims that the rejection was based on the fact that the word ""Christian"" was used on the application form (emphasis in original):

The City of Boston designated its City Hall Flag Poles as one of several “public forums"" for “all applicants,"" and encourages private groups to hold flag raising events at and on the Flag Poles “to foster diversity and build and strengthen connections among Boston's many communities."" Over the course of twelve years, the City approved 284 such flag raisings by private organizations, with zero denials, allowing them to temporarily raise their flags on the City Hall Flag Poles for the limited duration of their events. But when Petitioners' Christian civic organization, Camp Constitution, applied to raise its flag during a flag raising event to celebrate the civic contributions of Boston's Christian community, the City denied the request expressly because Camp Constitution's proposed flag was called “Christian"" on the application form but, other than a common Latin cross on the flag itself, there is nothing to identify the flag as a “Christian"" flag.

The petition asserts that ""the denial of Camp Constitution's flag raising request violated Camp Constitution's right to free speech under the First Amendment, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.""

""Never has Boston censored any flag until the Camp Constitution's flag, which is white with a blue square in the upper corner and a red cross. The flag contains no writing,"" Liberty Counsel said in a statement about the petition. ""Under oath, the city official testified the flag would have been approved if the application did not refer to it as a 'Christian flag.'

Christian mom tells gay man on morning TV that homosexuality is a choice. Social media lashes out in response.,"A Christian mom told a gay man that she believes homosexuality is a choice, and social media users roasted her for her stance.

What are the details?

The mom — Izzy Montague of South London — appeared on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" Thursday, where she sat with Tom Cox, a gay father and blogger.

According to the Daily Mail, the two were going head-to-head over the teaching of LGBT lessons in schools. Most notably, schools in Birmingham recently suspended lessons on LGBT relationships after Muslim parents and leaders protested.

Montague said that she didn't believe schools should teach children such lessons, but Cox disagreed, saying that not teaching LGBT lessons on diversity will harm kids in the long run.

The Christian mom countered that her beliefs prevented her from having a homosexual relationship and explained that she never even questioned whether she was gay or straight because of those beliefs. She added that she believes homosexuality is a choice.

Cox, however, insisted that people are born into their sexual preferences.

""I think you're doing a child a disservice by not allowing them to have that education to see that families come in all different shapes and sizes,"" he said. ""We live in such a diverse time. Gay people are everywhere, so they're going to get on a bus and that bus driver is going to be gay.

""They're going to be served food in a restaurant by a gay woman, a gay person may be delivering your child's baby one day,"" Cox added. ""We are everywhere.""

Montague insisted that she's not teaching her child to be ignorant — she simply wants to have a say over their education.

""What makes you think that my child is going around in a world thinking that nobody is gay?"" she asked. ""I never said that I would not teach my child. I'm Christian, so we have our own ways of teaching about the world. It's not about living in a vacuum. It's not about saying 'This person doesn't exist,' it's nothing like that. It's our opinions of the world around us.""



Montague later revealed that she doesn't believe that people are born gay.

""I don't agree with that you're born, you know, anything, no,"" Montague said. ""Of course, I believe it's a choice. I've made a choice on what I think is right or wrong. I don't remember ever thinking to myself 'Am I gay, am I straight?' It's something that I have done based on how I believe.""

She added, ""Even if I was gay, I do personally believe — based on my belief — that I feel that a heterosexual relationship is the right course of action for me.""

What was the response to her remarks?

Montague's interaction with Cox was reasonable and fair, with both sides hearing out the other's point of view, but social media took her to the woodshed for her Christian beliefs.

Many users called her ""homophobic"" and ""bigoted,"" while others simply called her beliefs outdated.

The Daily Mail reported that Montague received heavy criticism from viewers on Twitter.

One person wrote, ""Wow, lost for words with this debate. Who in their right mind would choose to be gay with the amount of hate and abuse they would endure?""

Another attacked Montague directly and said, ""Wow, this woman's views are absolutely disgusting to say people who are gay have a choice. The more she talks the more I dislike her. She is blatantly homophobic!""

Others did stand up for Montague and express their gratitude for staying true to her beliefs, but the majority of social media users discussing the segment did not take to Montague's stances kindly.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-mom-on-tv-homosexuality-is-a-choice,2019-03-21
Judge rules against Christian professor who sued college over transgender pronouns,"An Ohio professor lost his lawsuit alleging that a college was infringing on his right to free expression of religion after the administration rebuked him for not using a transgender student's preferred pronouns.

Nicholas Meriwether said that using the transgender pronouns was against his Christian faith and the demand from the college was violating his rights. He has taught religion and philosophy at the school since 1996.

Shawnee State University responded that using the student's preferred pronouns was a reasonable request of Meriwether's employment as a professor and not in violation of his civil rights.

On Wednesday, a judge ruled against Meriwether and dismissed his lawsuit.

The transgender student was born a male but preferred being referred to as a female. Meriwether refused and referred to the student with male pronouns.

Asaf Orr, an attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights praised the ruling, saying that transgender students would have greater access to ""educational opportunities available to all students without fear of discrimination.""

""Since this lawsuit began, transgender students have been worried that they would have to start skipping classes or avoid particular professors because Shawnee State would no longer be able to effectively address bullying, harassment, and mistreatment of transgender students,"" said Jae Keniston, president of SAGA.

Meriwether's attorney, Travis Barham of the Alliance Defending Freedom, said they are considering taking further steps to defend his client's rights.

""This is wrong,"" Barham said. ""Public universities have no business compelling people to express ideological beliefs that they don't hold.""

Christian school fires pastoral assistant for petitioning against transgender lessons at her young son's school,"A Christian school in Britain fired a pastoral assistant who posted online her objections to the transgender lessons being taught at her son's Church of England school.



The Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, fired Kristie Higgs after she urged her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the government's relationships and sex education, which goes into effect in September 2020. The United Kingdom Department of Education's new guidelines dubbed ""No Outsiders"" would require children as young as 5 to receive LGBT lessons about relationships and gender reassignment.

On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel dismissed the 43-year-old mother, who worked at a separate school from the primary school her young son attended, after it found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" and ""illegal discrimination,"" the Christian Legal Centre said in a press release.

What did she write on Facebook?

Higgs wrote on her personal Facebook page that children are being brainwashed by educators. She asked other parents to sign the petition that she shared.

""Please sign this petition, they have already started to brainwash our innocent wonderfully created children and its [sic] happening in our local primary school now,"" she wrote, according to a press release the Christian Legal Centre sent to TheBlaze.

""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are valid and 'normal,' so that same sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are,"" Higgs wrote.

""At the same time it means that expressing and teaching fundamental Christian beliefs, relating to the creation of men and women and marriage, will in practice become forbidden — because they conflict with the new morality and are seen as indoctrination into unacceptable religious bigotry,"" Higgs added.

In a separate post, the mother of two also voiced her objections to a pair of children's books at her son's school which feature LGBT stories. One story is about a boy who wants to wear a dress and the other is about a red crayon that learns it's really a blue crayon.

The panel determined Tuesday that Higgs' comments ""could bring the school into disrepute and damage the reputation of the school,"" according to the press release.



Higgs had worked at the secondary school for six years before her firing. Her employee record was unblemished up to her firing.

Was she fired because of her Christian beliefs?

Higgs, who is challenging her firing, said she believes she was fired because of her Christian faith and beliefs. She is represented by the Christian Legal Centre.



""I have been punished for sharing concerns about Relationships and Sex Education. I hold these views because of my Christian beliefs, beliefs and views which are shared by hundreds of thousands of parents across the UK,"" she said in a statement via Christian Legal Centre. ""My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age.""

""As soon as the investigation into the posts began I was repeatedly told: 'this is nothing to do with your religion.' That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion,"" she continued. ""I am determined to fight this case and to stand for Christians and all parents across the country who are being silenced for sharing and holding these views.""

The school claims it received a single email complaint about Higgs' comments. The complainant accused the woman of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""

""We concluded that no action was taken because of your religion,"" the disciplinary panel said, according to the Christian Legal Centre. ""The disciplinary occurred for reasons other than your religion.""



""As an inclusive employer, Farmor's school recognizes and protects the statutory rights of its staff,"" the panel said. ""Such rights however are not absolute and we are concerned that you did not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the school's requirement to respect and tolerate the views of others and to role model such behavior.""

The panel admitted that no damage had occurred to the school because of Higgs' Facebook posts.

""Regarding bringing the school into disrepute … we agree that there is no direct evidence that as a matter of fact that the reputation of the school has been damaged to date,"" the panel said in its decision.

What else?

Muslim parents at a Birmingham school have also protested against the ""No Outsiders"" program, which some have called indoctrination.

""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun in an earlier interview. ""You are using our children as an experiment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-school-fires-employee-for-petitioning-against-transgender-lessons,2019-04-17
Christian substitute teacher says she was fired from public school for raising concerns about LBGTQ book shown to elementary students — now she's suing,"A Christian substitute teacher is suing after she said a Georgia public school fired her for raising concerns about an LGBTQ book shown to elementary school students, WJCL-TV reported.

What are the details?

Lindsey Barr, who worked for McAllister Elementary School in Richmond Hill, took issue with a library read-aloud program featuring ""All Are Welcome,"" a book that depicts same-sex couples parenting and expecting children, the station said.

Barr's three children also attend the school and were shown the book, WJCL said.

Barr and her attorney Tyson Langhofer appeared on ""Fox & Friends First"" Tuesday to discuss the lawsuit, which said the book violated her religious convictions. Barr said during the interview that after raising objections with the school's principal about the book, ""within hours I was unable to access my teacher account and pick up substitute jobs.""

Fox News said Langhofer sent a letter to the school in response that reads: ""The firing is intended to send a message to Mrs. Barr and others in the community that if they criticize the school's approach to sensitive political topics or express viewpoints contrary to the school's preferred viewpoints, they will face the consequences.""

Langhofer, who is with Alliance Defending Freedom, told WJCL that it's a First Amendment issue — and the state has even added extra layers of protection.

""The Georgia legislature just enacted the Georgia Parental Bill of Rights this past session, and this bill specifically gives Lindsey the right that she exercised,"" he told the station. ""It gives every parent the right to review curriculum and to object to a curriculum that they do not want their children exposed to. All Lindsey was doing is exercising her right that the Georgia legislature just gave her.""



Barr told Fox News that although the school hasn't behaved unfairly toward her children as a way of retaliating against her, she believes that's coming.

""My children will be passed up for opportunities,"" she told the cable network. ""This is a county where you have to apply for your children to do most anything, even a field trip, and I think that this is a good way that they will quietly retaliate against our family for making noise.""

What did the school district have to say?

WJCL said it reached out to Bryan County Schools for comment and did not hear back.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-substitute-teacher-suing,2022-10-04
Gay couple demands new law forcing Christian service to prepare their taxes,"An Indiana same-sex couple is demanding lawmakers pass new legislation after they were turned away by a Christian tax preparer.

What happened?

Bailey Brazzel has filed her taxes with Nancy Fivecoate, owner of Carter Tax Service, for the past four years. But to her dismay, Brazzel says was turned away this year after she told Fivecoate she would be filing jointly with her new wife, whom she married last summer, according to WRTV-TV.

""We were really upset and shocked. At first I thought she was joking around,"" Bailey told WRTV. ""I was completely shocked, I never expected that to happen.""

""We shouldn't be able to be turned away or kicked out of places just because of who we're married too,"" Samantha Brazzel said, according to ABC News.

Eventually, Bailey and her wife went elsewhere to file their taxes.

Still, they remain upset over what happened, explaining to WRTV they believe they are victims of discrimination. They told the news station it is now their goal to ensure new laws are passed preventing discrimination against same-sex marriage couples in the future.

What did Fivecoate say?

In a statement to WRTV, Fivecoate explained her Christian beliefs prevented her from seemingly endorsing the same-sex marriage by preparing the taxes jointly — but that does not mean she in any way disrespected the Brazzels.

""The LGBT want respect for their beliefs, which I give them,"" Fivecoate said. ""I did not say anything about their lifestyle. That is their choice. It is not my choice. Where is their respect for my beliefs?""

""I am a Christian and I believe marriage is between one man and one woman. I was very respectful to them. I told them where I thought she might be able to get her taxes prepared,"" Fivecoate explained. ""I am not trying to destroy them by dragging them through social media. Why are they trying to destroy my business? I have made no comment on social media. Where is their respect for me and my beliefs?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-taxes-gay-couple-indiana,2019-02-24
Christian teacher sues school after allegedly being fired for refusing to read LGBT books to children,"A Christian teacher filed a lawsuit last week against her former employer, claiming that the child care center fired her for refusing to read LGBT-themed books to children. She accused the school of harassing and mistreating her because of her deeply held religious beliefs and objections to the content of the literature.



According to the lawsuit filed on Thursday, Nelli Parisenkova cared for children ages 5 and younger at Bright Horizons Children's Center in Studio City, California. After four years with the child care center, Parisenkova was removed from her position in April.

Bright Horizons Children's Center is an international child care provider founded in 1986 with over 700 locations in the United States. The school boasts its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In the complaint, Parisenkova stated that when she first started working at the school, she knew the school stocked LGBT books for the children. However, Parisenkova claimed that her supervisor at the time granted her an informal accommodation based on her religious beliefs that excused her from reading the books to children.

Parisenkova said she never opposed other teachers reading LGBT-themed books to children but objected to personally promoting and celebrating same-sex relationships and marriage.

The teacher's complaint said that on or around April 7, 2022, the temperature outside reached over 90 degrees, so the children could not spend time outside. To keep them occupied, Parisenkova read books to the children but noted that of the 12 books available, five of them promoted same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting.

Parisenkova stated that she felt pressured to read books that did not align with her values. While the children were taking a nap, Parisenkova claimed that she asked the lead teacher if those five books could be removed from the shelf for the rest of the day.

According to the lawsuit, the lead teacher removed the books without objection but later reported Parisenkova to the school's director, Katy Callas. As a result, Parisenkova was called into Callas' office, where the director allegedly ""became increasingly angry"" as she reprimanded the teacher for refusing to read the material to the children.

According to the lawsuit, Callas stated, ""If you cannot celebrate with us, then Bright Horizons is not a place for you."" Following the heated interaction, Parisenkova claimed that she was escorted out of the building by security and placed on administrative leave.

The following week, Parisenkova submitted a written request for religious accommodation, which asked that she be excused from reading LGBT-themed books to children. The lawsuit stated that Bright Horizons categorically denied her request without engaging in any negotiations.

Instead, the child care center allegedly issued a counseling memo that contained false statements, terminated Parisenkova's life insurance policy, and required her to undergo ""retraining"" for non-discrimination, harassment, and diversity.

""Ms. Parisenkova could not return to work without an accommodation; so, Bright Horizons terminated her employment,"" stated the claim.

Parisenkova is suing the child care center for disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, wrongful termination, harassment, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge.

Bright Horizons did not respond to a request for comment, reported Fox News Digital.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-teacher-sues-school-after-allegedly-being-fired-for-refusing-to-read-lgbt-books-to-children,2022-10-17
Christian university responds to students who voted for the school to ban Chick-fil-A: Get over it,"Trinity University will not be removing Chick-fil-A from its campus dining hall despite students rallying for the Texas school to drop the company, according to Campus Reform.

The school's student government previously voted unanimously to remove the restaurant from school property because students felt that the restaurant's traditional Christian values was a ""drastic assault on [LGBTQ] students.""

What are the details?

Tess Coody-Anders, the school's vice president for strategic communications and marketing, sent an email to students notifying them that their vote effectively means nothing.

The student resolution read, ""Trinity's values of diversity and inclusion and Chick-fil-a's values regarding the LGBT+ community are mutually exclusive.""

""We do not make vendor decisions based on their political or religious beliefs,"" the message read in part. The communication added that the school considers ""utilization, variety of options, vendor performance, and campus-wide feedback"" when selecting vendor offerings on the school's San Antonio campus.

The email added, ""Based on these criteria, Chick-fil-A appears to be a preferred vendor by students and the broader Trinity community.""

What is the student reaction?

Sen. Claire Carlson told the school paper that it's only natural that people should feel ""uncomfortable"" on the campus as a result of Chick-fil-A.

""Obviously [the presence of Chick-fil-A] has the potential to make a lot of people feel uncomfortable on campus, and also it looks really bad for Trinity in the context of recruiting potential students who may be a part of the LGBTQ community,"" Carlson complained.

Isaiah Mitchell, chapter president of the Young Conservatives of Texas, told Campus Reform that outrage is on the rise.

“The leftists here have the advantage of outrage,"" Mitchell said. ""It's not valid, but it's an advantage we don't have because we understand that the presence of Chick-fil-A doesn't harm anybody. They don't realize that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-university-issues-a-response-denying-students-who-voted-for-the-school-to-ban-chick-fil-a-get-over-it,2019-05-15
Herschel Walker’s son goes off on BLM: They’re ‘the KKK in blackface’ and ‘a terrorist organization’,"Christian Walker, the gay son of football legend Herschel Walker, unloaded on Black Lives Matter protesters and rioters in an in-your-face video posted to social media on Monday, calling them ""domestic terrorists.""

""Anybody who honestly cares about black people could not support Black Lives Matter — it's a terrorist organization, and personally I think it's the KKK in blackface,"" Walker said in the opening of the video posted on the Log Cabin Republicans' Twitter account.

Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's largest Republican organization dedicated to representing the LGBT community.

In the video, Walker, who lives in Los Angeles, recalls being frightened and then enraged after witnessing looting and burning taking place on the streets right outside his home.

""I was on the roof of my building in Los Angeles, and I was looking around town and the whole town was on fire because of radical BLM domestic terrorists,"" he said. ""There were 12 helicopters in the sky. I was freaking out, and all anyone had to say was, 'Oh, let me go post a black square on Instagram!' And I said, 'Oh, no-no-no, I'm not giving up my country up to the radical left.'""

Walker, like his father — who made headlines for speaking in support of President Trump at the Republican National Convention last week — is an outspoken voice for the black conservative community in America.

He has risen to internet fame in recent weeks after posting videos denouncing leftist policies on his Twitter account.

In the video posted by Log Cabin Republicans Monday, Walker took aim specifically at the Black Lives Matter organization, which he argues uses racial division to promulgate its anti-American Marxist vision.

""If you go on Black Lives Matter['s] website,"" Walker said. ""They hate Western civilization, they hate our society, and really — to me — they hate black men. They wanna destroy the nuclear family.""

Last month, Walker appeared on Glenn Beck's radio program to discuss the ongoing riots in America and what it's like to be a young, outspoken conservative in today's political climate.

During the interview, Walker again took time to dismantle the Black Lives Matter agenda, claiming it is doing nothing to make racism go away.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-walker-goes-off-on-blm,2020-09-02
Christian wedding venue owner under fire after turning away gay couple,"A Christian wedding venue owner in Texas has come under fire after he turned away a gay couple who wanted to host their upcoming wedding at the facility.

Lyle Wise, who owns The Venue at Waterstone in Celina, emailed the couple Jan. 19 and informed them that the ceremony could not be held there because same-sex weddings are a violation of his family's religious beliefs. Celina is about an hour north of Dallas.

""Our venue came about as a vision given to me roughly 27 years ago. That vision was from God and I had no knowledge or familiarity with wedding venues at the time. We have tried to honor that vision by following His instructions and to serve as by His example,"" Wise wrote in an email to the couple, which has been shared on Twitter.

""The design for marriage that we hold to is based upon the design He set forth which is a representation of the bride of Christ joined to the Groom (Christ who is the very God we worship.)

In Texas, businesses have the right to refuse service based on sexual orientation.



What did the couple say?

The couple, Aaron Lucero and Jeff Cannon, who are planning to wed in November, received Wise's email the day before their scheduled tour of the facility.

""It's 2019, is this really happening to us? I was kind of shocked,"" Lucero told the Dallas Morning News. ""The Supreme Court has already said that gay marriage is legal. What is the issue?""

Lucero and Cannon said they didn't find any information on the venue's website that stated the policy on gay nuptials.

""It's their right to refuse service to us, but if you're going to do that at least just be transparent with your policy and put that on your website,"" Lucero added.



They took to social media where they posted the email from Wise, along with their response.

""There is nothing on your website that shares your vision from God that prohibits same sex weddings which is a little surprising considering what an important role your faith was in deciding to start this business,"" the couple wrote in response to Wise's email.

""Had we known this upfront we would not have given your venue a second thought and would not be as disappointed as we are now having received your rejection email,"" the message continued. ""We were recommended to your venue by friends that were married there and I am sure they had no idea they were patronizing a business that discriminates against LGBT couples.""

Christians successfully apply pressure to prevent removal of a Nativity scene in liberal Arkansas town,"A mayor in an Arkansas town nestled in the Ozark Mountains sought to remove a Nativity scene from a public park, thereby ending a 70-year-old tradition.



Met with significant backlash from Christians, in part due to the attention drawn to the ban by a conservative radio show, the removal has been reversed.

A strong public reminder of the first Christmas will, as a result, not be hidden from public sight this winter in Eureka Springs.

Nowhere to lay His head

The town of Eureka Springs has been referred to by CNN as ""the Bible Belt's LGBTQ oasis.""

One city ad campaign reportedly claimed, ""Not even our streets are straight!"" Public displays of LGBT affinity are not just permitted but celebrated.

Notwithstanding a good deal of talk about inclusivity in and by the town, last week, it appeared as though certain groups and beliefs would be excluded from public spaces.

Mayor Robert Berry told Randall Christy, executive director of the Great Passion Play, to remove the Nativity scene in Basin Spring Park.

The Nativity scene had been in the park for nearly 70 years, erected by volunteers and sponsored by the Eureka Springs chapter of the Beta Sigma Phi sorority.



The Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported that the sorority donated the Nativity scene to the Great Passion Play last year and asked that the display be once again showcased at the park this year.

After getting the call from the mayor, Christy told KNWA, ""We decided we're not taking it down. We refused to take it down.""

Conservative radio host Todd Starnes caught wind of the order to remove the Nativity scene and helped amplify the cause against this instance of apparent secular iconoclasm.

Christy told Starnes, ""This is Christmas. ... Why is the Nativity such a threat to the mayor of Eureka Springs?""

He added, ""I’m tired of people demanding that we remove Jesus from Christmas. Doesn’t that bother you?""

While the Great Passion Play executive director instructed his team not to comply with the mayor's request, he noted that he harbored no ill will toward the mayor and the city attorney who ""are confused and mixed up like a lot of America is.""

The Nativity isn't going anywhere

There was substantial backlash over the threat of the Nativity scene's removal.

Christy said, ""People have just been pouring out — posting pictures, saying, ‘don’t take it down, don’t take it down,’ and the mayor has heard the cry of the people.""

KNWA reported that the park was flooded with visitors taking pictures of the installation they believed might soon be taken down.

""You made a big difference, Todd,"" Christy told Starnes, underscoring how many people had been calling, ""and I think it caused the mayor to take a second look at this.""

On Monday, Christy met again with the mayor, who was reelected to a third term in November.

Christy agreed to pay $25 and get a permit for the Nativity scene. The mayor agreed to allow the statue of baby Jesus to remain in the manger in the city park.

In a Dec. 6 Facebook post, Berry said that ""Eureka Springs is going to issue a permit for the Nativity scene to remain, along with other secular displays, in the bandshell in Basin Spring Park in Eureka Springs. The City of Eureka Springs is following its philosophy of being inclusive of all people and all beliefs.""

Christy similarly posted to Facebook, writing, ""I want to sincerely, personally thank Eureka Springs Mayor, Butch Berry who just notified me in writing that he has changed his mind and WILL NOT require us to remove our Nativity Scene out of the city's Basin Park. He and I will STAND TOGETHER to fight this potential lawsuit. We stand together to keep Christ and the Nativity in Christmas in Eureka Springs!!!""

According to Berry, a resident of the town had threatened to sue Eureka Springs over the Nativity, claiming the religious imagery violated his constitutional right to freedom of religion, reported the Gazette.

City attorney Forrest Jacob and the city's parks director, Scott Miskiel, reportedly told the mayor that ""as long as you allow other secular displays to be displayed, then you're OK,"" said Berry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christians-successfully-apply-pressure-to-stop-removal-of-a-nativity-scene-in-arkansas-town,2022-12-07
Church of England won't support gay 'marriage' in its churches,"Church of England bishops will not recommend that gays partake in the sacrament of marriage, ""a solemn, public and life-long covenant between a man and a woman, declared and celebrated in the presence of God and before witnesses.""

The BBC reported that Anglican bishops finalized their recommendations after several years of debate on the CE's stance on sexuality. These recommendations will be factored in at the CE's general synod in February, where the decision will be formalized.

What are the details?

After a ""six-year period of listening, learning and discernment known as Living in Love and Faith,"" CE bishops noted in a statement Wednesday that they are resolved to preserve the ""Church's doctrine of Holy Matrimony.""

Rhys Laverty, managing editor at the Davenant Institute, noted that ""an organisation concluding that Holy Matrimony is between one man and one woman should not, in fact, be surprising,"" granted ""'matrimony' literally means 'state of motherhood' (from Latin mater).

Notwithstanding the church's stance on this issue — the very issue that first distinguished the CE — the bishops nevertheless resolved to offer gays ""the fullest possible pastoral provision"": ""prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God’s blessing on the couple in church following a civil marriage or partnership.""

Extra to making these concessions, new pastoral guidance in relation to the discernment of vocation will eventually be produced, ""to which all clergy currently are asked to assent.""

This prospective document would replace the December 1991 ""Issues in Human Sexuality"" statement from the CE general synod, which claims, among other things: ""There is ... in Scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong, monogamous, heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings. Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable.""

The document also states that there is a ""mismatch between [gays'] sexuality and their physical and often also their emotional capacity for parenthood. There may be for some a mismatch between their bodies and the ways in which they wish to express their mutual self-giving. Their sexuality can be a barrier rather than a help toward full man-woman complementarity.""

The CE's ""Issues in Human Sexuality,"" which declares clergy cannot enter into active gay relationships, further condemns as ""bogus"" the ""philosophies of erotic freedom which have ... marked twentieth century European culture, and which have sought to justify every excess or deviation,"" for having advanced ""chaos and misery, disease and death.""

It is clear from the CE bishops' latest statement that much of the language and argumentation in this church document will be abrogated – no doubt favorable news for the church's ""non-binary"" Anglican priest and those clergymen driven to LGBT activism.

Apologies and 'breadcrumbs'

The church will reportedly be issuing an apology later this week to ""LGBTQI+ people for the 'rejection, exclusion and hostility' they have faced in churches and the impact this has had on their lives.""

Furthermore, the church will call on all congregations to welcome gay couples ""unreservedly and joyfully"" as they reaffirm their commitment to a ""radical new Christian inclusion founded in scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it — based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st Century understanding of being human and of being sexual.""

Various CE bishops commented on the proposals and the apparent balancing act between a prohibition on gay ""marriages"" and gay blessings.

Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said, ""I know that this has been costly and painful for many on all sides of the debate and has touched on deeply personal matters and strongly held beliefs.""

Stephen Cottrell of York said, ""This is not the end of that journey but we have reached a milestone and I hope that these prayers of love and faith can provide a way for us all to celebrate and affirm same-sex relationship.""

Justin Welby, the bishop of Canterbury, stated, ""I am under no illusions that what we are proposing today will appear to go too far for some and not nearly far enough for others, but it is my hope that what we have agreed will be received in a spirit of generosity, seeking the common good.""



Peter Tatchell, an LGBT activist, did not appear to receive the news in a ""spirit of generosity.""

Tatchell tweeted that the CE's decision is ""like the southern US churches that refused inter-racial marriages 60+ years ago. Anglican leaders are the ENEMY of human rights & LGBT+ equality!""



The Times noted that Jayne Ozanne, an LGBT activist on the synod, similarly denounced the bishops for not accommodating the zeitgeist, saying the proposals were ""breadcrumbs from bishops.""

""Therefore we are still second class and discriminated against, even with this really small concession,"" Ozanne added.

Penny Mordaunt, a senior Tory minister who failed in her recent bid to become prime minister, wrote to the bishop of Portsmouth, suggesting that the CE's refusal to marry gays has left many ""feeling that they are treated as second-class citizens within our society.""

NBC News noted that the CE is at the heart of the Anglican communion, accounting for over 85 million people in over 165 countries.

CNN anchors left cackling after conservative analyst mocks AOC's bizarre accusations about her GOP critics,"Conservative political commentator Mary Katharine Ham caused two CNN hosts to belly-laugh Monday after mocking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

What is the background?

Ocasio-Cortez incited backlash over the New Year's holiday after she accused her Republican critics of being ""creepy weirdos"" who have ""deranged sexual frustrations"" because they ""are mad they can't date me.""

""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Ya creepy weirdos.""

""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" she added. ""These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.""

The New York Democrat issued the strange accusations after she was sharply criticized for traveling to Florida over the holiday. None of her critics indicated they sought to date Ocasio-Cortez, which compounded the bizarre nature of her reaction.

What happened on CNN?

Network anchors Brianna Keilar and John Berman could not hold back their laughter when Ham reacted to Ocasio-Cortez's bizarre accusations by mocking her.

""First of all, I woke up like this. So I have authority on people being sexually frustrated by my mere existence,” Ham began.

""I’m glad to be able to discuss this important issue with you. The plight of the super-hot in America has long been ignored. AOC has started a national conversation about this,"" she continued. ""You know, I know we have all dealt with it — and by that I mean AOC, and you, Brianna, and myself and John — you know, we can start an organization or something.""

“Just the other day, I noticed the IRS keeps sending me notices even though I never expressed any interest in them. And it’s like, ‘Why are you so obsessed with me?'"" Ham joked. ""One day you wake up and you think to yourself, is there more to life than being really, really ridiculously good-looking? You know? I did it. And now I’m here. AOC did it, and now she’s a congresswoman. And in that capacity, you have to answer questions.""

After mocking Ocasio-Cortez, Ham shifted to a more serious tone. She highlighted the absurdity of Ocasio-Cortez's comments because the criticism she received for vacationing in Florida was fair.

""I’m goofing on this because it’s goofy. But to question the motives of every questioner you come across, I don’t think behooves you,"" Ham said. ""She can answer the questions about being in Florida without going here.""

""By the way, I know because I’m talking about this, there are weirdos who will get weird in my comment section right now. ‘Hi, how is it going?' You can’t date me. This is the real plight of actually being a woman in the public eye. And there is some of that out there,"" Ham explained.

""But we also have to answer fair questions,"" she continued. ""And a fair question to AOC is, ‘Hey, is your trip with your partner to Florida dangerous to yourself and others? And if not, why not?’ Because if it's not, it suggests that people can use their personal freedom to make decisions about their risk profiles and go forward in the world of COVID.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-anchors-left-cackling-after-conservative-analyst-mocks-aoc-s-bizarre-accusations-about-sexually-frustrated-critics,2022-01-04
CNN panel is stunned by host's bizarre question about Karen Pence teaching at Christian school,"The panel on CNN appeared to be stunned at the insinuation from host John King that Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, should be stripped of Secret Service protection because she teaches at a Christian school.

The issue arose after several news outlets began criticizing Pence and his wife over the stated policy at the school that students and staff should not participate in homosexual activity or behavior.



""Does it matter that all taxpayers pay for her housing?"" asked King at the end of the segment.

""All taxpayers pay for her Secret Service protection?"" he continued. ""You know, it's not her fault she needs protection, that's the world that we live in.""



""But all taxpayers pay for, subsidize for life, does it matter?"" he added.

Olivier Knox, the chief White House correspondent for SiriusXM, appeared confused by the implication made by King, and after a pause, responded negatively.

""So you mean do her First Amendment freedoms get somehow curtailed because taxpayers pay for her accommodations and her security?"" he asked. ""I don't know that a lot of people would sign on to that.""

""But other people have the First Amendment freedom to criticize, and they should expect that,"" added Washington Post congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian.

""Everything is fair debate, we live in a Democracy,"" King concluded.

Vice President Pence defended his wife from the media criticism on Thursday where he cited the history of Christian education in America and called the reaction ""offensive.""

""My wife and I have been in the public eye for quite a while but I have to tell you, to see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive,"" Pence said to EWTN's Lauren Ashburn.

""We have a rich tradition of Christian education and, frankly, religious education broadly defined,"" he explained. ""We celebrate it. The freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.""

""The Constitution prohibits a religious test for holding public office,"" he concluded defiantly, ""so we'll let critics roll off our backs.""

College faculty chair compares Chick-fil-A to 'pornography' as academic senate votes to kick restaurant off campus,"The vice chair of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's academic senate likened popular fast-food chain Chick-fil-A to ""pornography"" as the faculty body voted overwhelmingly to kick the restaurant off campus after 25 years, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

""We don't sell pornography in the bookstore, and we don't have a Hooters on campus — we already pre-select those kind of things based on our existing values,"" Thomas Gutierrez told student publication Mustang News. ""This is a similar thing. The difference is we're actually profiting from this. So our money, every dollar a student is spending at Chick-fil-A, is going to these causes that are in violation of our values.""



Mustang News — citing left-wing outfit Think Progress — said the ""Chick-fil-A Foundation donated more than $1.8 million to groups with a history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in 2017.""

The Tuesday vote to oust Chick-fil-A was a landslide of sorts, with 38 of 44 academic senators wanting to get rid of the restaurant, the Chronicle said.

What did the school administration have to say?



Despite the demands of the faculty representatives, it doesn't appear Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is in any rush to bow to them.

""While university administration passionately disagrees with the values of some of the organizations the president of Chick-fil-A has chosen to make personal donations to, we do not believe in responding to intolerance with intolerance,"" university spokesman Matt Lazier told KSBY-TV. ""Rather, we must model our values of inclusion — that means upholding the rights of others to have different perspectives and ensuring there is space in our community for differing viewpoints and ideologies, even those that may be in direct conflict with our own.""

The school and Chick-fil-A signed a 5-year contract extension in 2018.



Despite attacks, Chick-fil-A just keeps forging ahead



Chick-fil-A has been enduring left-wing attacks for years. But it seems that as the punches increase in number and intensity, the success of the franchise just keeps increasing: To wit, Chick-fil-A just became the third-largest restaurant chain in America, behind McDonald's and Starbucks.

But some folks are nevertheless doing their darndest to keep Chick-fil-A down:

College of Natural Science 'diversity' group at MSU: 'No science is needed to support transgender and non-binary identities',"A diversity group within the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University told students that ""no science is needed to support transgender and non-binary identities"" and that such support ""is simply a matter of affirming their experiences,"" Campus Reform reported, citing an email the outlet said it obtained.

The NatSci Council on Diversity and Community penned the email titled, ""Increasing transgender visibility on campus,"" the outlet added. The NatSci Council falls under MSU's College of Natural Science.

The email asked students to ""reflect on how visibility of minoritized groups is essential to changing our campus culture,"" Campus Reform said, and suggested a number of online resources to help in that regard.

More from the outlet:

These included links to LGBT resource centers, how to "" learn about and start using the singular they,"" a resource on hosting queer inclusive workshops, one dedicated to inviting ""transgender and gender-diverse scientists,"" guides on transphobia, and more.



Clicking on the pronoun link brings up a colorful and interactive web page titled ""I [love] the singular they,"" which maps out benefits and tools to using the pronoun to refer to a person. The page argues that the singular ""they"" is ""neutral,"" ""easy,"" ""inclusive,"" and ""classy.""

What else does the pronoun site say?

""Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain,"" the pronoun site says. ""Some prefer the Frankenword 's/he,' while others rack their brain. Some stick with a particular pronoun for one paragraph or chapter, then swap out the one they're using; others alternate 'he' and 'she' by sentence, or use a plural adapter, but that all sounds confusing.""

The site adds that ""'they' doesn't assume a person's gender, and it doesn't assume there are only two"" and that it's ""inclusive of people of all different genders.""

What did natural science students have to say?

Ashley Deaton, a food science and microbiology student, told Campus Reform that the email is ""dangerous"" as it reflects ""a single mentality that actually isn't as straightforward as people may believe.""

MSU physiology student Shad Soldano told the outlet he sees things differently, saying he believes the email stands for ""a good cause in bringing awareness and hopefully eliminating remaining prejudices toward the transgender community.""

What did the College of Natural Science have to say?

Campus Reform said it didn't immediately hear back from Shelby Gombosi, the MSU administrative assistant who sent the email. MSU on Tuesday didn't immediately reply to TheBlaze's request for comment on the email Campus Reform said it obtained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-of-natural-science-at-major-school-tells-students-no-science-is-needed-to-support-transgender-and-non-binary-identities,2019-04-23
College offers 'Presidential Debate Support Space' through counseling center so students can share feelings about 'national events' in 'safe space',"Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland — which hosted Tuesday's debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden — has opened up a virtual ""Presidential Debate Support Space"" through the college's counseling center so students can share their feelings about ""national events"" in a ""safe space.""

What are the details?

""Support Space is a confidential safe space for students to have open discussions in a group setting, moderated by University Health & Counseling Services clinical staff,"" the program's page says. ""Students can discuss the impact of recent national events, including the presidential debate and upcoming election.""

However, the page adds that the support space ""is not a substitute for psychotherapy and does not constitute mental health treatment.""

The first hourlong session was scheduled Monday, a day prior to the presidential debate. Another session was scheduled Tuesday evening, just before the debate commenced, and another was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. Another session is set to take place Friday, and four more are scheduled to run next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Participants must register in advance, the page notes, and they ""will be expected to adhere to rules regarding respectful dialogue"" — which Trump and Biden pretty much ignored during their testy throw-down:

Biden Tells Trump to “Shut Up"" But Isn't Ready for Trump to BRING THE FIRE! youtu.be

Not the first time

This idea of safe spaces for college students to deal with emotional trauma accompanying elections is nothing new.

You might recall that Marquette University's counseling center advertised a safe space for students to ""de-stress"" from the ravages of the 2018 midterm elections. Among the perks were ""stress busting activities,"" ""a gratitude board,"" and ""self-care strategies.""

And a Georgetown University LGBT student group was set to host a ""Self-Care Night"" featuring ""Legos, juice boxes, and more!"" on the Monday after Trump's 2017 inauguration — recognizing what students have been through ""after a long week."" Apparently stuffed animals and coloring books also were on the agenda.

Oh, and a ""Meeting of Healing"" took place at the University of Connecticut in response to a conservative speaker's appearance at the school in 2017.

College offers gender pronoun stickers 'so each individual feels safe navigating' campus,"The University of California, San Francisco, offers gender pronoun ""stickers"" that can be affixed to school identification cards in order to ""reduce instances of misgendering"" and to ensure ""each individual feels safe navigating UCSF.""

""As a university that recognizes and appreciates diversity, UCSF strives to create an inclusive environment for all of our community members,"" according to the school's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. ""It is important to offer opportunities for all members to share their gender pronouns in settings where they are asked to introduce themselves. Whether you are working with a colleague, peer, or patient — we want to allow for everyone to specifically indicate their pronouns so each individual feels safe navigating UCSF.""

The site further explains that the stickers ""aim to reduce instances of misgendering and to make it easier for you to know which pronouns to use for someone you just met, especially if you are not sure about their correct gender pronouns.""

What do the stickers say?

Well, there are ""he, him, his"" and ""she, her, hers"" stickers available for less adventurous campus travelers — along with a grammatically incorrect ""they, them, theirs"" sticker (not that it's from a college or anything) along with ""ze, hir, hirs,"" whatever that means. Oh, and if you want to gab with your counterpart a bit, there's also an ""ask me about my pronouns"" option:





Image source: UCSF website

The site adds: ""We encourage everyone to add a pronoun sticker to your UCSF ID badge. Stickers are available in the LGBT Resource Center located at MU108W.""

Why stop there?

Hopefully, the UCSF LGBT Resource Center is offering additional options beyond what's seen on its website — but if not, it could always take cues from other campuses that have announced a bevy of possible pronouns for every occasion.

Take the LGBT group at the University of Georgia. Last year it opened the door for other pronouns such as ""per"" and ""ve"" and ""ver"" and ""eirs"" and ""eirself"" — along with ""vis,"" ""vers"" and ""verself."" Not content with additional vocabulary, the group also decreed that folks must use a person's correct gender pronoun even if they're not with that person.

Colonial Williamsburg aims to tell the 'queer history' of America's founding,"""Colonial Williamsburg was a lot queerer than we were led to believe,"" said a recent report in Out Magazine, ""Colonial Williamsburg Is Uncovering America's Hidden Queer History,"" which details efforts under way at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation to uncover America's hidden LGBTQ history.

The popular living history museum in Williamsburg, Virginia, has reportedly spent the last two years poring through archives to uncover the nation's so-called ""queer history"" in order to produce programming that tells the ""complete"" story of the time period.

The initiative was originally intended for the creation of an internal sourcebook that could be used by interpreters seeking to answer visitors' questions, the Virginia Gazette reported.

But now, with some research under its belt, the foundation claims it is nearly ready to introduce programs and re-enactments aimed at educating the public on the LGBTQ history of the colonies.

It all started in 2019 when Aubrey Moog-Ayers, an apprentice weaver at the museum who identifies as queer, was approached by a gay male couple asking what life was like for queer individuals in colonial America.

In an interview with Atlas Obscura, Moog-Ayers recalled that she didn't know what to say, but the question ignited a drive within her to search for answers. So she got together with other staff members and urged the foundation to fund research into the city's queer history. The foundation agreed, and the Colonial Williamsburg Gender and Sexual Diversity Research Committee was born.

Committee researcher Ren Tolson noted that the research has been slow and ""difficult,"" but nonetheless rewarding. He said despite what many might believe, there are numerous examples of queer colonialists, it's just hard to locate them within the historical record.

""It's not that the information isn't there, it's that it hasn't been properly researched and a lot of other groups are overrepresented in the historic record,"" Tolson recently told the Gazette. ""We just assumed that people had similar ideas as current day and moved on, but that's not entirely the case.""

For now, all Tolson has been able to produce — for public consumption, anyways — is a story about a lesbian couple seeking to obtain a marriage license.

Unearthed documents allegedly tell the story of an affluent landowning Virginian woman who was denied a marriage license to another woman since local law only issued marriage licenses to male and female couples. Only she returned the next day dressed as a man and was granted her request.

Commenting on the discovery, Out Magazine said, ""The eye-opening discovery proved LGBTQ+ folks existed at the time and, apparently, enjoyed some tolerance from the greater community.""

Tolson insists that more has been discovered and that the foundation will soon begin rolling out programs, the first of which will be a dramatization of the ""Ladies of Llangollen,"" a true story about two 18th century women whose romantic relationship garnered the attention of Queen Charlotte.

""It turns out we were always here and queer, we were just kept out of the history books,"" Out Magazine added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colonial-williamsburg-queer-history-americas-founding,2021-08-11
Democrats pounce on Boebert after Colorado Springs shooting,"Democrats pounced on Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado after the GOP lawmaker issued an innocuous tweet in the wake of a shooting at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs that left several dead and others wounded.

Boebert described the shooting as ""awful,"" said that she was praying for the victims and their relatives, and added that unlawful violence must stop.

""The news out of Colorado Springs is absolutely awful. This morning the victims & their families are in my prayers. This lawless violence needs to end and end quickly,"" Boebert tweeted.

Transgender Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone called for Boebert's resignation and claimed that the GOP lawmaker has blood on her hands.

""Thanks for the 'thoughts and prayers' but that does nothing to offset the damage that you directly did to incite these kinds of attacks on the LGBTQ+ community. You spreading tropes and insults contributed to the hatred for us. There's blood on your hands. Just resign,"" Titone tweeted.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York tweeted, ""@laurenboebert you have played a major role in elevating anti-LGBT+ hate rhetoric and anti-trans lies while spending your time in Congress blocking even the most common sense gun safety laws. You don't get to 'thoughts and prayers' your way out of this. Look inward and change.""

California state Sen. Scott Wiener highlighted a June tweet in which Boebert had declared, ""Take your children to CHURCH, not drag bars.""

""You regularly pour lighter fluid on anti-LGBTQ hate & help fuel this kind of violence. This bar was literally scheduled to host a drag brunch this morning — the exact people you regularly demonize as harming children,"" Wiener tweeted. ""You're complicit.""

According to the nightclub's Facebook page, Club Q had been planning to hold an ""ALL AGES DRAG BRUNCH"" on Sunday.

""Your record 'is absolutely awful.' You use hateful rhetoric towards the LGBTQ+ community and helped block even modest efforts to end gun violence. You're also one of the reasons we put metal detectors outside the House floor,"" U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York tweeted.

Commentary: Can a Christian be a 'decent' person? Not according to Biden and other liberals,"Former Vice President Joe Biden got in trouble for calling current Vice President Mike Pence ""a decent guy.""

On the surface, the situation is rather trivial and ridiculous. A likely presidential candidate having to essentially apologize for calling another politician ""decent"" illustrates how uncivil politics have become.

But why did Biden's ""decent"" compliment make people so mad? Because Pence's Christian beliefs, and the political decisions he has made as a result of those beliefs, are increasingly unacceptable in contemporary society.

What's wrong with Mike Pence?

Pence is often accused of being ""anti-LGBTQ."" He has affirmed the Christian belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. He fought for religious freedom as governor of Indiana. He opposed the Obama administration directive that required schools to allow students to use bathrooms according to gender identity rather than biological sex.

He and his wife, Karen, recently faced criticism because the Second Lady teaches at a private Christian school that requires applicants to affirm the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, and which bans any sexual activity outside of marriage, whether homosexual or heterosexual.

Pence has a personal policy, one shared by some church pastors, of not dining alone with a woman who is not his wife, which made him the source of numerous mocking or critical articles that called the policy sexist or indicated that Pence may lack self-control.

Democrats believe President Donald Trump is a racist, lying, treasonous criminal who is unqualified for the job and who deserves to be removed from office and possibly thrown into prison. But some of those same Democrats also question whether removing Trump is the right decision—because they believe Pence is worse.

Mike Pence's sin in the eyes of his political and ideological opponents is that he's too Christian. Many things are excused in today's politics—corruption, immorality, dishonesty, ignorance—but a Christianity that is too bold and unwavering in the face of ever-changing societal norms is becoming a disqualifying characteristic.

Public Christians have to choose

When Christians see how someone like Pence is received, we have to look at ourselves. We have to look at our jobs, our social circles, our public platforms and our ambitions, and make sure we're ready for the rejection and the opposition we will face if we don't compromise our beliefs.

The other side will not compromise on our behalf. And if we compromise the principles of our faith on their behalf, it will not satisfy them for long. In the months and years to come, the standards will change, and they will demand that we abandon another belief in order to avoid their charge of bigotry.

Today the issues may be marriage or gender or abortion. Who knows what the issues of tomorrow will be.

That Joe Biden can't get away with calling Mike Pence a decent guy shows that Christianity is not decent to many liberals unless it is a Christianity that shifts with the culture. That is not what Christianity is meant to do.

Christians are to stand firm in the faith and not be conformed to the world. In this world, we will have troubles. Things are not going to get easier. We have to live according to what we know is true, and never fall into the trap of seeking praise from a world that will never fully accept us.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/commentary-can-a-christian-be-a-decent-person-not-according-to-biden-and-other-liberals,2019-03-05
Congressional Republicans submit a bill to define what a woman is,"Republicans in Congress have introduced a bill to define what a woman is.

Republican Representative Debbie Lesko from Arizona sponsored a “Women’s Bill of Rights” to provide additional legal protections to women under federal law, RedState reported.

Noting that establishing a standard for identifying people on the basis of their sex is crucial to societal stability, H. Res. 1136 states: “[T]here are important reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy are implicated.”

The proposed legislation states that “males and females possess unique and immutable biological difference that manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty” and that “biological differences between the sexes can expose females to more harm than males from specific forms of violence, including sexual violence.”

It even defies current leftwing orthodoxy by declaring that only women are able to get pregnant. The bill states “biological difference between the sexes mean that only females may get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed children.”

The bill also indicates that motherhood and fatherhood are reserved for women and men respectively. The bill states “for purposes of Federal law, the word ‘mother’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘father’ is defined as a parent of the male sex.”

Republican Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana, Mary Miller of Illinois, Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, Claudia Tenney of New York, Vicky Hartzler of Missouri, Doug Lambron of Kansas, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Doug LaMalfa, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, and Barry Moore of Alabama submitted the bill along side Lesko.

Banks, who also serves as the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, argued that this legislation is critical in order to protect the rights of women from leftist attacks.

He said, “The modern Democrat party has put the Left’s woke agenda before the rights of women. These days, Democrats refuse to even admit women exist or recognize them as unique beings, with unique abilities. While radical liberals strip away the progress and protections that generations of women fought to achieve. Republicans must fight back and acknowledge these basic biological truths. AS the father of three daughters, I’m proud to co-lead this resolution reaffirming the legal protections afforded to them under federal law.”

According to a press release from the Republican Study Committee, H. Res. 1136 is also supported by several outside women’s interest organizations such as the Independent Women’s Law Center, Concerned Women for America LAC, Women’s Liberation Front, and the Eagle Forum.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congressional-republicans-submit-a-bill-to-define-what-a-woman-is,2022-05-29
Converse announces new partnership with 11-year-old gay child who is famous for dressing in drag and dancing in gay nightclubs,"Converse has announced a new partnership with 11-year-old Desmond Napoles — a self-identified gay child who dresses in drag and frequents gay nightclubs as Desmond is Amazing.

The new campaign, which includes five other models from within the LGBTQ community, was designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pride and features a new collection of footwear.

What are the details?

The site reads, ""What started as a rebellious fight for equality has since grown into a loud, proud assertion of true self-expression. Celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pride with a glitter-dipped collection of parade-worthy sneakers, including our first-ever trans flag design. Because equal rights are for everyone.""

The brand explains that they are committed to ""supporting movements for positive social change and amplifying youth voices as they spark progress to build the future they believe in.""

""Let's spread a message of love together and shout a little louder,"" the page adds.

Desmond's shoes — low-top Chuck-style sneakers with a vivid rainbow design — retail for $95.

On Monday, the company tweeted, ""We're happy to launch our Pride Collection, partnering with six individuals connected to the LGBTQ+ community who show the power of expressing one's true self.""

What else?

Desmond, who appeared on NBC's ""Today"" in 2018, said that he began watching ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" when he was just 3 years old.

Watching the drag queens perform, he said, changed his life, and he knew that he'd just watched a preview of his own future.

The child also says that he's gay and has been ""out"" since birth.

His parents fully support his life choices, and encourage his performances.

"'The cool pope isn't so cool after all': Pope Francis says church won't bless same-sex unions, calls homosexuality a sin","The Vatican published a document Monday saying the Catholic Church would not bless same-sex unions, a statement that likely let down a number of Catholics who identify as LGBT.

Now Pope Francis, whom progressive outlets like Rolling Stone have called the ""cool pope,"" is being seen as not so cool after all for not being woke enough to betray thousands of years of Christian teaching.

What did the pope say?

In a response to the question to the Holy See of ""Does the Church have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons of the same sex?"" the Vatican responded, ""Negative.""

The pope-approved statement called homosexuality a choice and said God ""does not and cannot bless sin,"" which means the church, too, cannot bless sin.

Blessings belong to the category of the sacramentals, whereby the Church “calls us to praise God, encourages us to implore his protection, and exhorts us to seek his mercy by our holiness of life."" In addition, they “have been established as a kind of imitation of the sacraments, blessings are signs above all of spiritual effects that are achieved through the Church's intercession.""



Consequently, in order to conform with the nature of sacramentals, when a blessing is invoked on particular human relationships, in addition to the right intention of those who participate, it is necessary that what is blessed be objectively and positively ordered to receive and express grace, according to the designs of God inscribed in creation, and fully revealed by Christ the Lord. Therefore, only those realities which are in themselves ordered to serve those ends are congruent with the essence of the blessing imparted by the Church.



For this reason, it is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage (i.e., outside the indissoluble union of a man and a woman open in itself to the transmission of life), as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex. The presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator's plan.



Furthermore, since blessings on persons are in relationship with the sacraments, the blessing of homosexual unions cannot be considered licit. This is because they would constitute a certain imitation or analogue of the nuptial blessing invoked on the man and woman united in the sacrament of Matrimony, while in fact “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family.""

No longer a 'cool pope'

Rolling Stone, the leftist progressive entertainment magazine, reported this story on its website under the banner headline ""Guess the Cool Pope Isn't So Cool After All.""

Pope Francis has gained a reputation among left-wing — many non-religious or non-Catholic — fans for being woke on issues near and dear to the left's heart (except, much to their lament, abortion). For example:

The pope said last year that the coronavirus is ""nature's response"" to man's mistreatment of the environment.

Last fall, the pontiff denounced trickle-down economics and private property and advocated for the redistribution of wealth in a papal encyclical.

He used his 2020 Easter address to advocate for a socialist ""universal basic wage.""

Francis was on record saying he was considering adding ""ecological sin"" to the church's official teachings in order to take on ""sin against ecology ... against our common home.""

A couple years ago, there was discussion that the pope may allow married men to become ordained priests and thereby bring an end to celibacy.

In December 2018, rumors swirled that the pope was considering the approval of a significant edit to the Lord's Prayer.

He added environmentalism to the church's seven works of mercy in 2016.

In October, the pope appeared to endorse same-sex civil unions in a documentary in which he discussed pastoral care for those who identify as LGBT. (The Vatican said the comments were taken out of context.)

Last November, he praised NBA players for their racial justice protests.

So it's no wonder that the reporters and editors at Rolling Stone were taken aback by the pope daring to uphold 2,000 years of Christian teaching by calling homosexuality a sin and standing for traditional marriage.

In fact, the rag pointed out that it's got to be tough for the pope to be cool when he's running a backwards, two-millennia-old faith organization:

Rightly or wrongly, Pope Francis has long enjoyed the reputation as the “cool pope,"" a view that has been bolstered by, among other things, his public statements in support of the theory of evolution and a 2014 profile in the pages of this magazine. A documentary released last fall even appeared to suggest his emerging support for same-sex pairings.



As it turns out, however, it's pretty difficult to be hip and woke and with-it if you're the face of a retrograde thousands-year-old religious institution, as the Vatican clarified in a statement on Monday that it would not bless same-sex unions on the grounds that God “does not and cannot bless sin.""

The pope's critics, naturally, said he was somehow hypocritical for calling homosexuality a sin while numerous priests stand accused of pedophilia — a scandal the pope has condemned.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cool-pope-homosexuality-same-sex-unions,2021-03-15
Cops say tire mark on rainbow pride crosswalk is 'gesture of hate' — and get mocked mercilessly,"Police in West Vancouver, British Columbia, called a tire mark on a rainbow pride crosswalk a ""gesture of hate,"" City News reported.

What are the details?

The rainbow pride crosswalk at the intersection of 16th Street and Esquimalt Avenue was unveiled June 30:

But a week later — around 4 p.m. Tuesday — staff inside the West Vancouver Police station heard a loud, sustained squealing sound, City News said.

A tire mark was found on the crosswalk — and police had a theory as to who's responsible for leaving it:

Surveillance video shows the same car from the latter tweet at the intersection and taking a right turn:

Two people appeared to be in the vehicle, the outlet reported.

What did police have to say?

""This is very upsetting,"" Cst. Kevin Goodmurphy said in a release, according to City News. ""For whatever reason, this person has chosen to leave a gesture of hate on a crosswalk that stands for the exact opposite.""

And on Thursday, police tweeted that they've identified the driver they believe is responsible for leaving the tire mark and included a thank you to ""those who have come forward with information.""

How are observers reacting?

Upon hearing the news that the cops got their man, so to speak, folks on Twitter mocked police without mercy:

""Y'all are a joke,"" one user said.

""It's ok everyone we're safe now,"" another person quipped.

""It's good to see tax payers money being used to find the skid mark bandits,"" someone else said.

""Do I need to be gay to use the crosswalk?"" another commenter inquired.

""How do you even take yourselves seriously?"" yet another user queried.

""If this is what you guys do, let me just say I'm getting on board with abolishing the police. If you guys are going to be useless, we don't need you,"" one user added.

""If you look closely, there are hardly any skid marks on the white stripe,"" one cheeky commenter noticed. ""This driver must have been homophobic AND a white supremacist.""

Republican lawmaker checkmates Rep. Cori Bush after she blames GOP for 'hate-driven murders' of LGBT people,"Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) tried to blame Republicans for violence against LGBT people on Wednesday, but Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) refused to let her claims go unaddressed.

During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on alleged violence against LGBT-identifying persons, Bush outright blamed Republicans for fomenting deadly hate against the LGBT community.

Specifically, Bush targeted Republicans for passing what she described as ""anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.""

""They've repeatedly — it's absolutely disgusting — filed library book bans on doctor-recommended care, student organization bans, and sports bans,"" she said.

Then, after asking one of the witnesses a question about such bills, Bush declared, ""Hate drives these Republican bills, which in turn drive dangerous hate and violence towards our LGBTQ+ community. In Missouri, my state, we have seen multiple hate-driven murders of our trans siblings in recent years.""

In another question, Bush condemned the ""Republicans' obsessive attack on trans and gay rights"" and drew an explicit connection between ""the Republican crusade to target the LGBTQ+ community"" and a surge in ""hateful, anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric.""

In response, Comer noted that St. Louis, which is located in the congressional district that Bush represents, is plagued by violent crime.

So he wondered: If Bush is so concerned about violent crime, what about the crime in her own community?

""You know, I'm not even gonna comment on what Ms. Bush said, but I'll say this: Crime is going to be a top priority for Republicans in this committee in the next Congress, and perhaps Ms. Bush could come give us some pointers on how she's reduced crime in St. Louis since she's been in Congress and what her ideas are to further reduce crime in St. Louis,"" Comer said after Bush's questioning.

""Wait a minute... St. Louis has one of the highest crime rates in America,"" he observed.

Comer will likely become the next chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee once Republicans take control of the Senate in January.

Bush, meanwhile, is one of Congress' most far-left lawmakers. She is an ardent supporter of the defund the police movement — even to the chagrin of her own party.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cori-bush-blames-gop-lgbt-hate,2022-12-15
Court dismisses Christian photographer's case challenging New York laws that would require her to service gay weddings,"In a blow to religious liberty, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York dismissed a case brought by a Christian photographer who sought to challenge state laws that would prohibit her from refusing to provide her services at homosexual weddings.

Emilee Carpenter had lodged the suit against New York attorney general and two other officials.

""If Emilee ... speaks consistent with her faith, New York officials can force her business and her personally to pay limitless damages and a $100,000 fine, require her to create artwork against her beliefs via court order, revoke her business license, and lock her in jail for up to a year,"" Carpenter's suit claims.



The suit, which was filed in April, notes that Carpenter had received at least seven requests to work at same-sex weddings over the prior year, but that she had not responded to them.

Part of the court's decision states that ""the Court concludes that New York has a compelling interest in ensuring that individuals, without regard to sexual orientation, have equal access to publicly available goods and services, and that the Accommodation clause is narrowly tailored, as applied to Plaintiff, to serve that interest. As a result, even if the Accommodation clause compels speech or expressive association in a manner that implicates Plaintiff’s free-speech and free-association interests, the provision survives strict scrutiny.""



Alliance Defending Freedom, an organization that is frequently at the forefront of the battle for religious liberty, said that ADF attorneys representing Carpenter would request the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the decision.

""The court's decision continues down a dangerous path of the government compelling artists to speak messages that violate their religious beliefs — or imposing steep fines, closing their businesses, or throwing them in jail,” ADF senior counsel Jonathan Scruggs said in a statement.



But Attorney General Letitia James hailed the court's move in a statement.

“This court decision is a huge victory in our pursuit to ensure that every New Yorker has equal access and equal protections under the law,” James said. ""The LGBTQ+ community is an integral part of New York, and no New Yorker should be excluded or turned away from a business or denied a service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Love is love, which is why my office will always fight to ensure that all New Yorkers are treated equally under the law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/court-dismisses-christian-photographer-s-case-challenging-new-york-laws-that-would-force-her-to-service-gay-weddings,2021-12-17
Court observers believe Chief Justice Roberts just signaled that abortion rights could be overturned,"Court observers suggested Thursday that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has signaled the court will significantly slash abortion rights.

What is the background?

In December, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The case is centered on a Mississippi abortion law that prohibits abortion beyond 15 weeks of gestation.

At issue is whether ""all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.""

The case ultimately challenges the precedent established by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which both upheld the right to elective abortions under Roe v. Wade and affirmed the unfettered legality of abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.

What happened with Roberts?

On Thursday, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision in Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, ruling that ""emotional distress damages are not recoverable in a private action to enforce either the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Affordable Care Act.""

The case is completely unrelated to abortion. But what is interesting, however, is who wrote the majority opinion: Roberts. This matters because the court heard oral arguments for nine cases in December; thus each justice was most likely assigned to write the opinion of one case. Therefore, if Roberts wrote the opinion in this case, it suggests he is not writing the opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Roberts' authorship of this opinion suggests (but does not guarantee) that he is NOT writing the abortion decision. Otherwise, he would have two majority opinions from the December sitting and some other justice would have none,"" observed Bloomberg News Supreme Court reporter Greg Stohr.

Michigan Law School assistant professor Leah Litman pointed out the significance of this: Because Roberts supports narrowing abortion access but not overturning Roe v. Wade completely, the fact that he may not have been assigned the Dobbs opinion hints that a consequential ruling is forthcoming, probably a rolling back of abortion rights.

Stohr, however, cautioned against rushing to assumptions, because Justice Neil Gorsuch authored two opinions for cases the court heard in November. Still, the distribution of opinion-writing is normally balanced.

The Wall Street Journal editorial board theorized recently that Roberts may attempt to recruit at least one conservative justice to uphold the Mississippi law without a wholesale nullification of abortion rights. It has happened once, when Gorsuch joined Roberts and the court's left-leaning justices to protect LGBT rights, but whether it will happen again remains to be seen.

For what it's worth, the Journal predicted the outcome of Dobbs will be a 5-4 ruling with Roberts joining the court's left-leaning justices and Justice Samuel Alito writing the majority opinion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/court-observers-believe-roberts-signals-major-abortion-decision,2022-04-29
Yeshiva University ends all student groups after court  orders it to recognize gay activist student group,"When presented with a court order to formally recognize an LGBT student group, the Jewish Yeshiva University in New York City determined it would be optimal to ""hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the US Supreme Court to protect YU's religious freedom.""

Katie Rosenfeld, the lawyer for the unofficial gay activist group that sued the college for recognition, characterized the college's refusal to back down as a ""shameful tactic,"" likening it to the stratagems of segregationists.

An ongoing battle

In 2018, a gay activist student group was informally created at Yeshiva University. The school is said to have overrode the student council's 2019 approval of the group and to have blocked its recognition again in 2020.

The college, which continues a 136-year commitment to religious identity, explained that the conference of official status to the group would be ""inconsistent with the school's Torah values and the religious environment it seeks to maintain.""

As controversy first began to mount, the university released a statement suggesting ""The message of Torah on this issue is nuanced, both accepting each individual with love and affirming its timeless prescriptions. While students will of course socialize in gatherings they see fit, forming a new club as requested under the auspices of YU will cloud this nuanced message.""

While opposed to formally recognizing a gay student group, the university made explicit its ongoing commitment to support gay students as well as to prohibit discrimination and harassment.

On April 27, 2021, a cadre of former and past students sued Yeshiva University to force the institution to recognize their gay activist group, the Yeshiva University Pride Alliance. The students behind the suit suggested that the college's refusal amounted to a violation of New York's human rights law.

In June, Democratic Judge Lynn Kotler of the New York Supreme Court First Judicial District ruled that Yeshiva University must approve the formation of the gay activist club. Kotler argued that the college did not constitute a ""religious corporation,"" but was instead — according to its own charter — an ""educational corporation,"" meaning the city's anti-discrimination law applied.

A university spokesman took issue with Kotler's insistence that the university was not a religious institution, telling the Commentator: ""As our name indicates, Yeshiva University was founded to instill Torah values in its students while providing a stellar education, allowing them to live with religious conviction as noble citizens and committed Jews.""

The college has reportedly also maintained that its non-sectarian status was based on its non-discriminatory practices in its admissions rather than on its administrative decisions.



The spokesman added that the ""court's ruling violates the religious liberty upon which this country was founded.""

Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, stated, ""When secular authorities try to tell Yeshiva University that it is not religious, you know something has gone terribly wrong ... The First Amendment protects Yeshiva's right to practice its faith.""



The university issued an emergency request to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking relief from the order, which the justices summarized as ""requiring the University to treat an LGBTQ student group similarly to other student groups in its student club recognition process.""

On September 14, the Supreme Court refused to block the order in a 5-4 decision, with conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh voting in the majority.



In an unsigned order, the majority wrote that the university should return to the state court to seek quick review and temporary relief while the case continues.

Though set back, not defeated

Rabbi Dr. Ari Berman, the president of the college, issued a statement after the decision was handed down: ""Every faith-based university in the country has the right to work with its students, including its LGBTQ students, to establish the clubs, places and spaces that fit within its tradition.""

He noted ""Yeshiva University simply seeks that same right of self-determination.""

Berman indicated that the college will seek to restore that right by pursuing ""the roadmap"" presented to the college by the Supreme Court.

In the interim, all student clubs and groups will be suspended.

The president of the college's student union, Baruch Lerman, noted that he and his organization ""were not expecting the university to take this drastic measure, and have not received any guidance about how we are to proceed with approving clubs."" He also told the Commentator that they have also not recieved instruction on how to proceed hosting student council events.

Lerman also indicated he would insist that student activity fees ""on every student's tuition bill be prorated for the extent of the time that student activities are suspended.""

A spokesman told Fox News that the school expects ""a quick conclusion in the courts and the start of clubs soon.""

Not fighting alone

Seattle Pacific University, a Christian college in Washington state, filed a lawsuit on July 27 against Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington, claiming he had encroached upon its constitutional rights as they relate to the institution's private religious convictions, communications, and hiring practices.

In its lawsuit, SPU stated it ""expects its faculty, staff and leadership to agree with the University's statement on faith and to live out that faith as a model for others, including by living according to the University's religious teachings on marriage.""

Members of the board of trustees of SPU are now being sued for barring persons in gay relationships from working full-time.

At Brigham Young University, students and gay activists protested earlier this month when the LDS college removed pamphlets promoting gay activism, events, and other resources from new students' welcome bags. BYU's honor code prohibits ""same-sex romantic behavior.""

As part of the protests at BYU, the so called RaYnbow Collective held a drag show for students which was also open to children.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/court-ordered-to-recognize-gay-activist-student-group-yeshiva-university-ends-all-student-groups,2022-09-19
"Ted Cruz calls out the NBA and other leagues for hypocritical virtue signaling on LGBT agenda, while caving to China","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blasted the National Basketball Association for kowtowing to China over free speech, and blasted all sports leagues for virtue signaling in America on LGBT causes while caving to China.

Cruz called in to speak to CNBC host Joe Kern when he made the comments.

Kern asked him to comment about the ostentatious posturing of the NBA as a ""woke"" league even as they stifled free speech in order to maintain their business relationship with China.

""Well and Joe, it's a striking contrast, we've seen when different states in the United States have passed laws protecting religious liberty that athletic leagues have been perfectly willing to declare boycotts of those states and denounce them loudly based on LGBT issues well that's easier to do because that doesn't cost them any money,"" Cruz explained.

""So it lets them virtue signal all day long, but there's nothing at stake,"" he added.

The NBA has faced public outcry over their efforts to shut down critics of Chinese aggression in Hong Kong, including the silencing of league employees who said they supported the liberty movement against the communist government.

""Here, when the Chinese communists in Hong Kong are oppressing dissidents, are suppressing free speech, are violating human rights, where the stakes matter intensely, and there's a choice between standing for free speech and human rights or making another buck, sadly the NBA has demonstrated where its priorities lie, and I believe we can do better,"" Cruz continued.

""Any time an American business does business with China, there are risks,"" he concluded, ""but if our companies are willing to be essentially an arm of Chinese censorship, that exports their repressive policies and regimes to the United States and globally.""



Kern pointed out that it was a bad strategy for China because it helps push critics of President Donald Trump's foreign policy to his side.

Cruz also accused of China of ""economic coercion"" all over the globe, saying it was ""profoundly dangerous.""

Republican senator apologizes after affirming 'fundamental scientific truth' of biological sex,"Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.) has caved to the outrage mob, issuing an apology after affirming the existence of ""two sexes"" as absolute scientific truth.

What is the background?

While speaking to graduates at the University of Wyoming commencement on Saturday, Lummis observed that truth itself is under attack in our postmodern world, including the ""fundamental scientific truth"" about biological sex.

""[This includes] our rights to freedom of speech, religion, property, assembly, and to keep and bear arms,"" Lummis said, adding, ""Even fundamental scientific truths, such as the existence of two sexes — male and female — are subject to challenge these days.""



The crowd of graduates immediately reacted with loud jeers and boos. Lummis tried to save face, but swiftly moved to a different topic when the raucous crowd did not subside.

What did the apology say?

The Wyoming senator apologized for making people feel ""un-welcomed"" and ""disrespected"" for affirming the truth about biological sex.

""My reference to the existence of two sexes was intended to highlight the times in which we find ourselves, times in which the metric of biological sex is under debate with potential implications for the shared Wyoming value of equality,"" she said in a statement, according to Oil City News.

""I share the fundamental belief that women and men are equal, but also acknowledge that there are biological differences and circumstances in which these differences need to be recognized,"" she continued. ""That being said, it was never my intention to make anyone feel un-welcomed or disrespected, and for that I apologize. I have appreciated hearing from members of the University of Wyoming community on this issue, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue.""

What did the university say?

The university also released a statement apologizing for Lummis' remarks.

Writing to university faculty and students, the statement claimed that Lummis' comment — that biological sex is a fundamental scientific truth — is ""not the scientific truth.""

""Regardless of biological sex, gender has a wide variety of expression. Research and lived experience continue to reveal more about the connection and interaction of gender presentation and identity,"" the statement added.

The statement also described Lummis' comments as ""harmful"" and ""marginalizing,"" claiming they distracted from the accomplishments of graduates that the commencement ceremony was meant to celebrate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cynthia-lummis-apologizes-two-sexes,2022-05-17
"Damon Wayans says Dave Chappelle's highly controversial Netflix special 'freed the slaves,' knocks cancel culture: 'You're no longer free in this country'","Comedian Damon Wayans says that fellow funnyman Dave Chappelle ""freed the slaves"" with his recent stand-up special, ""The Closer,"" TMZ reports.

What's 'The Closer?'

Chappelle, 48, has been at the center of a controversy surrounding the special after making jokes about transgenderism and other politically charged hot-button topics.

In response to the outcry, a Netflix executive said that despite hordes of critics calling for the special to be removed from the streaming giant's online library, the sanctity of ""artistic freedom"" must be preserved.

You can read more about the special here.

What are the details?

Wayans, 61, told TMZ on Monday that he thought Chappelle's Netflix special was nothing short of brilliant.

""I feel like Dave freed the slaves,"" the comedian and actor said. ""Yeah, the comedians. We were slaves to PC culture and he just, you know — as an artist, he's van Gogh. He cut his ear off. He's trying to tell us it's OK.""

He added, ""I can't speak about the content of the show, but what I say is, there's a bigger conversation we need to have. Someone needs to look us in the eye and go, 'You're no longer free in this country. You're not free to say what you want. You say what we want you to say. Otherwise, we will cancel you.' That's the discussion we should have.""

When asked if he feels if he now feels freer to ""be a bit more risqué"" with his own comedy, the longtime comedian said that he has ""always"" been free.

""I've always been free — but I just think he's saying, 'You know what? All that I have, I'm not afraid to lose it for the sake of creative freeness of speech,'"" Wayans insisted. ""You can't edit yourself. Comedians, we're like — Mercedes makes a great car, but you gotta crash a lot of them before they perfect it.""

He concluded, ""[Chappelle is] a unicorn. He's amazing. He's a van Gogh.""

Earlier this week, Netflix co-CEO and chief creative officer Ted Sarandos defended Chappelle's work.

“Chappelle is one of the most popular stand-up comedians today, and we have a long-standing deal with him,"" he said in a memo about the special. ""His last special 'Sticks & Stones,' also controversial, is our most-watched, stickiest and most award-winning stand-up special to date. As with our other talent, we work hard to support their creative freedom — even though this means there will always be content on Netflix some people believe is harmful.""

Dave Chappelle refuses to cave to angry students who call him 'bigot' for anti-woke comedy; Democrat comes to his defense,"Comedian Dave Chappelle reportedly refused to back down after angry students confronted him when he made a surprise visit to his alma mater in Washington, D.C., this week.

What happened?

Chappelle visited his alma mater, the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, on Tuesday, where he spoke to an auditorium of nearly 600 students and responded to backlash stemming from his most recent Netflix special, ""The Closer.""

According to Politico, students both cheered and booed Chappelle. At one point, an antagonistic student stepped up to a microphone and called Chappelle a ""bigot"" over his LGBT jokes. ""I'm 16 and I think you're childish, you handled it like a child,"" the student reportedly said.

But for students hoping for an apology from Chappelle, the legendary comedian immediately disappointed — and refused to cave to pressure.

""My friend, with all due respect, I don't believe you could make one of the decisions I have to make on a given day,"" Chappelle reportedly told the student. Sources told Politico the response angered students even more.

Later, in response to another hostile student, Chappelle — as one of the most successful stand-up comedians — pointed out the obvious. ""I'm better than every instrumentalist, artist, no matter what art you do in this school, right now, I'm better than all of you. I'm sure that will change. I'm sure you'll be household names soon,"" he said.

One particular exchange incited outrage from parents.

According to Politico, one student told Chappelle, ""Your comedy kills."" Chappelle fired back that, ""n****** are killed every day.""

Politico reported:

The two students we spoke to declined to go on the record out of fear of retribution from the school. The father of one of the students, who also declined to speak publicly to protect the identity of his daughter, said, ""As a parent, I have to say I have a real problem. … He was being dead serious and using the n-word on the record. What kind of judgment is the school showing to allow that?""

Students were reportedly angry because Chappelle did not take seriously their concerns that his comedy is offensive. One student claimed there was a ""huge power imbalance"" between Chappelle and students because Chappelle made students place their phones in special containers, thereby preventing recordings, before his appearance.

What did Chappelle respond?

Carla Sims, a spokesperson for Chappelle, responded to the tense meeting by saying, ""They are complaining that he talked and said the n-word. If anything, Dave is putting the school on the map.""

In fact, Chappelle has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the arts school, has brought mega celebrities to meet with students, and even extended that generosity again this week by donating Thanksgiving meals to students and staff.

""[Chappelle] said these kids deserve an F for forgiveness,"" Sims said. But, ""Give them some space to grow. They are going to say things that are immature.""

Anything else?

Democrat Andrew Yang spoke out on Friday to defend Chappelle amid criticism from blue checkmark liberals who chided Chappelle for his remarks to the students.

""I was endorsed by a number of celebrities. Dave Chappelle is the only one who came to Iowa and South Carolina to perform on my behalf — with proceeds going to the campaign — and even made phone calls and hung out with staff. He did it because he wants to help people. Great guy,"" Yang said.

""The press hit job on his visiting his high school is awful. Successful alum who fundraises for school returns, speaks to students and gives everyone a free meal for Thanksgiving. But of course in 2021 an obvious positive gesture is framed negatively in the media,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dave-chappelle-angry-students,2021-11-27
'Gender is a fact': Dave Chappelle triggers critics with new politically incorrect comedy special,"Comedian Dave Chappelle dropped a new Netflix comedy special this week, titled ""The Closer,"" and progressives are already seething over Chappelle's politically incorrect jokes.

What did Chappelle say?

Toward the end of the show, Chappelle responded to critics of his last special, ""Sticks & Stones,"" over which he was accused of ""punching down"" and being ""transphobic,"" ""homophobic,"" and other LGBT-related phobias.

Chappelle pointed out that his critics clearly have not listened to his comedy, for if they had, they would understand that he has never had a problem with LGBT people.

""Any of you who have ever watched me know that I have never had a problem with transgender people. If you listen to what I'm saying, clearly, my problem has always been with white people,"" Chappelle joked.

The comedian then addressed ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling, whom Chappelle explained was ""canceled"" for saying that gender is real. Rowling, as a feminist, believes that, if gender is not real, then ""the lived reality of women globally is erased."" Critics have labeled Rowling a ""TERF,"" or ""trans-exclusionary radical feminist.""

Chappelle proudly proclaimed, ""'I'm team TERF!""

""Gender is a fact,"" he stated. ""Every human being in this room, every human being on earth, had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth. That is a fact.""

""Now, I am not saying that to say transwomen aren't women, I am just saying that those p***ies that they got ... you know what I mean? I'm not saying it's not p***y, but it's Beyond P***y or Impossible P***y,"" Chappelle joked. ""It tastes like p***y, but that's not quite what it is, is it? That's not blood. That's beet juice.""

At the end of the show, Chappelle said he would stop telling LGBT jokes ""until we are both sure that we are laughing together. I'm telling you, it's done. I'm done talking about it.""

He then made one request of the LGBT community, ""All I ask of your community, with all humility: Will you please stop punching down on my people."" Chappelle was referring to Kevin Hart, who was unable to host the Oscars over old jokes, and rapper DaBaby, who similarly has been scrutinized for what LGBT people claim are offensive comments.

""In our country, you can shoot and kill a n***a,"" Chappelle said earlier in the comedy special, ""but you better not hurt a gay person's feelings.""

How are critics responding?

In reviewing Chappelle's work, the Daily Beast continued to do what Chappelle was criticizing in his show: The outlet labeled him transphobic. NPR took the criticism a step further, accusing Chappelle of making anti-Semitic jokes, and even said Chappelle was ""using white privilege.""

""Too often in The Closer, it just sounds like Chappelle is using white privilege to excuse his own homophobia and transphobia,"" the NPR review said.

Chappelle's closing line, wrote the NPR reviewer, ""just made me terribly angry and disappointed.""

Meanwhile, a writer at Vulture, an entertainment news website, claimed Chappelle has an ""obsession with trans bodies.""

Chappelle's comedy special currently boasts a 94% audience approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The one professional reviewer who has left a review, however, was thoroughly outraged, and accused Chappelle of ""rampant transphobia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dave-chappelle-gender-politically-incorrect-comedy,2021-10-06
Dave Chappelle's high school proceeds with naming ceremony in spite of controversy,"The Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., announced in a statement that it will stand by its decision to name the school's theatre after comedian Dave Chappelle in spite of the controversy over his Netflix special ""The Closer"" that progressives have called anti-LGBT.

Chappelle's former high school originally postponed the naming ceremony due to threats of a potential walkout by students who were ""uncomfortable"" with his comedy. The protests from students came just weeks after the comedian pledged to donate $100,000 to the arts school, according to DailyMail.com.

""On April 22, 2022, we will celebrate one of our most distinguished alumni, Dave Chappelle, by naming our theatre in his honor. This theatre naming was the desire of one of our founders, Peggy Cooper Cafritz, who recognized Chappelle as an important thought leader of our time,"" said the school in an official statement.

The school intends to use the naming ceremony as a teaching moment in an attempt to create a space of ""diverse viewpoints.""

""Additionally, using Chappelle’s latest works as the impetus, we have expanded our Social Studies curriculum to include content related to political activism, civic engagement, arts activism, and the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality. Our objective is to uplift conversations around artistic freedom and artistic responsibility,"" the school said in its statement.

In an Instagram post on Saturday, Chappelle proposed a challenge in order to raise donations for the school, in which the person offering the highest donation could keep his name on the school's theatre or change it to honor Peggy Cooper Cafritz.

""Talk is cheap (Unless I do it). The Duke Ellington School is a glorious institution. Within those walls I found a context to exploit my creativity seriously. Duke Ellington, in large part, prepared me to undertake this noble and difficult profession,"" Chappelle said on Instagram Saturday.









Duke Ellington High School said it would not change the name of the theatre but would accept all donations made to the school, according to The Hill.

DC anchor suspended for tweeting he's 'annoyed' obese people prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines,"A news anchor for WTTG-TV out of Washington, D.C., has been suspended following backlash he and the station received after he tweeted that he was ""annoyed"" over ""obese people"" being prioritized for the coronavirus vaccines over essential workers like him.

What are the details?

On Tuesday, McCoy tweeted, ""I'm annoyed obese people of all ages get priority vaccine access before all essential workers. When most stayed home, we went into work everyday last March, April, May and everyday since putting ourselves & loved ones at risk.""

He argued, ""Vaccinate all essential workers. Then obese.""

McCoy took heat from fellow Twitter users over his post and deleted the message. Within hours, he tweeted, ""Earlier today I Tweeted something insensitive and offensive. I truly regret my words and want to apologize. I have deleted my tweet and ask that you accept my sincere apology.""

But McCoy continued to be lambasted by users who claimed his apology wasn't sincere, pointing to an earlier response he sent that explained his original tweet and appeared to defend his position.

He wrote, ""I deleted because, frankly, who has the time to argue with strangers on the internet. But many people I know have quietly cut the line through various ways in various states. Rules seen as inequitable or unjust erode confidence in system & drive urge to cheat it.""

What was the LGBTQ response?

LGBTQ Nation called McCoy's apology ""tepid"" and lambasted the anchor (who happens to be gay), accusing him of hypocrisy because McCoy ""broadcast from his home at the beginning of the pandemic.""

The outlet further reported, ""McCoy has been traveling around the country for trips, but he's upset people with a health condition can get a vaccine before he can. He's an 'essential worker.'""

The Washington Blade, which hails itself as ""America's LGBT News Source,"" noted Wednesday that McCoy is gay and reported he has now been suspended, after people called his employer to complain over his tweet.

According to the outlet, a spokesperson for WTTG confirmed ""the suspension was related to McCoy's Twitter post about obese people and the COVID vaccine.""

The Washington Blade wrote that McCoy could not be immediately reached for comment. He has served as a weekday co-anchor for the station.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-reporter-suspended-for-tweeting-hes-annoyed-obese-people-prioritized-for-covid-19-vaccines,2021-02-25
DC restaurant fined $7k for questioning transgender who used women's restroom,"Washington, D.C., restaurant Cuba Libre has been hit with a $7,000 fine after questioning a transgender activist who used its women's restroom and a manager tried to insist the patron show identification proving to be female.

What are the details?

On June 22, Charlotte Clymer went to the restaurant to attend a bachelorette party for a friend. Clymer identifies as a woman and made the transition from being a man in November 2017.

According to Clymer's account of the June incident to MetroWeekly, when she went to use the women's restroom at Cuba Libre, an employee stopped her and asked for her to show identification. Clymer refused and used the women's facility. Upon exiting, she was approached by the same employee and a manager who insisted that, according to D.C. law, a person must be designated as a ""female"" on their ID in order to use a women's restroom in the city.

Clymer — who works in communications for the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign — argued that she was, indeed, protected under D.C. law and pulled the legislation up on her phone. The next day, Clymer claimed via social media that she had been ""forcibly removed from the restaurant.""

Clymer used her Twitter platform to stress the alleged hostility of the Cuba Libre manager and explained that she felt compelled to expose the ""violent nature"" of the incident in hopes that it would prevent discrimination against other transgender individuals who might not have her level of privilege.

I cannot stress enough the intentionality of this incident. The manager was hostile, condescending, and hateful. And my biggest fear is that this will happen again to someone without my privilege. Someone who's not white, doesn't have a wide network, doesn't know the law, etc.

— Charlotte Clymer🏳️🌈 (@cmclymer) June 24, 2018

So, this weekend, I have tried my best to articulate this story and communicate the violent nature of what took place on Friday night while also trying to be present for my friends and what was meant to be a celebratory weekend with girlfriends.

— Charlotte Clymer🏳️🌈 (@cmclymer) June 24, 2018

Clymer hired a law firm to represent her in filing a civil rights complaint against the restaurant, prompting an investigation from D.C.'s office of the attorney general.

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that the restaurant had violated the District's Human Rights Act by failing to have a written policy ensuring compliance ""with regard to restroom facilities"" and ""did not provide adequate training to employees."" The restaurant was issued a fine, ordered to implement new training for staff, and has agreed to ""post clear signage that, under D.C. law, everyone is allowed to use the restroom that matches their gender identity or expression.""

As part of the settlement, Cuba Libre must:



* Institute policies on civil rights compliance and train staff



* Post clear signage that, under #DC law, everyone is allowed to use the restroom that matches their gender identity or expression



* Pay a $7,000 penalty

— AG Karl A. Racine (@AGKarlRacine) January 16, 2019

How did the restaurant respond?

Cuba Libre issued a series of apologies and updates to the incident via social media. The employees involved in the incident with Clymer were terminated.

"DC school refuses to play sports at Christian school where Karen Pence teaches, claims students don't feel 'safe'","Sheridan School in Washington, D.C., sent an email to parents announcing that its student-athletes would no longer play at the facilities of Immanuel Christian School, where second lady Karen Pence teaches art.

Jessica Donovan, the head of Sheridan, explained that, even though the K-8 progressive school has played at ICS in the past, the recent discovery of the Christian school's ""exclusionary policies"" toward the LGBTQ community create an environment ""some students did not feel safe entering.""



What are the details?

In the letter obtained by The American Conservative, Donovan wrote:

Along with many of you, we learned last week that Immanuel Christian School, a school in our athletic conference, has a written policy prohibiting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students, parents and teachers.

Donovan went in depth describing the ""obvious challenges"" in determining how to deal with this new information. She gathered school officials and student leaders of Sheridan's two varsity basketball teams, and they kicked around the idea of still playing on ICS's turf but ""make a peaceful and respectful statement.""

""As we talked more,"" Donovan continued, ""we understood that some students did not feel safe entering a school that bans LGBTQ parents, students or even families that support LGBTQ rights. Forcing our children to choose between an environment in which they feel unsafe or staying home was not an option.""

Donovan noted, ""We were clear to separate the ideals of Christianity with the policies of this particular school, as we play many Christian schools that support LGBTQ rights.""

Donovan went on to say that Sheridan would still be hosting ICS at home, but that students ""will wear their rainbow socks in support of LGBTQ rights,"" and ""some have made banners that respectfully celebrate LGBTW rights"" to be displayed when the Christian school comes to visit.

Why all the kerfuffle?

A few weeks ago, it was widely reported that ICS requires employment applicants to sign a pledge to ""live a personal life of moral purity."" Part of the vow reads, ""I understand that the term 'marriage' has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive covenant union as delineated in Scripture,"" as quoted by the Washington Post.

It also says that God intended for sexual activity to only occur between ""a man and a woman who are married to each other."" More from the school's pledge:

Moral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, and sexual abuse or improprieties towards minors as defined by Scripture and federal or state law.

The school's Parent Agreement further notes that ICS reserves the right to refuse admission to or kick out any student whose family environment runs counter to biblical principles, including ""participating in, supporting or condoning sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bi-sexual activity, promoting such practices, or being unable to support the moral principles of the school. (Lev. 20:13 and Romans 1:27.)""

Several media outlets labelled Immanuel Christian School as a homophobic institution because of the policies. Newsweek's headline read: ""Karen Pence Teaching At Anti-LGBT School.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-school-refuses-to-play-at-christian-school,2019-01-30
Dean Cain describes the announcement of a bisexual Superman character as 'bandwagoning',"DC Comics announced that the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane will be bisexual, but actor Dean Cain, who more than two decades ago played the role of Superman in the television series ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,"" is not impressed.

""On November 9th the life of Jon Kent, the Superman of Earth and son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, takes a bold new direction,"" DC Comics declared.

""Just like his father before him, Jon Kent has fallen for a reporter. After initially striking up a friendship with reporter Jay Nakamura, he and Jon become romantically involved in the pages of SUPERMAN: SON OF KAL-EL #5 from writer Tom Taylor (DARK KNIGHTS OF STEEL) and artist John Timms (HARLEY QUINN),"" DC Comics explained.

""I say they're bandwagoning,"" Cain said during an interview on Fox News. ""If they had done this 20 years ago, perhaps that woulda been bold and brave.""



Other superhero comic book characters have been written as LGBT, like the Tim Drake version of Robin, the sidekick of Batman.

Cain suggested that it would have been brave to have the Superman character fight for the rights of gay individuals in the the nation of Iran.



But according to the New York Times, so far in the series, ""Jon has combated wildfires caused by climate change, thwarted a high school shooting, and protested the deportation of refugees in Metropolis.""

Cain questioned, ""Why don't they have him fight the injustices that created the refugees,"" or ""for the rights of women to attend school and have the ability to work and live, and boys not to be raped by men under the new warm and fuzzy Taliban. That, that would be brave. There's real evil in this world today ... human trafficking, real actual slavery going on.""

He noted that he does not think he will read the comic: ""I could just watch CNN or MSNBC to get this information.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dean-cain-describes-the-announcement-of-a-bisexual-superman-character-as-bandwagoning,2021-10-13
"Dean of students brags about bringing in LGBT group that passed around sex toys in classroom, talked to kids about 'queer sex'","A high-ranking official at an elite school that serves kids from pre-K through twelfth grade bragged to an undercover reporter that he has gone far beyond bringing drag queens into the classroom.



Joseph Bruno, dean of students at Chicago's Francis W. Parker School, indicated he brought in an LGBT group that passed around sex toys to kids and discussed ""queer sex"" best practices during ""Pride Week.""

Project Veritas released a video of Bruno's remarks on Wednesday.

Since the release of the video, the school, facing significant backlash, has deleted its Twitter and Facebook accounts. The school has also accused Project Veritas of editing the video ""with malicious intent.""

What are the details?

Francis W. Parker School purportedly guides students ""in their learning and development so they can become authentic, effective, responsible and empathic citizens and leaders in our democracy and the wider world.""

To this end, the school's faculty ""is committed to healthy identity formation and intellectual development within each learner at Parker.""

Last week at a National Association of Independent Schools People of Color conference, the school's dean of students unwittingly spoke with an undercover Project Veritas reporter on hidden camera, detailing some of the initiatives that have been undertaken in the classroom to aid in such ""identity formation.""

""During Pride, we do a Pride Week every year, and I had, like, our LGBTQ+ health center come in. They were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students. Talking about queer sex, using lube versus using spit,"" said Bruno.

Bruno indicated that the kids were ""just playing with"" and ""looking at"" the sex toys that had been distributed in the classroom ""while I'm sitting there.""

According to Bruno, some kids asked, ""How does this butt plug work? How do we do, like, how does this work?""

Bruno intimated that ""a really, like, cool part of my job is I don't have to worry"" about potential resistance to prompting and answering such questions and to giving kids lessons on ""queer sex.""

The reporter asked, ""Everybody's cool with that? The butt plugs and the dildos?""



Bruno responded, ""No. ... It's queer sex.""

Having apparently faced little to no opposition from the board of trustees, the administration, or parents, Bruno said he enjoyed ""so much freedom. So much money to do stuff.""

There's plenty of money in the school's coffers, given that tuition ranges from $37,080 to $42,300.



The dean of students said the school also ""had a drag queen come in, pass out cookies and brownies and do photos"" with students ages 14 to 18.



Alex Bevels, the ""non-binary"" man dressed as a woman who was brought into the classroom, ""hung out"" in Bruno's classroom and office.

School doubles down amid backlash

Facing outrage over the Project Veritas video, the school's principal, Dan Frank, issued a release saying, ""We are heartbroken to learn that one of our colleague's words have been severely misrepresented for a malicious purpose.""

Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe responded by suggesting there were no content edits.

""It's just him talking about dildos and butt plugs and spit and awful things with 14-year-old girls. ... There's no edit. What are you talking about? ... Are they saying he didn't say these things? Then sue me!"" said O'Keefe.

""Project Veritas is a far-right activist group that produces deceptively edited videos of secret recordings in an effort to discredit mainstream media organizations, progressive groups and educational institutions,"" wrote the school's principal.

Rather that condemn Bruno's remarks or explain the alleged provision of sex toys to kids, the school stated that ""administrators and Parker's Board of Trustees support Parker's programming, the strength and inclusivity of our curriculum, and the dedicated faculty and staff that teach it.""

Frank said he was ""sickened,"" not by potential sexualization of minors, but by Project Veritas' ""deceptive tactics ... and their attack on the LGBTQ+ community.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dean-of-students-brags-about-bringing-in-lgbt-group-that-passed-around-sex-toys-in-classroom,2022-12-08
Dem PAC slammed for 'sick' attack on domestic violence survivor Sen. Joni Ernst,"A Democratic political action committee has been accused of stooping too low in their attempt to smear a Republican over policy differences on the Violence Against Women Act, when they accused Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) of ""not serving the needs of domestic violence victims"" — when she is a survivor herself.

What are the details?

The VAWA's funding lapsed earlier this year, and rather than reauthorizing the law as it previously stood, the Democrat-led House passed a version with additional provisions such as gun control measures.

Since then, Sen. Ernst has been working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to find a viable bipartisan version of the bill for the upper chamber. But those talks broke down earlier this month, leading Feinstein to introduce the House version. Ernst blocked the move, insisting the proposed legislation was a waste of time because it would not pass the Senate.

In response, Senate Majority PAC tweeted Thursday, ""Unlike @joniernst's version of VAWA, the Senate Democrats VAWA bill actually expands protections for the LGBT community and Native American victims of domestic violence.""

The PAC — linked to allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — added that Ernst ""is sending a message that she's not serving the needs of domestic violence victims and those in the most vulnerable communities. Iowans and victims of domestic violence deserve better than Senator Ernst.""



The Twittersphere was quick to point out that Ernst, herself, is not only a domestic violence survivor but a rape survivor. Conservative writer and radio show host Erick Erickson called the PAC's attack ""sick.""



In response to the tweets, Ernst told reporters in Iowa on Thursday, ""I do not need to be mansplained by Chuck Schumer...I am a survivor. I'm not afraid of anyone, folks. I have been through the worst and I am here today.""

Anything else?

On Thursday morning, Ernst had touted her own version of the bill on Twitter, telling followers, ""As a survivor, protecting women from violence and abuse is incredibly important to me. It's shocking that @SenSchumer is blocking my VAWA bill that:

Triples resources for rape prevention

Addresses female genital mutilation

Puts stricter penalties on child sex abuse.""

"Demi Lovato comes out as pansexual, says she's attracted to 'anything, really'","Pop star Demi Lovato recently opened up about her newfound sexuality in an interview on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, telling host Joe Rogan she is pansexual now and is attracted to ""anything, really.""

The 28-year-old ""Dancing with the Devil"" singer said she is attracted to men, women, and anything in between and described herself as ""fluid"" sexually.

""I'm so fluid now, and a part of the reason why I am so fluid is because I was, like, super closeted off,"" she said, prompting Rogan to ask, ""You mean sexually fluid? You like girls? You like boys?""

""Yeah, anything, really"" Lovato responded.

When Rogan asked if the term ""pansexual"" was fitting, she responded, ""Yeah, pansexual.""

Later in the interview, she recalled how she ""heard someone call the LGBTQIA+ community the alphabet mafia"" and said, ""That's it! That's what I'm going with.""

""I'm part of the alphabet mafia and proud,"" she added.

Lovato, who called off her engagement to Max Ehrich last year, said she first learned she was attracted to women after watching Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair kiss in the 1999 teen drama ""Cruel Intentions"" as a kid. But she said her sexual awakening at the scene caused her to feel guilt and shame because of her Christian upbringing.



""I felt a lot of shame because growing up in Texas as a Christian, that's very frowned upon,"" she recalled. ""Any attraction that I ever had toward a female at a young age, I shut it down before I even let myself process what I was feeling.""

Lovato opened up more about her canceled engagement to Ehrich in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly in which she recalled realizing she was ""just too queer"" to settle down with a man.

""Regardless if drama is happening or not, I am too gay to marry a man right now,"" she said. ""I don't know if that will change in 10 years and I don't know if that'll never change, but I love accepting myself.""

""I've always known I was hella queer, but I have fully embraced it,"" she said.

In another interview, this time with Glamour, Lovato noted that around the time of the couple's breakup, she ""hooked up with a girl and was like, 'I like this a lot more.' It felt better. It felt right.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/demi-lovato-comes-out-as-pansexual,2021-03-31
"Democrat Katie Porter accused of ridiculing those concerned about sexual harassment in her office, mocking COVID victims","Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California has been accused by a former staffer of denigrating people for ""reporting sexual harassment"" and of other demeaning remarks.

These claims come just days after text messages leaked indicating Porter may have fired a staffer over her COVID-19 diagnosis.

What are the details?

The Huffington Post noted in 2018 that Porter, endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Vice President Kamala Harris, was previously in an abusive relationship and subjected to sexual harassment at home.

Despite Porter's possible personal insights into the gravity of the issue, one of her former staffers, Sasha Georgiades, indicated that the Democratic congresswoman berated at least one other staffer who had reported sexual harassment in her office, reported Fox News Digital.

A U.S. Navy veteran and former Wounded Warrior fellow for Porter, Georgiades suggested the congresswoman ""ridiculed people for reporting sexual harassment.""

Georgiades said one staffer, who has yet to ""file anything with [the] ethics committee,"" spoke about the matter of sexual harassment in the congresswoman's office with Porter personally.



Porter ""basically told the individual to grow up,"" said Georgiades, prompting the staffer to leave her post shortly thereafter.



Extra to allegedly dissuading people from highlighting potential abuse in her office, Georgiades said Porter ""made fun of individuals whose parents passed away from COVID.""

While COVID suffered by others may be a laughing matter for the Democrat representative, the laughing evidently stops at her front door. TheBlaze previously reported that Georgiades was apparently fired over her COVID-19 diagnosis that led to Porter's infection.

A leaked text message exchange appears to show Porter ousting the Navy veteran — who for two years served her office — over her alleged ""failure to follow office policies.""

The Twitter account Dear White Staffers, allegedly operated by black and indigenous congressional staffers, shared the messages:

Georgiades suggested to Reason that at the time, she had figured herself sore from exercise, given that she hits the gym just about daily. Accordingly, she had not taken a COVID-19 test despite feeling slightly unwell. This, she indicated, amounted to a violation of the office's protocol on testing.

Upon Porter notifying Georgiades via text of her dismissal, the Navy veteran wrote, ""I hate to have disappointed you in the manner, as I know it isn't an excuse I had found out my friend from the navy had been murdered and my head was not in the best place. Not an excuse but the reasoning for the lack of forethought. I appreciate everything this office has done for me.""

Porter apparently wrote back, ""Well you gave me Covid. In 25 months, it took you not following the rules to get me sick.""

It would appear, based on anonymous complaints shared by Dear White Staffers, that Georgiades was not alone in suffering Porter's personality.

One complaint from a purported anonymous staffer claimed that ""sexual harassment is not taken seriously and is swept under the rug"" in Porter's office.

Another complaint suggested, ""Katie Porter is abusive. Unable to cope with basic demands of being a member so she takes it out [on] staff. Says rude/racist things (anti-black esp) and tries to mask it as edgy humor.""



Porter ""was always screaming at her staffers over the phone during her fundraising call time. ... I love her, but I've never hated my life more than when I worked for her. I've worked for many reps, and her campaign has more turnover, more burnt out 22-25 year olds that I've ever seen. Including myself,"" said yet another anonymous complaint.

It is not only past and present staffers who appear to be concerned about the Democratic congresswoman's conduct and speech.

Porter complained during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Dec. 14 that terms like ""pedophile"" and ""groomer"" are rooted in bigotry that discriminates against LGBT ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity,"" reported TheBlaze.

Porter said, ""The 'groomer' narrative is an age-old lie to position LGBTQ+ people as a threat to kids, and what it does is deny them access to public spaces, it stokes fear, and can even stoke violence.""

She then suggested that those on Twitter accusing people of being groomers and pedophiles are thereby alleging they are criminals or ""engaged in criminal acts merely because of their identity — their sexual orientation, their gender identity [—] is clearly prohibited under Twitter's content.""

While liberal media outlets, including CNN, attempted to defend what Porter ""actually said,"" Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas suggested Porter was ""pushing for pedophilia normalization.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-katie-porter-accused-of-ridiculing-those-concerned-about-sexual-harassment-in-her-office-mocking-covid-victims,2023-01-03
Democratic Kentucky governor blasts 'homophobic' criticism of his photo with drag queens — one who appeared to wear 'devil horns',"Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear blasted criticism of his photograph with drag queens at a recent gay rights rally as ""homophobic,"" the Associated Press reported.

What are the details?

Beshear made history last month when he became the first Kentucky governor to appear at a rally for the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign, a group promoting LGBTQ rights, NBC News said. At the event, Beshear posed for a photo with members of two drag queen troupes, the network said.

Last week, Republican state Sen. Phillip Wheeler pulled out his cellphone at a political event and showed his constituents the image of the governor with the drag queens, NBC News said.

""This is what our Democrat governor is about today,"" Wheeler said, according to the network. ""These are the values that the Democratic Party of today is out there trying to convince our children's the right way to live.

""I would have never thought that there'd be a day where we'd have people dressed in devil horns celebrating with our governor in our beautiful capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky,"" Wheeler added, NBC News said, adding that he said Beshear ""celebrates it being defiled.""

The governor hits back

But Beshear said he'd repeat the photo op, WLWT-TV reported: ""Everyone in Kentucky counts ... I would absolutely take that picture again.""

The governor also called Wheeler's comments ""absolutely homophobic"" and said he owes ""an apology to every single person in that picture"" and ""should do it personally,"" NBC News said.

Wheeler told WLWT his comments weren't directed at homosexuals but only objected to what the drag queens wore, such as a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket that was modified to resemble a nun's habit.

What did the drag queens have to say?

The Derby City Sisters sent the following statement, WLWT said:

""The Derby City Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is an order of sacred clown nuns whose goal is to bring education and awareness of the LGBT+ community. We strive to be present in the community so that others can see they are allowed to be comfortable as they are, where they are in their journey. We would love for anyone (especially Senator Wheeler and Representative White) to come and get to know us! We look atypical as a goal, however, our mission can be easily skewed when someone doesn't know who we are.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-kentucky-governor-blasts-homophobic-criticism-of-his-photo-with-drag-queens-one-who-appeared-to-wear-devil-horns,2020-03-03
Democratic lawmakers celebrate International Pronouns Day,"Leftist lawmakers supported the LGBT agenda on Wednesday by sharing their preferred pronouns while marking ""International Pronouns Day.""

The woke lawmakers asserted that using someone's ""correct pronouns"" shows respect.

But in fact, radical gender ideology actually defies truth, reality, and objective biology.

""Pronouns are not a preference, they are someone's true identity. As we celebrate #PronounsDay, let’s commit to respecting people’s gender identities. Using someone's correct pronouns is an easy way to be an ally,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois tweeted.

""It's International Pronoun Day, a reminder to ask for pronouns and show respect by using those people prefer. Together, we can celebrate people’s multiple, intersecting identities,"" Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan tweeted

""Today, I join the @LGBTEqCaucus in recognizing #PronounsDay. Referring to people by their preferred pronouns is about showing respect and honoring how individuals choose to present themselves. Every person should be treated with dignity,"" Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin tweeted.

""Today we celebrate #PronounsDay! Using someone’s correct pronouns matters – it’s about respect. That's why we need to normalize sharing and asking for pronouns. My pronouns are she/her/hers,"" Rep. Sara Jacobs of California tweeted.

Tweets from Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida claimed that, ""Using correct pronouns is about respecting human dignity. However you identify, your pronouns are valid.""

""My name is Senator Ed Markey and my pronouns are He/Him/His. On International Pronouns Day, and every day, we must treat everyone with dignity and respect—this includes using their correct pronouns.

""Using someone's correct pronouns isn't just a sign of respect, it's a way to create a more inclusive and affirming environment for all. My pronouns are she/her. #ShareYourPronouns #PronounsDay,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington tweeted.

Cori Bush of Missouri tweeted her own pronouns and added, ""Using someone’s correct pronouns is not only a sign of respect — it is essential to creating a more inclusive and affirming environment for all.""

""International Pronouns Day seeks to make respecting, sharing, and educating about personal pronouns commonplace,"" according to pronounsday.org.

Democrats in the House push LGBT 'Equality Act' — here's what it could mean for you,"Democrats in Congress have put forward the ""Equality Act"" to prevent discrimination against the LGBT community, but conservative critics worry that it could force business owners and doctors to violate their firmly held beliefs.

What's in the bill?

The bill would include both sexual orientation and gender identity under the protections offered by both the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is already illegal for employers to discriminate against people based on either of these criteria, but the bill's authors said that these existing protections did not go far enough.

Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) who introduced the bill in the House, said in a news release that the bill would prevent same sex couples from being ""fired from their jobs, evicted from their apartment, or kicked out of a restaurant.""

As Conservative Review writer Nate Madden noted, the bill could also hurt the cases of bakers Aaron and Melissa Klein and Jack Phillips, all three of whom were hit by lawsuits after refusing on religious grounds to decorate cakes to celebrate gay weddings.

The conservative Heritage Foundation also argued that the bill would force religious doctors and hospitals to perform sex change surgery, and that it would pre-empt the rights of parents in cases where their minor children identify as transgender.

The bill would also grant controversial protections for LGBT individuals to use the bathroom of their choice. According to the text of the bill:



(with respect to gender identity) an individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room, and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.

Who is supporting the bill?

Every Democrat in the House of Representatives is co-sponsoring the bill, as well as three Republicans, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), and Rep. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon (R-Puerto Rico). Representatives from U.S. territories can co-sponsor bills and vote on them in committee, but cannot participate in the final floor vote.

The legislation has also been endorsed by at least 161 companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Amazon.

Every House Democrat but one cosponsers bill intended to let biological male athletes compete against females in pubic schools,"All the Democrats in the House of Representatives except one are cosponsoring a bill that's intended, in part, to allow biological male athletes who identify as females to compete against biological females in public schools.

The Equality Act would broadly amend civil rights legislation to outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing, public accommodations, jury service, education, federal programs and credit, NBC News reported. The bill's specific language prohibits discrimination based on peoples' ""sexual orientation and gender identity.""

But some cosponsors and supporters of the bill are looking at the bill as an avenue to allow transgender athletes in public schools to compete on teams that match their gender identities — which has become a contentious issue nationwide of late.

What do supporters and cosponsors say regarding transgender athletes?

Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) offered the following in his opening statement last week about the Equality Act:

Many states have sexual orientation and gender identity nondiscrimination laws, and all of them still have women's sports. Arguments about transgender athletes participating in sports in accordance with their gender identity having competitive advantages have not been borne out. Sports have positive impacts on physical, social, and emotional well-being, and we should not be denying transgender athletes those opportunities simply because sometimes they may win. Nor should their occasional success be used as a roadblock to advancing civil rights legislation for LGBT people as a whole.

Sarah Warbelow — director of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group — championed the Equality Act in written testimony to the House and echoed Nadler's words, saying it's a myth that transgender female athletes have unfair advantages over biological female athletes:

Opponents of equality in athletics for transgender athletes have argued that girls who are transgender have unfair physiological advantages over cisgender girls and as a result, will dominate women's competitive sports. Some have also suggested that girls who are transgender pose a threat to their cisgender teammates both on the field and in shared locker rooms. None of these arguments are rooted in fact. Existing evidence shows that denying opportunities and access to students based on their gender identity causes actual harm to those students, while there is no data to suggest that girls who are transgender are dominating athletics or posing a harm to their cisgender counterparts.

The issue is particularly hot in Connecticut, where a pair of biological males who identify as females have been dominating sprinting competitions in high school track and field. And as you might expect, not every biological female opponent is happy about it.



What did one opponent of the bill have to say?



Julia Beck of the Women's Liberation Front testified to the House against the Equality Act, saying ""men will dominate female sports; girls who would have taken first place will be denied scholastic opportunity.""

Beck added that the bill is a ""human rights violation"" and that in the end ""every person in this country will lose our right to single-sex sports"" and ""we will no longer be able to distinguish between women and men.""



Who are the outlier House members?

The only two Republican House members cosponsoring the Equality Act are John Katko of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. GOP Rep. Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico also cosponsored the bill, but she's not a voting member.



The Daily Caller noted that Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, ""the only pro-life Democrat left in the House, is also the only one in his party not co-sponsoring the Equality Act.""

Democrats push 'Trans Bill of Rights',"Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are supporting a resolution for a ""Trans Bill of Rights.""

""This resolution provides a comprehensive framework to provide protections for transgender and nonbinary people, ensuring that they are not discriminated against or persecuted for their gender identity and expression,"" according to a press release.



""With this resolution, we salute the resilience and courage of trans people across our country, and outline a clear vision of what we must do in Congress in order to allow trans people to lead lead full, happy lives with the basic freedoms to housing, physical and mental healthcare, and employment without discrimination or a risk to their lives,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement.

The proposed plan of action would almost certainly have dramatic negative repercussions for the rights Americans who do not support the LGBT agenda, as it would entail enshrining the concept of gender identity within civil rights law.



The plan would involve editing ""the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to explicitly include gender identity and sex characteristics as protected characteristics"" and altering ""federal education laws to explicitly clarify that they protect students from discrimination based on gender identity and sex characteristics,"" according to the press release.



It would also entail ""codifying Bostock and clarifying that it is illegal to discriminate in employment, housing, and credit based on gender identity and sex characteristics"" and ""requiring the Attorney General to designate a liaison within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice dedicated to advising and overseeing enforcement of the civil rights of transgender people."" It would also involve ""codifying the right to abortion and contraception, protecting transgender people from discrimination in healthcare, and banning forced surgery on intersex children and infants in violation of ethical standards of care.""

The U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling last week that enables states to ban abortions, and Democrats have been up in arms about the decision.

The dogmas of radical gender ideology remain deeply controversial. One area of significant debate has surrounded the issue of women's sports, as many people do not believe biological men should be allowed to compete in female athletics. Examples of biological males winning in women's sports continue to occur — for example, a 29-year-old transgender skateboarder recently won first place in a competition, while a 13-year-old girl placed second.

Denver Post fires conservative columnist after he criticizes leftist notion that 'there are more than two sexes',"Jon Caldara had penned his conservative/libertarian columns for the Denver Post since 2016 — until Friday's op-ed in which he criticized the leftist notion that ""there are more than two sexes.""

What are the details?

In a Facebook post about his firing, Caldara noted that his editor — whom he says he respects and still likes very much — ""found my writing too insensitive. And yes, it is. My column is not a soft voiced, sticky sweet NPR-styled piece which employs the language now mandated by the victim-centric, identity politics driven media.""

He added, ""Plain talk that doesn't conform to the newspeak law of 'use only the words mandated by the perpetually offended.' So, it is labeled as 'mean spirited' and banned. If conservatives and libertarians are granted a voice in the mainstream media, they must use the language of their ideological opponents. That is, they are not allowed to have their own voice.""

'The last straw'

Caldara went on to explain that ""what seemed to be the last straw for my column was my insistence that there are only two sexes and my frustration that to be inclusive of the transgendered (even that word isn't allowed) we must lose our right to free speech.""

Here's a bit of what his column in question had to say on the point:

Democrats don't want transparency in hospital billing and they certainly don't want education transparency when it comes to their mandate to convince your kid that there are more than two sexes, even if it's against your wishes.



Among the most controversial laws that passed last year was the comprehensive human sexuality education mandate which ripped local control away from your neighborhood school board. Now if your school district wants to teach even basic sex ed, the teacher must also teach the 'health needs' of LGBT individuals.



And in the anti-free-speech style that the left now embraces, the new law bans discussions that ""employ gender stereotypes,"" or any language the state's new oversight board of LGBT activists consider ""stigmatizing."" In case you hadn't noticed, just about everything is stigmatizing to the easily triggered, perpetually offended.



The law actually makes for some pretty funny Orwellian reading. It says nothing in the law ""shall be interpreted to prohibit discussion of health, moral, ethical, or religious values…"" And then it goes on to proscribe exactly what must and cannot be said during those ""discussions.""

Caldara emphasized in his Facebook post that he is ""strongly pro-gay marriage, which has frustrated many of my socially conservative friends. I have friends, family, and employees from the LGBT community. I don't care who uses whose bathroom, what you wear, or how you identify. People from this community have rights which we must protect.""

But he also argued that ""to force us to use inaccurate pronouns, to force us to teach our kids that there are more than two sexes, to call what is plainly a man in a dress, well, not a man in a dress violates our right of speech.""

More from Caldara's Facebook post:

There was a time when the liberals in the press fought hard to protect free speech. Now they fight hard to mandate speech because, heaven forbid, someone be offended or have their feelings hurt. It's okay people get offended. In fact, I encourage it. It means we are being challenged. It's not hate speech. It's speech. It used to be the press was all about.



I believe the reason so many people distrust the news media is the lack of intellectual diversity in it. My column is the most read column on the editorial pages. Perhaps it's because people hated it so much. Who knows?



I do know that the stifling of conservative and libertarian voices because journalists and those in entertainment see it as mean-spirited, has built up the frustration with the politically correct to the point someone who speaks as vilely as Donald Trump becomes president.

He ended his post with the following zinger: ""It's why I think he'll be re-elected. I guess, thank you media. Your intolerance created him.""

What did Caldara's editor have to say?

Caldara's editor, Megan Schrader, confirmed to the Washington Free Beacon that she fired Caldara but wouldn't discuss her reasons.

""I am writing a job description as we speak to fill his position,"" she told the Free Beacon. ""I hope that conservative Colorado writers will apply knowing that we value conservative voices on our pages and don't have a litmus test for their opinions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/denver-post-fires-conservative-columnist-after-he-criticizes-leftist-notion-that-there-are-more-than-two-sexes,2020-01-21
"DeSantis fires back at Disney, says company should be stripped of 'special privileges' that allow self-governance","The feud between the Walt Disney Company and Florida Republicans intensified Thursday after Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) floated the idea of repealing a 1960s law that gave Disney self-governing status over its property.

What is the background?

The Florida legislature passed a law in 1967 establishing the ""Reedy Creek Improvement District"" that essentially gave Disney self-governing control of nearly 40 square miles in Central Florida around Orlando.

The Reedy Creek Improvement District explains on its website that the law states ""that landowners within the Reedy Creek Improvement District, primarily Walt Disney World, would be solely responsible for paying the cost of providing typical municipal services like power, water, roads, fire protection etc. Local taxpayers, meaning residents of Orange and Osceola County, would not have to pay for building or maintaining those services.""

What is happening now?

Republican lawmakers began floating a repeal of the law this week as backlash against Disney grew over its stance on Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill.

The law protects children in kindergarten through third grade from receiving classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, Disney opposes the law and will lobby for its repeal.

""Yesterday was the 2nd meeting in a week w/fellow legislators to discuss a repeal of the 1967 Reedy Creek Improvement Act, which allows Disney to act as its own government. If Disney wants to embrace woke ideology, it seems fitting that they should be regulated by Orange County,"" Florida state Rep. Spencer Roach (R) wrote on Twitter.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, DeSantis addressed ""special privileges"" that Disney has accumulated in Florida.

""As a matter of first principle, I don’t support special privileges in law just because a company is powerful and they’ve been able to wield a lot of power,"" he said, later adding, ""I think what has happened is there’s a lot of these special privileges that are not justifiable, but because Disney had held so much sway, they were able to sustain a lot of special treatment over the years.""

The governor then called statements from Disney executives ""really, really crazy,"" and noted that Disney has ""lost a lot of the pull that they used to have,"" which he observed is ""good thing for our state, because the state should be governed by the best interest of the people.""

""I would say any special privileges that are in law, I would like to get rid of generally,"" DeSantis said.

""I think in this particular case with Disney, I just don’t think you have very many people in the legislature any more who are going to be able to defend a lot of what has been done over many, many years to really have them almost govern themselves in some of these things. That was probably never appropriate to start, but is certainly not appropriate now at this point,"" he added.

"Florida will never bow to 'woke corporations,' DeSantis promises — then he knocks Disney for China relationship","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) unequivocally promised Thursday that policies in the Sunshine State will not be determined by ""the musings of woke corporations.""

What is the background?

The promise was made one day after Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek capitulated to pressure from the outrage mob over legislation protecting parental rights in public education.

The Parental Rights in Education bill — falsely called the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — protects Florida students in kindergarten through third grade from receiving classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation or gender identity,"" topics better suited for parents.

But Chapek said Disney has ""opposed"" the bill from its inception, claiming ""it could be unfairly used to target gay, lesbian, nonbinary and transgender kids and families."" Chapek even spoke with DeSantis to express Disney's ""disappointment"" with the bill.

What did DeSantis promise?

Speaking with supporters in Boca Raton, DeSantis vowed he will not cave under the pressure of LGBT activists, Democrats, and ""woke corporations"" like Disney.

""In the state of Florida, we are not going to allow them to inject transgenderism into kindergarten,"" DeSantis said, triggering a raucous applause.

""First-graders shouldn’t have woke gender ideology imposed in their curriculums, and that is what we’re standing for because we’re standing for the kids and we’re standing for the parents,"" he continued. ""And I can tell you this: The chance that I am going to back down from my commitment to students and back down from my commitment to parents’ rights simply because of fraudulent media narratives or pressure from woke corporations— the chances of that are zero.""

After reaffirming that parents do not want their young children taught progressive sexual and gender ideology in schools, DeSantis turned to Disney and invoked the company's relationship with China.

""You have companies like a Disney that are going to say and criticize parents’ rights, they’re going to criticize the fact that we don’t want transgenderism in kindergarten and first-grade classrooms,"" DeSantis began.

""If that’s the hill that they’re going to die on, then how do they possibly explain lining their pockets with their relationship from the Communist Party of China?"" he continued. ""Because that’s what they do and they make a fortune, and they don’t say a word about the really brutal practices that you see over there at the hands of the CCP.

""And so in Florida, our policy’s got to be based on the best interest of Florida citizens, not on the musing of woke corporations,"" DeSantis declared.

After being approved by the Florida legislature, the Parental Rights in Education bill is headed to DeSantis' desk, where is expected to sign it into law sometime soon.

The White House has condemned the bill as ""horrific"" and a form of ""bullying.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-florida-will-not-bow-to-woke-corporations-rips-disney-china,2022-03-11
"Ron DeSantis tells NCAA, 'woke corporations' where they can shove their threats over transgender sports law","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) revealed Tuesday exactly where the NCAA and ""woke corporations"" can shove their money and events if they don't like Florida's effort to protect girl's sports from transgender athletes.

What is the background?

On Tuesday, DeSantis signed into law the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act,"" which prohibits biological males who identify as transgender females from competing on female sports teams, both in high school and at the collegiate level.

The purpose of the law, according to DeSantis, is to protect the integrity of women's sports.

""The bill that we're doing today will ensure fairness for women athletes for years to come in the state of Florida,"" DeSantis said. ""It says that athletic teams or sports that are designated for females are open to females. And we're going to go based off biology.""



How did DeSantis respond to corporate pressure?

Speaking with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, DeSantis said he called the bluff of organizations like the NCAA.

The NCAA, the sanctioning body for most collegiate athletics, threatened to withdraw events from states that pass laws preventing biological males who identify as transgender females from competing in women's organized sports.

Recalling his response to the NCAA's threats, DeSantis made it clear the pressure would not work. ""To hell with these events,"" DeSantis said.

""I remember the NCAA put out a statement saying any state that enacts this, we're not going to hold events there. So I called the speaker of the House in Florida and I said, 'Did you hear what they said?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' I said, 'We definitely got to get this done.' You can't be cowed by these organizations, or particularly by woke corporations, from doing the right thing,"" DeSantis explained.

The Republican governor said protecting women's athletics is worth the cost of losing NCAA events.

""We have to protect our girls. It is discriminatory to force them to compete against biological males,"" DeSantis said. ""If the price of having a tournament is that I have to deny equal opportunity to hundreds of thousands of young girl and women athletes throughout Florida, I am much more willing to stand with the girls. And to hell with these events.""

""If corporations want to come in and try to bully us around, they are going to go nowhere. It's going to be like hitting their head against a brick wall,"" he added.

What has the NCAA said?



The NCAA has not yet responded to Florida's new law or DeSantis' remarks.

However, as the New York Times noted, the NCAA's statement in April failed to explicitly pledge to pull events from states that enact laws not favorable to LGBT activists, suggesting the NCAA's woke appeasement is all bark and no bite.

In fact, the NCAA's failure to act has enraged LGBT advocacy groups, like the Human Rights Campaign.

HRC president Alphonso David said recently:

The NCAA should be ashamed of themselves for violating their own policy by choosing to hold championships in states that are not healthy, safe, or free from discrimination for their athletes. It also undermines their commitment to transgender participation in NCAA events, for which they have had an inclusive policy for years. While we have remained hopeful about the NCAA stepping up to the plate and taking action like they have done in the past, they are willfully ignoring that commitment this time, despite repeated attempts by the Human Rights Campaign and others to communicate the harsh and harmful negative impacts of this legislation, which is not just pending but enacted into law in seven states, with South Dakota also creating two Executive Orders to similar discriminatory affect. Their words will not stop discrimination, only actions to deliver real consequences to states that dare to discriminate. The NCAA must face scrutiny and public pressure to do the right thing.

Indeed, the NCAA even recently selected the University of Florida, located in Gainesville, as host of a regional tournament for NCAA baseball.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-ncaa-threats-transgender-sports-law,2021-06-02
Gov. Ron DeSantis signs bill banning biological males from competing on women's sports teams,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed Tuesday a version of the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act"" into law, prohibiting males who identify as transgender females from competing on female sports teams in high school and college.

""We believe in the state of Florida, of protecting the fairness and the integrity of women's athletics,"" DeSantis said at the signing ceremony, standing onstage with teenage girl athletes from Trinity Christian Academy.

""And I can tell you this in Florida, you know, girls are going to play girls' sports and boys are going play boys' sports, that's what we're doing. We're going to make sure that that's the reality,"" he continued. ""So the bill that we're doing today will ensure fairness for women athletes for years to come in the state of Florida. It says that athletic teams or sports that are designated for females are open to females. And we're going to go based off biology.""

DeSantis signed the bill even though the National Collegiate Athletic Association threatened to pull its championship games out of states that ""discriminate"" against transgender athletes. Other companies warned that they would pull their business out of Florida because of the bill. DeSantis didn't care.

""Some of these organizations say they're not going to hold events if you do this, just let me say very clearly, in Florida, we're going to do what's right, will stand up to corporations, they are not going to dictate the policies in this state,"" the governor said. ""We will stand up to groups like the NCAA, who think that they should be able to dictate the policies in different states.""

Democrats and LGBT activists opposed the legislation as well, characterizing the bill as ""unnecessary"" and accused Florida Republicans of acting hatefully toward transgender persons.

Some critics observed that DeSantis signed the bill on June 1, the first day of National LGBTQ Pride Month, which in their view added insult to injury.

""Appalling,"" tweeted state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-Orlando). ""First day of LGBTQ Pride Month and Gov. Ron DeSantis signs SB 1028 which bans trans kids from school sports. FHSAA has allowed trans kids to participate in FL since 2013 with ZERO problems. This fuels transphobia and puts vulnerable kids at risk for no good reason.""

""By signing a heartless ban on transgender kids in sports, @GovRonDeSantis is marginalizing an entire community,"" Florida agriculture commissioner Niki Fried tweeted. ""Signing it on the first day of #Pride2021 is especially cruel.""

Fried, the only Florida Democrat currently holding statewide elected office, announced a bid for the Democratic nomination to challenge DeSantis for governor Tuesday.

""Florida should stand for inclusivity, equality, and liberty — not peddling hate for political points,"" she said.

A standalone version of the Fairness in Women's Sports Act had previously died in the state legislature, but Republicans revived the bill as an amendment to a larger bill related to charter schools.



The final version of the bill removed some of the most controversial portions in the first draft, including a requirement that student athletes undergo testosterone or genetic testing and have their genitalia examined before joining sports teams.

Almost immediately after DeSantis signed the bill, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, declared it would sue Florida.

""The Human Rights Campaign will always stand up to anti-equality forces on behalf of transgender kids, and that is exactly what we plan to do by legally challenging this ban on the participation of transgender girls and women in sports,"" HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. ""Gov. DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are legislating based on a false, discriminatory premise that puts the safety and well-being of transgender children on the line. Transgender kids are kids; transgender girls are girls. Like all children, they deserve the opportunity to play sports with their friends and be a part of a team. Transgender youth must not be deprived of the opportunity to learn important skills of sportsmanship, healthy competition, and teamwork. The harmful provisions added to SB 1028 will not just impact transgender people in Florida. All Floridians will have to face the consequences of this anti-transgender legislation — including economic harm, expensive taxpayer-funded legal battles, and a tarnished reputation. In Florida, we are ensuring that there are legal consequences to pay for being on the wrong side of history.""

The bill's supporters say legislation was needed to prevent unfair competition in women's sports.

""This bill is very simply about making sure that women can safely compete, have opportunities and physically be able to excel in a sport that they trained for, prepared for and work for,"" said state Sen. Kelli Stargel, who sponsored the legislation.

""This is nothing about anybody being discriminated against,"" she said. ""It's solely so that women have an opportunity to compete in women's sports.""

Florida joins West Virginia, Montana, and Idaho in banning transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says Disney 'crossed the line' with its statement pledging to push for a piece of state legislation to be repealed or overturned,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Disney has ""crossed the line"" by declaring that it will push for a recently approved piece of legislation to either be repealed by the state legislature or rejected by the courts.

The Sunshine State's governor on Monday signed the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, which critics have been erroneously referring to as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

One of the provisions included in the measure prohibits teaching children about gender identity or sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade: ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,"" the text states.

The Walt Disney Company issued a statement on Monday decrying the legislation, and vowing to advocate for it to be abolished.

""Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,"" Disney's statement declared. ""We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.""

DeSantis called out Disney for issuing the statement, declaring on Tuesday that Florida is run based on the interests of Floridians, not by business executives.



""This state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of Florida. It is not based on the demands of California corporate executives. They do not run this state. They do not control this state,"" DeSantis declared.

Disney 'Baymax!' show includes LGBT propaganda,"A clip from Disney's new show ""Baymax!"" reveals that the company has slipped transgender ideology into the animated program.

In the segment, Baymax, a robot that was featured in the Disney movie ""Big Hero 6,"" receives several recommendations about menstrual products, including from an individual who looks like a man and is wearing a shirt that resembles the colors of a transgender pride flag.

""Excuse me, which of these products would you reccomend?"" the robot asks a woman.

At first bewildered, the female character replies by handing the robot a box and noting that she typically uses those tampons.

""I prefer pads. They're more comfortable for me,"" someone else says.

""I always get the ones"" that have ""wings,"" an apparently transgender character then remarks.

Christopher Rufo, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow, posted the clip on Tuesday, and indicated that it was from the Disney show. According to Disney, ""Baymax!"" released on Wednesday and can be streamed on Disney+.

Steve Deace, host of BlazeTV's ""Steve Deace Show,"" described the content as ""Straight up demonic.""

""Disney has devolved from being family friendly to being outright evil… Parents beware,"" talk radio host Janet Parshall tweeted.

""Disney is evil,"" tweeted Carmine Sabia, who describes himself as a writer, editor and pundit.

The recently released animated Disney and Pixar movie ""Lightyear,"" includes a lesbian kiss.



Earlier this year Disney angered many conservatives by issuing a statement pledging to push for a Florida law to get repealed to overturned— the law includes a section that states, ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

Disney bends knee to outrage mob over Florida parents' rights bill. But DeSantis refuses to capitulate.,"Disney capitulated to the social media outrage mob over a controversial bill protecting the rights of Florida parents. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) did not falter.

What is the background?

Disney faced manufactured backlash this week for not speaking out against Florida HB 1557, the Parental Rights in Education Bill.

As TheBlaze reported, former and current Disney employees expressed outrage at Disney over the company's silence about the bill. Apparently, Disney executives are supposed to comment on any legislation in Florida that Democrats and LGBT advocates oppose. Disney employs more than 75,000 people in Florida.

The Parental Rights in Education bill — falsely called the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by critics and the media — prohibits classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation or gender identity"" for grades K-3. The bill does not, as critics incorrectly claim, prohibit use of the word ""gay."" The purpose of the bill is to prevent school officials from discussing with young students sexual topics that are better suited for their parents.

What is Disney doing now?

Speaking with Disney shareholders on Wednesday, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek said company executives were ""opposed to the bill from the outset,"" but chose to work ""behind the scenes"" with lawmakers to address their concerns.

It is not clear why Disney would be concerned with legislation protecting children and parents' rights.

""We were hopeful that our longstanding relationships with those lawmakers could lead to a better outcome. Ultimately, we were unsuccessful,"" Chapek added. ""I called Gov. DeSantis this morning to express our disappointment and concern that if the legislation becomes law, it could be unfairly used to target gay, lesbian, nonbinary and transgender kids and families. The governor heard our concerns, and agreed to meet with me and LGBTQ+ members of our senior team in Florida to discuss ways to address them.""

Not only did Chapek voice Disney's ""disappointment"" with the bill and call DeSantis, but Disney reportedly committed to signing a statement opposing all similar legislation across the nation.

How did DeSantis respond?

Despite hearing Chapek's concerns, DeSantis refused to bend the knee to the outrage mob, which is angered by a falsified depiction of the bill.

According to a statement released by DeSantis' office, Wednesday was the first time DeSantis was contacted by Disney about the bill. Nevertheless, ""the governor's position has not changed.""

""Governor DeSantis has always been open to hearing from Floridians and having conversations about legislation — as long as those discussions are grounded in facts, not false media narratives,"" the statement explained.

Disney 'makes history' with first bisexual lead character for children's animated TV show,"""The Owl House,"" a Disney Channel animated show for kids, has reportedly ""made history"" by pushing a bisexual character as the show's lead, Variety reported.

From Variety:

Luz Noceda, the show's 14-year-old protagonist, is a normal teen who goes on a journey to another world to become a witch. Luz has shown she's attracted to male characters in the show, and in the two most recent episodes, ""Enchanting Grom Fright"" and ""Wing It Like Witches,"" a relationship between Luz and the recurring female character Amity is explored. It is revealed that Amity had intentions to ask Luz to Grom, their world's version of Prom, and the two share a dance together.

Dana Terrace, the show's creator who is bisexual herself, confirmed last week that Luz Noceda is, in fact, bisexual.

""In [show development] I was very open about my intention to put queer kids in the main cast. I'm a horrible liar so sneaking it in would've been hard haha,"" she explained.

However, according to Terrace, certain Disney executives refused to approve a queer lead character — but they eventually ""greenlit"" her idea.

""When we were greenlit I was told by certain Disney leadership that I could NOT represent any form of bi or gay relationship on the Channel,"" she explained. ""I'm bi! I want to write a bi character, dammit! Luckily my stubbornness paid off and now I am VERY supported by current Disney leadership.""

In response, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the development, calling the lead bisexual character ""an inclusive, fair, accurate, and age-appropriate world through the representation of its characters.""



""The Owl House"" is not the first Disney-owned program to include an LGBT character.

The Disney-Pixar feature film, ""Onward,"" released earlier this year, includes a character who briefly indicates that she is gay. The movie was subsequently banned from several Muslim-majority countries that outlaw homosexuality.

The Disney show, ""Andi Mack"" was the first to have a character discover they are gay, while ""Out,"" a Pixar short film that was released earlier this year, also included a gay character.

However, what distinguishes ""The Owl House"" is that it is the first Disney show or movie to feature an LGBT character as the lead character.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-bisexual-lead-character-kids-cartoon,2020-08-17
Disney blatantly lies about Florida bill protecting parents' rights — and the backlash is swift,"After Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed into law the Parental Rights in Education bill, Walt Disney Co. spread blatantly false claims about the legislation and vowed to fight for its repeal.

Democrats, progressive activists, and the media have falsely labeled the law as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. While mainly reinforcing parental rights, the bill prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades K-3. The statute neither uses the word ""gay,"" nor does it prevent anyone from saying the word.

What did Disney say?

The company released a statement Monday afternoon recycling the blatant lie about the bill and vowed to fight against it.

""Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,"" the statement began.

""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,"" the statement added. ""We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.""

Disney was abruptly condemned on social media, both for repeating false claims about the law and for opposing a law meant to protect children.

""Isn’t Disney supposed to be a family friendly company? Why do they want to teach K-3 grade children about sex and gender theory and hide it from parents?"" Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for DeSantis, responded.

""Your goal as a company should be to preserve the innocence of children, not fight against it on behalf of a small, radical group of employees who need the validation of having their choices validated by kindergarteners,"" Ben Shapiro responded. ""It's honestly incredible how a couple hundred pissed off employees can take hostage a company with 200,000 employees and hundreds of millions of consumers. Incredible and unconscionable. Cowards.""

""1) Is Disney opposed to the part that bars sexual/gender identity instruction for K-3 students? Or another part of the bill? 2) Has Disney put out a statement this forceful on the genocide in China, where they eagerly do business? Trying to pinpoint their ‘corporate values,'"" Fox News radio host Guy Benson said.

""The bill is about Parental Rights in Education (literally the name) so again, why is a theme park of quasi-furries hell bent on teaching 4-8 year-olds about getting it on without parental consent? Is that the new 'family-friendly' Disney?"" conservative radio host Dana Loesch said.

""What sort of creepy company is this invested in *4 to 7 year olds* being exposed to issues incl sexual orientation & transgenderism in kindergarten to grade 3,"" writer Rita Panahi questioned.

""You mispelled Parents Rights In Education bill,"" another person noted.

""Kinda weird y’all want kindergartners to receive sex-ed,"" one person observed.

""There is no such thing as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill. It’s 1557 and refers to Parental Rights in Education,"" another person explained.

""I support the Florida anti-grooming bill. 3rd grade children shouldn’t be talking about sex. Businesses who think 3rd grade children should be talking about sex shouldn’t be getting our business,"" one person blasted.

"Disney employees speak out: Woke mob has 'hijacked' the company — conservatives, Christians no longer welcome","The Walt Disney Company's wholehearted embrace of the progressive sexual orientation and gender identity movement has rankled not only customers, investors, and Republican politicians in Florida, but now some of the entertainment company's employees are publicly voicing their displeasure.

Speaking with Fox News reporter Raymond Arroyo this week, a handful of Disney employees called out the family entertainment company over its woke activism.

""You can clearly see the magic is gone,"" one employee said.

""I am deeply saddened by what Disney has chosen to take their stand on politically and just with their money, in general,"" she continued, noting that she has experienced ""such a drastic change"" between the time she started working for the company and now.

Another employee said Disney ""has made it very clear that conservative Christian voices have no place visiting their parks or working at their parks.""

She recalled that over the last year, the company has been ""heavy"" in its internal communications regarding ""things to say"" and ""things not to say"" to visitors in order to avoid hurting people's feelings. Things that cast members were asked not to say allegedly included words such as ""he, she, ladies, and gentlemen.""

""Basically, we have to be in fear of what we say now,"" the employee claimed.

Disney employee: The magic is gone www.youtube.com

Yet another employee said that he felt ""estranged"" by the company over its political stances, which in the short term included its public opposition to Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill.

The bill, recently signed into law, bars discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms and sets reasonable parameters for discussions in grades thereafter.

The employee said he and many others desired to simply show up at the office and dig into the work, but all the noise surrounding Disney's political agenda made it ""increasingly harder"" to do so.

""At this point, I believe the company has been hijacked by the liberal left,"" exclaimed another employee, Jose Castillo, who is also running for Congress in Florida as a Republican.

Castillo has been outspoken in his criticism for several weeks and claims that there is a ""silent majority"" of Disney employees who oppose the company's activism.

""We need new leadership,"" he told Fox news. ""Our CEO Bob Chapek, he's supposed to be leading the company, not following the woke mob. He has fiduciary duty to the stockholders of this company. That means he has to protect their investment, protect their money. But instead what does he do? He protects the feelings of a few minority workers.""

Last month, a group of Disney employees published an open letter directed at the company's management, calling on the company to adopt a politically neutral approach. In the letter, the employees also lamented the top-down silencing of conservative voices.

""Over the last few weeks, we have watched as our leadership has expressed their condemnation for laws and policies we support. We have watched as our colleagues, convinced that no one in the company could possibly disagree with them and grow increasingly aggressive in their demands. They insist that [Disney] take a strong stance on not only this issue but other legislation and openly advocate for the punishment of employees who disagree with them,"" the employees wrote, later adding, ""[Disney] has fostered an environment of fear that any employee who does not toe the line will be exposed and dismissed,""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-employees-speak-out-against-woke-activism,2022-04-29
Disney hires ex-Hillary Clinton staffer and chief of Biden's COVID-19 vaccine education strategy as new spox,"The Walt Disney Corporation has just hired a former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign flack and the leader of President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccination education campaign to serve as its chief spokeswoman.

In a news release Tuesday, Disney announced that Kristina Schake will take over as the company's executive vice president for global communications, reporting to chief corporate affairs officer Geoff Morrell.

“I could not be more pleased to welcome Kristina to Disney and to have her leading communications for the company,” Morrell said in a statement.

“Her experience in the public and private sectors, in political and corporate campaigns, make her ideally suited for this important role and to help me integrate communications with government relations, public policy, and corporate social responsibility into a new Corporate Affairs team,"" he added.

Disney bragged that Schake has more than three decades of experience working in government, media, business, entertainment, and technology. Most recently, she was appointed by Biden to lead the federal government's national COVID-19 vaccine education campaign. She has previously served as the Global Communications Director for Instagram and in 2016 she was the deputy communications director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Before that, she served in the Obama administration as special assistant to the president and communications director to the first lady.

“As Disney approaches its 100th anniversary, I’m excited to lead the company’s global communications work at this pivotal moment of growth and transformation,” said Schake in a statement. “The magical stories and experiences Disney creates enrich the lives of countless people around the world and it’s an honor for me to be a part of that, helping Bob Chapek, Geoff Morrell, and the talented teams throughout the company tell the story of Disney as it begins its second century.”

Disney set itself up as a political punching bag for Republican politicians like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this year when the company took an activist position opposing Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. The law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades K-3, but Democrats and progressive activists inaccurately labeled it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, alleging that GOP politicians wanted to hatefully attack trans kids.

Caving to pressure from LGBTQ+ employees and outside groups, Disney CEO Bob Chapek spoke out against the law and the company issued a statement declaring, ""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts,"" leading to multiple public confrontations with DeSantis.



Disney has increasingly signaled it will take more action to appease the left and alienate conservatives. In March, leaked videos from a corporate meeting showed Disney executives and producers boasting about implementing ""gay agenda"" content directed at children and families.

The hiring of a veteran Democratic communications pro like Schake continues the company's political drift leftward.

LGBTQ+ Disney workers lament 'the magic has died' over Florida Parental Rights in Education bill after CEO refuses to condemn it,"Former and current Disney employees supportive of the LGBTQ+ movement expressed outrage this week at their progressive employer's silence regarding a Florida bill that seeks to guide ""age-appropriate discussions"" of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.

What are the details?

""If this bill was in place when I was growing up, I probably would not be here,"" a transgender former cast member at Walt Disney World told BuzzFeed News recently.



Another employee told the outlet that Disney's championing of diversity and inclusion ""feels like virtue signaling when you're not willing to take a stand.”

""The magic has died for me,"" lamented another former cast member. ""The little queer kid being beaten for being queer is crying and alone again.""

Still another employee, a director of an unreleased Disney+ show who identifies as bisexual, said, ""The blood and suffering of LGBTQIA+ children will be on Disney's hands thanks to their support of this life-altering bill. It breaks my heart.""

Even the grand-niece of Walt Disney, Abigail Disney, got in on the action, tweeting, ""The times for neutrality are long since over. That train has left the goddamn station. What is Disney for? Is it for pretending what America is about, or it is for defining a vision for a world in which fantasy, love, kindness, decency and loyalty are bedrock values.""

What's the background?

The Parental Rights in Education bill — inaccurately dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by opponents and most national media outlets — was passed by the Florida Senate this week and will now move to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk to be signed into law.

The legislation specifically riles LGBTQ+ activists by prohibiting ""classroom instruction"" on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and teaching on the subject ""in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students"" in higher grade levels.

The Republican-sponsored bill seeks to protect students and their parents from pressurized classroom instruction or indoctrination on matters of sexual orientation and gender identity. But LGBTQ+ activists claim the legislation will only isolate vulnerable students and strip them of support systems at their schools.

What else?

Yet in the face of pressure from activists and employees, Disney CEO Bob Chapek has refused to take a stand against the bill. On the contrary, the chief executive recently shut down criticism over the company's neutral stance.

In a memo to staff on Monday, Chapek recalled meeting on Friday with ""a small group of Disney LGBTQ+ leaders"" who wished to voice their ""disappointment"" at the company’s lack of a public statement. But according to the Los Angeles Times, he said in the memo that, despite being moved by their concerns, he was unpersuaded to issue a public statement condemning the bill.

Instead, he explained that corporate statements ""do very little to change outcomes or minds"" and instead are ""often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame.""

""Simply put, they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change,"" Chapek reportedly wrote.

The CEO went on to suggest that Disney's artistic contributions are corporate statements in and of themselves and ""are more powerful than any tweet or lobbying effort"" at that.

""I firmly believe that our ability to tell such stories — and have them received with open eyes, ears, and hearts — would be diminished if our company were to become a political football in any debate,"" he added.

Apparently, Chapek's memo only served to further outrage some employees, the Times noted.

DeSantis is expected to sign the legislation into law sometime this summer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-workers-lament-florida-parent-education-bill,2022-03-09
"Disney World drops 'ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls' from recorded greeting as park pushes to be 'place where everyone is welcome'","Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has removed ""ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls"" from a recorded greeting, Insider reported, as the park pushes to be a ""place where everyone is welcome.""

What are the details?

The outlet said employees were invited to a Wednesday ""cast member"" preview of the ""Happily Ever After"" fireworks show at Magic Kingdom — the first since the nightly shows were halted when the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year.

And now instead of the ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, dreamers of all ages"" introduction heard in 2020, the recorded greeting is now, ""Good evening, dreamers of all ages,"" according to videos shared by employees, Insider said.

Here's a comparison video shared on Twitter:

The outlet said while Disney World hasn't commented on the greeting change, it has made it clear that it's aiming for lots of inclusivity.

An April letter from Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, noted that the organization is ""creating a place where everyone is welcome and taking action to create meaningful change."" One of the ways it's doing so is providing ""greater flexibility with respect to forms of personal expression"" of cast members ""surrounding gender-inclusive hairstyles, jewelry, nail styles, and costume choices; and allowing appropriate visible tattoos.""

""The world is changing, and we will change with it, and continue to be a source of joy and inspiration for all the world,"" the letter added.

Insider also said Disney has made other related changes:

In June 2020, Disney announced that it would turn its Splash Mountain attraction at its US theme parks into ""Princess and the Frog""-themed rides.



The update was announced shortly after an online petition was created with the goal of encouraging Disney to ditch the ride's music and characters from ""Song of the South,"" a 1946 Disney film that's been widely criticized for its racist plot and imagery.



The company also announced in January that it'd be removing racially insensitive scenes from its classic Jungle Cruise rides.

Anything else?

In July 2017, it was announced after months of lobbying from LGBT activists that the famed London Underground train (or ""tube"") would cease using the time-honored ""ladies and gentlemen"" greeting.

Later that year, New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority followed suit, saying it also would stop using ""ladies and gentlemen"" greetings and replace them with acceptable words such as ""passengers,"" ""riders"" and ""everyone.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-world-drops-ladies-gentlemen-boys-girls,2021-07-02
Two DNC caucuses — 1 Muslim and 1 LGBT — omit 'under God' from Pledge of Allegiance this week,"At least two caucuses at the 2020 Democratic National Convention opted to omit ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance during this week's convention meetings, according to reports.

What are the details?

David Brody at CBN News posted the videos to Twitter, which have been widely shared.

Brody shared video footage of the meeting, captioning it, ""NEW! Democrats leave out 'Under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance at the #DemocraticNationalConvention Muslim Caucus meeting this week. Watch delegate AJ Durrani skip it. Featured speakers at this event were @BernieSanders @RashidaTlaib & @TomPerez.""

During the meeting, the assembly said, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

At the LGBTQ caucus, the speaker said, ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

Brody also shared the now viral video, captioning it, ""At the #DemocraticNationalConvention, LGBT Caucus purposely leaves out the words 'under God' from the Pledge of Allegiance. Watch. This now makes twice that two key constituencies of the Democratic Party have done this. See my earlier tweet about DNC Muslim Caucus.""

'One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all'

As highlighted by the Washington Times, the term ""under God"" was not officially part of the Pledge of Allegiance until 1954.

The decision to include the verbiage was made official in a bill signed by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

At the time, Eisenhower wrote, ""From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty ... In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dnc-caucuses-omit-under-god-from-pledge,2020-08-20
DOJ challenges Alabama law prohibiting gender transition for youth,"The U.S. Department of Justice is challenging an Alabama law that would make it a felony to give puberty blockers, gender reassignment surgeries, and gender transition hormones to people younger than 19 years old.

The DOJ is promoting radical leftist gender ideology by claiming that the law is prohibiting ""medically necessary care.""

""The United States’ complaint alleges that the new law’s felony ban on providing certain medically necessary care to transgender minors violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The department is also asking the court to issue an immediate order to prevent the law from going into effect,"" the DOJ's press release noted.



Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed the measure earlier this month, and it is slated to go into effect on May 8.

""S.B. 184 makes it a felony for any person to 'engage in or cause' specified types of medical care for transgender minors. S.B. 184 thus discriminates against transgender youth by denying them access to certain forms of medically necessary care,"" the press release declares. ""S.B. 184 would force parents of transgender minors, medical professionals, and others to choose between forgoing medically necessary procedures and treatments, or facing criminal prosecution. The United States’ complaint alleges that S.B. 184 violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating on the basis of sex and transgender status.""

The DOJ's move comes as Americans remain divided on issues related to radical gender ideology, especially as it pertains to children — many people believe that children should not be exposed to such ideology in school and that kids should not be able to get gender transition hormones and surgeries.



""I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl,"" Ivey said in a statement earlier this month. ""We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-challenges-alabama-transgender-law,2022-04-30
'Alt-right' trolls target Turning Point USA again as Donald Trump Jr. walks out of book launch at liberal university after constant heckling,"Donald Trump Jr. walked out of his Sunday appearance at the University of California, Los Angeles, after an unruly mob of purported ""alt-right"" activists heckled the president's son off the stage, demanding a Q&A session.

What are the details?

Trump Jr. appeared at the university for a launch of his new book, ""Triggered: How The Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.""

About 450 people were in attendance at the event — which was moderated by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk — many of them chanting, ""USA, USA!""



According to The Guardian, Trump Jr. — who appeared with his Trump adviser girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle — refused to take questions during the event due to time constraints. Trump Jr. also said that taking questions from the audience ran the risk of creating misconstrued soundbites that would end up distorted on the internet.



The chants of ""USA!"" eventually turned into chants of ""Q and A!"" before Guilfoyle called out the protesters for being rude. ""We are happy to answer a question. Respect the people around you so that they can hear.""

When it seemed like the protesters would not let him get a word in edgewise, Trump left the stage about 20 minutes into the event, which was scheduled to span two hours.

According to The Washington Post, Trump Jr. initially appeared to believe that the shouts were coming from leftist protesters.

""Name a time when conservatives have disrupted even the furthest leftist on a college campus,"" he reportedly told the crowd. ""It doesn't happen that way. We're willing to listen.""

One of the audience members then reportedly shouted, ""Then open the Q&A!""

""See what I mean?"" Trump Jr. fired back. ""And that is the problem. And the reason oftentimes it doesn't make sense to do the Q&A is not because we're not willing to talk about the questions, 'cause we do. No. It's because people hijack it with nonsense looking to go for some sort of sound bite. You have people spreading nonsense, spreading hate, trying to take over the room.""

Who are these people?

Several outlets report that the hecklers were the same ""alt-right"" trolls who had dogged Kirk, disrupting and sabotaging at least one previous event that was moderated and sponsored by Turning Point USA.

Nick Fuentes, a 21-year-old white nationalist activist who hosts a podcast called ""America First,"" Salon reports, called the protest a ""HUGE victory,"" and seemed to take credit for the disruption. Fuentes — who is sometimes known as ""Nazi Nick"" — is also a self-described white supremacist and holocaust denier.

Fuentes wrote that he and his ""group"" didn't have a particular issue with Trump Jr., but did take issue with Kirk.

""Our problem is not with [Trump Jr.] who is a patriot — We are supporters of his father!"" Fuentes wrote on Twitter about the incident. ""Our problem is with Charlie Kirk's TPUSA organization that SHUTS DOWN and SMEARS socially conservative Christians and supporters of President Trump's agenda. We are AMERICA FIRST!""

Fuentes also blasted Kirk for being a ""fake conservative.""

""Charlie Kirk is a FAKE CONSERVATIVE that promotes the LGBT agenda, supports immigration policies that hurt the American worker, and says that America is simply a worthless 'placeholder,'"" he wrote. ""Kirk was virulently anti-Trump until we won the nomination. He is hurting MAGA!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/donald-trump-jr-walks-out-of-book-launch-at-liberal-university-after-his-own-supporters-heckle-him,2019-11-11
"Drag queen on 'Blue's Clues' sings to kids about 'two daddies,' 'two mommies,' and 'trans,' 'nonbinary,' 'pan' family members for Pride Month","Children's show ""Blue's Clues & You"" released an LGBTQ-themed video on its YouTube channel showing an animated drag queen singing to kids about ""two daddies,"" ""two mommies,"" as well as ""trans,"" ""nonbinary,"" and ""pan"" family members to mark the start of Pride Month.

What are the details?

The drag queen in the video is an animated version of a real-life drag queen — Nina West — whom ""Today"" called a ""beloved 'RuPaul's Drag Race' contestant from season 11.""

West's character leads young viewers in a song about a ""Pride Parade"" — to the tune of ""The Ants Go Marching"" — and shows different groups of animals in a parade waving rainbow flags. The lyrics also include other LGBTQ buzzwords such as ""ace"" — which stands for ""asexual"" — as well as ""queer,"" ""bi,"" ""pan,"" ""allies,"" and ""kings and queens.""

""Hey, Blue! Look at all these families! Hi, families!"" West's character begins. ""It's time for a Pride Parade.""

""Families marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah! Families marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah!"" the first verse notes. ""This family has two mommies, they love each other so proudly. And they all go marching in ... the big ... parade!""

The song continues with the ""two by two"" group of animals and ends with ""ten by ten"" as West's character sings, ""Love is love is love, you see, and everyone should love proudly.""

Here's the video:

The Blue's Clues Pride Parade 🏳️🌈 Sing-Along Ft. Nina West! youtu.be



Anything else?

According to TMZ, ""the overwhelming reaction to this appears to be positive ... with many taking to social media to praise 'Blue's Clues' for being progressive — and taking proactive steps to teach kids about different family structures in a fun, catchy way that appeals to young children.""

But the outlet noted that some are ""clutching their pearls over this ... but they're mostly being drowned out by folks saying this is a great thing that Nick/Nick Jr.'s doing.""

""Remember,"" TMZ noted, ""Nickelodeon has already indicated that some characters in their own pantheon — including SpongeBob SquarePants — might just be part of the LGBTQ+ world themselves, or allies at least. So, it's really not that much of a stretch for them to get Blue onboard, too.""

It isn't clear if the Pride Parade song is part of an actual episode or if it's a standalone clip separate from it. But it appears that Pride Month may have been a recent topic on a ""Blues Clues & You"" episode, as the little girl in the clip below shows her drawings of flags depicting ""different parts of the LGBTQ+ community,"" including a ""gay pride flag,"" a ""nonbinary pride flag,"" a ""lesbian flag,"" and a ""transgender pride flag.""

Yahoo Life noted that ""Blue's Clues & You"" went down this road even earlier, as the show posted a new alphabet song in February declaring that ""P is full of Pride"" with rainbow flags and other LGBTQ ""signifiers.""



Pushback

Joy Pullmann, executive editor of the Federalist, pushed back against the Pride Parade song and said it's part of the show's psychological strategy for indoctrinating children.

More from her piece:

A 2018 New York Times article points out that the highly popular show for two- to five-year-olds is so dedicated to repetition to impress its messages on children that each episode of ""Blue's Clues"" plays every day for an entire week. The producers also test each episode three times on focus groups of children before it airs.



The 2005 cover story for the Association for Psychological Science's publication Observer discusses the psychological techniques preschool shows use to impress what they believe are socially beneficial attitudes on viewers. Verbal repetition is one. Repetition throughout a child's environment — merchandizing a show's characters to meatspace products like classroom math exercises or Tickle Me Elmo dolls — is another.



This repetition and saturation strategy has clearly been deliberately used to normalize certain sexual behaviors and attitudes, both in children and adults. We've recently seen everything from a cross-dresser on ""Sesame Street"" to a gay wedding on PBS's children's show ""Arthur."" LGBT consciousness is so pervasive that Americans think six times as many people are LGBT as actually identify so, and each successive generation exhibits higher rates of LGBT identification.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-blues-clues-pride-month,2021-06-01
Drag queen called 'Flowjob' is a guest at a Scotland elementary school — and parents are furious,"Parents of elementary school students in Scotland are outraged after the school reportedly permitted a visit from a drag queen called ""Flowjob.""

What are the details?

According to The Scottish Sun, the drag queen recently appeared at Glencoats Primary in Paisley in order to read a story to elementary school students.

Parents were outraged following the visit, saying that Flowjob's appearance at the school was ""disgusting."" The outlet reported that many of the parents also voiced their contempt for school officials that permitted the visit, as parents were reportedly not notified of the appearance beforehand.

The outlet reported that the school set its Twitter account to private following the outrage. An internet search for the school's Twitter account now directs users to a page that appears to have been deleted.

One parent told the outlet, ""While I don't agree with the abuse being given, my kids go to this school [and] there was no information fed to parents about this happening. Surely that's a parent's choice? I'm happy my child is learning about LGBT, but it's overtaking the school now. Something every week.""

The parent added, ""I'm not opposed to learning about LGBT, but my 7-year-old doesn't need to know what a drag queen is, and certainly not the one they had in. The head teacher is more concerned about furthering her career than tackling issuing (sic) that our school has.""

The Sun reported that the drag queen's social media presence is chock-full of sexual content and innuendo, which further upset many parents.

Flowjob apparently took heat for the appearance as well, and the outlet reports that the drag queen fended for themselves on social media.

""Don't bring your negativity into my life,"" Flowjob demanded. ""I am a drag queen yes who does adult jokes, but I also do under 18 Venus [sic] and cater around children.""

What else?



A spokesperson for Renfrewshire Council acknowledged the controversy in a statement to the Sun.

""The school pupils at Glencoats Primary are currently organizing a series of activities and events to mark LGBT history month,"" the statement explained.

Drag queen says gun control is needed to protect kids,"Drag Queen Story Hour executive director Jonathan Hamilt said that gun control is needed to protect kids.

""You know, 19 students just got shot in Texas, and Texas legislation wants to ban minors from going to drag shows. It makes zero sense. It's a sad, sorry excuse... [for] the lack of gun control, and that's the real issue,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent.

A school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last month left 19 children and two teachers dead.

""Drag queens aren't going into schools to shoot kids... when did we decide that it's appropriate to teach kids how to hide under desks and not to talk about LGBT people and histories?"" Hamilt said. ""If people really wanted to protect children, it wouldn't be banning LGBTQ education, it would be banning guns.""

After a bar in Texas held a ""Drag the Kids to Pride"" event last weekend, GOP Texas state Rep. Bryan Slaton said that he would propose legislation to protect children from being exposed ""to drag shows and other inappropriate events.""



Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, also a Republican, tweeted that ""Drag Sex Shows aimed at children have come to Florida"" and announced that he ""will be proposing Legislation to charge w/ a Felony & terminate the parental rights of any adult who brings a child to these perverted sex shows aimed at FL kids.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said that Florida has ""laws against child endangerment"" and that his administration is examining what actions can be taken ""under existing, ah, statutes.""

Dallas drag show controversy: DeSantis says staff will look at child endangerment laws in Florida www.youtube.com

""Any attempt to criminalise our work is rooted in tired homophobic and transphobic hate and misinformation, and we refuse to give in to politicians who are too bigoted and boring to comprehend our vision for a world in which every child can be safe fully expressing who they are,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent.

The issue of exposing children to drag is very controversial — many parents consider the topic to be highly inappropriate for kids.

Drag Queen Story Hour events involve drag queens reading to children, but Hamilt contended that there is a world of difference between DQSH events and adult drag shows.



""I'm not going to lie and say drag is never sexualised, because drag is an art form and it can be sexual like anything else can be,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent. ""Drag with adults in an adult setting could be sexual, sure. Is it sexual at a Drag Queen Story Hour? No! Do you bring your kids to an R-rated movie? I hope not. There are actors in R rated movies, and those same actors can be in a family friendly comedy that's rated G...

""Someone who is bigoted or doesn't want to do the research, they're not going to understand that an adult drag show at an adult bar, in the evening, with alcohol, is different from a Drag Queen Story Hour nonprofit event at 11am at a public library.



""Obviously, all adults act differently when they're around children and when they're not. Every schoolteacher has a private life outside of working with children, and you act appropriately around children. That's just a normal thing that all adults do, no matter who you are – gay or straight, drag queen or not,"" Hamilt said.

A drag queen known as ""Lil Miss Hot Mess"" has authored two children's books that replace the lyrics of well known songs with drag-related themes. A book titled, ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It,"" replaces the lyrics of ""If You're Happy and You Know It"" with words such as ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It, Blow a Kiss!"" and ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It, Strike a Pose!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-gun-control-kids,2022-06-11
Drag queen pastor declares 'God is nothing' in blasphemous profanity-laced video,"Isaac Simmons, a United Methodist Church candidate for ordination and associate pastor at Hope UMC in Bloomington, Illinois, recently spewed blasphemy in a new slam poem ode to the LGBTQ+ movement.

The drag queen pastor and self-styled ""drag-evangelist"" who goes by the stage name, Ms. Penny Cost, declared over and over again that ""God is nothing,"" ""the Bible is nothing,"" and ""religion is nothing"" in the profanity-laced video posted on his website.

Yet while the God of historic Christianity is but a farce, according to Simmons — who repeatedly refers to the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as female — queer spirituality and LGBTQ+ identity are, in fact, the true expression of divinity.

""God is nothing, but if she were, she would be yes, queen-ing her way down the runways of Paris and Montreal, strutting between that tightrope pulled taught between absurdity and opulence, balancing between too much and never enough,"" he proclaims. ""Nothing, but if she were, she would be a seamstress of divine couture, weaving together string theory and self portraits to form the fiercest gowns of queer existence.""

""God is nothing but a drag queen with a microphone of biblical f***ing proportions,"" he adds.

""Out of a closet of darkness, from under a shroud of secrecy came the beauty of humanity, humanity made in the gender-bending, identity-breaking, system-shaking image of God, the imago Dei,"" he declares. ""From Adam and Steve to you and to me.""

Simmons then turns his attention to the ""f***ed up theology of toxic masculinity and the s***y ideals of the oppressive regime"" and ""Christian terrorists who wield their flappable doctrine to inflict harm on God's queerly-anointed creation.""

The Bible, God, and religion ""must be nothing,"" he concludes, unless we wield it into something.""

In the caption of the video, Simmons dedicates his performance to so-called deconstructionists, non-literalists, and queer spiritualists, and claims his message is ""directed to those who actively and passively cause harm against the LGBTQIA2S+ Community due to their understandings of Scripture.""

Amazingly, despite his clear denial of and hatred for the basic tenets of Christianity, the United Methodist Church has certified Simmons as a candidate for ministry. At Hope UMC, where Simmons currently serves, the proudly queer pastor has hosted ""drag queen Sundays,"" which he describes as ""basically just a church service that just happened to be performed in drag.""

Simmons has become a lightning rod amid a years-long clash over LGBTQ+ issues within the United Methodist Church. Earlier this year, the Global Methodist Church — a more conservative Methodist denomination that holds to a traditional view of marriage and opposes ordaining LGBT clergy — announced it would formally split from the denomination.

Simmons discussed in more detail his efforts to merge drag and spirituality in an interview with UMC, posted below.

Drag queen show held at US Air Force base to reflect its commitment to 'diversity and inclusion' — and observers torch the decision,"Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada hosted its first-ever drag queen show last week, reflecting service members' commitment to ""diversity and inclusion,"" a base spokesperson told Newsweek.

What are the details?

The ""Drag-u-Nellis"" show was held at the Las Vegas base last Thursday, the magazine said, adding that the Nellis Air Force Base Pride committee planned the event.

Newsweek said the show featured drag queens from the Las Vegas area, including appearances by Coco Montrese, Makena Knight, and Alexis Mateo. The event's flyer said attendees can ""discover the significance of Drag in the LGBT+ Community.""

The individual who posted the event flyer on Twitter — @BravoKiloActual — is an Air Force special warfare veteran, according to the person's bio.



""I guess the airmen at @NellisAFB have completely mastered air and ground combat so they can relax with an event that has grown men in dresses twerking; very cool!"" @BravoKiloActual added in a subsequent tweet.

Newsweek also said event critics wondered why the largest U.S. air combat training center was hosting a drag show, noting some Twitter users called it ""outrageous"" and ""unbelievable.""

Here's how other observers reacted:

""I'm so embarrassed for our military but our country,"" one commenter wrote. ""Some of you may think this OK but many more of us are disgusted and find this appalling and disrespectful to those in uniform past and present. On a global stage we are being laughed at.""

""I love drag shows & it's great entertainment. But I'm totally lost on this new 'woke' agenda being pushed on our military,"" another user noted. ""Their oath is to support & defend the constitution, not to learn the history of drag.""

""China and Russia are licking their chops over the decline of the United States,"" another commenter declared.

""Base commander should be relieved of duty for letting this happen....oh wait, it's the Biden admin.....never mind,"" another user said.

What did the base have to say?

""Nellis Air Force Base is committed to providing and championing an environment that is characterized by equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion,"" a base spokesman told Newsweek. ""Base leaders remain supportive of events and initiatives that reinforce the Air Force's emphasis on diversity and inclusion toward recognizing the value every one of our Airmen brings to the team.""

The spokesperson added to the magazine that ""approximately 180 Nellis community members attended, and feedback from attendees was resoundingly positive.""

Anything else?

Nellis also houses the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center, which Newsweek — citing the base's website — said is ""the largest and most demanding advanced air combat training mission in the world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-show-air-force-base,2021-06-24
Drag Queen Story Hour at Ohio elementary school canceled after 'outside agitators' complain — and district doesn't sound happy,"A Drag Queen Story Hour set to take place Tuesday at an Ohio elementary school after school hours was canceled for safety reasons after ""outside agitators"" complained, WCMH-TV reported.

""We support Clinton Elementary School and its PTA in their efforts to promote diversity, inclusion, and safe spaces within their school community,"" Columbus City Schools said in a statement late last week, the station noted. ""The response to the event from our Clinton Elementary School families has been overwhelmingly positive. This is a diverse school community who feels it is important to recognize and support people from all walks of life. It is unfortunate that outside agitators feel the need to influence what we do locally.""

Patricia Price, the school's principal, told WCMH that malicious messages were sent to the school, so the decision was made to cancel the event to maintain the safety of students and staff.

The district's statement added, ""It is important that we all work together to keep our children safe and our schools a welcoming environment that is conducive to learning and growth for everyone. The District does not discriminate based upon sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, ancestry, familial status or military status with regard to admission, access, treatment or employment.""

What else?

Prominent Ohio drag queens Valerie Taylor and Courtney Kelly were set to dress as Disney characters Mary Poppins and Cruella de Vil for the Drag Queen Story Hour, the Columbus Dispatch reported.

According to a poster advertising the event, the plan was to ""sing songs and read books exploring diversity, self-love, and an appreciation of all people"" and raise money for those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, the paper added.

A parent of two students at the school declined to go on camera but told WCMH she was disappointed about the cancellation as she was planning to take her kids to the Drag Queen Story Hour.

Those opposed to the event made their voices heard on social media, the station said, adding that one individual tweeted an image of the story hour poster along with the phone numbers for the school's principal and the school board president and encouraged people to call them.

"Drag queen rallies militant leftists defending drag story time for kids at library: 'This is not lewd! We LGBT people, we're not inappropriate!'","Militant leftists far outnumbered people protesting a drag story time event for kids Saturday in front of the Fall River Public Library in Massachusetts — and a drag queen was on hand to rally the woke troops.

Miss Gloria was jazzed that so many fellow leftists came out ""to show Nazis that they have no place in the 21st century!"" The cheering crowd loved it.

Speaking in defense of the drag story time event, Miss Gloria added: ""This is not lewd! We LGBT people, we're not inappropriate! ... We reject hate!""

Video journalist Brendan Gutenschwager captured the drag queen's speech and a number of other notable moments:

WJAR-TV spoke to Sean Connell — who plays Miss Gloria — and he told the station he believes there's a big difference between drag shows that take place at bars and the drag story time event.

""It's not recruitment. It's not grooming. It's love. It's stories,"" Connell told WJAR. ""It's letting LGBT kids know that LGBT adults are here — we survive [and] they can survive and they can continue to be themselves.""

Connell added to the station that despite the protests, the drag story time at the library will continue every month: ""I think that the big message here is, 'Don't let hate and fear stop you from learning who you are and from being your authentic self.'""

What else happened?

At one point, a lone man holding a ""no sex with children! Pervert!"" sign stood in front of the leftist group supporting the drag event, one of whom waved an Antifa flag:

Here's the clip showing the man eventually being surrounded:

A different lone man standing against the drag time story event faced off against leftists standing guard and wouldn't back down when one them took a couple of steps beyond the protection of his group and put on a tough-guy routine:

Here's the clip. (Content warning: language):



Anything else?

WJAR did get the perspective of one person protesting the drag time story event.

""I'm just completely against it, I want it to stop,"" Christine Doherty told the station. ""Drag shows and drag queens are not appropriate for children. Nobody's homophobic on our side at all. Drag shows are fine for adults who want to go see them.""

Woman allegedly tries taking Virgin Mary statue at Drag Queen Story Hour protest — then freaks out at intervening cops,"A woman was caught on video allegedly trying to take a Virgin Mary statue from a Catholic group protesting a Drag Queen Story Hour in Indianapolis — and then was seen freaking out at police who intervened and pulled her from the scene.

Rex Teodosio wrote for the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property that his group was ""peacefully praying the rosary"" Feb. 23 outside the Indy Reads Books store in protest of its Drag Queen Story Hour, in which men dressed in drag read books to young children and their parents.



Image source: YouTube screenshot

Drag Queen Story Hours have been growing in number and popularity. One performer said at a public hearing that Drag Queen Story Hours are designed to ""groom the next generation"" to accept LGBT values.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And as you've no doubt heard, a number of kids are getting into the drag queen act, too.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

What happened at the Drag Queen Story Hour protest?

""We were heckled by a few advocates of the LGBT community right from the start,"" Teodosio wrote. ""Ironically, the first counterprotester accused us of being intolerant and warping children.""

Teodosio added that his group only engaged adversaries ""when they came up right to our faces. They kept claiming we were intolerant. Yet, they showed nothing but aggression and provocation, frequently calling us names and even blaspheming God and the Church. They behaved like bullies.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Soon a woman tried to grab a Virgin Mary statue from the protest area, lifting it up and then apparently throwing it to the ground as one protester tried to stop her — all of which was caught on video.



Image source: YouTube screenshot

Teodosio said the base of the statue was broken off, and the crown fell and was damaged — which is a problem because the statue was custom-made in Brazil and ""is not something you buy in the local Catholic gift shop.""

Get your popcorn ready



Video showed three officers putting the alleged culprit's arms behind her as they escorted her from the scene.

She also complained to police that ""I have three men around me. Get off of me ... I don't know what a statue is.""

Soon she began screaming and shouting at the officers, one of whom put an arm around the front of her neck and pulled her backward in an apparent attempt to restrain her.

""This was a clash of two queens,"" Teodosio concluded. ""We were praying to our Heavenly Queen against a drag queen event.""

Drag Queen Story Time specifically for children under 5 championed by London borough — and observers are horrified,"The borough of Newham in London championed a Drag Queen Story Time specifically for children under 5 years of age in an official borough news story regarding the start of LGBT+ History Month.

Here's the lowdown about the event featuring drag queens reading stories to kids — from a Newham Council Twitter account that handles borough news:

The council's tweet links to a page for Newham LGBT History Month, which describes the Drag Queen Story Time as ""providing spaces in which kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions"" and a chance for ""children to imagine the world in which people can present as they wish.""

What did observers have to say?

As you might expect, not everyone reacted positively to the Newham Council tweet about the upcoming event:

""What kind of sane adult takes their kids to this?""

""Every single person involved in the promotion, facilitation, and execution of this deranged, wicked event deserves to be locked up in prison facing capital punishment. Including the parents.""

""Child abuse.""

""Well, at least do me a favor and don't pretend to be surprised when the pedophiles want to be recognized as 'just love.' Slippery slopes.""

""This is grooming. Don't pretend it's anything else.""

""It does nothing positive for the kids. It only feeds the leftist need to feel superior. 'Look at how superior I am, allowing these heathens into my children's space,' 'I am the epitome of inclusion.'""

""Where are the parents? Parents are supposed to protect their children.""

As the following BBC clip on Drag Queen Story Time UK, parents and caregivers are right there smiling with their youngsters while drag queens teach their version of what acceptance and tolerance looks like:

Drag troupe for those with Down syndrome was set for US debut until Republican owner of venue nixed show. Now ACLU is complaining.,"A few months back TheBlaze noted a drag queen troupe consisting of performers with Down syndrome — which calls itself ""Drag Syndrome.""

The U.K. outfit was launched in March 2018 because choreographer Daniel Vais wanted people with intellectual disabilities to have an outlet to perform. The troupe sported Lady Francesca (Francis), Horrora Shebang (Otto), and Gaia Callas (Danny) — as well as a drag ""king"" Justin Bond (Ruby).

""When people see us perform, they recognize the immense talent in front of them and the sheer quality entertainment of the artists,"" Vais told the Mighty, adding that ""people with Down syndrome have the extra chromosome to excel in the arts, culture, and anywhere else.""

Coming to America



Drag Syndrome recently was set to make its United States debut at an art exhibition in Grand Rapids, Mich., the New York Times reported. But the paper said there was backlash from community members concerned that the performers were being exploited.

Among the detractors was Peter Meijer, a member of the family that owns Meijer supermarkets in the region, the Times said.

Meijer — also a Republican congressional candidate — happens to own the venue where Drag Syndrome was slated to appear, and the paper said he put a stop to the show last month, as he wasn't sure the performers could give their ""full and informed consent.""

Enter the ACLU

With that, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights against Meijer, claiming he discriminated against the Drag Syndrome performers due to their disability, the Times reported, adding that the complaint also called him out for sex discrimination since the performers would be in drag.

""If members of the group were to perform an orchestra recital, chances are he wouldn't have canceled the performance,"" Jay Kaplan, a staff attorney at ACLU of Michigan, told the paper.

Kaplan also told the Times that the complaint is mostly intended to make a statement — but he added that if the case is referred to the state's Civil Rights Commission, a discrimination finding could elicit a fine.

DisArt, the local nonprofit that organized the drag show, found a new venue for Drag Syndrome, the Times said, and since the first performance on Saturday sold out within hours a second one was added for Sunday.

The nonprofit added in a statement to the paper that the Drag Syndrome performers are ""consenting adults"" who have ""paved their own way into this career, a process that has not been easy, but nonetheless successful.""



Meijer speaks out

""The involvement of individuals whose ability to act of their own volition is unclear raises serious ethical concerns that I cannot reconcile,"" Meijer wrote in his letter to officials heading up the Drag Syndrome show, the Times said, adding that he told a local news station he believed the performance was meant to ""further an activist message.""

More from the paper:



In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Meijer said that he did not take his decision lightly, calling up about three dozen people beforehand (""probably irresponsibly, for the sake of my campaign,"" he said). They included members of the disability advocacy community, parents of children with Down syndrome, members of the LGBT community and national groups dedicated to Down syndrome, he said.



After his decision was publicized, he was the subject of a backlash of his own.

""I have been called a bigot, an ableist, a homophobe, and a transphobe,"" Meijer told the Times. ""I fundamentally don't understand how someone can take my very good faith concern about the potential for exploitation and spin that into discriminating against people with a disability.""

Christopher Smit, the other director of DisArt, noted to the paper that the group talked with Meijer and believed his decision to nix the show was premature.

Smit added to the Times that he wanted to Meijer to speak with one of the performers, but Meijer said he made his decision before that was able to happen and that his legal counsel was concerned about a possible protest at the building.

And while an official at the National Down Syndrome Congress told Meijer that competence among those with intellectual disabilities should be presumed unless there's evidence to the contrary, the paper said Meijer insisted his ""standard of proof"" was higher as the venue's owner.

Dennis McGuire, a Down syndrome behavioral expert, added to the Times that adults with Down syndrome are typically mature enough to make their own decisions.

""Anyone who knows people with Down syndrome understands that they love to perform, and they're really good at it,"" McGuire told the paper. ""They're so openhearted, and they love music and dancing and theater.""

Here's a report about the dust-up that aired before Drag Syndrome found a new venue:

Drew Brees responds to LGBTQ lobby after they attack him for supporting the 'Bring your Bible to school' program,"NFL superstar quarterback Drew Brees was broadsided by the LGBT lobby over his support of an innocuous program advocating for children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith out publicly.

Brees has been outspoken about his Christian faith and how it has guided his life.

In the video promotion he recorded for the program, Brees talked about one of his favorite Bible scriptures, and encouraged kids to talk about their Christian faith.

Shout-Out from Drew Brees www.youtube.com

""I want to encourage you to live out your faith on Bring Your Bible to School Day, and share God's love with friends,"" Brees said. ""You're not alone.""



Allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated Brees on social media.

Robert Littal of Black Sports Online called the group ""a known racist discriminatory religious cult,"" and, ""an Anti-Gay Religious Cult That Believes in Conversion Therapy & Fights Against Any Anti-Discrimination Laws.""

Deadspin ran the headline ""Drew Brees appears in video for gay conversion therapy sickos, doesn't understand what the big deal is,"" for the story.

Others on Twitter accused Brees of being a ""bigot"" and aligned with a ""hateful group.""

Brees responded to the online furor through a video on his Instagram trying to clear the air and saying that he was falsely smeared by a deceptive article on the story.

Brees said that he lived by the credo to ""love all, respect all, and accept all.""

""What I did was I filmed a video recently that was encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school for national Bring your Bible to School Day,"" said Brees.

""So I'm not sure why the negativity spread, or why people tried to rope me into certain negativity,"" he added. ""I do not support any groups that discriminate, or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality. OK? So hopefully that has set the record straight, and we can all move on, because that is not what I stand for.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drew-brees-called-a-bigot-for-bible-program,2019-09-05
Gay reparations? Elizabeth Warren introduces bill to pay certain same-sex couples,"Amid debate over whether Americans should pay reparations for slavery, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is advocating what many claim amounts to ""gay reparations.""

Warren introduced a bill last week — called the ""Refund Equality Act"" — that would permit gay married couple to amend past tax returns to receive the additional tax breaks they would have received had they been allowed to file taxes jointly with their partner.

""The federal government forced legally married same-sex couples in Massachusetts to file as individuals and pay more in taxes for almost a decade,"" Warren said, according to NBC News. ""We need to call out that discrimination and to make it right.""

Same-sex couples in 10 states were allowed to legally marry before the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Warren's bill would allow those couples to amend their previous tax returns for all the years they were married before DOMA was overturned. The IRS previously allowed same-sex couples to amend the last three years of returns, the same time allotted to all married couples.

A report by the Joint Committee on Taxation revealed last week those couples would be eligible for $57 million in refunds.

""We must right these wrongs,"" Warren said last week.

Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) introduced companion legislation, called the ""PRIDE Act of 2019,"" in the House earlier this month.

Warren introduced similar legislation in 2017, put it failed to gain enough support to pass, despite being co-sponsored by more than 30 lawmakers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-gay-reparations,2019-06-23
LGBT icon Ellen DeGeneres sits next to former President George W. Bush during Cowboys game — and some people were incredibly angry about it,"Comedian and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres sat with former President George W. Bush during Sunday's Dallas Cowboys game, and many people on the internet were not happy that the LGBT advocate was happily rubbing elbows with the former Republican president.

What are the details?

DeGeneres and Bush were seated in Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' suite when one of the stadium cameras panned to the two of them looking happy and friendly.

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Bush — who also sat next to wife Laura Bush — even elicited a ""big laugh"" from the popular talk show host. DeGeneres' wife, actress Portia de Rossi, was also in attendance at the game between the Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers.

Predictably, however, much of the internet was not impressed with the bipartisan show of unity between the two beloved public figures.



Here's what some of them had to say:

""It doesn't matter if you're gay or straight. Just untouchably rich. And white, of course.""

""As Ellen is a gleeful participant in the George W. Bush Rehabilitation Project, I'd just like to point out George W. Bush's 2004 re-election relied upon pushing state ballot initiatives banning Same-Sex Marriage and pushing for a Constitutional Amendment banning it.""

""So quirky and fun to see George Bush out with Ellen at a Cowboys game after his terrible foreign policy decisions killed thousands of innocent people.""

""Ellen donates to Pete Buttigieg and goes to ball games with George W Bush Don't be like Ellen.""

""Ellen DeGeneres laughing it up with someone who has actively tried to harm our community feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous.""

""I don't care how nice of a guy George W Bush is. He was one of our worst presidents and left our country and world in bad shape. The mess he helped create we're still trying to dig out of. This is a bad look for @TheEllenShow.""

Ellen DeGeneres talks the Academy into rehiring Kevin Hart; Twitter trolls turn on her,"Ellen DeGeneres has come to the defense of comedian Kevin Hart, saying he should be able to host the Oscars in spite of recent backlash over tweets that resurfaced from years ago. But the same trolls who caused Hart to back out of the awards show turned on DeGeneres for accepting Hart's apology to the LGBT community.

What are the details?

Last month, Hart stepped away from hosting the 91st annual Academy Awards ceremony after being accused of homophobia over years-old comments for which he had already publicly apologized.

In an interview Thursday, DeGeneres told Hart on her talk show that she had reached out to the Academy and asked if they would still be willing to have Hart emcee their ceremony if he reconsidered his decision.

""They were like, 'Oh my God! We want him to host...whatever we can do, we would be thrilled, and he should host the Oscars,"" she said, the Washington Examiner reported.

Hart said he would think about it, responding, ""It's tough for me because it was an attack, a malicious attack on my character, to end me.""

But, he told DeGeneres, ""Leaving here, I promise you I'm evaluating this conversation. Let me assess, just sit in the space and really think, and you and I will talk before anything else.""

DeGeneres went on to encourage Hart to not let Twitter trolls keep him from what he's called ""the opportunity of a lifetime.""

""They're gonna win if you don't host the Oscars,"" DeGeneres told him. ""You can't let them destroy you and they can't destroy you because you have too much talent. That's why they [The Academy] haven't found another host. I think they were secretly hoping that you would come back.""

What's so wrong with that?

When clips of the interview were released on Friday, online critics weren't having it. The Hollywood Reporter said DeGeneres faced ""backlash,"" citing several tweets from Twitter users pelting DeGeneres with insults for giving Hart a pass.

BuzzFeed film reporter Adam Vary searched Hart's entire Twitter feed for gay slang and re-posted several of the comedian's past comments online Dec. 5. Hart backed out of hosting the Oscars the next day, after initially accepting the role just 48 hours prior.

On Friday, Vary — who has repeatedly criticized Hart since — went on a Twitter tirade, taking offense that DeGeneres would tell Hart to defend himself against ""haters.""

(1) First, the people who brought up Kevin Hart's past tweets — like me — were not, as Ellen characterized, ""haters."" The host of the Oscars had made anti-gay jokes, and LGBT people who love the Oscars were legitimately startled to see just how harsh his words were. It wasn't a…

(3) …when @louisvirtel asked Hart about the vaguely homophobic jokes in GET HARD, like Hart affecting an effeminate voice to evoke fear of prison rape, Hart's response was, ""Funny is funny."" That may be a legit perspective; it isn't an apology. https://t.co/z92Bslbdhr

— Adam B. Vary (@adambvary) January 4, 2019

(4) Third, Hart argued that the fact that his old tweets were found so quickly is evidence of a malicious attack to destroy him personally, b/c people had to go through over 40k tweets to get back to his old ones from 2010 and 2011 (rather than 2008, as he kept saying). Well…

(5) …Hart may not be aware, but Twitter has a search function that allows anyone to search anyone else's history. So if you're curious if a standup comic hired to host the Oscars had used homophobic language in the past, it takes 10 seconds to find out. https://t.co/FQS89q3o6e

— Adam B. Vary (@adambvary) January 4, 2019

(6) Finally, it's depressing that Ellen's enthusiasm for Hart hosting the Oscars — and he would've been a good host! — led her to contribute to a narrative that Hart is the victim of ""haters"" & ""trolls"" out to ""destroy"" him, & if he doesn't host the Oscars, they'll ""win."" Well…

— Adam B. Vary (@adambvary) January 4, 2019

(7) …if @TheAcademy wants to hire Hart back after he made the simple act of apologizing for hurtful, harmful, anti-gay language into a vicious conspiracy to ruin his entire life, I'm not sure who ""wins"" in that scenario, either. (END)

Singer threatens to cancel performance at Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving game unless Salvation Army supports LGBT agenda,"Singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding threatened to cancel her planned halftime performance for the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving football game unless the Salvation Army issues a show of support for gay marriage.

Goulding made the demands after her fans appraised her of the traditional marriage stance of the Salvation Army, which is a Christian organization.

The game, which will feature the Cowboys against the Buffalo Bills, promotes the Red Kettle Kickoff halftime show that raises money for the charitable efforts of the Salvation Army.

""Upon researching this, I have reached out to The Salvation Army and said that I would have no choice but to pull out unless they very quickly make a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community,"" she wrote.

""I am a committed philanthropist as you probably know, and my heart has always been in helping the homeless, but supporting an anti-LGBTQ charity is clearly not something I would ever intentionally do,"" she added. ""Thank you for drawing my attention to this.""

A spokesperson for the Salvation Army responded to the threat to the Dallas News, but they did not indicate whether their plans for the halftime show had changed.

""With an organization of our size and history, myths can perpetuate. An individual's sexual or gender identity, religion, or lifestyle has no bearing on our willingness to provide service,"" the statement read. ""We stand firmly behind our mission to meet human needs in His name without discrimination.""

Elon Musk dissolves Twitter's censorship council,"Twitter axed its so-called Trust and Safety Council on Monday night.

Leftist elements of the defunct council have denounced the move and joined the chorus of critics opposed to Twitter's apparent embrace of Elon Musk's ""free speech absolutist"" ideals.

The dissolution of the council comes just days after three of its members, including the niece of Biden official John Podesta, resigned, citing as partial cause their opposition to the restoration of banned accounts belonging to conservatives such as former President Donald Trump.

Thanks but no thanks

Trust and Safety Council members received an email signed ""Twitter"" on Monday that said, ""As Twitter moves into a new phase, we are reevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development.""

Evidently, the best way forward was without the meddling council's direct involvement.

The letter noted that Twitter will ""continue to welcome your ideas going forward"" and ""will also continue to explore opportunities to provide focused and timely input into our work, whether through bilateral or small group meetings.""

An archived version of the council's now-defunct ""About"" page describes the council as ""a group of independent expert organizations from around the world. Together, they advocate for safety and advise us as we develop our products, programs, and rules.""

The so-called expert groups that provided the council with counsel included the Anti-Defamation League, the LGBT activist group Black Rainbow, Feminist Frequency, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Muslim Advocates, and the United Nations' Association for Progressive Communications.

The group's purported areas of focus included ""Online Safety and Harassment, Human and Digital Rights, Suicide Prevention and Mental Health, Child Sexual Exploitation, and Dehumanization.""

How dare he!

Alex Holmes, now a former member of the council and a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation advisory board member, took to Twitter to lament, writing, ""Many of us have been in this space for a number of years, each with different expertise, but all with a passion to see healthy and diverse conversations and safety exist on platforms.""

""The way this has unfolded and way members have been treated is unfortunate and unacceptable,"" Holmes added.

The Washington Post reported that the council was set to meet virtually to discuss recent developments when it learned that it had been disbanded.

Larry Magid, chief executive at the Silicon Valley nonprofit ConnectSafely, was on the board as of Monday. He told the Post, ""By disbanding it, we got fired instead of quit.""

Members Eirliani Abdul Rahman, Anne Collier, and Lesley Podesta saved Musk three emails by resigning last week, claiming ""the safety and wellbeing of Twitter's users are on the decline.""

Rahman alleged in a statement that slurs against black Americans and gay men jumped since Musk's takeover and that anti-Semitism was on the rise.

""Another red line for me was when previously banned accounts such as those on the far right, and those who had incited others to violence, such as then US President Donald Trump's, were reinstated,"" said Rahman.

While noting that the readmission of the former president and others amounted to unforgivable actions on the part of Twitter's leadership, the trio of quitters claimed that under Musk, Twitter was in danger of losing its reputation as ""the platform where anyone could be heard.""

In response to these resignations, Musk tweeted, ""It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!""

Twitter founder Jack Dorsey suggested that the allegation that the Trust and Safety Council failed to take appropriate action to protect minors was false.

However, Musk doubled down, writing, ""When Ella Irwin, who now runs Trust & Safety, joined Twitter earlier this year, almost no one was working on child safety. She raised this with Ned & Parag, but they rejected her staffing request.""

Roth on the run



While some council members have gone online to complain, the former council head, Yoel Roth, has reportedly gone on the run.

The Washington Post reported that Roth fled his home on account of Musk drawing attention to his doctoral thesis.

Musk tweeted on Saturday, ""Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis,"" adding, ""This explains a lot.""

In addition to erroneously claiming investigative journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss were conservatives and only later making a stealth edit, the Washington Post claimed Musk had ""mischaracterized Roth's academic writing about sexual activity and children.""

Even if the trust and safety council hadn't been disbanded, Roth still wouldn't be able to hit Musk with a misinformation label, given that he resigned back in November.



The 35-year-old penned an op-ed in the New York Times on Nov. 18, stating, ""In my more than seven years at the company, we exposed government-backed troll farms meddling in elections, introduced tools for contextualizing dangerous misinformation, and, yes, banned President Donald Trump from the service.""



Roth, who likened members of the Trump administration to Nazis, embraced the descriptor ""custodians of the internet"" and claimed the ""work of online sanitation is unrelenting and contentious.""

Online sanitation, for Roth, has involved taking input from the FBI and censoring the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story, potentially impacting the 2020 election; de-platforming the democratically elected president of the United States; and censoring satire he personally did not find to be amusing.

"Elon Musk tweets 'pronouns suck.' Twitter doesn't respond well, and his girlfriend asks him to turn off his phone","Controversial billionaire CEO Elon Musk has done it again.

Did he introduce a new invention, like a new electric automobile or another rocket or a new online payment platform or a functional hyperloop?

Nope. Instead, he got into another digital controversy.

Musk took to Twitter — the virtual land where nothing good can happen — and declared, ""Pronouns suck.""

And the Twitterverse was none too happy. Neither was his girlfriend, hit Canadian musician Grimes.

What's all this now?

Musk has a history of being involved in online dustups: from smoking pot on camera to blasting COVID lockdowns to mocking CNN to declaring on Twitter that he was moving his company from California to Texas. Just recently ripped COVID tests for their inaccuracy and demanded that anyone who has tested positive should be tested again because of so many alleged ""false positives.""

On Friday night, the Tesla founder wrote a two-word Tweet that set people off: ""Pronouns suck.""

Image source: Twitter screenshot

Apparently everyone online assumed that Musk was making a statement criticizing people's individual pronoun choices — a cause near and dear to much of the LGBT community.



Even his partner, Grimes, went after him.

""I love you but please turn off ur phone or give me a dall [sic],"" Grimes posted in a tweet that has since been deleted, the Page Six reported. ""I cannot support hate. Please stop this. I know this isn't your heart.""

Grimes and Musk had their first child in May. They named their son X AE A-XII.

Elton John shuts down critics of the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush,"Musical superstar Elton John, 72, spoke out recently in defense of the lengthy friendship between LGBT icon Ellen DeGeneres and former Republican President George W. Bush.

What's a quick background?

DeGeneres sparked outrage last week when she was spotted having a joyful laugh with Bush during a recent Dallas Cowboys football game.

In her own defense, DeGeneres issued a matter-of-fact statement that did not back away from her relationship with Bush.

""Here's the thing: I'm friends with George Bush,"" DeGeneres said. ""In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have. We're all different and I think we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.""

This Photo of Ellen & George W. Bush Will Give You Faith in America Again www.youtube.com





What are the details?

During a recent interview with NPR, John said that DeGeneres is entitled to be friends with whomever she chooses.

""I admire Ellen for standing up and saying what she did,"" he said. ""George Bush has made a lot of mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes. Ellen DeGeneres has made a lot of mistakes. People need to come together. ... They need to respect people's view on life. Except when it's heresy, and I don't think George Bush is that kind of guy.""

Elton John on his autobiography, ""Me"" www.youtube.com

Anything else?

DeGeneres, who is openly gay, admitted that a lot of people were angered as a result of her friendship with the former president.

""They thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?"" DeGeneres said. "" A lot of people were mad.""

She offered some reasonable advice to those people with a chip on their shoulders.

""When I say, 'be kind to one another,' I don't only mean the people that think the same way that you do,"" DeGeneres continued. ""I mean be kind to everyone.""

The Bush family also released a statement on the friendship following the controversy.

""President and Mrs. Bush really enjoyed being with Ellen and Portia, and they appreciated Ellen's comments about respecting one another. They respect her,"" Freddy Ford, Bush's chief of staff, told CNN in a statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elton-john-defends-ellen-degneres-george-w-bush,2019-10-14
Elton John announces he's leaving Twitter over 'unchecked' misinformation — and Elon Musk responds,"Legendary singer-songwriter Elton John announced that he was leaving Twitter over new rules that would allow ""unchecked"" misinformation, and Elon Musk responded.

John posted his announcement in a tweet on Friday.

""All my life I’ve tried to use music to bring people together. Yet it saddens me to see how misinformation is now being used to divide our world,"" he tweeted.

""I’ve decided to no longer use Twitter, given their recent change in policy which will allow misinformation to flourish unchecked,"" he added.

His tweet garnered more than 208k ""likes"" of support in just 14 hours.

John didn't elaborate on what changes in policy he was referring to, but Musk has allowed many people who had been previously banned to come back to the popular social media platform. Many on the left have excoriated him for the move and claimed that hate speech has increased on their timelines.

Musk responded to the iconic performer.

""I love your music. Hope you come back. Is there any misinformation in particular that you’re concerned about?"" he asked.

He did not received a response.

Musk has been publicly releasing internal documents, including emails, from Twitter in a series of revelations called the ""Twitter Files,"" showing the chaos and incompetence that led to very controversial decisions at the social media platform.

John made headlines in 2019 when he pushed back against the LGBTQ movement for criticism over a heterosexual actor portraying him, a gay man, in the biopic based on his life.

""That's all bulls**t, I'm sorry,"" he said about the outrage. ""If people don't like it, review-wise, or it doesn't make one dollar, it's the movie I wanted to make and that's all that counts. I can look back and say, 'You know what, I love it. I can live with it,'""

Elton John blasts 'bulls**t' criticism from LGBT community over straight actor portraying him in new movie,"Sir Elton John has come to the defense of a heterosexual actor who portrays the legendary musician in the upcoming film ""Rocketman,"" a forthcoming biopic based on John's life.

What's the background?

Actor Taron Egerton, a straight man who portrays John in the film, has been criticized by the LGBT community for playing the role of a gay music icon. Critics say Egerton should have turned down the role and allowed a gay man to portray John instead.

What did Elton John say?

Speaking to The Sun UK after ""Rocketman"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, John made it clear he vehemently disagrees with Egerton's critics.

""That's all bulls**t, I'm sorry,"" he told the newspaper about the criticism.

""If people don't like it, review-wise, or it doesn't make one dollar, it's the movie I wanted to make and that's all that counts. I can look back and say, 'You know what, I love it. I can live with it,'"" he explained.

John also praised Egerton's performance.

""I was very emotional just now,"" he said. ""The movie floored me. But I'm very high. Taron is beyond belief. It's like watching me. It's quite extraordinary, he's so me-like. He's a megastar. He was schooled by George Martin's son Giles and he's done the most amazing job. I wanted it to be a movie where the actor sang — and he sings.""

What has Egerton said?

The young actor addressed the criticism in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month.

""I have spoken to gay people for whom it's not a problem, and I've spoken to gay people for whom it is a problem,"" he said.

""But for my part, I'm an actor, and I did not get into acting to just play people like me. You have to draw the line somewhere, and I don't want to live in a world where straight people play straight people and gay people play gay people,"" Egerton explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elton-john-responds-rocketman-lgbt-criticism,2019-05-18
'I try to undermine that BS in my classroom': English teacher claims teaching kids 'how to write properly' is rooted in white supremacy,"A California English teacher recently posted several controversial videos on social media claiming that teaching children ""how to write properly"" is rooted in white supremacy and vowed to begin the school year with a different approach to teaching linguistics, Fox News Digital reported.



Marta Shaffer, an English teacher at Oroville High School in northern California, posted videos to TikTok claiming that white supremacy culture ""runs deep"" in public schools.

""What do I mean by that?"" Shaffer stated. ""Well, let's look at how we write essays: Start with an introduction that includes a thesis; always cite your sources; use transition words like 'however' and 'therefore.' They are all made-up rules. They're arbitrary. They were created by Westerners in power.""

According to Shaffer, the IQ bell curve and the SAT are also problematic and ""racist.""

""The writers of these tests were made up almost entirely of white people … and they still are,"" she said.

In Shaffer's social media bio, which she recently deleted, she described herself as an ally to LGBT youth and ""another cringey millennial.""

""As an educator, I am constantly worried if I am part of the problem,"" stated Shaffer. ""Public education is an institution that upholds lots of problematic systems in our society like white supremacy and misogyny and colonization, etc. I try to undermine that B.S. in my classroom as much as I can.""

Shaffer referred to writing rules and proper grammar as the ""language of power"" and said she would start the school year with a unit ""honoring how we talk rather than teaching students how to write properly.""

""We study linguistics and the rules that we actually use to communicate instead of the made-up rules that white supremacy created for when we write papers and stuff, which is what scholars call the 'language of power,'"" Shaffer claimed in another video posted to her TikTok account, which has over 13,000 followers.

Shaffer insisted that she tries to be ""inclusive of all kinds of ways we use language."" The teacher noted that she applauds her students for using ""AAVE"" language, or African-American Vernacular English, in academic essays.

""Just because your teachers, your professors, and your boss may expect you to write and speak in a certain way that may not be natural to you, does not mean that your more natural … languages are not important. They are just as important, if not more important, than the 'language of respectability,'"" said Shaffer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/english-teacher-claims-teaching-proper-writing-is-rooted-white-supremacy,2022-12-06
"House passes the Equality Act, sweeping anti-discrimination legislation that threatens religious liberty","The House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly passed the Equality Act, sweeping legislation that would expand U.S. anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual preference or self-proclaimed gender identity. Supporters say the bill will establish basic legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer Americans nationwide that will establish equal justice and fairness for all Americans. Opponents warn that the language of the bill would make mainstream traditional beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and religious convictions on these issues punishable under the law.

The Equality Act passed on a nearly party-line vote, 224 to 206, with every Democrat and three Republicans voting in favor of the bill. A previous version of the bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in 2019 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to add explicit language including sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under federal law.

""In most states, L.G.B.T.Q. people can be discriminated against because of who they are, or who they love,"" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the bill's sponsor in the House, who is gay, said, according to the New York Times. ""It is past time for that to change.""

The bill is a priority for President Joe Biden, who promised to champion the legislation during the first 100 days of his presidency. This version that passed the House Thursday is not expected to win enough support in the Senate to pass and be signed into law by President Biden unless Democrats take the drastic measure of eliminating the filibuster to bypass Republican opposition and pass the bill with a simple majority.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Senate Republican who expressed support for the 2019 bill, but she told the Washington Blade on Feb. 23 that she does not support the current version because it lacks certain revisions she requested. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has also expressed opposition to the bill, citing the need for ""strong religious liberty protections.""

While the bill is supported by constituencies including civil rights groups, pro-LGBT organizations, and multiple corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Congress, it faces opposition from religious groups and conservative activists who agree that LGBT people should be protected from discrimination, but think the Equality Act goes too far by actively discriminating against traditional beliefs on marriage, human sexuality, and the differences between men and women.

What's in the bill?



The Equality Act is broad in scope and according to the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBT activist organization, would add anti-discrimination provisions for sexual orientation and gender identity to areas of federal law including employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded programs, and jury service.

Last June, the landmark Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which protects against discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin also includes protections for lesbian, gay, and transgender Americans. The logic of the court was that if a man who married his same-sex partner were fired from his job for doing so, but a woman who married a man were not fired, the homosexual man was discriminated against on the basis of his sex. Likewise, if a woman who identifies as transgender and presents as a man were fired for how she dressed, but biological men at the same place of employment were not fired for how they dressed, then that transgender individual was discriminated against based on sex.

While the court's ruling was expansive and fundamentally transformed labor law, LGBT activists contend that the court's ruling did not go far enough and say the Equality Act is needed to codify the court's decision not only in employment law, but in other areas as well. President Biden signed an executive order to that effect, directing federal agencies to apply Bostock to all areas of law that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. But progressives fear that a future conservative presidential administration would simply reverse Biden's executive order, so they want LGBT people protected by explicit statute.

The Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Jury Selection and Services Act, and other laws to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. It would expand the scope of federal civil rights law to make public spaces and services like a ""store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services"" places that could be liable to a discrimination claim.

Additionally, the Equality Act would override the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that affords exemptions in anti-discrimination law to religious people and organizations who argue such laws infringe on their religious liberty. For example, a Christian charity accused of discriminating against a transgender person in a hiring decision might claim protections under RFRA, citing religious beliefs on the nature of human sexuality, males and females, and their proper roles in a godly marriage.

The Equality Act would specifically prevent an entity from using RFRA to challenge its anti-discrimination provisions or defend itself in a claim made under the law.

Controversies

Advocates for the Equality Act say the bill is needed to extend popular protections from discriminations enjoyed by most Americans to LGBT people.

""Just as [a business] would not be able to turn away somebody for any other prohibited reason in the law, they would not be able to do that for LGBTQ people either. And we think that's a really important principle to maintain,"" Ian Thompson, senior legislative representative at the ACLU told NPR.

But critics counter that the way the bill is written would proactively discriminate against views that do not conform to the federal government's definition of human sexuality and gender identity. The also say that because an individual's conception of gender identity and sexual orientation are said to be fluid, lawful protections for those classes of people would necessarily be vague, unclear, and even contradictory.

""Rather than finding common-sense, narrowly tailored ways to shield LGBT-identifying Americans from truly unjust discrimination, the bill would act as a sword — to persecute those who don't embrace newfangled gender ideologies,"" Ryan T. Anderson, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post opposing the bill. Anderson is the author of ""When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,"" a book that evaluates the current science on transgender issues and the proposed public policy responses. He has written extensively on sexual orientation and gender identity laws and opposes the Equality Act on grounds it would be harmful to women.

""It would vitiate a sex binary that is quite literally written into our genetic code and is fundamental to many of our laws, not least laws protecting the equality, safety and privacy of women,"" Anderson argued.

He pointed to legislative text that states, for example: ""An individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual's gender identity.""

While public spaces can have separate rooms for men and women, the definition of who is a man and who is a woman is in flux. A male who identifies as a woman must be granted permission to use women's bathrooms, locker rooms, or dressing rooms, or else the entity that hosts that public space, be it a business or even a church, may be liable to a discrimination lawsuit.

As explained by the Heritage Foundation, ""Employers, medical professionals, educators, and religious organizations"" would be forced ""to allow men into women's shelters, pay for or perform sex-change operations, and engage in speech that violates their consciences. Faith-based adoption and foster care agencies would be forced to violate their belief that every child deserves a mother and a father."" The Equality Act labels belief in traditional marriage as a ""sex stereotype,"" statutorily stigmatizing the convictions of hundreds of millions of Americans including Christians, Jews, Mormons, and Muslims.

Anderson also noted that the Equality Act treats refusal to perform an abortion as ""pregnancy"" discrimination, and because the RFRA is overridden, Christian doctors and nurses with pro-life convictions would be forced to perform abortion procedures or risk being sued without any claim to First Amendment protections as a defense.

Other medical and legal experts have raised concerns over women's athletics and parental rights. At a virtual event hosted by the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday, Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-Mo.), a former teacher and track coach, said that if the Equality Act becomes law ""we won't have women's sports that are fair,"" referring to recent controversies over boys who identify as transgender and competing against and defeating girls in school sports.

Hartzler also warned that passage of the Equality Act could lead some parents to lose custody of their children if a child identifies as transgender but parents do not consent to ""gender-affirming"" treatments, which can include cross-sex hormone prescriptions or even mutilating breast or genital surgeries.

Hartzler was one of several speakers at the Heritage event, which included doctors, lawyers, and policy experts who spoke out against the Equality Act.

These points were fiercely debated in the House of Representatives before the Equality Act was passed, with Democrats accusing Republicans of making ""ridiculous"" claims to hide their supposed bigotry against gay and transgender Americans.

As reported by the Christian Post:

During the 90-minute House debate over the bill on Thursday, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., claimed the Equality Act posed no threat to religious freedom and that such concerns being raised by Republicans were ""ridiculous.""



Maloney then accused the bill's opponents of using religious freedom as a ruse to conceal their ""pro-discrimination against gay people.""



In response to Maloney's accusations, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, declared: ""Here it is, on page 25. It says specifically, 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a legal basis for a claim' [against a religious discrimination charge].



""The founders said in the first right, in the First Amendment to the Constitution, you can practice your religion as you see fit. But right here in their bill today, the Democrats say 'No you can't,'"" Jordan asserted.

The Equality Act now heads to the U.S. Senate, where Democrats would need Republican support to overcome a filibuster. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the bill's sponsor in the Senate, has signaled support for changing the Senate rules to end the legislative filibuster and pass the bill, but Democrats would need a majority of senators to vote to do so, and Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) are opposed to the idea.

Eric Holder mocks MAGA slogan: 'Exactly when did you think America was great?',"Former Attorney General Eric Holder made clear his feelings on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan — ""Make America Great Again"" — this week, saying in an interview that whenever he hears the rallying cry, he thinks to himself, ""exactly when did you think America was great?""

What are the details?

Holder sat down with MSNBC's Ari Melber to discuss progress on criminal justice reform and his new agenda to fight gerrymandering through redistricting.

The crux of their discussion was on racial inequities in the U.S. court system, which Holder explained could be combated through ""training.""

""I do worry that judges — like all other Americans — carry with them implicit biases, and especially in the criminal justice sphere,"" he said.

Melber asked the former attorney general, ""There is a lot of talk about America being a leader as a democracy, quote unquote, in the 1800s when women and African-Americans couldn't vote. What kind of democracy is that?""

In what Fox News called an unprovoked response, Holder replied, ""Well, that's exactly right. And that's when I hear these things about 'let's make America great again,' I think to myself, 'well, exactly when did you think America was great?' It certainly wasn't when people were enslaved. It certainly wasn't when women didn't have the right to vote. It certainly wasn't when the LGBT community was denied the rights to which it was entitled.""

When Melber followed up with the question, ""Does that phrase echo as discrimination in your ears?"" Mr. Holder replied, ""It takes us back to what I think, an American past that never in fact really existed. This notion of greatness.""

Holder conceded that America has done great things, then added, ""but we are always a work in process, and looking back, 'Make America Great Again' is inconsistent with who we are as Americans at our best where we look at the uncertain future, embrace it, and make it our own.""

Anything else?

Eric Swalwell suggests red flag laws should be used against 'lunatic' Ben Shapiro over LGBT views,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) suggested Friday that controversial ""red flag"" laws should be used against conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.

In a tweet, Swalwell said Shapiro is ""reason 1,578 America needs red flag laws.""

""Please tell me this lunatic does not own a gun,"" Swalwell said.

The Democratic lawmaker was responding to comments from Shapiro's Friday podcast. A Media Matters reporter highlighted the comments, stripping them of their context, to make it appear that Shapiro was advocating violence — and it worked.

Shapiro, however, was not advocating violence. He was responding to comments made during Thursday night's LGBT town hall on CNN.

Here is what Shapiro said:

You want a culture war in this country? You d**n well have it, Beto O'Rourke. You want a culture war in this country? You want this country to come apart at the seams? This is how you do it. Because I promise you: If you come to tell me that you're going to indoctrinate my kids on a particular policy and that I can't pull my kid out of the school and send my kid to a school that I want to send them to. That I can't go to the church or synagogue that I want to go to.



And if you make that national policy, not just California policy where I can move, but national policy? People are not going to stand for that. They are not going to stand for that. And if you send a truant officer to remove my child, I have two choices at that point, right? If I have no place to move because you have now made this national, federal policy.



I now have two choices: One, is to leave the country utterly. Two is to pick up a gun. Those are the only two choices that you have left me.

ESPN issues statement of support for LGBT movement,"ESPN and other Disney-linked entities have posted statements expressing support for the LGBT movement.

""ESPN believes in inclusivity and denounces legislation and actions across the United States that infringe on any human rights. We stand with our LGBTQIA+ colleagues, friends, families, and fans,"" ESPN tweeted on Tuesday. ""We'll continue to partner with organizations that support the LGBTQIA+ community, be accountable where we fall short of expectations, and never stop telling stories about LGBTQIA+ athletes, like the ones that we’ll be sharing in this thread.""

Some on social media took issue with ESPN's statement.

""ESPN is no longer a sports company. They’re left wing political activists masquerading as a sports company,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis tweeted.



""Miss when ESPN used to talk about sports,"" GOP Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina tweeted.

The Florida state legislature has passed a bill that will bar teaching children about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis plans to sign the bill. Individuals on ESPN have previously expressed their opposition to the Florida legislation.

Disney owns the lion's share of the sports-focused media giant: ""ESPN ... is 80 percent owned by ABC, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company,"" according to ESPN.

Walt Disney World and other Disney-related entities also issued statements similar to ESPN's.



""To ALL who come to this happy place, welcome. Disney Parks, Experiences and Products is committed to creating experiences that support family values for every family, and will not stand for discrimination in any form. We oppose any legislation that infringes on basic human rights, and stand in solidarity and support our LGBTQIA+ cast, crew, guests and fans who make their voices heard today and every day,"" a statement said.



Disney+ issued a statement, declaring: ""Disney+ stands by our LGBTQIA+ employees, colleagues, families, storytellers, and fans, and we strongly denounce all legislation that infringes on the basic human rights of people in the LGBTQIA+ community — especially legislation that targets and harms young people and their families. We strive to create a service that reflects the world in which we live, and our hope is to be a source for inclusive, empowering, and authentic stories that unite us in our shared humanity.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/espn-issues-statement-lgbtq,2022-03-22
European Parliament aims to make the EU an LGBTQ 'freedom zone',"The European Parliament is set to consider a resolution Wednesday that would declare the entire European Union — consisting of 27 member nations — an LGBTQ ""freedom zone.""

Lawmakers claim the resolution's intent is simply to ""promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons,"" though conservatives will likely view the move as an affront to traditional values and an unnecessary exercise of power.

The resolution comes largely in response to recent developments in one of EU's member states, Poland, where scores of local communities have set up symbolic resolutions declaring themselves free from ""LGBT ideology,"" the Associated Press reported.

Conservative leaders in the predominantly Catholic nation have expressed concerns over the growth of the ideology of late, with Polish President Andrzej Duda even having compared its effects to that of communist oppression. As of February, nearly 100 municipalities in Poland, or one-third of the country, had declared themselves ""LGBT-free zones.""

However, the resolution takes aim not only at Poland but at Hungary, as well, where it claims the fundamental rights of LGBTQ people have been ""severely hindered"" due to a ban on legal gender recognition for transgender and intersex individuals. It also makes mention of developments in Latvia, as lawmakers there have taken up examination of a court ruling that extended the concept of family to include same-sex couples.

Lawmakers also note that only two of the EU's member states, Malta and Germany, have criminalized ""conversion therapy,"" a controversial practice aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation from lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transsexual to heterosexual.

The resolution is reportedly the product of a cross-party group in the European Parliament, known as the LGBTI Intergroup, which claims that it has amassed enough support to pass the largely symbolic measure.

According to the group's vice chair, Liesje Schreinemacher, it was purposefully timed to mark the second anniversary of the first Polish community's declaration of itself as an ""LGBT-free zone.""

""We wanted to send a strong signal in Poland that we consider all of Europe to be an LGBTI freedom zone,"" she told the AP. ""But every European country has work to do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/european-union-lgbtq-freedom-zone,2021-03-10
Evangelist Franklin Graham has been dropped by all seven of his UK tour venues. His offense? Believing the Bible's teaching on homosexuality.,"The Rev. Franklin Graham, a popular evangelist and son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, is planning a four-month gospel-preaching tour through the United Kingdom this summer.

But now, all seven of his scheduled venues have dropped him, citing his views on homosexuality and Islam.

What are they saying?

CNN reported that on Wednesday an arena in Newcastle became the seventh and final venue to cancel Graham's scheduled appearance, following similar cancellations by venues in cities across the U.K., including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, and Glasgow.

The cancellation came after the regional LGBT groups joined with Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes to oppose the visit.

Forbes, who claims that Graham ""peddles controversial, repulsive views about LGBT people"" said he was ""delighted"" to hear the news.

""Instead of focusing on such divisions, we can now come together and look forward to hosting U.K. Pride here this summer,"" he added.

More than 5,000 people had signed a petition put on by Northern Pride calling for the event to be canceled. The petition argued that Graham has ""publicly promoted homophobia.""

Similar protests have erupted in other U.K. cities over recent weeks. In Liverpool, a local gay pride foundation penned a letter to authorities, saying, the evangelist preacher ""is well known"" for ""promoting hate of LGBT+ people"" and ""openly supporting conversion therapy.""

CNN noted that Graham has ""fueled anger for his past comments and stances"" such as maintaining the Bible's view that ""homosexuality is a sin"" and calling Islam a ""wicked and evil"" religion.

The tour will go on

Graham has responded to the cancellations with resilience, vowing the tour will go on.

""We are still finalising where the Graham Tour will be held, but we want to be clear that the initiative and all associated training courses will take place on the same dates as originally planned,"" a statement on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association website says.

Graham had previously noted on the website that opposition in the cities came from ""a small but vocal minority,"" and assured that such opposition would not derail the tour.

Last week, after the Liverpool venue cancelled, Franklin Graham took to Facebook to articulate his views and send a message to the LGBTQ community in the U.K.

""The rub, I think, comes in whether God defines homosexuality as sin. The answer is yes,"" he acknowledged. ""But God goes even further than that, to say that we are all sinners — myself included. The Bible says that every human being is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The penalty of sin is spiritual death — separation from God for eternity.""

Graham then went on to offer his detractors the Gospel, saying that he plans to come to the U.K. not out of hate, but out of love.

""The Gospel is inclusive. I'm not coming out of hate, I'm coming out of love,"" he wrote. ""I invite everyone in the LGBTQ community to come and hear for yourselves the Gospel.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/evangelist-franklin-graham-dropped-venues-for-believing-bible-teaching-on-homosexuality,2020-02-06
Eventbrite removes listing for 'What Is A Woman' screening,"The platform Eventbrite has once again exhibited its allegiance to the LGBT agenda by removing a listing that advertised a screening of conservative commentator Matt Walsh's ""What Is a Woman?"" documentary, a work that exposes the absurdity of radical leftist gender ideology.

Conservative Partnership Institute policy director Rachel Bovard tweeted about Eventbrite's move and posted a screenshot of the company's email.

""We're reaching out regarding your event listing, 'CPI 'What Is A Woman?' Movie Screening,'"" Eventbrite noted in the email. ""We do not permit events, content, or creators that promote or encourage hate, violence, or harassment towards others and/or oneself. In this instance, we have determined that your event expresses views that are in violation of our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service and is therefore not permitted on the Eventbrite platform. As a result, your event listing has been removed.""

""While you may continue to use Eventbrite for other events, if we become aware of any future event that violates our policies, we will remove it. Please note that severe or repeated violations of our policies could result in your account being terminated,"" the company warned.

Last month, the company delivered the same message when it yanked down a ""What Is a Woman?"" watch party event listing by the Western Kentucky University chapter of Turning Point USA.

But while Eventbrite claims that event listings for Walsh's documentary run afoul of its rules, it continues to allow posts about drag-related events that are open to children.

For example, right now on Eventbrite there is a listing for an ""All Ages Drag Makeup"" event that will be held next month in Australia. ""This event is for all ages. LGBTIQA+ young people are strongly encouraged to come along,"" the description notes. Another listing currently posted on Eventbrite advertises an ""All Ages Drag Bingo"" event slated to take place later this month in Oregon.

Facebook and Twitter take new actions to censor 'hate speech',"Big Tech companies Facebook and Twitter are developing plans to further automate identification of posts that violate rules against what they deem is ""hate speech.""

Twitter on Wednesday announced an expansion of its hateful conduct policy to ban language that ""dehumanizes people on the basis of race, ethnicity or national origin."" The company will also ""continue to surface potentially violative content through proactive detection and automation.""

Tweets that violate the rules will be removed by Twitter if reported and users who repeatedly have their tweets reported may have their accounts temporarily locked or permanently suspended.

Examples of tweets that could be banned provided by Twitter include, ""All [national origin] are cockroaches who live off of welfare benefits and need to be taken away,"" or, ""[Religious Group] should be punished. We are not doing enough to rid us of those filthy animals.""

Twitter also announced efforts taken to ensure that its rules are enforced consistently.

""Many people raised concerns about our ability to enforce our rules fairly and consistently, so we developed a longer, more in-depth training process with our teams to make sure they were better prepared when reviewing report,"" the company said.

At the same time, Facebook is reportedly about to conduct a ""major overhaul of its algorithms that detect hate speech,"" according to internal documents reviewed by the Washington Post. The Post reported that Facebook will reverse its ""race-blind"" enforcement of rules against hate speech, policing hate speech against blacks, Muslims, multi-racial people, LGBT-identifying people, and Jews more aggressively than anti-white hate speech.

This effort, called the WoW project, will reportedly rework Facebook's algorithms to improve detection and deletion of ""the worst of the worst"" hate speech rules violations. According to the Post, Facebook would assign numerical scores to certain kinds of posts, weighing them by perceived harm. The algorithm will prioritize posts with heavier weighted scores.

For example, a post that says ""gay people are disgusting"" will have higher priority for Facebook's algorithms than a post that says ""men are pigs.""

The Post reported that Facebook has already changed its algorithms to de-prioritize policing comments that refer to ""whites,"" ""men,"" and ""Americans."" While posts attacking these groups are still considered ""hate speech,"" Facebook's technology treats such posts as ""low-sensitivity,"" or less likely to be perceived as harmful or abusive. Facebook's algorithms no longer automatically delete such posts.

""We know that hate speech targeted towards underrepresented groups can be the most harmful, which is why we have focused our technology on finding the hate speech that users and experts tell us is the most serious,"" Facebook spokeswoman Sally Aldous told the Post. ""Over the past year, we've also updated our policies to catch more implicit hate speech, such as content depicting Blackface, stereotypes about Jewish people controlling the world, and banned Holocaust denial.""

Social media companies of late have been heavily criticized by both the left and the right over the enforcement of their rules against hate speech. Conservatives and right-leaning media organizations have accused Big Tech companies of exercising censorship of posts they disagree with while left-leaning groups say social media platforms are not doing enough to police hate speech and stop the spread of fake news or misinformation.



Civil rights activists who gave statements to The Hill praised Facebook and Twitter for ""progress"" in removing hate speech but expressed skepticism that the changes will meet their demands.

""This is progress, but Twitter demonstrated a consequential lack of urgency in implementing the updated policy before the most fraught election cycle in modern history, despite repeated warnings by civil rights advocates and human rights organizations,"" said Arisha Hatch, the vice president of Color of Change.

Hatch accused Twitter of having a ""non-committal and cavalier attitude toward transparency"" by failing to explain how content moderators are trained or how Twitter's artificial intelligence identify offending posts.

""The jury is still out for a company with a spotty track record of policy implementation and enforcing its rules with far-right extremist users. Void of hard evidence the company will follow through, this announcement will fall into a growing category of too little, too late PR stunt offerings,"" Hatch said of Twitter.

Hatch called Facebook's reported plans to change its algorithms ""confirmation of what we've been demanding for years, an enforcement regime that takes power and historical dynamics into account.""

Sum of Us, an anti-corporate advocacy group, told the Hill that Facebook's proposed changes do not go far enough to police hate speech.

""Facebook is well aware of the harm it causes by allowing some of the most vile content to be promoted through its algorithms. Their latest move to more aggressively police anti-Black hate speech and false claims about COVID-19 vaccines shows that they have the ability to clean up their act — if they want to,"" Sum of Us executive director Emma Ruby-Sachs said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-twitter-censor-hate-speech,2020-12-03
Female HS sprinter on transgender dominance: 'We are not physically able to be competitive against' biological males,"As a pair of transgender high school sprinters — who were born male but identify as female — continue to dominate the competition in Connecticut, a female-born sprinter who races against them is stating what's blatantly obvious.

""It's very frustrating,"" Selina Soule of Connecticut's Glastonbury High School told Fox News' Laura Ingraham. ""Because I know I have put in — some of my friends and fellow competitors have put in — so much time and effort to take down our times and compete ourselves better, but we are not physically able to be competitive against someone who is biologically a male.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Soule finished eighth in the recent state indoor girls' 55-meter sprint — and missed qualifying for the New England regionals by two spots, The Associated Press said. As it happens, transgender sprinters Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood smashed the field, coming in first and second place. The third-place finisher, a biological female, posted a much slower time (7.23 seconds) than Miller's (6.95 seconds — state record) and Yearwood (7.01 seconds).



Image source: YouTube screenshot

Soule told the AP had Miller and Yearwood not run, she would be in the regional race and showing her abilities to more college coaches.

""We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it's demoralizing,"" Soule told the outlet. ""I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.""

In her interview with Ingraham, Soule maintained her support for Miller and Yearwood to live the way they want — but that it becomes ""unfair"" when their personal choices affect the efforts of biological girls.

Ingraham was more direct: ""What happens to field hockey when soccer players start to play? What happens with girls' basketball? What happens with girls' volleyball? What happens with tennis?"" The host brought up the controversy over tennis legend Martina Navratilova, a lesbian, who was booted from an LGBTQ advocacy group for calling transgender females competing against biological women ""insane and cheating.""

Family sues Christian school for expulsion of daughter after LGBT-themed cake at birthday party,"A private Christian school is being sued by the family of a teen expelled after she posted photos to social media that were contrary to the values of the school.

The story made national headlines because the photos involved a rainbow-themed birthday cake at a private birthday party away from the school.

Whitefield Academy previously objected to how many national outlets were framing the story, and said that Kayla Kenney had been involved in several behavioral issues prior to the birthday party.

""Inaccurate media reports are circling stating that the student in question was expelled from our school solely for a social media post,"" the school said in a statement.

""In the fall, we met with the student to give her a final chance to begin to adhere to our code of conduct. Unfortunately, she did not live up to the agreement, and therefore, has been expelled,"" they added.

Kenney's parents claimed in the lawsuit that Kenney suffered ""serious emotional distress"" as a result of the actions of the school.

""In [expelling the student], Whitefield invaded K.K.'s privacy, defamed K.K., breached its contract with K.K.'s parents Kimberly Alford and Mike Kenney, and inflicted serious emotional distress on K.K. Certainly, in 2020 it is unbelievable that conversations like this one are still occurring — and that lawsuits like this one are still necessary,"" the family claimed.

Whitefield Academy declined to respond to requests from NBC to comment on the lawsuit.

Celena Morrison — slated to start as executive director in March — will ""drive the city's LGBT policy and community engagement and educate and advise the mayor's office and the city about the needs of LGBT individuals at work, in the community and beyond,"" the station said.

""While Philadelphia is known as a progressive, LGBTQ-friendly city, we still have work to do,"" Kenney said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with Celena to build a more inclusive city for our residents.""



Morrison added to the station that being transgender and black will be an asset when it comes to the job's demands of dealing with issues of race and gender.

""Trans folks are not being accepted,"" Morrison told KYW. ""They are not accepted within the LGBT community. They are also not accepted within the black community. That double marginalization calls for a different type of support.""

The North Carolina native has been a ""progressive LGBT advocate in Philadelphia for a decade,"" the station reported, adding that Morrison was director of programs at William Way LGBT Community Center for two years and began serving on the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations in 2018.

"Sick: Fatherly piece suggests taking children to pride parades, but acknowledges that 'They're filled with sights that may be new to kids, like public nudity and kink'","A piece posted on Fatherly.com suggests that people should take their children to pride parades — but by noting that such events can include ""public nudity,"" the piece actually proves that parents should under no circumstances consider taking their kids to pride festivities.

""Pride Parades and the Pride festivals that follow are noisy and crowded. They're filled with sights that may be new to kids, like public nudity and kink. Not to mention that Pride parades aren’t the most sober of places. So is it appropriate to take your young kids to Pride?"" the piece asks. ""Considering the benefits for all families — including seeing other LGBTQ+ families like yours, or showing up as an ally if your family members are straight and cisgender — the answer is absolutely.""

The piece says that Jenifer McGuire, a lesbian, has attended pride events with her children, who have learned to expect nakedness.

""They just had to learn to laugh and enjoy things. Like there were these Beanie Babies with giant penises on them,"" McGuire said, according to the outlet. ""For a fourth- and fifth-grade kid, that's super funny.""



The piece suggests preparing kids before heading to a pride event by reading them children's books about LGBT topics: ""Before going to Pride, you should also sit your kids down with a few more children’s books about LGBTQ+ people and families. Kids have a tendency to point and ask questions when they’re exposed to new things, and you don’t want people celebrating Pride to become a convenient life lesson for your children.""

Responding to a tweet about the article, Delano Squires commented, ""This type of 'fatherly' advice (written by a woman, btw) is why we’re in this position today. No father who actually loves his kids would subject them to 'nudity and kink' in the name of 'allyship' or any other political agenda.""

FDA 'will likely support' ending ban on blood donation from sexually active homosexuals despite blood banks' difficulty testing for HIV,"In 1983, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, the Food and Drug Administration instituted a lifetime ban on homosexuals who had engaged in gay sex since 1977. According to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, the FDA may soon allow certain homosexuals to share their vital fluids.

What are the details?

People said to be familiar with the FDA's plans told the Wall Street Journal that homosexuals in monogamous relationships will soon be allowed to donate blood without having to abstain from sex. The new rules and guidance, which have yet to be finalized, will reportedly be issued sometime in the coming months.

The FDA's forthcoming decision to turn the spigot on a new source of blood reportedly comes after an agency-funded study of approximately 1,600 sexually active homosexuals was launched to ""determine if a blood donor history questionnaire based on individual risk would be an acceptable alternative to a time-based deferral in reducing the risk of HIV among gay and bisexual men who present to donate blood.""

Although the study conducted by the FDA and three of the largest nonprofit blood centers in the U.S. has not been resolved, it has, according to Brian Custer, director of the Vitalant Research Institute, generated ""highly relevant information to envision what an individual risk-based approach would look like.”

All donors, irrespective of their disproportionate likelihood to carry HIV, will have to complete a comparable individualized risk assessment.

An FDA official indicated that the questionnaire, still being drafted, will ask prospective blood donors if they have had any new sexual partners in the past three months. Those who answer in the negative will be able to donate blood.

Those who indicate they have been promiscuous will be prompted to answer to whether they have had anal sex.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""anal sex is the riskiest type of sex for getting or transmitting HIV."" Although both participants involved in this particular act of sodomy are at risk, the recipient is at greater risk.

The CDC also noted that normal sex ""is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex.""

Those who answer in the negative about having anal sex will be able to donate blood. Those who answered in the affirmative will simply have to wait three months before donating blood.

The significance of the three-month window is that an HIV infection would reportedly become apparent in that time.

Risky business

The Wall Street Journal noted that the FDA's likely new change won't necessarily come without risks.

While HIV testing has improved over the years — enabling blood banks to toss out bad blood taken from people long-infected — no available test can presently detect HIV immediately after infection.

Dr. Bruce Walker, an infectious-diseases specialist, told the Wall Street Journal that ""with the latest HIV tests, that window is probably no greater than 10 days from the time of exposure.""

The CDC noted that antibody tests, which look for antibodies to HIV in a person's blood or oral fluid, can take 23 to 90 days to detect HIV after exposure.

Antigen/body tests, which look for both HIV antibodies and antigens, can take anywhere from 18 to 90 days after exposure.

Nucleic acid tests (NATs), which look for the actual virus in the blood, ""can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure."" Although highly sensitive, there have been incidents documented where NATs have failed to detect infected blood.

Life-saving 'discrimination'

Gay activist groups such as the Human Rights Campaign have long suggested that the policy prohibiting homosexuals from donating blood was discriminatory, even if it prevented healthy homosexuals from receiving bad blood.

Sarah Warbelow, legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, said, ""It is a completely outdated policy that doesn't reflect our current ability to test blood for HIV or the medical science around HIV.""

When the initial blood ban was first instituted, the purpose was not to discriminate but to save lives.

Marguerita Lightfoot, director of the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, told Men's Health that in the early 1980s, ""We were still trying to figure out the transmission of the virus, and all we knew was that this population was disproportionately impacted.""

That remains the case today.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2018, 13,000 people die from AIDS in the U.S. every year, and over 700,000 have died nationwide since the beginning of the HIV epidemic. AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection.

Like the recent rash of monkeypox cases, homosexuals were disproportionately impacted by the spread of the disease.

According to the CDC, in 2019, homosexuals made up nearly 70% of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S.

Notwithstanding the higher incidence of HIV infections in the demographic, in 2015, the FDA lifted its lifetime ban on homosexuals donating blood, ""changing its recommendation that men who have sex with men (MSM) be indefinitely deferred ... to 12 months since the last sexual contact with another man.""

Despite its apparent significance, this change was met by derision from gay activists.

The LGBT activist organization GLAAD posted a video of script-reader Alan Cumming to YouTube, wherein he mocked the idea that gay men could abstain from sex for an entire year.

Kelsey Louie, the former CEO of the AIDS service organization Gay Men's Health Crisis, lauded the 2015 decision, saying, ""The United States government has to stop reacting to HIV like it is the early 1980s. ... It is time for the FDA to implement a policy that is truly based on science, not blanket bans on certain groups of people.""

That 12-month waiting time will likely soon be cut down to 3 months and only apply to non-monogamous homosexual donors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fda-will-likely-support-ending-ban-on-sexually-active-gay-men-donating-blood,2022-12-01
Federal judge sides with Christian orgs in LGBT adoption case,"A Catholic adoption agency will not have to abandon its beliefs on marriage and the family in order to continue working with the state of Michigan for the time being, a federal judge ruled Thursday.

""This case is not about whether same-sex couples can be great parents,"" District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in his ruling granting an injunction against new state rules. ""What this case is about is whether St. Vincent [Catholic Charities] may continue to do this work and still profess and promote the traditional Catholic belief that marriage as ordained by God is for one man and one woman.""

The ruling bars Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel from acting on the terms of a legal settlement with the ACLU reached back in March that would have forced faith-based organizations that work with the state to place children in same-sex households, regardless of any deeply held religious beliefs. Michigan, like many other states, contracts with private adoption agencies to place foster children in new homes, and the ACLU sued in 2017 saying that prospective LGBT parents had been turned away by christian organizations.

In April, religious liberty legal nonprofit Becket responded to the settlement with a lawsuit on behalf of St. Vincent Catholic Charities, adoptive parents Chad and Melissa Buck, and a former foster child.

Jonker, a George W. Bush appointee, also wrote, ""Under the Attorney General's current interpretation of Michigan law and the parties' contracts, St. Vincent must choose between its traditional religious belief, and the privilege of continuing to place children with foster and adoptive parents of all types."" The ruling also stated that the state's position ""strongly suggests the State's real goal is not to promote non-discriminatory child placements, but to stamp out St. Vincent's religious belief and replace it with the State's own.""

A staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan's LGBT Project said that the ruing ""requires the state to put the individual religious beliefs of foster care agencies ahead of the welfare of children.""

Becket said Thursdays ruling was a win for foster families. ""Our nation is facing a foster care crisis, and we are so glad that Michigan's foster children will continue having all hands on deck to help them find loving forever homes,"" Becket senior counsel Lori Windham said after the ruling. ""The Bucks and St. Vincent Catholic Charities won a victory in Michigan, but there is still work to be done to ensure that faith-based agencies can contribute to ending our nation's foster care crisis.""



""Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel and the ACLU thought they could hatch a backdoor agreement to force ideological conformity in the state's foster care and adoption program and nothing could stop them,"" the Catholic Association legal advisor Andrea Picciotti-Bayer said of the decision. However, ""Both state and federal law protect faith-based agencies like St. Vincent Catholic Charities to find loving homes for needy kids without having to abandon their religious teachings on the family.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-sides-with-christian-orgs-in-lgbt-adoption-case,2019-09-27
First ever LGBTQ credit union set to launch,"The first credit union prioritizing the LGBTQ community has been given the all-clear to open for business next year, after the state of Michigan approved the charter for the new financial institution on Monday.

What are the details?

Superbia Credit Union boasts on its website that it ""is the first ever profit-for-purpose financial institution that exists solely to serve and advocate for the LGBTQ community across the country.""

Founder Myles Meyers explained his reasoning behind the idea to Fortune, saying, ""I can walk into a bank or credit union and apply for a loan or credit card or savings accounts and frankly, no problem. If I walked in to the same institution with my husband, we can come across different responses and welcome. And this is where it all starts to change for the community.""



The charter for Superbia's formation was approved by the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services on Monday, and its founders will now begin ""working with regulatory bodies to receive the required approvals that will make the credit union operational by early 2020,"" The Oakland Press reported.

State Sen. Jeremy Moss explained to the newspaper, ""State law doesn't protect Michigan's LGBTQ community from discrimination in the workplace and public accommodations...It's burdensome that gay and trans Michiganders must depend on private businesses to take it upon themselves to provide equal treatment to employees and consumers.""

""Fortunately, many LGBTQ business owners and entrepreneurs have stepped up to specifically cater to the needs of our community,"" Moss added,"" and I'm especially excited to welcome in Superbia Credit Union to Michigan as a safe space to bank and obtain lines of credit without fear of discrimination.""

Anything else?

Superbia Credit Union promises to ""provide access to fair, non-discriminatory products and services that care for the unique needs of the LGBTQ community, delivered with an affirming experience.""

Woke church issues statements regarding 'Fasting from Whiteness',"A liberal Illinois church that has received media attention for saying that it would not utilize any music or liturgy created by white people during Lent is standing behind its woke ways.

The First United Church of Oak Park, which is openly pro-LGBT and lists social justice as one of its ""core values,"" had previously posted a message on its website headlined, ""Lent 2022: Fasting From Whiteness.""

""For Lent this year, First United is doing a mix of 'giving something up' and 'taking something on.' In our worship services throughout Lent, we will not be using any music or liturgy written or composed by white people. Our music will be drawn from the African American spirituals tradition, from South African freedom songs, from Native American traditions, and many, many more,"" the church's website previously stated. ""For Lent, it is our prayer that in our spiritual disciplines we may grow as Christians, united in the body of Christ with people of all ages, nations, races, and origins.""

While that message no longer appears on the church's website, statements addressing the controversy have been posted.

""Our Lenten theme has spurred considerable discussion, with some people questioning the message. In practice with the Lenten spiritual discipline of fasting, our intent was to lay aside our usual frames of reference and open ourselves to hearing the Gospel message through the voices of Black People, Indigenous People, and People of Color,"" one statement explained. ""Our worship services in Lent have been diverse and beautiful. We pray that God oils the hinges of our hearts’ doors that they might swing open gently to receive the good news of Christ’s resurrection, which we all await at the culmination of Lent.""

The church said in another press release that it got more than 1,000 ""hateful messages"" in less than a day.

""White people absolutely have a place in the redemption story. White people were even at the foot of the cross: they were the Roman Guards. As white people we must love our Redeemer enough to put down our spears. We must love our redeemer more than our whiteness, and kneel before our redeemer who is a dark-skinned man from the poor parts of town,"" Rev. John Edgerton said, according to the press release.

Edgerton is described as the ""Lead Pastor"" on the church's website — the press release uses the term ""senior pastor.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/first-united-church-of-oak-park-stands-behind-its-whiteness-fast,2022-04-08
"NYC butcher removed BLM, LGBTQ flags after a customer complained. Then two-thirds of the staff quit, claiming they didn't feel 'safe,' appreciated.","A chain of New York City-area butcher shops was forced to temporarily close last month after two-thirds of its staff quit due to the removal of Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ Pride signs from storefronts.

What happened?

According to Forbes, the ""first sign of trouble"" for Brooklyn-based Fleishers Craft Butchery came on July 22. That was the day Rob Rosania, a leading investor in the business, received a text from a friend claiming he was offended by signs showcasing support for the Black Lives Matter movement on open display at the chain's Connecticut storefront.

In response to the complaint, Rosania reportedly called up the business's new CEO, John Adams, and ""ordered"" that he remove the signs. Adams complied, traveling first up to Westport and Greenwich, Connecticut, to remove the signage before heading back down to the chain's two New York City locations to do the same. Posters supporting LGBTQ Pride were also removed from storefronts in addition to the BLM signs.

The move apparently didn't go over well with roughly two-thirds of the company's 40-member staff, half of which identify as ""BIPOC, nonbinary, or queer,"" Forbes reported. Following the removal of the signs, some three dozen staffers abruptly quit, forcing the company to shutter all of its locations.

To make matters worse, the mass staff exodus came at a time in which many businesses are short on workers and continuing to struggle to fill positions. Millions of workers have been content to turn down work and instead collect generous pandemic-related unemployment benefits.

What else?

In a panic, Adams reportedly reversed course and put the signs back up the very next day and even messaged staff proof. But it was too late; the damage had been done.

One employee, 32-year-old Ajani Thompson, told Forbes that Adams was supposed to be an advocate for workers and a buffer from Rosania, who had become more involved in business operations of late. But he ""failed."" Now, some workers don't even feel ""safe"" at work.

""I told him he failed,"" Thompson said. ""You were trying to get our trust, and I don't feel comfortable here. I don't feel safe coming into work because you didn't do that.""

Thompson added that he wanted to be treated as an ""equal"" by the company, presumably to Rosania, despite the fact that Rosania has ""ponied up some $17 million"" to the business since joining as an investor in 2015.

""Think of me as an equal and none of this needed to happen,"" he said. ""It's messed up to think of someone as less-than and then want them to provide for you.""

Anything else?

Fleishers was founded in 2004 by husband and wife Joshua and Jessica Applestone, Forbes reported. The couple was described by the New York Times as ""rock star butchers"" in a 2009 article.

The company is expected to be closed at least until the end of August as it grapples with the staff shortage, according to signs posted on storefronts.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fleishers-employees-quit-after-blm-pride-flags-removed,2021-08-06
Florida Democrats to stage protest outside of Dave Rubin event with Ron DeSantis,"Florida Democrats are planning to protest an event featuring BlazeTV host Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report"" and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday evening in Orlando.



Democratic state lawmaker Rep. Anna Eskamani said Thursday that protesters will ""hold the Governor accountable for his extreme agenda"" in a tweet sharing details about the demonstration, including a meetup time and place of 6:45 p.m. ET at the public sidewalk outside of the event venue.

An event description for the protest on Facebook reads, ""Once again Governor Ron DeSantis and his alt-right Bully Brigade are coming to Orlando. And we want to make sure he knows who we are in Orlando and that we oppose his extreme agenda.""



""Join us outside The Plaza Live as we let him know: We’re WOKE, We Say Gay, Trans, Bi, Lesbian, and Queer, we believe Black Lives Matter, we support reproductive freedom and a person’s right to have an abortion, we demand sensible gun safety reforms, economic justice, and that he is not welcome in our community,"" the Orange County (FL) Democrats wrote.

""Bring your best signs and be ready to cause a little good trouble,"" the group added.

In a statement to TheBlaze, Rubin welcomed peaceful protesters but suggested their time might be better spent listening instead of demonstrating.

“Peacefully protesting is the cornerstone of living in a free society. I welcome protesters to exercise their free-speech rights as long as it doesn’t interfere with the event,"" Rubin said.

""Perhaps a better use of their time would be to actually attend the event and listen to what we had to say. They’d hear nothing close to hatred or bigotry, but would hear an awful lot about freedom and liberty here in the great state of Florida,” he added.



DeSantis, one of the most conservative Republican governors in the nation, has come under fire from the left for his support of Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. The statute prohibits classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, restricting lessons on those topics to age and developmentally appropriate settings in higher grades.

Critics inaccurately called it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, and the mainstream media adopted that name for it, which led many to mistakenly believe the law sought to make it illegal to recognize the ""existence"" of LGBT people. This led to accusations that DeSantis is anti-gay, hateful, or otherwise bigoted against LGBT people.



During Thursday's event, the governor will be interviewed by Rubin, host of ""The Rubin Report"" on BlazeTV, as part of Rubin's book tour for ""Don't Burn This Country,"" a book criticizing ""woke"" leftwing politics and calling for ""Americans to live the freest life possible.""

Eskamani criticized The Plaza Live for hosting the event last week, complaining that DeSantis is visiting ""one of the most #LGBTQ+ friendly parts of Orlando and during Pride Month too.""

""Orlandoans deserve better than this culture war B.S.,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Rubin, a married gay man, responded to Eskamani on Twitter, inviting her to the event as his guest. She replied that she would accept the invitation only if she ""can be on stage and debate both you and DeSantis,"" but Rubin declined her request.

""I’m not giving you a second of that time,"" Rubin said. "" I invited you to see what freedom, liberty and Florida are truly all about. I’ll gladly debate you at another venue in the future.""

Eskamani instead will be protesting outside as Rubin interviews the governor.

Florida doctors will no longer be authorized to prescribe puberty blockers or 'gender affirming' surgeries to minors,"After a contentious vote on Friday, the Florida Board of Medicine and Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine adopted rules that will prohibit doctors from prescribing certain medicines or performing certain surgeries on minors who believe that they are transgender. The rules had been pushed by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Lapado and were publicly supported by Governor Ron DeSantis (R), who last week took issue with some in the medical community during a gubernatorial debate.

Lapado lauded the vote by the medical boards, saying that the decisions will ""protect our children from irreversible surgeries and highly experimental treatments... I appreciate the integrity of the Boards for ruling in the best interest of children in Florida despite facing tremendous pressure to permit these unproven and risky treatments.""

The board meetings were held at a Holiday Inn in Lake Buena Vista, and, in an unusual scene for state medical board meetings, were attended by a sometimes ""raucous"" crowd, featuring some attendees who had to be removed for disrupting the proceedings with protests and attempts to shout down doctors who testified at the meeting.

The two medical boards split on whether to permit an exception for minors who want to receive these treatments as part of a recognized clinical study on the long term effects of these treatments. The Board of Osteopathic Medicine voted to approve such an exception, even though there are no such studies ongoing in Florida at this time. The Board of Medicine's proposed rule initially also contained such an exception, but it was ultimately removed before the final vote. This leaves the ultimate fate of such potential studies in legal limbo in the state of Florida.

Both rules, however, do contain exceptions that allow minors who have already begun to receive these treatments to continue to receive those treatments.

LGBT organizations have vowed to file prompt legal challenges to the rules.

In a debate last Monday night, DeSantis blasted the Orwellian rhetoric of those who have defended these procedures, saying, ""When they say gender-affirming care, they mean giving puberty blockers to teenage girls and teenage boys. They mean doing double mastectomies on young girls. They mean chemically-castrating young boys. That is wrong. We are not going to allow that to happen in the state of Florida.""

In defending the decision, Board of Medicine Chairman Dr. David Diamond said, ""To say that there is a singular standard of care is simply not accurate. The chief point of agreement amongst all the experts, and I must emphasize this, is that there is a pressing need for additional, high-quality clinical research.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-doctors-will-no-longer-be-authorized-to-prescribe-puberty-blockers-or-gender-affirming-surgeries-to-minors,2022-11-05
Florida Medicaid will not cover gender reassignment measures,"Florida will prohibit Medicaid coverage for various gender reassignment measures such as surgeries, puberty blockers, hormones, hormone antagonists, and procedures that would change primary or secondary sex characteristics.

The rule, which marks a blow against radical leftist gender ideology, will go into effect later this month on August 21.

""Throughout this process ⁦@AHCA_FL [Florida Agency for Health Care Administration] has remained committed to following the evidence in the treatment of gender dysphoria, rather than the eminence of a medical society or association. Our focus will always be on paving the way for a healthier Florida,"" tweeted Brock Juarez, communications director for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration.

Media reports discussing the state's move used the term ""gender-affirming"" to refer to the gender transition measures that will not be covered by Florida Medicaid. A Politico headline read, ""Florida bans Medicaid from covering gender-affirming treatments,"" while a Washington Post headline declared, ""Florida to bar Medicaid coverage for those seeking gender-affirming care.""

""'Gender affirming care' is not standard medical terminology. It's propaganda. The media should stop using left-wing talking points,"" Juarez tweeted.

Several groups issued a joint statement expressing staunch opposition to the rule.

""Lambda Legal, Southern Legal Counsel, Florida Health Justice Project, and National Health Law Program denounce Florida's cruel effort to strip transgender Floridians on Medicaid of the ability to access essential, medically necessary, and often lifesaving medical care,"" the groups said in the statement. ""This discriminatory and medically unsound rule will take effect on August 21, 2022, putting transgender people in jeopardy of losing access to critical gender-affirming health care services.""

Leftists were outraged earlier this year by the approval of legislation in the Sunshine State that included a provision that prohibits teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation in kindergarten through third grade.

""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,"" the law states.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-medicaid-bans-gender-reassignment,2022-08-12
Florida school board green-lights yearbook page featuring student walkout protest over Parental Rights in Education law,"A Florida school board has overruled the superintendent's decision to cover up a pro-LGBTQ+ page in this year's yearbook that expressed opposition to the state's Parental Rights in Education law.

Seminole County Schools Superintendent Serita Beamon had argued that the yearbook page violated district policy by appearing to endorse a walkout protest against the parental rights law, falsely dubbed ""Don't Say Gay"" by its critics. The page featured pictures from a March protest at Lyman High School showing students waving rainbow flags and a ""love is love"" sign.

Beamon had ordered stickers to cover the entire page and had planned to add them to the yearbooks before they were given to students this week.

But Seminole County School Board members unanimously voted to reject her plan Tuesday night, opting instead to add smaller stickers that would not cover the words and photos on the page but would add a disclaimer that the protest outside Lyman High School was unauthorized, the Associated Press reported.

“I would be happy out of my own personal pocket to pay for different stickers to say this was not a school-sponsored event,” said board chairwoman Amy Pennock.

The parental rights law, signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March, bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and restricts such discussion to what is ""age"" or ""developmentally appropriate"" in later grades as determined by state standards.

Critics accused the law of restricting speech in the classroom and hatefully targeting LGBTQ+ people, while its supporters asserted it is inappropriate to discuss sexual material with children between five and eight years old.

The plan to cover up the yearbook page drew opposition from students, parents, and teachers, who accused the superintendent of censorship and took to social media posting ""#stopthestickers.""

""It is silencing the LGBTQ-plus community and silencing the journalistic community,” said Sara Ward, a student on the yearbook staff who spoke at Tuesday's school board meeting.



Beamon denied that her intention was to censor pro-LGBTQ+ students or silence anyone's voice.

“I want to be clear to each and every student that this was not about the Lyman High School administration looking to try and target any student, to try and silence any voice,” she said.

She argued that school board policies authorize administrators to restrain certain speech in school-sponsored publications that could be disruptive of school activities.

“There is some speech that is prohibited. And that includes speech that is likely to cause substantial disruption or that materially interferes with school activities or the educational process,” Beamon said.

The board disagreed, calling the student walkout a peaceful protest and saying there was nothing wrong with featuring it on the yearbook page.

EXCLUSIVE: Florida considering a ban on sex-change surgeries for children; Democrats opposed,"TheBlaze has learned that a key committee in the Florida legislature has agreed to take up a bill proposed by a conservative lawmaker that, if passed, would outlaw injecting children with puberty blockers and performing sex-change surgeries on them in the state.

Members of the Health Quality Subcommittee will debate Republican Rep. Anthony Sabatini's ""Vulnerable Child Protection Act"" on Monday. Sabatini's legislation would make it a crime for doctors to perform surgeries on children that ""sterilize"" them, alter their genitals, or inject them with controversial ""puberty blockers.""

Under the new law, medical professionals who perform said procedures would face felony charges, fines, and imprisonment.

'Dangerous social experiments'

Sabatini said the new statute is needed to protect the Sunshine State's children from left-wing activists performing ""dangerous social experiments"" on underage minors.

In an interview with TheBlaze, the conservative Republican lawmaker from Central Florida noted that ""80 percent of children who experience gender dysphoria outgrow it, but radical leftists want to make it permanent with dangerous medical procedures simply to further a political agenda.""

The Lake County Republican is pointing to research showing the vast majority of children who experience gender identity dysphoria do not continue their transition into adulthood.

""While the actual percentages vary from study to study, overall, it appears that about 80 percent of kids with gender dysphoria end up feeling okay, in the long run, with the bodies they were born into,"" The Cut reported in 2016.

Sabatini also pointed to medical research showing puberty blockers can be dangerous for children.

""It has been shown that puberty blockers interfere with the expected increase in bone density in adolescence such that the bones are not as strong as they would be had normal pubertal development been allowed,"" according to endocrinologist Michael Laidlaw. ""These lost years of bone development cannot be regained.""

In addition, the FDA has received over 24,000 reports of adverse reactions to Lupron, the drug most commonly used to delay puberty. Reported side effects include joint pain, osteoporosis, immune systems complications, and mental health issues, among them suicidal thoughts and severe depression.

Anti-gay? Hardly, Sabatini says

Despite the medical concerns with puberty blockers and the performance of sex-change operations on minors, as TheBlaze reported last month, a handful of Sabatini's Democratic colleagues blasted the bill when the lawmaker presented it in January. Now, presumably as a result of lobbying efforts by LGBT groups, the Florida representative says that a growing number of Democrats are working in lock-step to undermine his proposal.

""Shockingly, the entire Democrat Party has become so radical, that it now defends shutting down puberty for minors and medical sex change for children—it's mind boggling,"" he said when contacted by phone on Saturday.

NBC News has labeled the ""Vulnerable Child Protection Act"" NBC and other unrelated regulatory pro-business reforms as ""anti-gay."" By labeling Sabatini's proposal as ""homophobic"" and grouping it together with other bills, Democratic activist groups are hoping to brand the disparate legislative efforts as a broader ""attack"" on LGBT communities with the goal of sinking the ""Vulnerable Child Protection Act,"" which, according to the Florida lawmaker, is the one that Democrats are truly attempting to target.



Sabatini is unfazed, however, telling TheBlaze that his Democratic colleagues are well aware that his bill ""has nothing to do with sexual orientation.""

""It's about stopping some in the medical industry making a profit while enabling those who want to experiment on children who are experiencing gender identity issues,"" he said.

Former Hallmark actress defends both Candace Cameron Bure and 'the LGBT community',"A former Hallmark actress, noted for her roles in wholesome Christmas movies, has come to the defense of another former Hallmark actress, as well as ""the LGBT community.""

Danica McKellar, 47, recently spoke to Fox News Digital about a controversy at her new network, Great American Family. Former Hallmark star and current GAF chief creative officer Candace Cameron Bure, who often speaks publicly about her deeply-held Christian beliefs, ruffled a lot of feathers last month when she stated: ""I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.""

After those comments, Neal Bledsoe, McKellar's male co-star in the recent GAF movie ""Christmas at the Drive-In,"" decided to leave GAF.

""As an artist, I yearn to be proud of the work I create,"" Bledsoe told Variety recently. ""But, the thought that my work could be used to deliberately discriminate against anyone horrifies and infuriates me.""

""I hope GAF will change, but until everyone can be represented in their films with pride, my choice is clear,"" Bledsoe added.

When asked about Bledsoe's sudden departure from GAF, McKellar expressed affection for her former co-star, but also explained that she interpreted Bure's comments differently.

""Neal is a wonderful person,"" McKellar stated unequivocally. ""He's such a great actor, and I have enjoyed working with him so much. He and I both share our love and support of the LGBT community, for sure.""

However, she also added, ""I don't agree with his interpretation of [Bure's] comments. I just didn't see them the same way.

""[Bure] started the sentence with ‘I think,’ which is not definitive,"" McKellar noted, ""and she ended it with ‘at its core,’ which doesn't mean exclusively.

""I don't agree with his interpretation, but I love him to death and I wish him well,"" she concluded.

After Bure made the comments back in November, McKellar took to Instagram to discuss her own understanding of Christianity and homosexual relationships.

""I'm a new Christian, and I'm so grateful for that. As I always have, I celebrate all forms of healthy love between adults, and I support representation,"" she wrote in part on November 23. In the post, she also discussed her participation in programs featuring same-sex relationships and her recent attendance at a same-sex ""wedding"" ceremony, which she called ""one of the purest expressions of love [she] had ever seen.""

""I'm still new to my faith journey, but as far as I can tell, Jesus loves and includes everyone. That's kind of His thing,"" she added.

"Former transgender woman says media, doctors misled him to believe that sex change was the answer to his gender dysphoria","A former transgender woman says that cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgery doesn't solve the underlying psychological problems associated with gender dysphoria.

Walt Heyer was 42 when he began taking female hormones and underwent sex-change surgery, including genital reconfiguration and breast implants. His doctors told him it was the only solution to his gender distress.

But they were wrong, Heyer explained in an op-ed published Monday in USA Today. The now 77-year-old detailed his transition from a man to a woman, then back to a man eight years later.

""After de-transitioning, I know the truth: Hormones and surgery may alter appearances, but nothing changes the immutable fact of your sex,"" Heyer wrote. ""You will hear the media say, 'Regret is rare.' But they are not reading my inbox, which is full of messages from transgender individuals who want the life and body back that was taken from them by cross-sex hormones, surgery and living under a new identity.""

What's the story?

Heyer said his gender confusion started when he was a young boy.

""I started my transgender journey as a 4-year-old boy when my grandmother repeatedly, over several years, cross-dressed me in a full-length purple dress she made especially for me and told me how pretty I was as a girl,"" he wrote. ""This planted the seed of gender confusion and led to my transitioning at age 42 to transgender female.""

When Heyer's parents learned what his grandmother had done, he was no longer permitted to visit her unsupervised.

""I thought my secret was safe, but my teenage uncle heard about it and felt I was fair game for taunting and sexual abuse. I wasn't even 10 years old. If not for the purple dress, I believe I would not have been abused by my uncle,"" Heyer wrote.

The abuse led him to no longer wanting to be a boy. He started cross-dressing as a means of escape.

In his 20s, he married a woman and they had two children. He was successful at work but Heyer continued cross-dressing on his business trips away from home.

""By the time I was 40, I couldn't take the pressure of living two separate lives. I felt torn apart, wanting to be a good husband and father, but in severe torment about needing to be a woman,"" he wrote.

After Heyer's marriage ended, he followed the recommendations given to him and transitioned to a woman.

""At first, I was giddy with excitement,"" he wrote. ""It seemed like a fresh start. I could sever ties with my former life as Walt and my painful past. But reality soon hit. My children and former wife were devastated. When I told my employer, my career was over.""

He began living as a woman named Laura Jensen but he was still confused and ""deeply suicidal."" He couldn't understand why the hormones and surgery hadn't worked.

""Hidden underneath the makeup and female clothing was the little boy hurt by childhood trauma,"" Heyer wrote. ""I was once again experiencing gender dysphoria, but this time I felt like a male inside a body refashioned to look like a woman.""

Some studies have shown that many of those diagnosed with gender dysphoria have at least one other psychiatric disorder.

He finally sought help for the abuse he had suffered as a child. His breast implants were removed when he was 50 and he continued his therapy.

""In 1996, at the age of 55, I was finally free from the desire to live as a woman and changed my legal documents back to Walt, my biologically correct male sex,"" he explained in his column.

Heyer believes that he wouldn't have suffered as he did if he had not been ""misled by media stories of sex change 'success' and by medical practitioners who said transitioning was the answer to my problems.""

""I wouldn't have suffered as I have. Genetics can't be changed,"" he said. ""Feelings, however, can and do change. Underlying issues often drive the desire to escape one's life into another, and they need to be addressed before taking the radical step of transition.""

What else?

Heyer eventually remarried. He and his wife, who have been married for 21 years, provide support to others through his website SexChangeRegret.com.

He has written several books on the topic, including ""Sex Change-It's Suicide: A Whistleblower Speaks Out"" and ""A Transgender's Faith.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-transgender-doctors-misled-about-sex-change,2019-02-11
Fox cancels livestream of Louis Farrakhan's 'message' from 'God' after massive outrage,"Fox network's streaming service Fox Soul will no longer air Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's planned ""message"" from God.

What's a brief history of this?

The network's move follows major outcry against the previously planned airing, which was set to take place on July 4.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt were two prominent voices that spoke out against the network's decision to provide Farrakhan a platform.

In a lengthy statement, Greenblatt wrote, ""Louis Farrakhan, a notorious #antisemite & #homophobe, inexplicably continues to get airtime. He repeatedly elevates hateful conspiracies. He has called Jews ""termites"" and the #LGBTQ+ community 'degenerates.' He deserves condemnation, not exposure.""

Tapper added, ""Farrkhan is a vile anti-LGBTQ anti-Semitic misogynist. Why is a Fox channel airing his propaganda?""

What are the details?

Fox Soul issued a Twitter release announcing the broadcast's cancellation.

Instead of airing Farrakhan's speech, the release reveals, a compilation feature including speeches from ""the greatest Black leaders and thinkers"" is set to air in its place.

A portion of the statement read, ""This powerful and inspirational program replaces the previously scheduled Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's 'Message to America.'""

What else?

A Fox source reportedly told the Daily Beast that such programming might include people such as Malcolm X, Cornel West, and Martin Luther King Jr.



According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Nation of Islam is an organized hate group. The SPLC adds that the group's ""theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""

Fox Soul — which was launched in January — aims to be ""a new live and interactive streaming channel dedicated to the African American viewer.""

Social conservatives slam Fox News for airing pride month segment on transgender teen,"Social conservatives slammed Fox News on Friday after the cable network aired a lengthy segment praising a transgender California teenager as an ""inspiration"" for LGBTQ+ pride month.

""Pride month continues as we highlight the story of Ryland Whittington, who's journey of transitioning at age 5 has been seen by seven million people in a family YouTube video,"" said anchor Dana Perino as she introduced the controversial segment on ""America's Newsroom"" Friday.



Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas then reported on Ryland Whittington, a 14-year-old gender dysphoric girl who identifies and presents as a boy.

“If you saw me walking down the street you wouldn’t think anything different,” Ryland says at the beginning of the segment.

“14-year-old Ryland Whittington is a typical southern California teenager. And the Whittingtons, along with mom Hillary, dad Jeff, and sister Brynley are a typical family. The only difference though, in Ryland’s eyes, is what this family can mean to the tens of thousands of kids under 18 who identify as transgender,” Llenas reported.

“We put our story out there so people could see that, like, there's another family out there that is going through what we’re going through or there is another family who is proud of who they are,"" Ryland said.

Watch:



The Whittingtons claim they knew their child was transgender even before Ryland could speak.

“I could see it. It wasn’t him trying to be a brat. It was like painful. It was truly painful for him to have to wear feminine clothing and for us constantly telling him that you're a girl,” said Ryland's mother, Hillary.

When Ryland vocalized her gender confusion at age 5, her parents ""fully embraced"" her new identity as a boy, Llenas reported.

“We were confused like most people are. We thought gender and sexuality were the same thing. It took us a while to figure out those two things are different and that children actually do recognize their gender identity very young. Some of them, not all,” Hillary said.

She claims that her ""conservative faith"" led her to believe that God made Ryland transgender.

“For me, it is just a deep spiritual belief that you believe in God and he created us the way he wanted us and he created Ryland just the way he is,” Hillary said.

The Whittington family said they want Ryland's story to raise awareness for how transgender youths are at a higher risk of self-harm when their self-proclaimed gender identities are not accepted. Llenas reported statistics from the Trevor Project, a suicide hotline for LGBTQ+ youth, that show more than 50% of transgender youths consider suicide.

“That was the turning point. I didn’t want to see Ryland go through that,” said Ryland’s father Jeff.

“I would rather have a living son than a dead daughter,"" added his wife Hillary.



""I guarantee that if we had pushed back and done what a lot of parents do, I don’t think we would have either one of the kids that you see before you here today,” she said.

The family has written a book, ""Raising Ryland,"" that chronicles their experience. They also posted a YouTube video telling Ryland's story in 2014 that has since been viewed more than 8 million times.

“I’m just here to make the ride smoother for others. You might be struggling right now but we believe in you. This family, we might not know you, we might not know where you live but, you know, we understand you and we believe in you,” Ryland concluded.

“What extraordinary courage, displayed by Ryland, his sister Brynley, father Jeff, and mom Hillary. I want to thank the family for speaking to us,” Llenas said at the end of the segment. ""It is not easy, particularly at a time when transgender issues have been politicized. People are afraid of what they don’t understand, Dana. This family hopes their story will lead to more understanding, more acceptance, and ultimately more love.""

Social conservatives reacted poorly to the Fox News segment, which was aired as part of the network's diversity programming for Pride Month.

""I’m stunned that Fox News ran a segment celebrating a girl whose parents 'transitioned' her into a boy when she was 5 because she apparently told them she was a boy 'before [she] could talk,'"" tweeted BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey of ""Relatable.""

""For those saying, 'why are you stunned?' Look - of course we all knew most at Fox are socially liberal. But THIS? Is a whole other level. It’s as extreme and depraved as it gets,"" she said in a follow-up tweet.

""Fox has become Jenner’s press agent, so this is sadly its next logical descent into the mouth of madness,"" BlazeTV host Steve Deace of ""The Steve Deace Show"" said, quoting Stuckey's tweet and referring to Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender former Olympic athlete who has since been hired as a contributor by Fox News.

Conservative radio host Erick Erickson commented that the segment on Ryland was likely to hurt Fox News' reputation as the go-to cable news channel for conservatives.

""Fox News promoting trans propaganda is something to behold. That’s gonna hurt the network more than calling Arizona for Biden,"" Erickson tweeted.

Others slammed Fox News for promoting the pro-trans position.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-pride-month-transgender,2022-06-10
Fox network streaming platform set to air Louis Farrakhan's 'message' from 'God' on July 4,"Fox network's ""Fox Soul"" will be streaming a live ""Message of Hope"" from Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on Saturday, July 4.

Farrakhan is reportedly set to deliver a message from ""God"" during the event.

What are the details?

In a since-deleted tweet, Fox Soul wrote, ""LIVE ON FOX SOUL: THE CRITERION THE HONORABLE MINISTER LOUIS FARRAKHAN will deliver his MESSAGE TO AMERICA on JULY 4th at 11 am ET/8 AM PT.""



Image source: Wayback Machine screenshot

Farrakhan also tweeted the message as one that ""God has formed in me.""



""It is for every inhabitant of this planet,"" he wrote. ""If it is the Will of God, I will deliver it to the world on July 4th.""

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Nation of Islam as a hate group and says that the group's ""theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""



On its website, Fox Soul says it is ""a new live and interactive streaming channel dedicated to the African American viewer.""

""The programs aim to celebrate black culture and deal with real topics that impact the everyday lives of the black community through frank and insightful dialogue with local and national influencers,"" the website adds.

FOX network launched Fox Soul in January.

What else?

On Monday, CNN host Jake Tapper took notice of Fox Soul's Independence Day programming and called the network out for the Nation of Islam leader's special.

He wrote, ""Farrakhan is a vile anti-LGBTQ anti-Semitic misogynist. Why is a Fox channel airing his propaganda?""

Rapper Ice Cube fired back, writing, ""Watch your mouth Jake.""

"NBC analyst demands Tucker Carlson, Lauren Boebert face 'consequences' for Club Q massacre","NBC News analyst Frank Figliuzzi demanded on Monday that Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Fox News host Tucker Carlson be held partially responsible for the attack at Club Q, an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs.

Wait, what?

Speaking on MSNBC, Figliuzzi encouraged the families of the Club Q victims to take action against people like Boebert and Carlson, whom Figliuzzi suggested are partially responsible for the tragedy.

""Prosecutors and police, they found quickly what they needed. That means they know this was a biased crime,"" Figliuzzi said. ""This is likely since we've heard reports that the subject isn't cooperative with police, that means they likely found clear and convincing evidence on his devices.""

Authorities have charged the suspected perpetrator with hate crimes, but accusations, of course, are not declarations of guilt. That is something that Figliuzzi, a trained lawyer and career FBI official, should know, yet he declared the crime ""biased"" anyway.

""If he's a consumer of the people we just rattled of — from Lauren Boebert to Tucker Carlson — let's get it out. Let's get it out at trial, let's expose it for what it is, name it, and shame it,"" Figliuzzi continued.

""He's a consumer of these people and those people should face civil consequences from the victims,"" he declared.

There is no evidence, in fact, that the perpetrator is a ""consumer"" of Boebert and Carlson.

What about the law?

While Figliuzzi did not clarify what those ""civil consequences"" should be, the First Amendment protects Boebert, Carlson, and others who share their views about the LGBT agenda.

At any rate, neither of them have called for violence against the LGBT community.

And despite what progressive activists claim, disagreeing with the LGBT agenda is not the same thing as calling for violence against the LGBT community or directly inciting violence, which is unlawful.

Ironically, the same free speech principles that protect Boebert and Carlson also allow Figliuzzi to claim that the solution ""to put a stop to hate"" is to teach ""young children in school"" the LGBT agenda.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/frank-figliuzzi-carlson-boebert-consequences,2022-11-22
Franklin Graham had an event canceled in the UK because he views homosexuality as a sin — he responded with the gospel,"The Rev. Franklin Graham, a popular evangelist and the son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, recently had a speaking engagement in the United Kingdom canceled due to his views on homosexuality.

What are the details?

Graham was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool this summer as a part of a larger tour through the U.K., but on Sunday the venue, ACC Liverpool, informed the public that the event would be canceled.

""Over the past few days we have been made aware of a number of statements which we consider to be incompatible with our values,"" ACC Liverpool said in a statement. ""In light of this we can no longer reconcile the balance between freedom of speech and the divisive impact this event is having in our city. We have informed the organisers of the event that the booking will no longer be fulfilled.""

FaithWire noted that the decision to cancel Graham's event in Liverpool is not surprising, as LGBT protesters in the city had been calling for its cancellation for several days.

The Liverpool Labour LGBT Network called Graham a ""homophobic hate preacher"" in a petition to the Liverpool City Council.

""We fear that with such a high profile event gaining traction, Graham's appearance may incite hateful mobilisation and risk the security of our LGBTQ+ community,"" the group wrote.

The Liverpool City Region Pride Foundation also penned a letter to authorities, saying, the evangelist preacher ""is well known"" for ""promoting hate of LGBT+ people as more important than education"" and ""openly supporting conversion therapy and the vicious attacks on our community in Russia.""

How did Graham respond?

Following the cancellation, Graham posted a lengthy response on Facebook to the LGBTQ community in the U.K.

In the response, he did not back off his views regarding what the Bible says about homosexuality, but suggested that he is not coming to condemn them, but to present them with the hope of the gospel.

""The rub, I think, comes in whether God defines homosexuality as sin. The answer is yes,"" he acknowledged. ""But God goes even further than that, to say that we are all sinners — myself included. The Bible says that every human being is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The penalty of sin is spiritual death — separation from God for eternity.""

Graham also said that he desires to use his freedom of speech not to speak ""against anybody"" but to speak ""for everybody.""

""The Gospel is inclusive. I'm not coming out of hate, I'm coming out of love,"" he wrote, inviting ""everyone in the LGBTQ community to come and hear for yourselves the Gospel.""

That gospel, Graham wrote, is that ""Jesus Christ came. He became sin for us. He didn't come to condemn the world, He came to save the world by giving His life on the Cross as a sacrifice for our sins.""

College students support violence stop free speech on campus,"A new poll revealed that a disturbing percentage of college students are in favor of using violence to stop a campus speech. The survey, by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, Real Clear Education, and College Pulse polled 20,000 students from 55 different colleges, found that nearly one-fifth of college students believe it is acceptable to use violent means to shut down speech that they may agree with or deem offensive.

The poll found that 18% of college students approve using violence in certain situations to stifle campus speech. That number rises to 21% at Ivy League schools, and drops to 15% at colleges in the Southeastern Conference.

""Liberal students expressed a higher acceptance of violence,"" FIRE explained. ""Students identifying as extremely liberal said violence to stop a speech or event from occurring on campus was 'always' or 'sometimes' acceptable at a rate double than students identifying as extremely conservative: 13% to 6%. More than a quarter of extremely liberal respondents said it is 'rarely' acceptable, compared to 8% of extremely conservative respondents.""

""One quarter of atheist students and black students expressed some level of acceptance for violence, as did 27% of LGBT students,"" the poll revealed.

Over 60% of extreme liberals proclaim that it is ""always"" or ""sometimes"" acceptable to shout down a speaker, compared to only 15% for extreme conservatives.

The hostile atmosphere against speech deemed as offensive or inflammatory has caused conservative college students to self-censor to avoid conflict. While 55% of liberal students self-censor, 72% of conservative students feel the need to self-censor.



More than 40% of college students said the topic of race is a difficult topic to have an open and honest discussion about. There were 45% of students who said abortion would be a problematic topic to broach.

When it comes to guest speakers appearing at colleges and universities, there is a bias against conservative orators. The FIRE poll found that an overwhelming 87% of students would welcome former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to speak, but only 69% would allow President Donald Trump to speak on campus.

Conservative students were much more tolerant in hearing speakers who they disagree with politically, and 71% of strong Republicans support Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden coming to speak at their campus. Meanwhile, only 49% of strong Democrats would allow President Trump to speak at their college.

The research also provided metrics for FIRE to name the best and worst colleges for free speech.

The best colleges for free speech:

The University of Chicago Kansas State University Texas A&M University University of California, Los Angeles Arizona State University

The worst colleges for free speech:

Syracuse University Dartmouth College Louisiana State University University of Texas DePauw University

Gallup polls record record high support for gay marriage and abortion in US,"The American left appears to be winning the culture wars as new opinion polls released by Gallup this week show record high support for gay marriage and the moral acceptability of abortion.

The survey results reflect how Americans are quickly reaching a consensus view on same-sex marriage since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized it in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision, but remain sharply divided by political affiliation on the life issue.

On the gay marriage issue, 70% of Americans now say that marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages. This is the highest amount of support shown for same-sex marriage since Gallup began polling the issue in 1996. Since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the practice in 2015, overall support for it has increased by about 10%.

Notably, for the first time a majority of Republicans (55%) say they support same-sex marriage, which lines up with recent trends in the party. Former Republican President Donald Trump was the first person elected to that office who openly supported gay marriage before becoming president. Trump's ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, an openly gay man, spearheaded an initiative in 2019 to decriminalize homosexuality globally. In the last year of his administration, Trump named Grenell acting director of national intelligence, making him the first president to appoint an openly gay person to a Cabinet-level position.

""Once opponents of legalization, Republicans have mostly come to back it. Court and legislative challenges to the legal status of same-sex marriage have simmered down since the Supreme Court issued its decision,"" Justin McCarthy wrote for Gallup.

The abortion issue remains sharply divisive, but a record high of 47% of Americans now say it is morally acceptable, compared to 46% who believe killing unborn children in the womb is morally wrong.

Democrats and political independents are most likely to say abortion is morally acceptable: 64% of Democrats, 51% of independents and 26% of Republicans currently subscribe to that view.

The survey found that Americans are nearly evenly divided over whether they identify as ""pro-life"" (47%) or ""pro-choice"" (49%). Unsurprisingly, Republicans strongly identify as pro-life (74%) while Democrats say they are pro-choice (70%). A majority of independents (53%) say they are pro-choice.

By gender, most women continue to identify as pro-choice (52%) while men are more likely to say they are pro-life (50%). Americans between ages 18 and 54 lean pro-choice while older Americans lean pro-life.

A very small minority of Americans (19%) believe abortion should be ""illegal in all circumstances."" A plurality of those surveyed (48%) favor restrictions on abortion but 32% say abortion should be legal ""under any circumstances.""

""The nearly one-third of U.S. adults who support fully legal abortions is the highest such percentage since the early to mid-1990s, when it was consistently at that level,"" Megan Brenan noted for Gallup.

These changing attitudes show how the battlefields of the culture wars are shifting. While there are ongoing legal challenges to abortion and the Supreme Court is set to consider a case that could result in the first major rollback of abortion rights since Roe v. Wade, Republicans have largely given up fighting same-sex marriage and are moving on to fight Big Tech censorship, critical race theory, and transgender ideology in schools and sports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gallup-record-gay-marriage-abortion,2021-06-09
'Bold hypocrisy': Gavin Newsom caught vacationing in red state on California's travel ban list,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is defending himself after he was caught vacationing in Montana.

What is the problem?

Newsom left California with his family last month, but did not initially disclose the location of his travels. Officials did not immediately answer why the information was not shared, which is unusual for Newsom's out-of-state trips, Cal Matters reported.

But on Tuesday, Cal Matters reporter Emily Hoeven discovered that Newsom traveled to Montana, where his in-laws own a ranch, according to the Associated Press.

The problem is that Montana is among other states on a travel ban list imposed by the state of California. The prohibition bars ""state-funded"" or ""state-sponsored"" travel to states that California officials claimed have adopted policies that discriminate against LGBT people.

News of the governor's travels are leading to new charges of ""bold hypocrisy."" Newsom was accused of hypocrisy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic when he was caught caught skirting rules that Californians otherwise had to follow.

What is Newsom saying?

Now, Newsom is on the defensive, arguing his vacation does not violate the travel ban.

""We don’t legislate where people vacation. Never have. The travel ban applies to expending state funds. The Governor’s travel is not being paid for by the state,"" Anthony York, a senior adviser to the governor, told Cal Matters.

However, when asked whether taxpayer funds are paying for Newsom's security while out-of-state, York refused to answer. ""We don’t comment or provide details on the governor’s security,"" he said.

The question is important because California's state law enforcement agency, the California Highway Patrol, is tasked with dignitary protection.

The CHP's website states:

Dignitary Protection Section (DPS) operates from both Los Angeles and Sacramento and is responsible for the protection of state constitutional officers including: the Governor, First Lady, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the State Insurance Commissioner.

Politico reported that, in the past, California governors have traveled out-of-state with CHP agents serving as security. If that is true now, then Newsom would appear to be skirting the travel ban, since the CHP is funded through taxpayer dollars.

Newsom is expected to return to California over the weekend, Hoeven reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gavin-newsom-montana-vacation-hypocrisy-accusations,2022-07-07
Marvel Comics to introduce a gay Captain America designed by transgender artist,"Marvel Comics will introduce a gay version of Captain America into their comic book universe, and he was created by a transgender writer to celebrate LGBT Pride Month.

The new character is named Aaron Fischer and he will be introduced in a new comic book series titled, ""The United States of Captain America."" The series will explore various people who don the guise of Captain America, but the first issue will highlight the gay teen version.

The gay captain is designed by Jan Bazaldua, a transgender comic book artist.

""I really enjoyed designing him, and as a transgender person, I am happy to be able to present an openly gay person who admires Captain America and fights against evil to help those who are almost invisible to society,"" said Bazaldua.

Here are the designs of the new Captain America character:

""While I was drawing him, I thought, well, Cap fights against super-powerful beings and saves the world almost always, but Aaron helps those who walk alone in the street with problems that they face every day,"" Bazaldua added. ""I hope people like the end result!""



Josh Trujillo, one of the co-writers of the comic book, said that the gay captain is inspired by ""activists, leaders, and everyday folks pushing for a better life,"" and that he would fight for other runaways and homeless people.

The United States of Captain America #1 will be available for purchase in comic shops on June 2, coinciding with the beginning of LGBT Pride Month.

Marvel made similar headlines in January 2020 when the company revealed that it was planning on an openly transgender character to be included in a superhero movie being shot at the time. Meanwhile, in the DC universe of comic book heroes, a lesbian actress portrayed a gay superhero in the ""Batwoman"" television series in 2018.

Gay couple reaffirm reality of biological sex by suing fertility clinic for giving them a girl instead of a boy,"A gay couple in California perhaps unwittingly reaffirmed the gender binary when they decided to sue a fertility clinic for giving them a daughter instead of the son they ordered.

Last Friday, Albert and Anthony Saniger of Pasadena, California, filed a lawsuit against HRC Fertility and fertility specialist Dr. Bradford A. Kolb in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging breach of contract, medical malpractice, negligence, fraudulent concealment, and violation of the Unfair Competition Law and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act — all because they were assured that they would have a boy born via surrogacy, not a girl.

According to the lawsuit, the Sanigers spent approximately $300,000 to secure donor eggs and a female surrogate, whom the lawsuit and KNBC refer to as a ""gestational carrier."" They then endured two unsuccessful implantation attempts in 2020 before the unidentified woman surrogate became pregnant in December that year.

The lawsuit claims that the clinic assured the Sanigers that they would be able to select the exact embryos used in each round of in vitro fertilization and that the biologically determined sex of each embryo had already been made known to them prior to the transfer procedures. The Sanigers say that they selected a male embryo, but that the clinic and Dr. Kolb ""negligently, recklessly, and/or intentionally transferred a female embryo to the Sanigers’ gestational carrier.”

“To this day, HRC has offered no explanation for how this error occurred,” the suit states.

The Sanigers claim that they had decided before they got married in 2013 that they wanted to have two boys to raise. They even selected names for the boys in 2015 and created email accounts for them using those names. They say they still intend to have two sons, whom they will raise alongside their daughter, and that the ""staggering'' expense of a third child is another reason they have decided to sue.

HRC, which according to its website specializes in ""family building options for the LGBT community,"" has since issued a statement in response to the lawsuit.

“At HRC Fertility, our mission is to provide world-class care,” a spokesperson for the clinic said. “We have helped thousands of people, including the couple involved in this lawsuit.

“Every child has value and limitless potential regardless of gender. We hope the Sanigers find love and value in their healthy child while so many across the country are struggling with reproductive issues.”

According to the lawsuit, the Sanigers' ""healthy child"" is biologically female and not just AFAB, or ""assigned female at birth.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-couple-sue-fertility-clinic,2022-07-11
'Gay dads' appear on Disney's kids' cartoon 'DuckTales'; producer says 'relevant LGBTQ+ narratives' are in the works,"Disney's kids' cartoon ""DuckTales"" has introduced a gay couple — two dads — as the parents of Violet, who's a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, LGBTQ Nation reported.

Violet's dads adopt her friend Lena in the episode, the outlet said, adding that Violet dubs her ""my sister from a couple of misters.""

Their names are Tyrian ""Ty"" Sabrewing and Indigo ""Indy"" Sabrewing, LGBTQ Nation said. They both wear T-shirts with the phrase ""I'M WITH DAD"" on the front along with arrows pointing at each other.

What does the show's co-executive producer have to say?

""DuckTales"" co-executive producer and story editor Frank Angones noted that ""we had a lot of conversations about who Violet was and what her background was and came up with this fun notion of her too enthusiastic, overly supportive dads who love being dads.""

""I'm well aware that the 'queer representation through parents and background characters' trope is an issue, and we've sort of stumbled backwards into a lot of heteronormative romances in this show due to legacy characters with pre-existing relationships (Scrooge and Goldie, Donald and Daisy, Fenton and Gandra) and how many specific hoops you have to jump through to make changes to established Disney characters,"" Angones said.

""But that's really no excuse. We've done pretty well on racial diversity and representation of people with limb differences, but we really have not done enough relevant LGBTQ+ rep. We do have some themes and ideas coming up that address relevant LGBTQ+ narratives. But there's always opportunity for a lot more,"" he said.

What are observers saying?

There was pointed enthusiasm out there for the new characters:

""Violet has gay dads!!!"" one Twitter user wrote, while another called it a ""step in the right direction for LGBT representation.""

Although one commenter seemed less than satisfied: ""Yup. I'm so glad to be represented by background characters that they can just erase if China so much as raises an eyebrow.""

Gay journalist slams LGBT athletes group for kicking out Martina Navratilova over comments on trans women,"Former nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova has been taking heat for an op-ed published over the weekend, where she argued that allowing transgender female athletes to compete in sports against biological women is ""insane and cheating.""

LGBTQ advocacy group Athlete Ally quickly gave Navratilova the boot from its advisory board over her comments, despite the fact that she was one of the first worldwide athletes to come out as homosexual and has defended gay rights for decades.

Now, a gay journalist is slamming the organization for its treatment of Navratilova, whom he calls ""one of the greatest LGBT pioneers of the 20th century.""

What are the details?

Investigative reporter and best-selling author Glenn Greenwald has come to Navratilova's defense on Twitter, sending out a series of tweets scolding Athlete Ally for its ""pathetic"" actions against the tennis legend and reminding followers of her trailblazing history.

Greenwald, who is also gay, wrote that Navratilova ""has fought more & sacrificed more than all of those now trying to marginalize her combined: at a time when these causes had very little support. Punishing her for raising questions is shameful.""

The journalist went on to cite examples of how Navratilova ""revolutionized feminism in sports, LGBT equality and trans visibility,"" and slammed those now attempting to paint the tennis star as ""an enemy"" of the cause.

Anything else?

Twitter users attempted to argue with Greenwald's points, but he pushed back, telling one critic, ""Martina has more courage and has done more for the cause of LGBT equality (in) her toenail than you've done in your entire life.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-journalist-slams-lgbt-group-over-navratilova,2019-02-20
Writer for gay magazine says Trump administration's plan to end criminalization of homosexuality is racist,"Out Magazine ran an op-ed speaking out against reports that President Donald Trump's administration is preparing to end the criminalization of homosexuality.

The piece noted that the administration's planned move is nothing more than an ""old racist tactic.""

On Tuesday, NBC News reported that the Trump administration planned to launch a worldwide initiative to end such practices. The report also noted that U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell — who is openly gay — is spearheading the effort.

The purported move comes in the wake of Iran recently hanging a 31-year-old gay man over his sexuality.

So what does the article say?

In a Wednesday article titled, ""Trump's Plan to Decriminalize Homosexuality Is an Old Racist Tactic,"" Out's Mathew Rodriguez writes that there's no reason to ""cheer"" the Trump administration over the reports.

""While on its surface, the move looks like an atypically benevolent decision by the Trump administration, the details of the campaign belie a different story,"" Rodriguez wrote, adding that the administration is ""using queer people"" as pawns to gain power and implement its own agenda.

Rodriguez pointed out what he believes to be the Trump administration's failures at maintaining a ""human rights record at home"" concerning LGBT rights, including — but not limited to — the president's transgender military ban.

He also opined that reports of the administration kicking off the initiative in response to the gay Iranian man's fate is suspicious.

""Grenell has had his eyes on Iran for some time and just a week ago,"" Rodriguez wrote, ""[and] was trying to get several European nations to pass sanctions on Iran, unrelated to the country's stance on homosexuality, to no avail.""

Rodriguez went on to suggest that Grenell's ""sudden interest in Iran's anti-gay laws"" is ""strikingly similar to Trump's rhetoric after the 2016 Pulse massacre in Orlando, Florida."" At least 49 people were killed during the massacre at the gay nightclub.

Rodriguez noted his belief that the president used the deadly massacre in order to gain support for ""an anti-Muslim agenda"" instead of supporting LGBT people.

""Rather than honor those who died, Trump used the tragedy as a way to stoke fear among the American people, and Grennell is taking similar actions with Iran — trying to reach an economic goal by painting the administration's opponent as anti-gay,"" he explains.

What else?

Josh Lederman, who reported the original NBC News article, told Rodriguez that ""Trump is very focused on Iran and is looking for ways to demonize it in the public opinion.""

""This is one area where you know the U.S. and European countries see eye to eye on Iran,"" Lederman added. ""It makes [sense] for [the administration] to focus strategically on that rather than sanctions, where there's been a big gulf between the U.S. and its allies.""

Rodriguez then pointed out the administration's ""racism"" in trying to fight for equal worldwide rights.

The truth is, this is part of an old colonialist handbook. In her essay, ""Can the Subaltern Speak?"" postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak coined the term ""White men saving brown women from brown men"" to describe the racist, paternalistic process by which colonizing powers would decry the way men in power treated oppressed groups, like women, to justify attacking them.

He said that Grenell's move could very well be ""a case of white men trying to save brown gay men from brown straight men.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-magazine-trump-decriminalizing-gays-racist,2019-02-20
Brave new world: Gay man impregnates transgender partner who identifies as male,"Stephan and Wyley met on a gay dating app, and they live in a converted bus in their friend's backyard in San Antonio.





Image source: Facebook video screenshot





""The bio of his Grindr account said something like, 'Country boy, loves the wild, loves animals, vegan' and then like picture of a tree,"" Stephan said of Wyley.





Image source: Facebook video screenshot





All of the above is enough to open a few eyebrows — but the kicker is that Wyley is pregnant, according to an upcoming ""Extreme Love"" episode about the couple.





Image source: Facebook video screenshot





Stubborn biology strikes again

You might be asking yourself how this happened.

Thing is that while Wyley identifies as a transgender male and sports a beard, deeper voice, and a chest without breasts, Wyley — who was born female — still possesses a pesky vagina.

Ergo, a pregnancy that ""definitely was not planned,"" Wyley said, adding that ""I am a man, and I am actually pregnant.""





Image source: Facebook video screenshot

The narrator for the episode's trailer echoed the sentiment, saying that ""carrying a baby isn't something many men expect to experience.""



Wyley's history



""I have always felt uncomfortable in my female-born body,"" Wyley said, adding that the pervasive feeling was being ""stuck in something i don't see as myself.""





Wyley at about 11 Image source: Facebook video screenshot

After hitting puberty, Wyley said dressing in guys' clothing wasn't enough in the quest to ""be more masculine.""







Image source: Facebook video screenshot

So the first step in 2012 was testosterone treatment, followed by ""top surgery"" in 2013 to remove Wyley's breasts.







Image source: Facebook video screenshot





The result was others seeing ""how happy I was and how I could be myself ... my true self of who I wanted to be and who I wanted to become as a man,"" Wyley added.

But Wyley hasn't yet had ""bottom surgery"" — an operation to create a penis, according to the show. The minor detail of still-existing female genitals, turns out, was a ""turn off"" to previous partners.

""Everybody that I've dated in the past, they didn't accept me for who I was, or they all Ok with it up to an extent, probably up to about where we became physically intimate,"" he said.

Stephan's reaction

Stephan, however, knew about Wyley's biology ""right off the bat"" — but still there was the question for Wyley, ""Can you get pregnant?""





Image source: Facebook video screenshot





They assumed the answer was no due to what Wyley was told by doctors amid all the testosterone treatments.

""But that wasn't truth,"" Stephan remarked.

Wyley started experiencing ""morning sickness"" and then learned of the pregnancy at 11 weeks.

""I was nervous, I was very emotional, I started crying,"" Wyley recalled about the big moment.

""As a gay person I don't think I ever really planned for biological children,"" Stephan admitted.

Now what?

According to the episode's trailer, the couple is torn about how to proceed.

""What am I gonna do?"" Wyley asked.

The episode is set to air Friday on WE tv.

Gay polyamorous throuple with children say it's 'no big deal' that their kids have 3 dads,"A gay throuple living in California are telling the story of how they became ""the first polyamorous family ever named as the legal parents of a child.""

In a new book, ""Three Dads and a Baby,"" set to be released next week, one of the fathers, Dr. Ian Jenkins, details the reproductive journey he and his partners embarked upon in order to become fathers to their daughter, Piper, who is now 3 years old. The throuple now also have a 1-year-old son named Parker.

Jenkins explains in the book that though the world may see their family as strange, he and his partners, Jeremy Hodges and Dr. Alan Mayfield, do not believe themselves to be all that unusual.

""The fact that Piper has three parents is just not a big deal,"" Jenkins says in the book, according to a write-up by the New York Post. ""I have three parents myself — my mother, father and stepmother — and no one thinks anything of it.""

""Some people seem to think it's about a ton of sex or something, or we're unstable and must do crazy things. [But] it's really remarkably ordinary and domestic in our house and definitely not 'Tiger King,'"" he adds in reference to the bizarre threesome showcased in the popular Netflix documentary.

In the book, Jenkins describes how the trio's path to fatherhood was trial-filled and expensive. But having fought through numerous legal obstacles and endured through many medical setbacks, they feel it was all worth it.



Jenkins claims the throuple's two children have no problem understanding their parents' relationship: ""I'm Papa, Alan is Dada and Jeremy is Daddy,"" he explains.

""We all bring something different,"" he adds, going on to characterize Alan as the best at reading books, with an accent and, Jeremy as the creative dad, and Ian who is often the cook.

Piper, who is now in preschool, is alleged to have proudly told a classmate, ""You have two parents. I have three parents.""

However, despite Jenkins' best efforts to normalize his family's situation, three gay dads raising children is certainly not yet the norm in America. And the new memoir, scheduled for release on March 9, is sure to draw intense scrutiny.

In a tweet about the book's upcoming release, BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey, wrote, ""Kids are always the unwilling participants of progressive social experiments. We don't even bother to ask whether or not maybe — just maybe — biology and human history tell us something about the best environment in which kids should be raised.""

Last month, Jenkins previewed the book in a video interview, during which he spoke in more detail about his and his partners' life together.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-polyamorous-throuple-with-kids,2021-03-01
Openly gay Trump admin official slams Buttigieg for Jussie Smollett-like 'hate hoax' against Pence,"A Trump administration official who is openly gay pushed back on Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's narrative that Vice President Mike Pence's views on sexuality are hateful.

Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Buttigieg is only making noise about Pence's views now as a way to boost his presidential campaign.

""Mayor Pete has been pushing this hate hoax along the lines of Jussie Smollett for a very long time now, several weeks,"" Grenell said on Fox News. ""It's ironic that right about now when he's starting his fund-raising apparatus to run for president that he comes up with this… idea and this attack.

""Mike and Karen are great people, they're godly people, they're followers of Christ. They don't have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner, they have accepted us,"" Grenell continued.

What happened to tolerance?



Grenell made an argument that is increasingly rejected these days: that tolerance doesn't mean forcing someone else to believe exactly what you believe.

""We were the ones saying everyone should be able to accept and love each other,"" Grenell said of the gay community. ""Now, suddenly, there's a whole community of people who are demanding that we all think alike. I think it's outrageous.""

In comments on several occasions recently, Buttigieg has been critical of Pence and any Christian who does not affirm gay marriage claiming Pence's views cause harm and that the vice president has a problem with God if he believes homosexuality is wrong.



About Richard Grenell

When Grenell was confirmed to his position nearly a year ago, he became the highest-ranking gay official ever to serve in a Republican administration, according to NBC News.

Grenell's appointment was lauded by the chairman of the Democratic National Committee's LGBT caucus at the time.

""Having a Republican president appoint an openly gay man as an ambassador to one of our important allies such as Germany speaks volumes to the influence that the LGBTQ [community] has in politics in the United States,"" said chairman Earl Fowlkes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gay-trump-admin-official-slams-buttigieg-for-jussie-smollett-like-hate-hoax-against-pence,2019-04-19
Mom holds ‘It’s a Boy’ gender reveal photo shoot for 20-year-old transgender child,"A Kentucky mother set up a gender reveal photo shoot for her 20-year-old transgender son's birthday as a way to celebrate his coming out, WAVE-TV reported.

Heather Green purchased glitter, blue balloons, and an ""It's a Boy"" blanket for the themed photo shoot on her child's Jan. 29 birthday.

Then she posted the photos on Facebook for all the world to see.

""When your child comes out as trans, the best thing to do is create a photoshoot to celebrate the fact that he silently and bravely stepped out of the race that he never wanted to be in, found his own lane and proceeded to win,"" Green wrote in the post. ""HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY, Adrian! You are without a doubt the most fascinating human I know and I will always be your biggest fan! I love you, I honor who you are and I respect your courage to be unapologetically you!! Lets celebrate!!""

What's the story?

Green told WAVE that her son was born as a girl but last fall Adrian Brown came out to her and his younger brother as a transgender.

""There was no rule book for what a mom is supposed to do when their child comes to them and says, 'This is my truth,'"" Green told the news station. ""This was just uncharted territory. And as much as I was wanting to support him, I was also wanting him to know that it wasn't just acceptance, or that I was going to put up with him — I was going to celebrate it.""

The whole family participated in the photo shoot, which was snapped by the daughter of Green's boyfriend.

""I mean my kids are used to me coming up with these harebrained schemes all the time,"" Green said. ""He was like, 'You're crazy, but, yes of course,' which was a fair reaction.""

In some of the photos, Green sported a faux baby bump while holding a bunch of blue balloons and a sign that read, ""It's a boy.""

In others, Brown was photographed with a big teddy bear lying next to him wrapped in a baby blanket.

""I thought this was sort of a struggle I had to do by myself,"" Brown told WAVE. ""It's really heartwarming to see there are so many people out there who share the same story that I do and are so supportive of a complete stranger. And it gives me a lot of hope.""

Georgia advances legislation that outlines a 'Parents Bill of Rights' in education,"In Georgia, lawmakers advanced legislation that, if signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, will give parents more direct input over what their children are being taught in the state’s public schools.

Just the News reported that on Friday, the Georgia state senate voted 31-22 in favor of House Bill 1178. The bill outlined a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” that proponents of the legislation say allows parents adequate recourse if they are opposed to the curriculum being taught in their local public schools.

The bill passed the Georgia house of representatives on March 4 with a vote of 98-68.

The reader summary provided for the bill by the Georgia legislature said that bill will provide a “review of removal of students in elementary and secondary education, so as to provide for the protection of the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their minor children from undue infringement by a state or local government entity, local board of education, or any officer, employee, or agent thereof.”

Frontline Policy Action, a group that according to its website, advocates for “God-honoring legislation that protects family values and advances freedom for Georgians,” took to Facebook to declare its support for the bill.

The group said, “Once signed into law by the governor, this bill will codify parental rights as fundamental in Georgia law and strengthen parents’ control over their children’s education.”

It is expected that Kemp will sign the bill, now passed by both chambers of the Georgia legislature, into law.

“Parents have a right to be actively involved in their child’s learning experience,” Kemp said. “This bill will ensure transparency in education by promoting a partnership between parents [and] educators.”

This legislation has worked its way through the Georgia legislature in the midst of similar legislation in its neighboring state of Florida making national headlines.

Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis recently signed the “Parental Rights in Education” bill into law much to the chagrin of liberal legacy media, leftwing institutions, and transnational corporations.

These groups inaccurately characterized the legislation as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill despite the proposed law barring schools from teaching about “sexual orientation or gender identity” to students in kindergarten through third grade or “in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards” and not the utterance of the word “gay.”

In response to DeSantis signing the “Parental Rights in Education” bill into law, the Walt Disney Company — one of Florida’s largest employers —announced that it would work to get the law repealed or overturned by the court system.

Similarly, in 2019 after Kemp signed a bill into law that banned abortions after the detection of a fetal heart beat in Georgia, Hollywood studious and celebrities vowed to boycott the state.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgia-advances-legislation-that-outlines-a-parents-bill-of-rights-in-education,2022-04-04
'Get back to business': Disney shareholder blasts company for wasting shareholders' money on 'political crusades',"A Disney shareholder is speaking out after the Walt Disney Company caved to woke demands and vocally opposed Florida's Parental Rights in Education law.

What are the details?

Speaking with Fox News, shareholder Rob Keating said Disney should return to creating excellent stories — and stay far away from politics.

""Here’s a suggestion for Disney CEO Bob Chapek: Get back to business, that is, excellence in storytelling, and stop wasting shareholders’ money on political crusades that have nothing to do with Disney’s business,"" Keating said. ""We all have the right to have our voices heard on issues, but not on the shareholders’ dime.""

Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Chapek (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

In a corresponding essay, Keating observed that Disney ""managed to get itself in a political mess largely of its own making over an issue that has nothing to do with its business.""

""All of this gets back to a fundamental point: Company executives who use company resources, that is, shareholder resources, to engage in politics, including so-called corporate social responsibility adventures, are, in effect, guilty of stealing from the company’s owners,"" Keating wrote.

Keating's comments came after Kristan Hawkins, a mother and president of Students for Life of America, wrote a viral ""goodbye"" post to Disney, condemning the company for having ""transformed into a political propaganda machine that grooms children for abortions and sexual promiscuity.""

What is the background?

Disney became a lightning rod for the culture wars last month after CEO Bob Chapek spoke out against the Parental Rights in Education bill. The company has repeatedly referred to the law by its false moniker, the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

Importantly, the law does not prohibit use of the word ""gay."" Instead, the law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for grades K-3.

After Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the bill into law, Disney released a statement vowing to fight against the law.

Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that. We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.

Last week, leaked videos from a meeting of Disney employees showed executives and producers boasting about implementing a ""gay agenda"" in Disney content, whose primary audience is children.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/get-back-to-business-disney-shareholder-blasts-company-for-wasting-money-on-political-crusades,2022-04-04
"Chris Matthews calls Trump 'presidential' for his response to Ginsburg death, and liberals are melting down online","Former MSNBC host Chris Matthews was the object of a furious backlash after he offered praise for President Donald Trump and his response to the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The iconic liberal pundit offered his appraisal of the president in a short tweet on Monday.

""Trump is right to show respect for RBG. True presidential behavior. Far too rare,"" said Matthews.

The president was first made aware of the death of the women's rights advocate on Friday when asked by reporters about it after he spoke at a campaign rally in Minnesota. The president called Ginsburg an ""amazing woman who led an amazing life."" The White House later released a statement praising Ginsburg for her lifetime of accomplishments.



'Pathetic suck-up!'

Despite the muted criticism tacked on at the end of his tweet, Matthews immediately faced the ire of liberals and other critics of the president on social media.

""Oh geez, @HardballChris, give me a f**king break. Really, you're such a pathetic suck-up!"" replied Democratic strategist Jon Cooper.

""Oh look, it's Chris Matthews being terrible, how shocking! I'm so glad you're not on TV anymore #stfu,"" said writer Tara Dublin.

""I swear to god that Chris Matthews never really made it past 1996 in terms of his perception of American politics. The man seems to be stuck in a time when the national discourse was shaped by white men saying things about each other,"" replied LGBT advocate Charlotte Clymer.

""When you're desperate to be even more of a joke than you already are,"" said Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko.

""So glad you aren't on the air. Some people never learn,"" said screenwriter Bruno Amato.

Others made biting references to the accusations of sexual harassment that forced Matthews to leave his MSNBC show in March after two decades.

""Gonna just throw it out there that Chris Matthews isn't exactly an expert on respecting women,"" said disability advocate Kendall Brown.

"Girls feel unsafe using school restrooms after district quietly implements trans policy, 100 local clergy members and parents allege","Concerned parents and a group of 100 local clergy members alleged that an Ohio school district quietly implemented a controversial transgender restroom policy without notifying parents — and since then, female students have felt unsafe using the facilities.



Parents with children at Shelby City Schools noted that they were unsure when the restroom policy changed because there was no public notification. Parents only know that, at some point, the district began allowing students to use restrooms that correspond to their preferred gender identities.

After learning about the policy change, several parents rallied to request that the district reverse the rule, citing concerns over privacy and safety.

A diverse group of local clergy members, led by Pastor Anthony Cooper of Life Church, penned a Dec. 14 letter to the district, urging it to reverse its restroom policy.

In the letter to Superintendent Tim Tarvin, the clergy noted that parents had ""compiled statements from at least ten different female students who feel unsafe using school restrooms.""

According to the letter, one mother alleged that a biological boy forced her daughter to hug him against her will in a restroom and that her daughter is afraid to go to school since the alleged incident.

The clergy members claimed that Tarvin had even confirmed that ""three transgender girls at school use the girls' restrooms.""

The clergy members called on the district to return to the restroom policy requiring students to use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their biological gender.

""It is our expectation School Administration have a zero-tolerance policy to incidents of misconduct in school restrooms, locker rooms, and showers,"" the clergy members wrote. ""As clergy, we will not sacrifice the safety and privacy of children on the altar of political correctness.""

A 12-year-old girl outlined her concerns to the school board during a December meeting: ""I do not want to walk into a restroom and be scared about who I will see in there.""

""Girls spend more time in the restroom and are more vulnerable,"" she added.

Despite community concerns, the district stated that it had no plans to reverse the transgender restroom policy.

""The board must make decisions based on legal, moral, financial, and public relation considerations,"" School Board President Lorie White said. ""We have to make decisions based on things beyond our personal convictions. There are no plans to change the process now. We want to work with your cisgender students as well as our transgender students. So please, please don't be afraid to give us a call and talk to us about our processes.""

Following the district's decision, Cooper told Fox News Digital that he was ""really devastated about what is taking place.""

""We're finding out that many of them won't even go to the bathroom all day long because they are afraid to go to the restrooms,"" he said, adding that ""we have found out the kids are scared to say anything. It doesn't do any good. And so they're not listening to the children.""

""We're not against the LGBT community,"" Cooper added. ""There's no hate here whatsoever. We want our community to be safe. We want our kids to be safe. It's not really about church. It's not really about the adults. It's about keeping our kids safe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/girls-feel-unsafe-using-school-restrooms-after-district-quietly-implements-trans-policy-100-local-clergy-members-and-parents-allege,2023-01-06
Glenn Greenwald calls out Democrats for 'absolute lie' about Pulse Nightclub massacre,"Journalist Glenn Greenwald called out Democratic senators on Saturday who he said were spreading an ""absolute lie"" about the tragic Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people in June 2016.

What are Democrats saying?

To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragedy, which came on Saturday during Pride Month, Democratic senators posted messages to social media claiming the victims of the Pulse Nightclub massacre were targeted because of their sexual orientation.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.): ""5 years ago, we lost 49 people in a deadly, hate-filled shooting at the Pulse nightclub. The LGBTQ+ community was targeted and killed—all because they dared to live their lives. Once again I say: hate has no place here. And we must end the gun violence epidemic.""

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.): ""Today we #RememberPulse. 49 lives lost to senseless gun violence and anti-LGBTQ hate. A tragedy that is still hard to comprehend. But tomorrow, with Pulse always in our minds, we continue the fight to end gun violence and hatred. We will not rest until we do.""

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.): ""5 years ago we lost 49 beautiful souls at Pulse nightclub. I continue to hold in my heart those who were killed, their loved ones & the survivors of this unspeakable act of hate toward the #LGBTQ+ community. We must #EndGunViolence & build a nation based on love for each other.""

What did Greenwald say?

Greenwald called out the senators for misrepresenting the motive behind the Pulse Nightclub massacre. It was not, in fact, anti-LGBT animus, but the perpetrator was a terrorist who sworn allegiance to the Islamic State and chosen Pulse Nightclub at random.

""Democratic Senators and activist groups promoting a false, conclusively disproven narrative about the Pulse shootings for their own benefits. Anti-LGBT animus was not part of that massacre. It dishonors the memory of the victims — & the LGBT cause — to lie about what happened,"" Greenwald said.

He then called out Duckworth, specifically.



""This tweet is an absolute lie. Every journalist who covered the PULSE shootings and trial will tell you this. It's infuriating to watch Senators blatantly lie this way,"" Greenwald said. ""[The killer] had no idea PULSE was a gay club. He spent the prior day looking at Disney locations, but they were too secured. He entered 'Club, Orlando' in Google — not 'gay club' — to find it. He never uttered an anti-LGBT syllable, saying his motive was US bombing in Iraq/Syria.""

""Even NBC News has acknowledged that the PULSE massacre was not motivated by anti-LGBT sentiment. Their article is definitive as it should be. The evidence leaves no doubt. There's no excuse for Senators and LGBT groups perpetuating this lie,"" Greenwald continued, linking to NBC News' story about the massacre.

The NBC News story explained:

[D]uring the trial of [the killer's] widow, Noor Salman, all forensic evidence suggested that up until the moment he turned into the Pulse parking lot, [the killer] had been considering other venues, rejecting them because they were more heavily guarded. In their closing statement, government prosecutors admitted that there was no evidence to suggest that [the killer] knew that Pulse was a gay club.



Indeed, during the massacre, the killer phoned 911 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, solidifying what prosecutors said was the real motive behind the crime.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glenn-greenwald-calls-out-democrats-for-absolute-lie-about-pulse-nightclub-massacre,2021-06-13
GLSEN to host pride conference for kids at church,"A pro-LGBT organization is slated to host a conference for kids ages 12 to 18 at the Naples United Church of Christ in Florida on Saturday.

""GLSEN Collier is hosting the inaugural Youth Pride Conference in Naples, FL for all local LGBTQ youth ages 12-18,"" a post about the event states. ""This one-day conference, created by and for LGBTQ youth, will provide students with the opportunity to engage in LGBTQ-related issues facing them today while empowering them to be confident in all their identities.""

The event will include a drag show.

""It's no different than what you'd find at a local Naples Pride or Fort Myers Pride or Cape Coral Pride event that families are at all the time. I take my 3- and 4-year-old sons to these because they're fun and entertaining,"" Daniel Selvey Shaw said, according to the Naples Daily News. ""They're making it sound like a drag show that is this big taboo show.""

Shaw — who is the conference director and belongs to the GLSEN Collier board, according to the event description posted on Eventbrite — said that the conference was planned with students, the outlet noted.

One of the breakout sessions available for attendees will include, ""Inclusive Sex Education,"" featuring a presenter from Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, according to the conference description.



A registration form states that ""this is an event hosted by GLSEN Collier and is not affiliated with Naples United Church of a Christ or Collier County Public Schools. GLSEN Collier is a nonprofit organization that works to provide a safe and inclusive environment for our marginalized students, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ.""

The form also notes that there will be transportation available. ""Free Shuttle Transportation is available to/from Immokalee and Golden Gate areas,"" the form says.

""We lease the space. We paid for the personnel. While the church absolutely supports the mission of our organization, they are simply facilitators by reason of the rental agreement we've entered into,"" Shaw said, according to the Naples Daily News.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/glsen-lgbtq-pride-conference-kids,2022-05-21
"'God rest you, queer and questioning ...' Altered lyrics for iconic Christmas carol sung at UK church; ideology behind it blasted as 'woke, unbiblical'","A U.K. church is raising eyebrows for performing the iconic Christmas carol ""God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen"" with altered lyrics that reflect a ""woke, unbiblical"" ideology.

What are the details?

All Saints with Holy Trinity in Loughborough used the updated carol — which removes references to Satan as well as to Christ as Savior — and instead refers to “queer and questioning” “women, who by men have been erased,"" MSN reported.

The network added that the altered lyrics were printed in the order of a Monday carol service to feature “new inclusive words for a traditional hymn.""

MSN said the new lyrics read, in part:

God rest you also, women,

who by men have been erased,

Through history ignored and scorned,

defiled and displaced;

Remember that your stories too,

are held within God’s grace.

The network noted there's more where that came from:

God rest you, queer and questioning,

your anxious hearts be still,

Believe that you are deeply known

and part of God’s good will

For all to live as one in peace;

the global dream fulfilled.

Apparently, this week wasn't the first time the altered carol was performed at All Saints. Here's a video of the church's Carol Service from 2020, during which a choir also belted it out:



The Mayor's Community Carol Service 20/12/21 @ 19.00 from All Saints with Holy Trinity, Loughborough youtu.be





Commentators on GB News seemed none too pleased by it all:

The outlet said All Saints with Holy Trinity in Loughborough was contacted for comment on behalf of its rector, Rev. Wendy Dalrymple.

'Woke, unbiblical agenda'

In a separate story, MSN reported that the altered lyrics ignited an argument on social media between traditionalist members of the clergy and General Synod — the Church of England’s legislative body — and LGBTQ activists within the Church.

Rev. Matthew Firth, former vicar of St. Cuthbert’s and Holy Trinity Darlington in the Diocese of Durham, told the outlet, “I’m not sure where the lyrics came from, but it seems clear that they were changed to fit with the [Church of England's] woke, unbiblical agenda.""

MSN said Firth added, “Compare it with the real words. All ideas about Christ as Savior have been erased. Triumph over Satan’s power has been erased. And the whole nativity story has been erased.”

Sam Margrave, a General Synod member, added to the outlet that he was “absolutely disgusted” that an “act of worship to our Lord and Saviour is being used to push political ideology.”

But Jayne Ozanne — a prominent gay, evangelical Christian and also a General Synod member — praised the altered lyrics, telling MSN: “What an utterly Spirit-inspired set of words for our time! I love the way this speaks into the pain that the Church has caused so many different groups & yet recognizes that God's love is so much bigger than it all. May people who sing it be blessed & restored this Christmas!”

Cardinal Vincent Nichols — the Archbishop of Westminster and president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales — said carols shouldn't be rewritten, the outlet said.

MSN said Nichols spoke to Times Radio about the recent trend of rewriting carols to be more inclusive: ""I think what Christmas does ... it tells us the importance of ritual. And ritual helps us to step outside of our own little bubble, connect with something that we have received, inherited, and that we hope to pass on. And I think those values of a continuation of musical repertoire, of the ability to sing together, of looking at the rituals that have been fashioned over centuries. And those are, probably for me, more important than particular sensitivities which come and go.""

Anything else?

The outlet said the updated lyrics are described online as “new inclusive words for a traditional hymn” on the ResistHarm Movement website, a United Methodist movement of “faithful resistance to anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and practice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/god-rest-you-queer-and-questioning-altered-lyrics-for-iconic-christmas-carol-sung-at-uk-church-ideology-behind-it-blasted-as-woke-unbiblical,2022-12-22
Goodyear employees say company's new 'zero-tolerance' policy bans 'Blue Lives Matter' and MAGA gear,"A concerning training tool made its way from Goodyear's corporate headquarters in Akron, Ohio, to Topeka, Kansas, where some residents are furiously working to defund the police.

The training tool? A slide unveiling the company's new ""zero-tolerance"" policy against ""Blue Lives Matter,"" MAGA Attire, and more.

What are the details?



A photo of the training slide in question has gained traction, and ended up at WIBW-TV in Topeka.

The outlet reported that Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company has a serious problem with supporting the police — or even supporting the president.

Acceptable notions, according to the company, include Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride (LGBT).

Unacceptable notions, however, include Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, MAGA Attire, and Political Affiliated Slogans or Material.

The station reported that the slide was presented at the Topeka plant.



A Goodyear employee speaking on the condition of anonymity told the station, ""If someone wants to wear a BLM shirt in here, then cool. I'm not going to get offended about it. But at the same time, if someone's not going to be able to wear something that is politically based, even in the farthest stretch of the imagination, that's discriminatory.""

The employee added, ""If we're talking about equality, then it needs to be equality. If not, it's discrimination.""

'Committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace'

A spokesperson for Goodyear told TheBlaze, ""Goodyear is committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful workplace where all of our associates can do their best in a spirit of teamwork. As part of this commitment, we do allow our associates to express their support on racial injustice and other equity issues but ask that they refrain from workplace expressions, verbal or otherwise, in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party as well as other similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of equity issues.""

Update

On Wednesday, Goodyear issued a follow-up statement on the training graphic, pointing out that the company fell victim to ""misconceptions"" about their policies and the company.

The company said that the visual was ""not created or distributed by Goodyear corporate, nor was it part of a diversity training class.""

Google celebrates gay Velma with search result animation,"Google is celebrating the news that Velma, one of the main characters from the widely-beloved world of ""Scooby-Doo,"" is being explicitly presented as a lesbian in the new movie ""Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!""

Googling words and phrases such as ""velma,"" ""velma dinkley,"" ""dinkley,"" ""scooby velma,"" or ""scooby-doo velma"" yields the typical search results as well as an animated shower of virtual confetti and two kinds of LGBT flags that float down from the top of the screen — one of the flags is a lesbian pride flag.

Two buttons appear onscreen, including one to run the animation again, and another button where people can copy a link to results page for ""Velma Dinkley"" or share the link on Facebook, Twitter, or email.

""We saw a long-anticipated moment for a character people love, and had a good feeling it'd be an identity-affirming surprise for fans around the world,"" Google senior interaction designer Anthony Irwin said, according to Variety. ""We didn't expect it to be so well received, resonating across so many different cultures and age groups, but people need things to be happy about, and when we can help everyone celebrate together, that's pretty great.""



Google software engineer Emma Freeman, who was also involved, said, ""We have loved seeing the response from both the fans who grew up with the franchise finally getting a chance to celebrate the acknowledgement of her sexuality and younger fans who get to grow up seeing themselves represented.""

Velma is blatantly portrayed as a lesbian in the new animated movie, including in one scene where her glasses fog up and her cheeks turn red after she sets eyes on another female character, Coco Diablo.

Republican lawmakers call on TV ratings board to alert parents about children's shows with 'sexual orientation and gender identity content',"Several Republican lawmakers called on the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board to alert parents about children's shows with ""sexual orientation and gender identity content"" to help them shield children from unwanted messages.

“To the detriment of children, gender dysphoria has become sensationalized in the popular media and television with radical activists and entertainment companies,” Republicans said in a letter to the board. “This radical and sexual sensation not only harms children, but also destabilizes and damages parental rights.”

The letter also specifically cited a viral video showing a prominent Disney executive saying they ""have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters"" in their content. In another part of the video, another executive says they want to feature more ""gender nonconforming characters"" as well as ""queer stories.""

“Considering that the cognitive markers of sexual desire emerge during puberty when adolescents undergo natural hormonal and physiological changes, it is wholly inappropriate to display this content in a TV-Y7 category and for other young audiences,” the letter continued.

""The motivations of hypersexualized entertainment producers striving to push this content on young audiences are suspect at best and predatory at worst,"" they added.

Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, the lead author of letter, told the Kansas City Star that he is especially concerned about how gender dysmorphia is represented on children's shows, and “the promotion of cosmetic treatments.”

Marshall's office offered four examples of children's shows that prominently featured gender identity or sexual orientation content: “Danger Force” and “The Loud House” on Nickelodeon, and two shows from Netflix, “She-Ra and the Princesses of Power” and “Dead End: Paranormal Park.""

Along with Marshall, four Republican senators signed the letter including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah.

The letter asked for a response from the board about their demand by May 18.

Will Hurd gave some pointed advice to his Republican colleagues nationwide about how to prevent the party from shrinking, while speaking at a Log Cabin Republicans event in Washington, D.C. last week, according to the Washington Blade.

Hurd is the only black Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives. Log Cabin Republicans is a group that works for LGBT rights within the Republican Party. Here is an excerpt of Hurd's remarks:

""It's a pleasure to be with you all today because you all know something that many of my colleagues don't. If you're at the age of 40 in most places across this country you have to whisper that you're a Republican. This is a party that is shrinking. The party is not growing in some of the largest growing parts of our country.



Why is that? I'll tell you. It's real simple. Don't be an asshole. Don't be a racist. Don't be a misogynist, right? Don't be a homophobe. These are real basic things that we all should learn when we were in kindergarten. But unfortunately there's too many people that don't follow those things.""



Hurd represents a district in Texas that includes more than one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border, and he has broken with the majority of his party by publicly opposing President Donald Trump's border wall.

Hurd also split with most of the GOP by being one of only eight Republicans in the House to vote for the Equality Act, an LGBT civil rights bill that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected classes under civil rights law.

""People would ask me (why I supported the bill) and I would say, 'look, are you asking the only black Republican to support not being pro-equality?'"" Hurd said. ""And most people never have a follow-up question to that.""

Justice Gorsuch corners Colorado solicitor general into admission about what state did to cake baker Jack Phillips,"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch got Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson to essentially admit on Monday that cake baker Jack Phillips went through a reeducation program.

The admission happened as Gorsuch grilled Olson during oral arguments for 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, a case about whether public accommodation laws that compel artists to violate their personal beliefs violate the First Amendment.

What happened?

After an intense back-and-forth, Gorsuch questioned Olson about the legal remedy that Colorado imposed against Phillips for not having baked a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Though Olson denied it was a ""reeducation"" program per se, what he described was a reeduction program.

""Mr. Phillips did go through a reeducation training program pursuant to Colorado law, did he not?"" Gorsuch asked.

""He went through a process that ensured he was familiar with —"" Olson responded.

""It was a reeducation program, right?"" Gorsuch interjected.

""It was not a reeducation program,"" Olson fired back.

""What do you call it?"" the justice followed up.

""It was a process to make sure he was familiar with Colorado law,"" Olson admitted.

""Someone might be excused for calling that a reeducation program,"" the justice then quipped. Olson responded by saying, ""I strongly disagree.""

The exchange came after minutes of interrogation from Gorsuch in which the justice sought to draw out the difference between a freelance writer and a website designer who both refuse to provide services that contradict their sincerely held religious beliefs.



The writer, Olson explained, would have his religious beliefs protected, but the website designer in this particular case would not. He failed to explain why and even admitted the state can neither change someone's sincerely held religious beliefs nor allegedly make a practice of compelling people to express ideas or speech that violate those beliefs.

How will the court rule?



While the decision is not expected until sometime next year, the court is sympathetic toward the plaintiff, the website developer who sued Colorado because she argues the state's public accommodation law would force her to violate her religious beliefs if she designed wedding websites.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of Phillips.

The court, however, did not rule on the broader questions related to public accommodation laws, answers the present case will likely provide.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gorsuch-olson-jack-phillips-reducation,2022-12-06
"Gov. Walz's appointees will require Minnesota educators to affirm students' gender dysphoria, turn kids into 'agents of social change'","Minnesota will require all educators in the state to embrace contemporary leftist theories about sex and race and to inflict them on students.

As of 2025, teachers' licenses will be conferred on those individuals in the state proven willing to ""disrupt"" normalcy, affirm minors' gender dysphoria, reject ""eurocentrism,"" accept that knowledge is racially informed, and embrace various other ideological fads presently in favor with the radical left.

These new requirements will apply to K-12 public and charter school teachers alike, inevitably impacting children statewide.

What are the details?

The teacher licensing board in Minnesota is called the Professional Educators Licensing and Standards Board. The board's eleven members were all appointed by Democrat Gov. Tim Walz.

The PELSB is responsible for approving and overseeing teacher preparation providers in the state. The PELSB's training standards for both public and charter school teachers are defined in the ""Standards of Effective Practice for Teachers.""

Julie Quist, board chair of the Minnesota Child Protection League, noted that these standards have been transmogrified in recent months. Quist stated, ""Because these revisions affect all licensed teachers in Minnesota, nonpublic schools and institutions of higher education that prepare students for licensure will be subject to these new radical teaching standards, contrary to the beliefs and values of many teachers and schools.""

The Federalist reported that an administrative judge ordered the implementation of the revised ""Standards of Effective Practice"" in December.

To receive or renew a teaching license, applicants will be required to undergo PELSB-approved ""cultural competency training."" This way, the board can ensure that all teachers in the state embrace the same leftist mode of thinking and being.

The training program offered by PELSB-approved providers ""promotes self-reflection and discussion including but not limited to all of the following topics: racial, cultural, and socioeconomic groups; ... systemic racism; gender identity, including transgender students; sexual orientation; language diversity; and individuals with disabilities and mental health concerns.""



The stated objective behind these programs is to ""deepen teachers' understandings of their own frames of reference, the potential bias in these frames, and their impact on expectations for and relationships with students, students' families, and the school communities.""

While characterized as a deepening of understanding, the program effectively prescribes a politically specific approach to race, sex, gender, power, and the West, with the intended outcome of rendering educators activists.

The Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism stated prior to implementation of the new standards, ""The proper focus for the Standards of Effective Practice is to identify what competencies best meet the priority of student learning, not affirmation of student identity or the furthering of activism.""

Standardization by a lower standard

According to the PELSB, as of 2025, teaching licenses will be contingent upon an individual's willingness to:



affirm students' ""gender"" and sexual identities;

create opportunities ""for students to learn about power, privilege, intersectionality, and systemic oppression in the context of various communities and empower learners to be agents of social change to promote equity"";

feature, use, and highlight ""resources written and developed by traditionally marginalized voices that offer diverse perspectives on race, culture, language, gender, sexual identity, ability, religion, nationality, migrant/refugee status, socioeconomic status, housing status, and other identities traditionally silence or omitted from curriculum"";

""assess how their biases, perceptions, and academic training may affect their teaching practice and perpetuate oppressive systems and utiliz[e] tools to mitigate their own behavior to disrupt oppressive systems"";

""explore their own intersecting social identities"";

understand ""how ethnocentrism, eurocentrism, deficit-based teaching, and white supremacy undermine pedagogical equity"";

understand ""the impact of the intersection of race and ethnicity with other forms of difference"" including gender; and

conform ideologically in a variety of other ways.

Karin Miller, a Minnesota teacher, suggested that Minnesota's new standards will both replace academic standards with socio-political standards and violate teachers' First Amendment rights:

A Teacher's Response to the Proposed MN Teaching Licensing Standards Revisions (PELSB) youtu.be





These revised standards not only outline the activities that would signal ideological conformity, but make impactful epistemological presumptions.



For instance, the suggestion that ""knowledge creation, ways of knowing, and teaching are social and cultural practices shaped by race and ethnicity,"" implies not only that some groups may be incapable of the comprehension enjoyed by others, but that knowledge is manufactured, not attained.

Par for the course

The PELSB's assurance that teachers will champion diversity, equity, and inclusion along with LGBT activism is apparently insufficient for some state Democrats.



State Rep. Sydney Jordan (D) wants children to be provided with more information about ""diverse sexual orientations and gender identities."" Jordan announced on Jan. 6 that she was pushing a bill ""to include comprehensive sex education in Minnesota schools.""

She claimed that ""students are demanding access to information about their bodies, consent, and contraception and it's time the #mnleg listens.""

Alpha News reported that Jordan previously pushed a bill that would advance transsexual activism in grade schools. ""One of the most important parts of comprehensive sex education is knowing about gender identity. … I was never taught that there was anything other than a heteronormative view of relationships,"" said Jordan in 2021.

While managing to cram more critical race theory and LGBT activism into Minnesota schools, the state's education department is also taking out more American history and Western culture.

The Federalist reported that in 2013, the department removed presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln from the social studies standards, along with Susan B. Anthony, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan.

Students will similarly no longer learn about the Magna Carta or universal principles of ordered liberty. If Minnesota educators get their way, students will instead navigate childhood with the understanding that they belong either to a victim or an oppressor class in a country that is systemically racist, requiring disruption.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gov-walzs-appointees-will-require-minnesota-educators-to-affirm-students-gender-dysphori,2023-01-10
'Gross mismanagement': DC Attorney to freeze LGBT nonprofit's assets after executive allegedly flees with cash,"Corado, an immigrant from El Salvador, is the formerly gay and now transgender-identifying man behind Casa Ruby—a leftwing nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., that purportedly aims “to create success life stories among Transgender, Gender Queer, and Gender Non-conforming Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people.” Corado and the organization have been embroiled in an ongoing scandal concerning misallocation and misappropriation of funds for weeks, but now D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine is taking action.

On August 1, Racine announced that his office is going ""to address Casa Ruby’s failures in their critical mission to help LGBTQ+ youth.”

After filing a restraining order with the aim of freezing all of the organization's financial accounts, Racine noted that Trump-critic Corado ""appears"" to have fled the country, after having “withdrawn tens of thousands of nonprofit funds.” According to Racine, Corado has also failed to “pay employees and vendors money they are rightfully owed.”

Corado's taxpayer-subsidized piggy bank

Corado, executive director of the nonprofit, is said to have used funds taken from the organization's M&T Bank accounts for personal purposes. Corado allegedly used $60,000 of the organization's money to pay off his personal credit card bills, and used additional funds to purchase food and pay for travel to and from El Salvador.

In the motion filed by Racine, the D.C. Department of Human Services (DHS) ""authorized the use of $500,000 in Casa Ruby's funds to establish youth housing in El Salvador,"" but ""no Board minutes or any other documentation indicate the Board approved this expense."" Furthermore, the organization's stated charitable purpose would not have supported the use of these funds.

Casa Ruby also presently faces legal action from three of its landlords who claim to be owed more than $1 million in back rent. Several employees have been left in lurch as well, noting they haven't been paid since May 2022.



WUSA9 reports that since 2016, the nonprofit has received over $9.6 million in District grants, intended for the use of helping “the District Latino and LGBTQ+ youth communities.” It received $1.7 million in grants from the D.C. DHS in 2021 alone. The Washington Post has indicated federal tax filings show that by 2020, ""Casa Ruby was bringing in nearly $4.2 million a year in revenue.""



The Advocate reported earlier this month that Corado sold a home in Prince George's County for $775,000 and that various employees ""hadn't heard from Corado since May."" Twitter user Taylor Lianne Chandler linked to a video on Instagram that suggests that Corado has in fact fled back to El Salvador.

Trend of betrayal

The anger and hurt now being voiced online about this alleged corruption appears to echo that resulting from the discovery of BLM's ""murky finances."" In late 2021 and in early 2022, BLM was caught in a comparable scandal, albeit of a far greater magnitude.

According to an impact statement issued in 2020, a year in which the organization failed to file taxes, BLM boasted “an approximate balance of $60 million.” Two years later, in May 2022, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation released the first account of its finances since incorporating in 2017, which revealed that over $12 million had been spent on luxury properties in a single year.

BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors was found to have transferred “millions from the organization to a charity run by her wife, Janaya Khan, to purchase the property,"" and ended up with a $3.2 million property portfolio. Cullors also paid her baby daddy ""almost five times more than [BLM] gave to the Trayvon Martin Foundation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gross-mismanagement-dc-attorney-to-freeze-lgbt-nonprofit-s-assets-after-trans-executive-allegedly-flees-with-cash,2022-08-02
Hallmark Channel says LGBT storylines and characters will be announced 'in the coming months',"The Hallmark Channel has long been the cable TV destination for families seeking safe programming — especially during the Christmas holidays.

Because the company has had a history of being faithful to the goal of providing family-friendly programming, it has become a target of the left that wants to see the entertainment outlet become a platform for its cultural agenda, specifically the promotion of the LGBT movement.

In a statement on Twitter last week, the Hallmark Channel announced something sure to set the left-wing agitators' hearts aflutter: America can expect to see announcements of LGBT storylines and characters ""in the coming months"" — which would be just in time for Hallmark's annual ""Countdown to Christmas"" programming block.

Hallmark's statement came as a response to a fan who was praising the channel's announced Christmas lineup but lamenting the absence of LGBT representation.

""I love your movies a lot but I can't say I'm not looking forward to some lgbtq rep that goes further than just a hint of it. I look forward to seeing the moves but also more rep,"" the fan wrote.

Hallmark responded, ""Diversity and inclusion is a top priority for us and we look forward to making more programming announcements in the coming months, with projects featuring LGBTQ storylines, characters, and actors.""

""We are committed to creating a Hallmark experience where everyone feels welcome,"" the outlet added.

This isn't the first time in the last several months that Hallmark has faced controversy over LGBT content.



In late November, then-Hallmark Channel chief executive Bill Abbott said the company is ""open"" to doing movies with gay leads.

Asked whether Hallmark had discussed having stories about same-sex couples at Christmas, Abbott said, ""We're open to really any type of movie of any type of relationship in any space.""

Then, in December, the channel was in hot water over an ad showing a lesbian couple. Hallmark initially yanked the ad after getting pressure from a conservative group, telling the New York Times that the company pulled the ad because the channel doesn't run ads ""that are deemed controversial.""

After a left-wing call to boycott Hallmark, the company relented and reversed course. It not only began running the ads, it fell over itself apologizing for the ""hurt"" it had caused.

In January, after the Christmas season was wrapped up, Abbott resigned from Hallmark.

It's official: Hallmark to run Christmas movie about a gay couple looking to adopt their first child,"The Hallmark Channel will for the first time ever feature a holiday movie about an LGBT couple as a part of this year's popular ""Countdown to Christmas"" lineup.

What are the details?

The movie, titled ""The Christmas House,"" starring Jonathan Bennett of ""Mean Girls,"" will spotlight a storyline about ""a gay couple looking to adopt their first child,"" the network announced in a statement Wednesday, according to People.com.

""Our holiday table is bigger and more welcoming than ever. This year's movies reflect our most diverse representation of talent, narratives, and families,"" said Michelle Vicary, executive vice president of programming. ""Our movies are rooted in warmth and positivity, meaningful connections, family gatherings, and seasonal traditions — a winning formula we hope will bring our millions of viewers much-needed levity and holiday cheer at the end of a tough year.""

A fuller description of the movie, provided by People.com, states:

Synopsis: Working through some difficult decisions, Mitchell family matriarch Phylis (Lawrence) and patriarch Bill (Williams), have summoned their two grown sons — TV star, Mike Mitchell (Buckley) and Brandon Mitchell (Bennett) — home for the holidays. It is their hope that bringing the family together to recreate the Christmas house, will help them find resolution and make a memorable holiday for the entire family and community. As Brandon and his husband Jake (Harder) make the trip home, they are anxiously awaiting a call about the adoption of their first child. Meanwhile, Mike reconnects with Andi (Ayora), his high school sweetheart.

The movie is slated to premiere on the Hallmark Channel on Nov. 22.

Why does it matter?

Though not a surprise — Hallmark had telegraphed the coming of a holiday film featuring gay leads for months — the move nonetheless marks a major shift in the network's programming.

Over the last several years, the channel, often considered the last beacon of conservative entertainment on cable television, became almost synonymous with traditional, family-friendly programming, especially around the holidays.

As such, the channel's decision to show a movie with an LGBT storyline will likely be perceived as the ultimate act of caving to the cultural left.

Last year, Hallmark Channel leadership waffled amid pressure from the left after it pulled ads featuring a same-sex wedding. The ads, produced by Zola, a wedding planning start-up, showed two women kissing during a wedding ceremony.

The channel originally pulled the ads after a petition for their removal by One Million Moms gained more than 20,000 signatures, but after backlash from the left, the network reversed its decision and began running the ads again.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hallmark-christmas-gay-couple-adoption,2020-09-23
Harry Styles being accused of 'queerbaiting' means gender ambiguity is no longer enough for the LGBT movement. People must pick sides and be 'loud and proud.',"In a strange departure from the left's typical support for gender ambiguity, flamboyant pop star Harry Styles is reportedly under fire from some progressive critics for refusing to say publicly whether or not he is bisexual.

The backlash apparently stems from a recent interview he conducted with Better Homes & Garden, published on Tuesday, in which the former boy band singer turned solo act offered a controversially dodgy answer on the subject.

Citing his desire for personal privacy, Styles rebutted the media's frequent attempts to find clarity regarding his sexual orientation, calling the concept ""outdated,"" anyways.

""I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience; it's mine,"" he told the magazine. ""The whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter, and it's about not having to label everything, not having to clarify what boxes you're checking.""

Some evidently found his reasons for not disclosing who he's slept with to be fair enough. But according to EuroNews, others were left dissatisfied.

The outlet reported that some critics on social media ""critiqued his privilege as an ostensibly straight man to be able to remove himself from discussions while still embracing a queer aesthetic.""

The concept is reportedly known as ""queerbaiting,"" and it loosely describes a scenario in which someone adopts the aesthetics of queer culture without committing to identifying with LGBT culture at large.

""To critics, queerbaiting allows people a free ride on the aesthetic without the personal difficulties associated with openly identifying as queer in a heteronormative world,"" EuroNews reported.

In Styles' case, queer critics charge that he is benefitting from LGBTQ+ support without publicly coming out as bisexual.

One might think that Styles' increasingly outward embrace of the LGBTQ+ movement would be celebrated by those in the camp.

But it seems the pop star's Pride flag-waving and extravagant dress-wearing are not enough in the new transgender-crazed world. He needs to reject the heteronormative lifestyle in full or go back to being a normal masculine male.

""Translation: I’m a straight man that wants to keep my queerbait marketing strategy,"" one critic charged.

They added: ""If he is actually queer it would be more important for him to voice that than keep it ambiguous. People in our community (especially black people) are constantly at risk for showing who they are and doing it flamboyantly, and that’s the reason we’re at the place we are now.""

""Ding ding ding!!!"" one person replied in approval of the message.

Another critic wrote: ""That would be nice if that was the case, but queerness is under attack constantly. Especially in some states where u can't even say gay. We can't all live in 2050 where ambiguous sexuality is the norm. We are living in 2022 and we need allies who will be loud and stand with us.""

""No hate but it seems more like a marketing strategy than anything else, he is benefiting from the sexual ambiguity around him, if he comes out as gay or bi....he'll be less relevant cuz there is nothing new about a queer person wearing a dress or painting his nails,"" added another.

Still another commenter voiced a similar rebuke, saying, ""I respect that he wants to preserve his own experiences, but then, he shouldn't sell it like it doesn't matter, especially when people die in the middle of these speeches, I believe we need and must talk it out loud and proud, today more than ever.""

And the list went on. It's a strange new world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harry-styles-accused-of-queerbaiting,2022-04-28
"Hate speech against transgenders — even when spoken in private — outlawed in Norway, punishable by year in jail","Hate speech against transgender people — even when uttered in private — has been outlawed by Norway's parliament in an expansion of the country's penal code that's protected gays and lesbians since 1981, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

Those found guilty of hate speech spoken in private face a fine or up to a year in jail, the outlet said, adding that those found guilty of public hate speech face a maximum of three years in jail.

""I'm very relieved actually, because [the lack of legal protection] has been an eyesore for trans people for many, many years,"" Birna Rorslett, vice president of the Association of Transgender People in Norway, told Reuters.

More from the outlet:

Norway is one of the most liberal countries in Europe for LGBT+ people, allowing trans people to legally change gender without a medical diagnosis in 2016. But reported homophobic crimes have risen, according to advocacy group, ILGA-Europe.



Minister of Justice and Public Security Monica Maeland told Reuters that transgender people are ""an exposed group when it comes to discrimination, harassment, and violence"" and that ""it is imperative that the protection against discrimination offered by the criminal legislation is adapted to the practical situations that arise.""

The amendments approved in late November outlaw discrimination based on ""gender identity or gender expression"" and ""homosexual orientation"" was changed to ""sexual orientation,"" meaning bisexual as well as lesbian and gay people will be explicitly protected from discrimination, the outlet said.



And those charged with violent crimes can receive harsher sentences if judges decide their actions were motivated by victims' sexual orientation or gender identity, Reuters reported, citing the penal code.

Pushback

Professor and legal scholar Jonathan Turley argued that the move is deadly to free speech in Norway.

""In their homes, people will often share religious and political views that depart from majoritarian values or beliefs,"" Turley wrote. ""This law would regulate those conversations and criminalize the expression of prohibited viewpoints.""

More from Turley's column:

The most chilling fact is that European-style speech controls have become a core value in the Democratic Party. Once a party that fought for free speech, it has become the party demanding Internet censorship and hate speech laws. President-Elect Joe Biden has called for speech controls and recently appointed a transition head for agency media issues that is one of the most pronounced anti-free speech figures in the United States. It is a trend that seems now to be find support in the media, which celebrated the speech of French President Emmanuel Macron before Congress where he called on the United States to follow the model of Europe on hate speech.



For free speech advocates, we need to educate the public on where this road leads in places like Norway. What is at stake is the very right that has long defined us as a nation. Once we cross the Rubicon into speech criminalization and controls, Europe has shown that it is rarely possible to work back to liberties lost. We are moving into potentially the most anti-free speech period of American history — and possibly the most anti-free speech Administration. Many politicians are already arguing for citizens to give up their free speech rights in forums like the Internet. With the media echoing many of these anti-free speech sentiments, it will require a greater effort of those who value the First Amendment and its core place in our constitutional system.

Hecklers harass NYC Mayor de Blasio in Trump Tower lobby while he tries to promote his 'Green New Deal',"Protestors heckled New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday during a news conference at Trump Tower while he promoted his Green New Deal.

What are the details?

De Blasio had originally planned to hold the rally outside the 5th Avenue building but inclement weather forced the group to move inside the building that houses President Donald Trump's Manhattan home, the New York Post reported.

""Had the weather cooperated we would have been outside,"" de Blasio said.

Shortly before the mayor arrived, Trump Tower staffers reportedly turned up the music in the building's lobby. The playlist included Tony Bennett's ""Stranger in Paradise"" and Frank Sinatra's ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" blasted through the speakers during the event.

One protester rode up and down the escalator with a sign that read, ""Worst mayor ever,"" according to the Post.

Some Trump supporters joined the protesters who booed and yelled, ""You suck!"" as the mayor tried to talk over the noise. Others held up ""Trump 2020"" signs.

Behind the mayor's podium, Juliet Germanotta, 37, held up a banner that read, ""LGBT for Trump.""

What did de Blasio say?

De Blasio told his supporters he plans to hold the Trump Organization accountable for what he claims it is doing to harm the environment.

""Clearly the Trump Organization is a little sensitive to the fact that we're calling them out for what they are doing to the climate but we are not backing down,"" the mayor said. ""We will take your money. We will hold you accountable.""

De Blasio said Trump's firm would be hit with seven-figure penalties if it doesn't retrofit eight of its buildings in New York City by 2030.

City officials claim that the Trump buildings emit 27,000 tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to the newspaper's report.

""We will not let you mortgage our future for your real estate,"" de Blasio continued.

De Blasio also called on his supporters to ""scream loud enough so they can hear it all the way to the White House, 'Our planet, not your profit.'""

Study claims public policy debates might promote bias-based bullying among youth,"A new study published in the journal Pediatrics found that publicly debated social policies might increase bias-based bullying among young people.

The study used data collected from nearly 5 million middle school and high school students who completed the California Healthy Kids survey between 2001 and 2014. Researchers compared the rates of homophobic bullying among students before and after the state's Proposition 8 initiative in 2008, which asked voters to decide whether or not same-sex marriage should be banned.



Voters approved Proposition 8, which made it illegal for gay couples to marry. In 2010, the measure was overturned by a federal judge who declared the rule unconstitutional.

The study found that the rates of homophobic bullying increased before the Proposition 8 vote. Then, following the Proposition 8 vote, homophobic bullying rates decreased year after year.

""This research provides some of the first empirical evidence that public campaigns that promote stigma may confer risk for bias-based bullying among youth,"" the authors wrote.

What are the details?

Students across nearly 5,000 schools participated in the surveys.

Among the questions asked on the survey was: ""During the past 12 months, how many times on school property were you harassed or bullied because you are gay or lesbian (or someone thought you were)?""

The students were also asked questions about bullying related to their race, ethnicity, religion, and gender.

Researchers found that the rates of bullying related to race, ethnicity, religion, and gender decreased during the 2008 and 2009 school years.

Schools with gay-straight alliance groups were less likely to see a rise in homophobic bullying compared to those that lacked programs for LGBT students.

The rates of homophobic bullying at schools with LGBT groups were below 10 percent versus rates of 13 percent on campuses without gay-straight alliances.

Stephen Russell, the senior author of the study and chair of the Human Development and Family Sciences Department at the University of Texas at Austin, said the study shows how students are affected by ""media-driven discussions.""

""Policies and campaigns related to Black Lives Matter, bathroom bills, immigration — these can be concerning in how they affect the health and well-being of youth,"" Russell told Newsweek. ""The public health consequences of these very contentious and media-driven discussions are more important than we knew.""

What else?

Straight kids also reported being bullied.

""The data are telling us that straight kids are getting bullied for this, too,"" Russell added. ""It's all about what the bullies perceive.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/homophobic-bullying-during-policy-debates,2019-05-13
Horrific new details emerge in criminal case of LGBT activist couple accused of raping and trafficking adopted boys: Report,"Horrific new details have emerged in the case of the LGBT activist couple arrested in Georgia this past summer on suspicion of using their two adopted children to make child porn.

Extra to the new charges against these suspected child rapists who frequently hashtagged their social media posts #gayfamily,"" there are now indications they may have trafficked the young boys to fellow pedophiles.

What's the background?

TheBlaze previously reported that William Dale Zulock, 32, who worked as a supervisor at the county's Georgia Department of Driver Services, and Zachary Jacoby Zulock, 35, had been booked at the Walton County Jail and charged with aggravated child molestation, sexual exploitation of children, and enticing a child for indecent purposes.



The Walton County school district helped the Walton County Sheriff's Office identify the victims, who had been enrolled in the third and fourth grade in July.

During the execution of a search warrant on the evening of July 27, 2022, the WCSO claimed it secured ""evidence that both adult males — the adoptive fathers of the sibling pair residing in the home — were engaging in sexually abusive acts and video documenting this abuse.""

Startling new revelations

According to a 17-count indictment obtained by Townhall, the LGBT activists ""allegedly performed oral sex on both boys, forced the children to perform oral sex on them, and anally raped their sons.""

Additionally, the older of the two victims — who just turned 11 in December — was grievously injured during one of the brutal rapes.

The court documents reportedly suggested the child sexual abuse had been going on for years, dating back to at least 2019.

Zachary Zulock filmed his so-called husband William Zulock sexually abusing at least one of the boys, said an updated criminal affidavit.

Townhall also reported that Zachary admitted to being the cameraman after authorities found a folder labeled ""US"" full of video evidence of the foul crimes against the children on his cell phone.

In a recorded police interview, he said he sent video evidence of the ""routine"" rapes to ""less than a dozen people.""

The alleged pedophiles weren't alone, however.

The criminal indictment indicated that the LGBT activists reached out to two other men via social media, soliciting them to ""perform an act of prostitution"" with one of the adopted boys — the same who suffered injuries from the sexual assaults.

27-year-old Hunter Clay Lawless and 25-year-old Luis Armando Vizcarro-Sanchez of Loganville, Georgia, are the two men in question, both allegedly members of a pedophile ring, reported Townhall.

Lawless informed on the Zulocks, noting that Zachary, whom he met on the gay dating app Grindr, discussed the prospect of ""f***ing [his] son tonight.""

Zachary Zulock allegedly sent Lawless pictures of him raping his 11-year-old prisoner. Lawless has reportedly been out on bond since July 29.

Besides allegedly raping their apparent child prisoners, a relative of the Zulocks said the couple also abused them by nonsexual means. The relative told Townhall that after school, the boys were forced to stand stand in a corner for ""eight hours straight.""

The LGBT activists, on whose doorstep the welcome mat read, ""Gayest place in town,"" maintain that they are not guilty, although the Walton County Superior Court lists among its evidence:

two flash drives containing phone data of Zachary Zulock and Hunter Lawless;

image of text messages from Lawless;

photo of ""daddy"" shirt;

a Snapchat letter;

forensic interviews of both children;

149 images taken from the alleged child rapists' home;

two written letters from the older of the two child victims;

and a disc ""containing data dump of iPad and iPhone of Luis Sanchez available for inspection by appointment.""

Zachary Zulock has been placed under ""maximum security"" at Barrow County Detention Center owing to the ""nature of the charges, reported Townhall.

Both suspected child rapists each face the potential of multiple life sentences.

'Hysterical' transsexual activists shut down talk by human rights expert about transsexual activists' intolerance,"An expert on human rights law was set to speak Tuesday at McGill University about whether transsexuals should be able to legally change their sex and invade women-only spaces when LGBT activists invaded the space, effectively shutting down the event.

Robert Wintemute, a law professor at King's College London, suggested the censorious uproar was ""hysterical"" and amounted to further evidence that any discussion of the fallout of the transsexual agenda, particularly for women, is increasingly being stifled.

What are the details?

According to the event page, Wintemute was scheduled to give a talk on Jan. 10 entitled, ""The Sex vs. Gender (Identity) Debate in the United Kingdom and the Divorce of LGB from T.""

""Since 2018, there has been a debate in the United Kingdom about whether or not the law should be changed to make it easier for a transgender individual to change their legal sex from their birth sex, and about exceptional situations, such as women-only spaces and sports, in which the individual’s birth sex should take priority over their gender identity, regardless of their legal sex,"" said the event posting.

It added, ""This debate inspired the foundation in 2019 of an organisation, LGB Alliance, which rejects the political coalition of LGB and T and challenges some transgender demands, on the basis that they conflict with the rights of lesbian and bisexual women or the rights of children who might grow up to be LGB adults.""

Wintemute, a McGill alumnus and trustee of the LGB Alliance, was invited to speak on this topic as well as to his record as a human rights and LGB scholar by the university's Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism.

Prof. Frédéric Mégret from the CHRLP suggested there was hope that Wintemute's participation in ""critical conversations"" about these issues might have been worthwhile.

""We understand that these are not consensual topics. However, we believe they can be productively and robustly discussed in an academic setting and could, in fact, be an opportunity to push back against certain views,"" said Mégret.

Robust discussion about women's rights on a university campus was apparently too much to bear for some male transsexual activists.

'Hysterical' mob rule

Canadian state media reported that transsexual activist Celeste Trianon, a biological male, sought to silence Wintemute and shut down the event, claiming the event excluded transsexual people's rights and was altogether ""transphobic.""

""I feel like there's such a tragic irony where someone who is actively working toward dismantling human rights toward one of the most marginalized groups … how such an event can be hosted at the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism,"" said Trianon.

According to Trianon, a student at another Quebec university, it is ""close-minded"" for anyone to suggest that the conference of ""rights to trans women"" means ""subtracting from the rights"" of real women.

Annie Collin, a real woman prevented from hearing Wintemute speak, told the Montreal Gazette that transsexual activists attacked her friend.

""They pushed her. They threw her phone away. They pretend they're being excluded but they're the people who tell people to get out. And they get madder because someone wants to defend women's rights, homosexuals' and bisexuals' rights. What's the problem about that?""

In a Jan. 6 Instagram post, Trianon claimed the event would ""contribute directly to the systemic elimination of trans voices and lives worldwide, as well as the dismantling of human rights as a whole.""



Trianon further accused the university of ""contributing to the genocide of trans people across the world"" in Jan. 10 letter co-signed by five professors at other Canadian universities.

The letter contended that ""free speech does not mean having to tolerate hate speech.""

This sentiment was evidently shared by the protesters, some of whom prejudged Wintemute's unuttered speech in advance as hateful.

Among the signs hoisted above the mob of anti-speech activists was one that read, ""No debate.""

The activists can be heard in one video chanting, ""We are not here for debate, f*** your systems, f*** your hate.""

Contrary to the mob's accusations that he harbored hate or irrational fears, Wintemute suggested that he would never have anything to do with a group that ""promotes hate,"" noting he had 37 years of experience defending human rights.

The professor has worked 15 successful cases challenging discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in various European and British courts.

Wintemute told CTV News that it is ""extremely anti-democratic to interfere with a seminar at a university just because you disagree with the opinions expressed.""

""We're supposed to be a democracy with freedom of expression,"" he said.

Wintemute and the LGB Alliance advocate on behalf of the ""many women who are concerned about the presence of male-to-female persons in women-only spaces, which would include changing rooms, prisons, hospital wards, etc.,"" as well as the real females adversely impacted by the inclusion of men in women's sports.



The event's cancellation served to confirm a trend Wintemute has observed elsewhere.

""I have to thank the protesters for giving me firsthand experience of that intimidation,"" he said. ""Probably the majority of women in this country disagree with some of transgender demands, but they refuse to say so because they will be seen as intolerant.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hysterical-transsexual-activists-shut-down-talk-by-human-rights-expert-about-transsexual-activists-intolerance,2023-01-12
Idaho state lawmaker to introduce bill banning biological males from competing against biological females in high school sports,"On the heels of Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire, Washington, Georgia, Tennessee, and Missouri looking to enact measures requiring public school athletes to compete according to their biological sex as opposed to their gender identities, an Idaho Republican is joining the fray.

What are the details?

State Rep. Barbara Ehardt of Idaho Falls said she will introduce legislation that would prevent individuals from competing in high school sports against opponents who aren't the same biological sex, the East Idaho News reported.

""Boys and men will not be able to take the place of girls and women in sports because it's not fair,"" she said, according to the outlet. ""We cannot physically compete against boys and men. The inherent biological, scientific advantages that boys and men have over girls and women, even if they were to take hormones, even if they were to spend a couple of years on estrogen, that's not going to replace the inherent biological advantages that boys and men have.""

Ehardt emphasized to the News that the bill's language focuses on DNA and chromosomes and doesn't single out transgender women — and in fact, she added that transgender men would be prevented from competing in men's sports as well.

""Those biological boys, those men, can still compete; it will just have to be with those who look like them, that have the same large heart and lungs,"" the state senator added to the outlet.

She also told the News that her bill isn't anti-LGBTQ and that she's worked with and trained many LGBTQ athletes.

""This has nothing to do with an anti-LGBT agenda,"" Ehardt said. ""This is all about providing the opportunity for girls and women to continue to compete just as our counterparts, boys and men, are able to compete.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/idaho-bill-banning-biological-males-from-competing-against-biological-females,2020-01-22
ACLU threatens to sue if Idaho passes law banning biological males from competing against biological females in sports,"LGBT groups are decrying the state government in Idaho as a bill banning biological males from competing against biological females in sports comes closer to becoming a legal reality.

The bill was approved by the Senate and will go the House for approval. Critics say the bill is unconstitutional and allows for discrimination against transgender persons.

Supporters of the law say it will protect females from unfair competition by biological males.

""It started to level the playing field. But now we are in a new crisis,"" said Republican Sen. Mary Souza according to the Associated Press.

""Girls who have been struggling and training and competing in their sport are suddenly confronted by biological males,"" she explained.

Trangender advocates and supporters complained about the bill on social media.

""The notion the Idaho House would spend time during #CoronavirusOutbreak looking for new ways to persecute transgender people is just beyond the pale. Don't do this,"" pleaded Montel Williams.

""While the world grapples with #coronavirus the Idaho Senate focused on discriminating by legislating against #transgender people and voting 24-11 to pass a bill barring transgender girls and women from women's high school and college sports teams,"" said Democratic strategist Meghan Stabler.

""We will sue""

The ACLU promised legal action if the governor signed the bill.

""The Idaho Senate just passed a bill targeting trans student athletes. This bill could subject any student athlete to invasive screenings,"" the ACLU tweeted. ""If @GovernorLittle signs this bill, we will sue.""

"If forced by law to call a biological male a woman, female British politician says 'you might as well arrest me now,' threatens to leave the Labour Party","A British member of Parliament who has faced intense criticism over her refusal to disassociate biological sex from gender doubled down last week, reiterating that she will not refer to 60-year-old comedian Eddie Izzard as a woman — even if it means imprisonment.

What are the details?

On Friday, Rosie Duffield, a Labour member of Parliament for Canterbury, England, attended the annual LGB Alliance conference in London.

The LGB Alliance, which seeks to help the ""Ls,"" the ""Bs,"" and the ""Gs,"" but is not so much interested in the ""Ts,"" affirms that ""biological sex is binary, female and male, and that (for the vast majority of people) sex is determined at conception, observed at birth (or in utero), and recorded.""

The Independent reported that at the conference, Duffield was asked about the possibility that referring to a transsexual's biological sex might soon amount to a hate crime.

The Canterbury MP replied, ""Is that a serious thing? Is that coming to Parliament any time soon? I hope not because you might as well arrest me now. I'm not calling Eddie Izzard a woman.""



This response echoed a comment Duffield made in September, when she allegedly said, ""I won't say a man is a woman. Eddie Izzard is not a woman.""

Izzard, a man who dates women and previously identified as a ""lesbian trapped in a man's body,"" is campaigning to secure a spot as a Labour MP. It was only two years ago that Izzard appropriated and began using ""she/her"" pronouns.



Duffield previously stated that she would leave the Labour Party along with a number of other women if Izzard was included on an all-woman short list to become the party's candidate for the Sheffield Central region in the next general election.

""I will not be a hypocrite and I won’t lie and I won’t say that a man is a woman. Eddie Izzard is not a woman,"" Duffield said late last month. ""I’m absolutely not the only Labour woman MP who will leave the party if Eddie Izzard gets on to an all-women short list.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer has not yet revealed whether or not Izzard would be included on the list.

The Daily Mail indicated that Starmer is aware of Duffield's position on the matter and suggested that while ""for 99.9 per cent of women, it's a matter of biology ... there is a small percentage who struggle with their gender and I'm not going to simply put that on one side and ignore that.""

The Labour Party's National Executive Committee ruled in 2018 that men claiming to be women are eligible for all-women short lists.

The general election is slated for December 2024.

LGB, hold the T

Duffield similarly made waves last year at the LGB Alliance conference.

Duffield appeared on a panel entitled ""Cancel Culture and Free Speech"" alongside Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price and Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry.

The National reported that Duffield thanked Doyle-Price and Cherry for supporting her amid her ongoing troubles with the Labour Party, elements of which, in concert with online trolls, have denounced her as a ""transphobe.""

She said the Labour Party is ""incredibly lonely"" for a real feminist.

In the months and years leading up to last year's conference, a number of Duffield's staffers quit, slamming her recognition of the meaningful difference between biological women and pretenders. Pink News reported that one of the outgoing staffers suggested Duffield's comments about only women having cervixes was ""offensive to the trans community,"" despite being a matter of fact.

Duffield said, ""We’re OK to talk about everyone else’s rights, but we’re not supposed to talk about women, and we’re not supposed to talk about our bodies without quantifying it or justifying it, or adding on other groups that we also support to, sort of, you know, have our credentials allowed.""



""I'm afraid my party is an absolute embarrassment at the moment,"" she said, referencing the leftist Labour Party's embrace of extreme views on gender and sex.

Unwavering support for real women

Duffield has long been clear about her rejection of social-constructivist arguments concerning sex and gender.

On Sept. 10, 2021, she tweeted, ""I do not accept self-ID as a passport for male-bodied biological men to enter protected spaces for biological women.""



She added, ""That includes [domestic violence] refuges, women's prisons, single-sex wards and school toilets.""



Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling spoke to Duffield's mistreatment by other Labour Party members as well as trolls online, writing that she and others like her ""have been subject to campaigns of intimidation which range from being hounded on social media, the targeting of their employers, all the way up to doxing and direct threats of violence, including rape.""

Rowling added that Duffield and other such biology-affirming women ""have been put into a state of fear and distress for no other reason than that they refuse to uncritically accept that the socio-political concept of gender identity should replace that of sex.""

The Daily Mail reported that Duffield was investigated by Labour Party officials in 2021 for allegedly liking a tweet that said transsexuals were ""mostly heterosexuals cosplaying as the opposite sex and as gay.""

Alex Beverley, then-chairman of LGBT+ Labour, said, ""We feel we have exhausted all other options and now must publicly call for the whip to be removed from Rosie Duffield and for her to be suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party.""

Despite the best efforts of activists, Duffield remains, at least until now, a member of Parliament.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/if-forced-by-law-to-call-a-man-a-woman-female-british-politician-says-you-might-as-well-arrest-me-now-threatens-to-leave-the-labour-party,2022-10-24
Critics demand Ilhan Omar condemn Palestinian ban on LGBT activities  — and she just responded,"Critics of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) demanded she respond to reports that the Palestinian Authority banned LGBT activities, and she tweeted very dismissively about the silencing of the group.

""Pretending that this act somehow balances or mitigates Israel violating the dignity & rights of Palestinians - or undermines case for defending Palestinian rights - is deplorable!"" she tweeted.

She referred to the criticism as a mere distraction in a follow up tweet.



""LGBTQ rights are human rights and we should condemn any effort to infringe upon them,"" she said.

""But we should also condemn any effort to equate this with the occupation or use this as a distraction,"" Omar concluded.

The Palestinian Authority announced that they would not allow an LGBTQ group to hold a demonstration, and called their activities ""harmful to the higher values and ideals of Palestinian society.""

Omar has been among the most vocal members of Congress against Israel and in favor of the Palestinian cause. She has also been an advocate for LGBTQ causes, but apparently that takes a back seat to her animosity against Israel.

She has also been widely criticized for employing anti-Semitic tropes while decrying Israel, even by some voices on the left.

"During Lent, Illinois church avoids music and liturgy created by non-whites","The website of a woke church in Illinois says that during Lent the church will not utilize any music or liturgy created by white individuals.

A section on the home page of the website of the First United Church of Oak Park bears the headline, ""Lent 2022: Fasting From Whiteness.""

""For Lent this year, First United is doing a mix of 'giving something up' and 'taking something on.' In our worship services throughout Lent, we will not be using any music or liturgy written or composed by white people. Our music will be drawn from the African American spirituals tradition, from South African freedom songs, from Native American traditions, and many, many more,"" the website states. ""For Lent, it is our prayer that in our spiritual disciplines we may grow as Christians, united in the body of Christ with people of all ages, nations, races, and origins.""

Turning Point USA posted a photo of a church sign that bears the headline, ""Fasting from Whiteness"" — the sign includes the message, ""This Lent we build our worship life around the voices of Black people, indigenous people, and people of color.""

The church is unabashedly pro-LGBT, declaring on its website, ""We welcome lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people into the full life and ministry of the church, including ordination, expecting and encouraging them to share their talents and gifts in the life, liturgy, leadership, and employment positions of our congregation, as our ministers, teachers, members, visitors, and friends.""

Editor's note: The original published version of this story contained a headline that erroneously stated that the church was avoiding liturgy created by ""non-whites."" We apologize for the error.

Illinois governor signs law mandating public schools teach LGBT history,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has signed a bill into law requiring public schools in the state to include LGBT history in their curriculums.

What are the details?

The legislation mandates that ""in public schools only, the teaching of history shall include a study of the roles and contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the history of this country and this State."" It goes into effect July 1 next year.

One of the bill's co-sponsors, state Sen. Heather Steans (D) said after it passage in May, ""It is my hope that teaching students about the valuable contributions LGBTQ individuals have made throughout history will create a safer environment with fewer incidents of harassment.""

Steans added, ""LGBTQ children and teenagers will also be able to gain new role models who share life experiences with them,"" The Hill reported.



Victor Salvo, executive director of nonprofit LGBTQ organization, the Legacy Project, issued a statement on Friday praising the law's passage, saying, ""We applaud and thank Gov. Pritzker for approving this law and for his commitment to LGBTQ inclusion. Illinois is on the right side of history with this important, life-saving law.""

Illinois joins four other states that have already passed similar legislation: California, Colorado, New Jersey, and Oregon.

Anything else?

According to The Huffington Post, the new law in Illinois ""also includes similar mandates for African American history and that of various other groups, including Polish, Irish, Italian, Hispanic and Asian Americans.""

The text of the bill also states, ""the teaching of history also shall include a study of the role of labor unions and their interaction with government in achieving the goals of a mixed free enterprise system.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-governor-signs-law-mandating-public-schools-teach-lgbt-history,2019-08-13
Indonesia set to criminalize consensual sex outside marriage,"Indonesia's government is pushing through a sweeping new penal code aimed at cracking down on behavior determined to be offensive to the country's majority-Muslim culture, and is set to outlaw consensual sex outside marriage as part of the package.

What are the details?

Reuters reported that four parliamentarians confirmed the new criminal code ""is due to be adopted in the next week,"" and the final version includes a law that would make it illegal for citizens to have sex with a person other than their spouse. Violators could be sent to prison for up to one year.

According to the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform, millions of Indonesians could face prosecution under the pending law. The organization pointed to a study showing that 40 percent of adolescents in the country have had pre-marital sexual relations — and that's just the young people in a country with a population of more than 250 million.

The Associated Press reported last year that the revisions to Indonesia's criminal code were pushed by the country's Islamic political parties, who are using ""moral conservatism' to ""rouse their base.""

In addition to criminalizing sex between unmarried people, the new penal code also includes a law handing prison terms to anyone found guilty of insulting the president, vice president, government or state institutions. Further, any woman found guilty of having an abortion could face four years behind bars.

Anything else?

Australian outlet the ABC reported last month that Indonesia's military and law enforcement are particularly targeting the LGBT community, conducting raids on gay spas and even private homes. The news organization wrote, ""State-sanctioned homophobia has become commonplace in Indonesia in recent years, amid what many observers say is a rapid rise in religious conservatism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/indonesia-set-to-criminalize-consensual-sex-outside-marriage,2019-09-18
"White influencer under fire for identifying as Korean, blasts 'woke' mob for hypocrisy: 'If you can be transsexual you can also be TRANSRACIAL'","British influencer Oli London is taking heat after publicly identifying as Korean.

The announcement comes after the influencer is said to have paid more than $150,000 for cosmetic surgery to look like Park Ji-Min of wildly popular South Korean K-Pop band BTS.

What are the details?

London is facing heavy backlash for identifying as Korean, according to Insider.

""On June 18, London tweeted an image of a rainbow reimagining of the South Korean flag, saying that it was their 'new official flag for being a non-binary person who identifies as Korean,'"" Insider's Palmer Haasch wrote. ""They also said that they use 'they and them' pronouns as well as 'kor/ean' neopronouns.""

London tweeted, ""This is my new official flag for being a non-binary person who identifies as Korean. Thank you for the overwhelming support it was so hard for me to come out as Them/they/kor/ean.""

London later added, ""So sad how many comments are being homophobic and non-binary phobic. This is actually the official LGBTQI+ flag of South Korea ... GOOGLE IT. Anyone that puts a negative comment is anti-LGBT and anti-equality. So sad in 2021 people will judge others on how they identify!""

On Friday, London continued to address the backlash, tweeting, ""If you can be transsexual you can also be TRANSRACIAL. Why are there such double standards & hypocrisy with people criticizing me for being Korean. It's the same as someone who was born in the wrong body and wants to become a man or a woman. I was actually born in the wrong body!""

London also shared the news in a widely viewed YouTube video, in which the influencer and performer blasted ""woke people"" for their criticisms.

""The only people that need to be canceled is the woke people,"" London said. ""Because they are so dangerous to freedom of speech in society.""

At the time of this reporting, the video — titled ""I'm Non Binary Korean..."" — has been viewed more than 34,000 times.

I'm Non Binary Korean… www.youtube.com

What else?



The British-born influencer and singer — who has nearly a half-million followers on TikTok — has long had a fascination with Korean culture and appearance.



In 2019, London appeared on plastic surgery reality show ""Hooked on the Looked,"" saying, ""I'm not actually changing my race. I have a deep respect for Korean culture. It's cultural appreciation, not cultural appropriation.""

In a 2020 interview with American TV host Phil McGraw, London said, ""If you look at the pictures of me and Ji-Min, we're identical. When I was in Korea, everyone called me Ji-Min [as] I'm walking down the street. Everyone, they think I'm Ji-Min.""

So what has been the response?



Paper Magazine's Sandra Song noted that London's announcement was highly offensive.

Song wrote, ""As someone who actually has Korean DNA though, I can say that some white fetishist — as proven by those 15 surgeries to look like Ji-Min — suddenly deeming themself 'Korean' is incredibly offensive, especially since it effectively trivializes our identities because they're suddenly 'trendy.'""

""[W]hat they're doing is an appropriation of only the good (K-pop and food) without acknowledging the way our lives are still affected by all the racist, discriminatory, and historical baggage caused by the West (being used as pawns in an anti-communist agenda which led to the separation of our families, the negative effects of being constantly pressured to assimilate, legislative 'Othering,' etc. etc),"" Song added.

""So yeah, obviously it's pretty sus that a white person is saying they're Korean.""

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for London told Song that ""Oli has ... felt strongly attached to Korea and the Korean culture and feels much more connected to this than his own culture.""

""[Oli] hopes that people will accept and love [them] for who [they] is without judgment,"" the spokesperson added.

The Daily Dot reported Monday that comments flooded social media after London's proclamation.

One user wrote, ""As a Korean Queer, shut the f*** up.""

Another added, ""As a Korean this is really p***ing me off right now. Nationality is not that simple.""

""You may fetishize Koreans but you'll never be a Korean,"" another irate social media user snapped.

What else?

On Thursday, London further addressed the controversy in an Instagram post, writing:

""I just want to set the record STRAIGHT… It's Pride Month and I have always struggled with identity issues and been confused about who I am as a person. I took the difficult and brave decision to come out as Non-Binary and Korean to help millions of other LGBTQI+ young people around the world, Kpop fans and the Korean people feel confident enough to be able to feel no fear to be able to express themselves and how they identify.""

The influencer continued, ""In South Korea, there are millions of unrepresented LGBTQI+ people who are voiceless and who often face being ostracised from society and sometimes even being rejected by their own families, for being LGBTQI+. Being a member of the LGBT community in Korea, like in much of the world, is often met with hardships and rejection due to traditional and conservative viewpoints.""

""I wanted to be a beacon of light for these brave people and tell them it's okay to express themselves and it's okay to come out to the world with however you identify,"" London's post continued. ""Yes I identify as Korean. Yes I'm non-binary. Yes I look like Jimin. But none of this should be a reason to outcast me from society, to dehumanise me and shame me for being who I am, a non-binary Korean person.""

London concluded the post, ""I will never stop being the person I was born to be! Next time you decide to troll a person online and publicly shame them for their sexuality or identify- think about the consequences of your words. It costs nothing to be kind, to show respect and to spread love. Spread kindness this Pride month and let's come together to fight homophobia and allow all human beings the same equal rights regardless of how each one of us identify.""

Bold Iowa mom shows up at school board meeting dressed like drag performer to prove a point,"An Iowa mom and activist made a statement at a school board meeting by demanding answers about a drag performance hosted at the school, all while dressed like the drag performer.

Kimberly Reicks, a self-described ""accidental activist,"" appeared at the Ankeny School Board meeting on Monday night and demanded that the board apologize and pass a resolution ""to make sure that this doesn't happen again on school grounds.""

In May, Ankeny High School's Gay Straight Alliance hosted an after-school drag performance as part of an end-of-year meeting. The club invited drag performers from the Iowa Youth Parade Pageant to come and put on a show. School officials said the event was not authorized and organizers did not follow protocol in response to controversy after video of the wildly inappropriate performance went viral on social media.

Reicks turned heads Monday night by attending the school board meeting dressed in a revealing leotard similar to the one worn by the drag performer to highlight the inappropriateness of the performance.



""Where's the transparency in this?"" Reicks asked during public comments, according to the Des Moines Register. ""How are we going to entrust you — the board members — to do what is right for us parents and make sure that the kids know what is right?""

Standing next to Reicks was another activist with the group Freedom Over Fear, who held a sign, featuring pictures of the drag performer, that asked, ""Is it appropriate for an exotic dancer to seduce the children in our public schools?""

As she spoke, Reicks stepped back from the podium and removed her jacket and sweatpants to reveal the same outfit worn by the drag performer.

""I want to know: Does this outfit make you turn your head?"" she demanded of the board and the audience. ""Is this outfit appropriate for anybody here to see?""

""Because if this makes your head turn, if this p----s you off, then it should. Because this guy walked into our school, wearing exactly the same thing,"" she added, before a board member interrupted and asked her to keep her comments directed to the board.

Turning back to the board, Reicks said she was ""embarrassed to stand here with the outfit I have today. I want to prove that this outfit should not ever be accepted in our school any way.""

Reicks is the founder of Iowa Mama Bears, an organization that opposes COVID-19 mandates and LGBT indoctrination in schools. She has previously challenged the school district's masking policies and filed a lawsuit alleging officials retaliated against her. Her case has been appealed to the Iowa State Supreme Court.

She was present with Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) when the governor signed a law that banned mask mandates in Iowa schools, cities, and counties.

"Ireland clamping down harder on 'offensive' online content, making it easier secure convictions for 'hate crimes'","Ireland's Department of Justice is finalizing a new hate crime and hate speech law that will make it easier to secure prosecutions and convictions for crimes allegedly motivated by or judged to cause hate. Material that is sent or distributed (e.g., retweeted) and judged to be hateful will be dealt with under this law.

Helen McEntee, the Irish justice minister, indicated on July 13 that the new law, entitled the ""Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Crime"" bill, will legislate for hate crimes by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offenses, ""where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic, which would include disability, religion, color, sexual orientation and gender (including gender expression and identity).""



Whereas previously in Ireland, which made hate speech a crime in 1989, prosecutors would have to establish ""proof of someone's subjective motivation for committing an offense"" — ""what was in their mind at that exact moment"" — Ireland will now alternatively or additionally use a so-called demonstration test. Accordingly, a crime may qualify as a hate crime if directed toward a member of a protected group or a protected characteristic.



The Irish Mirror reported that ""all offences that were aggravated by a hate element will incur penalties that are higher than the ordinary form of the offense.""

A harassment charge, for example, can be upgraded to a hate crime if it was directed at a protected class of person (e.g., transsexuals) or if it can be shown that there were accompanying ""hostile or prejudiced slurs, gestures, other symbols or graffiti at the time of offending.""

The Irish Department of Justice (IDOJ) admitted that this change is intended to rectify past difficulties establishing ""motivation alone in proving hate crime offences.""

Critics have suggested that this would constitute a shift in the burden of proof from those levying accusations of hatred to those who were accused.

According to Ireland's National Police and Security Service, a hate crime is any ""criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person to, in whole or in part, be motivated by hostility or prejudice."" Perception, not intent, makes the crime.

If a criminal offense has not been committed, someone can still be accused of a ""hate incident,"" having done or said something legal that is perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice.

The government claimed that the law will ""contain robust safeguards for freedom of expression, such as protections for reasonable and genuine contributions to literary, artistic, political scientific or academic discourse."" However, it is not clear whether expressions of religious belief (e.g., statements opposing abortion or gay ""marriages"") will be protected or meet the threshold for ""criminal incitement to hatred,"" especially as it was omitted from the IDOJ's sample list.

In the early days of the legislation's development, the IDOJ issued a report indicating that ""good faith"" contributions to public debates would be permissible, but ""a broadcast or speech which is clearly designed to incite hatred, but is couched in polite or coded language, would be covered by the new offence.""

David Quinn, founder of the Christian advocacy group Iona Institute, argued in the Sunday Times earlier this year that this law would have a significant chilling effect on free speech and political discourse. He questioned whether a Raidió Teilifís Éireann 1 show that discussed transsexual issues, later accused by activist groups as having been ""unacceptable, triggering and extremely harmful,"" would have been found guilty of ""recklessness"" and therefore treated as a protracted hate crime.

Quinn also suggested that the law might criminalize debates on immigration along with critiques of Islam, such as those advanced by Richard Dawkins, landing such speakers in jail. McEntee's unwillingness to factor in the likelihood that the law would be greatly abused for socio-political ends may be ""a clear indication that neither she nor the government has a true commitment to free speech and that their intention is to limit the scope of public debate.""

An IDOJ spokesman told the Irish Times that ""a communication will not be taken to incite violence or hatred solely on the basis that it contains discussion or criticism – even if that might be offensive – of matters related to a protected characteristic.""

It is presently unclear what will distinguish ""offensive"" material from, as the bill puts it, ""extreme forms of hate speech that deliberately and recklessly incite or stir up acts of hostility, discrimination or violence.""

An Irish repeat of the 2005 Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy may, for instance, test whatever distinction the IDOJ will arrive at in the language of the new law.

On the one hand, the Jyllands-Posten images, evidently offensive to some, might have fit the criteria of protected speech alluded to in the IDOJ's revelations about the forthcoming law (i.e., as contributions to artistic and political debates). However, with the IDOJ's suggestion that the result contra intent may be a determining factor, in such a scenario, the cartoons might have constituted hate crimes in light of the Islamist riots that followed, which resulted in nearly 250 deaths.

In a recent RTE article, two academics from University College Cork indicated that this law will most likely to target the ""male working-class youth"" and is being supported by ""'progressive' leftist, feminist, anti-racist and LGBT+ political movements,"" who are ""putting their trust in the state and its juridical institutions to do justice.""

Recent hate speech laws elsewhere in the Anglosphere

Last year, Scotland passed the ""Hate Crime and Public Order Bill,"" which made it a crime to ""stir up hatred against protected groups.""

The law reportedly builds on an understanding expressed by Lord Bracadale in his review of existing hate crime legislation, whereby ""it would not be necessary for the prosecution to prove that there was an 'intent' on the part of an accused person to stir up hatred, rather that, having regards to all the circumstances, hatred in relation to a particular characteristic is 'likely to be stirred up thereby'.""

Critics of the legislation noted that in a country with various groups all holding different and often opposing views, the bill ""would undermine that freedom, most crucially among religious communities.""

The Glasgow Guardian reported that one among the groups and institutions that criticized the bill was the Christian Institute, which stated, ""Provisions on 'inflammatory material' could be used against Christian books, sermons by church ministers – even the Bible itself.""

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government — which passed the prescribed speech bill C-16 — is advancing Bills C-36 and Bill C-11. The latter is regarded by many as a ""censorship law."" Bill C-11 will update the country's Broadcasting Act and enable the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to regulate social media content created by Canadians.



Bill C-36, touted as a means of targeting online hate and extremism, would enable an accuser to take someone to court if they felt the accused had posted something hateful online.

Accordingly, ""A person may, with the Attorney General's consent, lay an information before a provincial court judge if the person fears on reasonable grounds that another person will commit ... an offence motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based"" on a multitude of grounds.

Much in the spirit of the forthcoming Irish law, C-36 amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to provide that ""it is a discriminatory practice to communicate or cause to be communicated hate speech by the means of the Internet or other means of telecommunication in a context in which the hate speech is likely to foment detestation or vilification of an individual or group of individuals on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.""

Reclaim the Net reported that this bill is similarly vague about what precisely constitutes ""hate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ireland-clamping-down-harder-on-offensive-online-content-making-it-easier-secure-convictions-for-hate-crimes,2022-10-05
"James Webb Space Telescope reveals stunning images of the universe, liberals lash out at 'homophobic telescope' and accuse NASA of memorializing 'queerphobia'","The first images from the James Webb Space Telescope were revealed on Tuesday. The unveiling of the first images from the largest and most advanced space telescope ever built was touted as ""revolutionary."" The James Webb Space Telescope captured the deepest and highest-resolution images ever taken of the universe. However, some liberals soured the spectacular achievement by disparaging the JWST as a ""homophobic telescope"" and accusing NASA of memorializing ""queerphobia.""

In 2002, NASA named the one-of-a-kind space telescope after former NASA administrator James Webb, who ran the fledgling space agency from 1961 to 1968 during the programs of Mercury, Gemini, and some of Apollo. Before NASA, Webb served as undersecretary of state in the U.S. Department of State during the Truman administration.

Critics accuse Webb of being complicit during the Lavender Scare – when government employees were fired for being gay in the 1950s and 1960s.



The Guardian reported, ""During Webb’s time as administrator, NASA employee Clifford Norton was fired in 1963 for 'immoral, indecent, and disgraceful conduct' after being interrogated on suspicion of homosexuality. Norton later successfully sued for wrongful dismissal.""

Current NASA administrator Bill Nelson said, ""We have found no evidence at this time that warrants changing the name of the James Webb Space Telescope.""

NASA press secretary Jackie McGuinness said, ""NASA's History Office conducted an exhaustive search through currently accessible archives on James Webb and his career. Our historians also talked to experts who previously researched this topic extensively. NASA found no evidence at this point that warrants changing the name of the telescope.""

Astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi declared in January 2021, ""Naming a flagship space observatory after Webb is a fitting recognition of his contributions to NASA science, even if he was just an administrator.""

""On the specific allegations against Webb, the evidence is clear,"" Oluseyi argued. ""He was not the initiator of the Lavender Scare and he was not in charge of investigating allegations of 'homosexuality' or deciding the fate of accused individuals.""

John Logsdon – a historian with George Washington University who knew Webb – told NPR, ""I don't think he took any particular actions that were unacceptable at the time. But in this new 'woke' world, they probably wouldn't be acceptable."" He noted that Webb was ""a product of the value system of his time.""

A petition was launched earlier this year demanding that NASA rename the James Webb Space Telescope. The petition has been signed by more than 1,700 people, who are mostly in the astronomy community.



The website INTO – a ""space for the queer community to talk openly"" – published an article titled: ""Homophobic Telescope Reveals First Hi-Res Images of Deep Space."" The article, which was republished on MSN, stated, ""But despite this remarkable achievement for science, the JWST continues to stand as a bitter reminder of our country’s willingness to tolerate and even memorialize queerphobia.""

Astrophysicist Lisa Harvey-Smith described Webb as ""a zealot who drove LGBT+ employees out of NASA, by all accounts.""

Astrophysicist Sarah Tuttle claimed, ""When your field is homophobic, not only does it actively harm people - it warps your science!""

Chanda Prescod-Weinstein – an assistant professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire who uses the self-description of queer/agender/woman/she – tweeted, ""As one of the people who has been leading to push to change the name, today feels bittersweet, I’m so excited for the new images and so angry at NASA HQ. NASA leadership has stubbornly refused to acknowledge that what is now public info about JW’s legacy means he does not merit having a great observatory named after him.""



Telescopes are often named after famous astronomers such as Edwin Hubble and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. However, four astronomers want to rename the JWST as the Harriet Tubman Space Telescope because she ""almost certainly used the North Star"" to ""navigate her way to freedom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/james-webb-space-telescope-controversy-name,2022-07-14
"LGBT hero who became first legal nonbinary person renounces 'sham' transgender life, becomes man again","In 2016, Jamie Shupe, a biological male, made international headlines after an Oregon judge granted him legal status as a ""nonbinary"" person, legally shedding gender designations that he felt oppressed his true identity as a woman. He had become the first American granted this legal status.

Just three years later, Shupe has renounced his former life, which he now characterizes as a ""sham.""

In a personal essay published in the Daily Signal, Shupe, an Army veteran, recounted his story beginning with his longtime struggle with gender dysphoria to his overnight ascension as a ""liberal media darling"" after his major court win in 2016.

What did Shupe say?

Shupe said he now attributes his former gender confusion to post-traumatic stress disorder, ""severe mental health crisis"" in 2013, and childhood trauma. In the essay, he laments how ""out-of-control, transgender activism"" enabled the medical community to indulge his gender fantasies amid a temporary life crisis, a problem he believes is becoming more widespread.

""The best thing that could have happened would have been for someone to order intensive therapy,"" Shupe wrote. ""[Instead, the doctors] just kept helping me to harm myself.""

Shupe said his landmark court win landed him ""instant fame within the LGBT community."" But after he publicly stated his support for President Donald Trump's transgender military troop ban and his opposition to the ""sterilization and mutilation of gender-confused children,"" Shupe explained his fame dissipated almost overnight.

""Overnight, I went from being a liberal media darling to a conservative pariah,"" Shupe said. ""The truth is that my sex change to nonbinary was a medical and scientific fraud.""

In fact, Shupe said his historic legal victory was also fraudulent because the presiding judge had a transgender child.

""I now believe that she wasn't just validating my transgender identity. She was advancing her child's transgender identity, too,"" Shupe said.

What gender is Shupe now?

In January, Shupe said he renounced his nonbinary life to reclaim his true biological identity as he was ""unable to advance the fraud for another single day.""

""The weight of the lie on my conscience was heavier than the value of the fame I'd gained from participating in this elaborate swindle,"" he wrote. ""Two fake gender identities couldn't hide the truth of my biological reality. There is no third gender or third sex. Like me, intersex people are either male or female. Their condition is the result of a disorder of sexual development, and they need help and compassion.""

""I played my part in pushing forward this grand illusion. I'm not the victim here. My wife, daughter, and the American taxpayers are— they are the real victims,"" he explained.

Anything else?

At press briefing Jean-Pierre discusses coming out as gay,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre kicked off a press briefing on Tuesday by recognizing ""National Coming Out Day"" and briefly discussing her experience coming out as gay to her family.

""So today is National Coming Out Day, and so I wanted to start by sharing my own coming out story,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""Like so many in the LGBTQ community coming out wasn't an easy thing to do. My family was traditional and conservative. Being gay in my family wasn't something that you mention out loud or celebrated. But my family like many, many other families grew to accept who I was. They saw that who I loved didn't change who I was as a person.""

Jean-Pierre said that she is ""so honored to serve the president and the First Lady, who have stood with the LGBTQ community for many years, and will continue to stand with all those who come out.""

Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre www.youtube.com

During an interview earlier this year with USA Today, Jean-Pierre noted that her mom was distraught when she came out.



""It devastated her,"" Jean-Pierre told the outlet. ""She hated – hated – the fact that I was gay or hated the fact that I said that to her. And it destroyed her."" She also noted, ""my mom loves my partner, my mom loves my kid, and my mom loves me – and has always loved me – but she loves everything about me now.""

The White House Twitter account also celebrated the LGBT movement on Tuesday. ""On National Coming Out Day, the Biden-Harris Administration celebrates the courage of the LGBTQI+ community and reaffirms that LGBTQI+ rights are human rights,"" a tweet read.

Vice President Kamala Harris also marked the day. ""I celebrate our LGBTQI+ community this National Coming Out Day. Never doubt that you are loved and appreciated for being exactly who you are,"" a tweet on the @VP Twitter account stated.

Jeff Goldblum slammed for Islam questions on RuPaul's Drag Race,"Hollywood actor Jeff Goldblum is facing liberal backlash on social media after he asked a question about Islam while appearing on ""RuPaul's Drag Race.""

""RuPaul's Drag Race"" is a VH1 reality TV show where host RuPaul Charles leads asearch for ""America's next drag superstar."" On the most recent episode that aired on Friday, Goldblum was a guest judge for the drag queen competition.

One of the competitions was for contestants to do a stars and stripes-themed runway walk. Contestant Darius Rose, who goes by the performance name of ""Jackie Cox,"" wore an American flag-inspired outfit with red and white stripes, as well as a blue hijab with silver stars.

Goldblum asked Cox, ""Are you religious, may I ask?""

'I'm not,"" Cox, who is Iranian-Canadian, replied. ""To be honest, this outfit really represents the importance that visibility for people of religious minorities need to have in this country.""

The ""Jurassic Park"" actor then followed up with a question asking if homosexuality and feminism are compatible with Islam.

Goldblum asked, ""Isn't this an interesting wrinkle though? Is there something in that religion that is anti-homosexuality and anti-woman? Does that complicate the issue?""

""I'm just raising it and thinking out loud and maybe being stupid,"" Goldblum tacked on a disclaimer to his queries, possibly realizing at that moment that he had made a mistake by simply asking a legitimate question.

RuPaul attempted to defuse the potential tinderbox moment by saying, ""I think drag has always shaken the tree, so to speak. And there are so many different layers to this presentation, and if it was ever going to be done, this is the stage to do it.""

""It's a complex issue,"" Cox replied. ""I have my own misgivings about the way LGBT people are treated in the Middle East. And at the same time, I am one. What is so important to me that if you just happen to be different, then live that truth.""



Goldblum's questions were lambasted on social media, with dozens of commenters calling the inquiries ""Islamophobic."" Some said he was ""demonizing Muslims."" Other people responded by referencing the relationship between Christianity and homosexuality.

Cox also said that President Donald Trump's 2017 ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States"" travel ban barring foreign visitors from entering the U.S. had ""really destroyed a lot of my faith in this country.""

""When the Muslim ban happened, it really destroyed a lot of my faith in this country. And really hurt my family. And that's so wrong to me,"" Cox tearfully explained on the runway. ""And that's so wrong to me. And I had to show America that you can be LGBT and from the Middle East and there's gonna be complicated s**t around that. That's OK. I'm here, and I deserve to be an American just as much as anyone else.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jeff-goldblum-rupaul-islam-backlash,2020-04-26
'Abolitionist' professor says 9/11 was attack on 'heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems' that benefit white people,"Dr. Jenn Jackson, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, triggered an avalanche of backlash after claiming Friday the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an attack on ""heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems"" that ""white Americans fight to protect.""

Jackson's website biography reads, ""Jenn M. Jackson (they/them) is a queer genderflux androgynous Black woman, an abolitionist, a lover of all Black people, and an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University in the Department of Political Science.""

What did Jackson say?

Jackson published a series of tweets Friday that vocalized her problems with how ""white pundits and correspondents"" talk about 9/11, and the impact those tragic events had on America.

""It's twenty years since 9/11 and I'm still really disturbed by how many white pundits and correspondents talk about it,"" Jackson began. ""I'm watching [White House chief of staff on 9/11] Andy Card and [Former Homeland Security Secretary] Jeh Johnson on MSNBC. Card just said that 9/11 was the first time that Americans ever felt fear. He said that it was the last morning we woke up without fear and that the 'terrorists' succeeded in introducing us to fear.""

""White Americans might not have really felt true fear before 9/11 because they never felt what it meant to be accessible, vulnerable, and on the receiving side of military violence at home. But, white Americans' experiences are not a stand-in for 'America,'"" Jackson continued. ""Plenty of us Americans know what it's like to experience fear and we knew before 9/11. For a lot of us, we know fear *because* of other Americans.""

""We have to be more honest about what 9/11 was and what it wasn't. It was an attack on the heteropatriarchal capitalistic systems that America relies upon to wrangle other countries into passivity. It was an attack on the systems many white Americans fight to protect,"" Jackson added.

""We have to be clear that the same motivations that animated America's hypervigilance and responsiveness to 'terror' after 9/11 are now motivating the carceral state and anti-immigration policy,"" Jackson said.

What was the response?

Jackson's remarks generated a mountain of criticism and mockery, which pointed out that Islamic fundamentalists are certainly not motivated by femenist or pro-LGBT ideology.



""This is the kind of disturbing rubbish people spout when they see the world through a lens of identity politics. We need to reverse the long march through the institutions,"" one person said.

""Yes, the fundamentalist Islamic men were attacking 'heteropatriarch capitalist systems' because fundamentalist Islam is a very pro feminist pro LGBT ideology you absolute doorknob,"" another person said.

""What a race-hustling hatemonger Jenn Jackson is,"" another person said.

""SU has a professor on staff, Jenn Jackson, that's clearly a racist and has zero empathy for what took place on 9/11. Look at what she tweeted yesterday of all days. Every SU alumni should be disgusted with who SU is willing to employ and keep employed,"" another person said.

""The language of wokeism… it uses colorful, smart & complicated sounding phrases tossed into a word salad and mixed with emotional expressions so you can't deconstruct the nonsense. Jenn Jackson is a poster child of a crazy person acting as a paid pseudo intellectual,"" one person said.

""If it's one thing Islamic terrorists hate it's the 'heteropatriarchy,"" one person mocked.

""Yes, Al Qaeda is well known for it's feminist and pro-LGBTQ+ activism,"" another person mocked.

""Let me make sure I am getting this correct... The 9/11 attack by arguably the most heteropatriarchal people on earth was orchestrated because of America heteropatriarchal systems? I'm sure the female & LGBTQ execs who died in the Twin Towers would love this hot take,"" another person said.

""oh yes, the people behind 9/11 are known for their liberal views and dismantling of heteropatriarchal systems. just ask all the girls who want to go to school or drive over there,"" one person said.

After Jackson's tweets began generating attention online, she ""locked"" her Twitter account, which means that people who were not following her before cannot see her tweets now.

'There’s a war going on': Jeremy Clarkson of 'Top Gear' calls out the radical left's attack on normalcy and free speech,"Jeremy Clarkson of ""Top Gear"" fame faces further risk of cancellation over a December column in which he ridiculed former actress Meghan Markle. It appears he has decided to go out swinging, although his target is of much greater significance this time around.

The 62-year-old Briton penned an opinion piece over the weekend in the Sunday Times concerning his son's recent claim ""there's a war going on.""

The war his son was referencing was not that waged by Russia against Ukraine but the one allegedly afoot in the United Kingdom — in fields and streets, hills and landing grounds previously thought unconquered. The apparent enemy: the radical left, keen to ""unstitch and burn the fabric of Britain.""

Unlike militant socialists of old — Clarkson named British trade unionist Arthur Scargill as an example —, the leftists on the frontlines today allegedly hide ""in the impenetrable shadow of anonymity, inventing new rules to ensnare anyone and everyone them deem to be unworthy.""

While these leftists may conceal their intentions, Clarkson suggested their impact is far-reaching and unmistakable, citing as proofs the apparent ideological capture of television and radio, big business, and the education system in the U.K.

""When was the last time you saw a fictional police force hunting a gang of Muslim extremists? It's always the far right. ... Make a joke about she/him pronouns or Greta Thunberg, and they'll blow a piece of tumbleweed across the stage,"" he wrote.

Clarkson knows a great deal about the expurgation of nonconforming thought and thinkers from the British media — given his recent and forthcoming cancellations.

The former ""Top Gear"" presenter wrote a comedic column in December stating that he hated Markle on a ""cellular level,"" and — in a reference to a scene from ""Game of Thrones"" — quipped that he wouldn't mind seeing ""people throwing lumps of excrement at her.""

On another occasion, Clarkson wrote that he wanted to ""shoot a polar bear in the middle of its face"" after Markle, whom he referred to as a ""silly little cable TV actress,"" told commoners not to drive their automobiles.

Despite Clarkson offering a ""mea culpa with bells on,"" several members of parliament accused him of hate speech and called for his removal from the nation's television screens.

Variety reported last week that Amazon will likely not be working with Clarkson on future seasons of ""The Grand Tour"" and ""Clarkson's Farm.""

The Daily Mail noted that he might also get the axe by ITV, thereby losing his gig hosting ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""

In his opinion piece, Clarkson posed the questions, ""Who's doing the erasing? Who's making the rules? That's just it. We don't have a clue. What we do know is that, having taken control of the television stations, without a shot being fired, they turned their attention, like any conquering army, to the schools.""



Clarkson suggested that the leftists who successfully took over British schools ""went fully Pol Pot, doing a comprehensive year-zero job on the curriculum so that kids would know their parents were all racists. Apart from those with 'unconscious bias.' Who were racists as well.""

""You probably think, because you don’t know this war is going on, that when you drop little Johnny off at the school gates he’s going to learn the nine times table that day,"" wrote Clarkson. ""No, he isn’t. He’s learning that he might actually be a girl, which is why there are probably tampon dispensers in the boys’ lavatories.""

According to Clarkson, not only have schools, workplaces, and the media been conquered by the ideological peers of the Khmer Rouge but the British police, if not on board with these ideologies, is at least now deferential.

""Young people with green hair"" are free to partake in iconoclasm or glue themselves to roads. However, a young woman with Asperger's syndrome who posted rap lyrics containing the N-word is fitted with ""an ankle bracelet and a curfew order and made [to] pay £500 in costs as well as an £85 victim surcharge.""

""We’ve now reached a point where the leader of the opposition is so boxed in and frightened that for a while he could not answer when asked if a woman could have a penis,"" added Clarkson, concluding, ""There really is an army with the ability to remove from public life anyone who disagrees with its increasingly militant viewpoint.""

Jerry Seinfeld defends Kevin Hart in Oscars controversy,"Legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld stepped up in a big way for fellow funny man Kevin Hart, implying that the Academy Awards are worse off since Hart backed out of hosting the program when outrage erupted over some of Hart's past tweets that were called homophobic.

""Kevin is in a position, because he is a brilliant comedian, to kind of decide what he wants to do,"" Seinfeld told host Willie Geist in a video interview for ""Sunday Today"" on NBC. ""He doesn't have to step down. But he can.""

'Who got screwed in that deal?'



Seinfeld added, ""And when you look at that situation, well, who got screwed in that deal? I think Kevin's gonna be fine ... but ... find another Kevin Hart? That's not so easy. He's a brilliant guy with a movie career.""

No replacement has been named to host the Oscars, The Hollywood Reporter said.

""We have been navigating these slalom gates forever,"" Seinfeld observed with a skiing analogy, noting comedians are expected to be ""the most agile"" when it comes to working around verbal dos and don'ts.

""Look, when I started out ... there were dirty comedians ... 'Well, if you want to get on ""The Tonight Show"" or if you wanna get on TV, you can't use any of those words. All those words are out.' And a lot of us went, 'OK. I still wanna play. I'll play.' 'Oh, here's a new rule ... we're cutting this out.' 'OK. I'll get around that.' So, that's our thing,"" he told Geist. ""It's like Lindsey Vonn: Wherever you put the gates, I'm going to make 'em. I'm gonna make the gates ... That's the gig.""

What's the background?



After Hart's tweets from 2009 to 2011 resurfaced last week, he posted an Instagram video saying the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences demanded he apologize for his past comments or they would find a new host.

""I chose to pass on the apology,"" Hart said in the clip. ""The reason why I passed is because I've addressed this several times. This is not the first time this has come up. I've addressed it. I've spoken on it. I've said where the rights and wrongs were. I've said who I am now versus who I was then. I've done it. I'm not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I've moved on and I'm in a completely different place in my life.""

But after the controversy kept up, Hart announced on Twitter that he was backing out of hosting the Oscars because he didn't want to be a distraction to the ceremony — and he also apologized to the LGBT community for his past comments.

Who else stepped up for Hart?

In addition to Seinfeld, actor Nick Cannon also came to Hart's defense, pointing out on Twitter what appeared to be past homophobic tweets by liberal comedians Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer, and Chelsea Handler — and then wondering why they apparently are facing no consequences for them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jerry-seinfeld-defends-kevin-hart,2018-12-13
JK Rowling's agency refuses to bow down to writers who demanded 're-education' on LGBT issues,"British author J.K. Rowling found herself embroiled in controversy earlier this month after she affirmed traditional views of sex and gender.

Now, four authors who were represented by the same literary agency as Rowling have resigned in protest after they demanded the company ""re-educate"" its staff.

According to the Guardian, Fox Fisher, Drew Davies, and Ugla Stefanía Kristjönudóttir Jónsdóttir, who is also known as Owl Fisher, all resigned from the Blair Partnership, the London-based literary agency that represents Rowling. A fourth author also resigned, but reportedly did not go public.

The authors demanded the agency ""reaffirm their commitment to transgender rights and equality."" But the authors wrote in a joint statement the agency did not cave to their demands, so they chose to resign.

In response, the Blair Partnership said it supports free speech and chose not to be coerced by their now-former clients.

A spokesperson for the agency said, per the Guardian:

We support the rights of all of our clients to express their thoughts and beliefs, and we believe in freedom of speech. Publishing and the creative arts are dependent on these things. It is our duty, as an agency to support all of our clients in this fundamental freedom and we do not comment on their individual views.



We are disappointed by the decision that four clients have taken to part ways with the agency. To reiterate, we believe in freedom of speech for all; these clients have decided to leave because we did not meet their demands to be re-educated to their point of view. We respect their right to pursue what they feel is the correct course of action.



We value all our authors' voices and, as an agency, champion equality and inclusivity. We remain committed to making the agency the most welcoming environment it can be for everyone. The diversity of our clients' voices is our strength and we take enormous pride from each and every one.

While Rowling has not publicly commented on the controversy involving her representation, she did address criticism after speaking out against far-left transgender advocacy.

She wrote in a lengthy personal essay that transgender advocacy has come to a place where it now often harms women.

""I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman — and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones — then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside,"" Rowling said.

""That is the simple truth,"" she declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-agency-refuses-to-bow-down-to-outrage-mob-which-demanded-re-education-on-lgbt-issues,2020-06-23
"J.K. Rowling exposes hypocritical intolerance of trans activists who threatened her with rape, death, pipebomb","Author J.K. Rowling exposed Monday the absurdity of some activists who demand tolerance for LGBT people, yet invoke intolerance for those, like Rowling, who disagree with some aspects of LGBT ideology.

What are the details?

According to the ""Harry Potter"" author, trans activists have targeted Rowling with threats of rape and death. One activist angered by Rowling's refusal to acquiesce to the radical trans activism even appeared to threaten Rowling with a pipe bomb.

Rowling posted a screenshot of a tweet from the now-deleted Twitter account ""@queerqegaard"" that said, ""I wish you a very nice pipebomb in mailbox."" In response, Rowling highlighted the hypocritical intolerance of radical LGBT activists who demand no dissent to their ideology.

""To be fair, when you can't get a woman sacked, arrested or dropped by her publisher, and cancelling her only made her book sales go up, there's really only one place to go,"" Rowling said.

In response to a question of whether the threat was sent because of her position on trans women using women's bathrooms, Rowling explained, ""Yes but now hundreds of trans activists have threatened to beat, rape, assassinate and bomb me I've realised that this movement poses no risk to women whatsoever.""

What is the background?

Rowling is no stranger to harassment by LGBT activists online.

The billionaire author became the target of backlash when she publicly supported a woman who was fired for declaring that biological sex is, in fact, real.

""Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who'll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?"" Rowling tweeted in December 2019.

Rowling again affirmed biological gender last year, resulting in attempts to ""cancel"" her.

Social justice warriors cancel 'Harry Potter' author J.K. Rowling because she affirmed biological gender,"British author J.K. Rowling, known for writing the world famous ""Harry Potter"" books, triggered an avalanche of controversy over the weekend for affirming scientific views of gender and sex.

Although Rowling supports LGBT people, she said that maintaining the biological structure of gender and sex is vitally important — especially for LGBT people.

""If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction. If sex isn't real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn't hate to speak the truth,"" Rowling wrote.

""The idea that women like me, who've been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they're vulnerable in the same way as women — ie, to male violence — 'hate' trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences — is a nonsense,"" she continued.

""I respect every trans person's right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them. I'd march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans. At the same time, my life has been shaped by being female. I do not believe it's hateful to say so,"" the author added.

What was the response?

Rowling's comments went viral and generated more than 50,000 replies. One thing is clear: people are angry with Rowling's affirmation of science.

Literally NO ONE said the concept of sex or womxn is erased. The only thing erased here is YOU erasing the legitimacy of trans folks. Please reconsider where you stand here, for trans folks and for so many who used to idolize you,"" one person responded.

""As a physician, I want people to know that sex exists on a bimodal biological spectrum just like gender exists on a bimodal sociological spectrum. While most identify as either female or male, there are intersex and trans individuals whose identities are just as valid and real,"" another person responded.

""The vast consensus of medical and other scientific experts validate trans people and urge affirmation of us. Your own country's medical organizations have said as much. You don't love trans people, and certainly don't care about us,"" another person said.

""Truly pathetic that in the midst of huge outcry against police brutality and the unjust killings of black people by authorities, you choose to use your gargantuan platform and influence to attack a vulnerable minority?"" another person told Rowling.

""I feel heartbroken for every trans kid who grew up on Harry Potter, only to find out the author of their beloved childhood books is such a transphobic bigot,"" another person said.

""Just want to add my valuable 2 cents here: F**k JK Rowling. Thanks for listening. #JKRowlingIsOverParty,"" another person said.

But not everyone was angry with Rowling — ironically transgender people.

Blare White, a transgender person, replied, ""Facts. I only see facts.""

""Trans people appreciate @jk_rowling's courage in speaking out against an authoritarian ideology that oppresses women, gay people and trans people. We need to return to reality. Sex is real and it is immutable,"" another transgender person said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-sex-gender-controversy,2020-06-07
JK Rowling shuts down trans activist with perfect two-word response that goes mega-viral,"Author J.K. Rowling went viral on Sunday after responding to a transgender activist who attacked her without provocation.

What is the background?

On Sunday, Rowling criticized Scottish politicians for issuing groveling apologies after they participated in a demonstration in which at least one person had a ""decapitate TERFs"" sign, the Glasgow World reported.

""A strange new form of temporary blindness has broken out among Scottish politicians,"" Rowling tweeted. ""None of them could read placards calling for violence against women while standing inches away from them, yet they were instantly cured when photos of them posing with the signs hit the press.""

In response, trans activist India Willoughby claimed the ""decapitate TERFs"" sign did not exist and said that Rowling does not ""represent women."" Then Willoughby took a direct shot at Rowling.

""I’m more of a woman than JK Rowling will ever be,"" Willoughby claimed.

How did Rowling respond?

Willoughby's claim — that as a biological male Willoughby is more of a woman than Rowling, who is a biological woman — quickly caught the ""Harry Potter"" author's attention.

Rowling responded with just two words.

""Citation needed,"" she said.

The response generated nearly 140,000 ""likes"" and more than 16 million views by Monday afternoon.

Rowling is a regular target for trans activists because she has repeatedly made it clear that she opposes progressive trans ideology on the grounds that it erases the legitimacy of women.

Trans activists accuse Rowling of being a TERF, which stands for ""trans-exclusionary radical feminist."" Even dictionary.com defines the label negatively, saying that TERF refers to ""an advocate of radical feminism who believes that a trans woman’s gender identity is not legitimate and who is hostile to the inclusion of trans people and gender-diverse people in the feminist movement.""

Anything else?

Willoughby later celebrated that Willoughby's rhetorical attack on Rowling drew the billionaire author's attention, as well as the attention of comedian Ricky Gervais.

Posting a screenshot of Rowling's reply, which showed that Gervais had ""liked"" Rowling's response, Willoughby wrote, ""It’s insane that my existence annoys two people on Twitter who between them have a combined Twitter following of 30 million people! That’s nuts, isn’t it?""

"JK Rowling talks trans debate, gender reassignment surgery","British author J.K. Rowling has called for an end to the ""climate of fear"" regarding the debate about transgender individuals in a new interview that is certain to spur an uproar.

""Many are afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs and even for their personal safety,"" Rowling said in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine. ""This climate of fear serves nobody well, least of all trans people.""

Since Rowling has been speaking her mind on the trans debate, she has received harsh condemnation as well as death and rape threats. But the 55-year-old writer alleges that ""more than 90 percent of the letters and emails have been supportive.""

""My correspondence have included medical staff, social workers, prison workers, workers in women's refuges, and members of the LGBT community, including trans people,"" Rowling claimed.

""I believe everybody should be free to live a life that is authentic to them, and that they should be safe to do so,"" the ""Harry Potter"" author said. ""I also believe that we need a more nuanced conversation around women's rights and around the huge increase in numbers of girls and young women who are seeking to transition.""



Rowling claimed to have received ""heartbreaking letters"" from young women, who ""regret the irreversible surgeries they've undertaken."" She said these stories from women regretting their irreversible gender reassignment surgery ""need to be told.""

This follows the Keira Bell case in Britain, where the 23-year-old sued the British National Health Service's gender-identity youth clinic for prescribing her puberty blockers at the age of 16. Bell blamed the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the U.K'.s only gender identity development service for children, for not doing enough to ""challenge"" her decision to transition to a male.

Earlier this month, the judges' ruling stated, ""It is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers.""

""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers,"" the judges said.

""In respect of young persons aged 16 and over, the legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment,"" the ruling read.



Bell had a double mastectomy at age 20 with hopes to ""achieve happiness."" When the surgery didn't bring joy, Bell began to de-transition last year, describing the situation by saying, ""It was heartbreaking to realize I'd gone down the wrong path.""

Rowling has had a history of weighing in on trans issues. In September, transgender activists called Rowling a ""transphobe"" for writing about a character in one of her books that was a cross-dressing serial killer.

Over the summer, Rowling was heavily criticized for saying that hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgeries are too often over-prescribed.

The author penned a lengthy essay detailing how she was allegedly targeted by the transgender lobby.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-trans-debate-gender-surgery,2020-12-10
'Dictionary and a backbone': JK Rowling unleashes on British politician for refusing to define what is a woman,"Author J.K. Rowling punched back at a British politician on Tuesday who — on International Women's Day — refused to define what is a woman.

What is the background?

Transgender advocates believe Rowling is an enemy of their movement because the ""Harry Potter"" author affirms the biological structure of sex and gender and believes that transgender ideology delegitimizes women.

In fact, Rowling believes that if biological gender is not real — and only a social construct like some LGBT activists claim — then ""the lived reality of women globally is erased."" Rowling has repeated her beliefs several times in recent years, and, just last November, she vowed never to stop defending biological women's sex-based rights.

What did Rowling say now?

On Tuesday, Rowling criticized Anneliese Dodds, chair of the UK Labour Party and shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, for refusing to define what constitutes a ""woman"" in a BBC interview.

When asked to define what is a ""woman,"" Dodds said there are ""different definitions"" and claimed ""it does depend what the context is surely.""

""Someone please send the Shadow Minister for Equalities a dictionary and a backbone,"" Rowling responded, adding the hashtag ""#HappyInternationalWomensDay.""

Rowling then mocked Dodds in direct response to a video the British lawmaker posted for International Women's Day. ""This morning you told the British public you literally can't define what a woman is. What's the plan, lift up random objects until you find one that rattles?"" Rowling said.

Rowling also said, ""Apparently, under a Labour government, today will become We Who Must Not Be Named Day.""

Then, in response to someone who challenged Rowling about her legacy, Rowling said she plans to forever defend women's rights.

""Yes, sweetheart. I'm staying right here on this hill, defending the right of women and girls to talk about themselves, their bodies and their lives in any way they damn well please,"" Rowling said. ""You worry about your legacy, I'll worry about mine.""

Rowling has been critically outspoken in recent days about Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which would further codify progressive transgender ideology in Scottish society. Specifically, Rowling believes the legislation ""will harm the most vulnerable women in society.""

""Multiple women’s groups have presented well-sourced evidence to [First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon's] government about the likely negative consequences of this legislation for women and girls, especially the most vulnerable. All has been ignored,"" Rowling said on Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-unleashes-on-british-politician-define-what-is-a-woman,2022-03-09
"Joe Biden got shamed for calling Mike Pence 'a decent guy,' and walked back the compliment","In the most recent example of the death of civility in politics, former Vice President Joe Biden was attacked on Twitter for simply calling current VP Mike Pence ""a decent guy.""

That's it. Decent. Possibly the most lukewarm compliment that can be paid to another person.

Biden's reference to Pence came Thursday at the Forum in Global Leadership at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.

Biden and Pence have been friendly with one another for quite some time, but in 2019 politics, that sort of bipartisan politeness is apparently unacceptable. Biden was quickly attacked by people who accused him of supporting an anti-LGBTQ figure in Pence.

""You've just called America's most anti-LGBT elected leader 'a decent guy,'"" said former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon to Biden on Twitter. ""Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community.""

""You're right, Cynthia,"" Biden replied. ""I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage. But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President.""

Pence is often targeted by liberal voters and politicians as anti-LGBTQ, which really means he adheres to the traditional Christian beliefs on gender and sexuality. Biden has been able to maintain a positive relationship with Pence despite their ideological disagreements (imagine that), but for some Democrats, that sort of friendliness is disqualifying.



""Nothing better exemplifies why Joe Biden has zero chance of winning the Democratic Primary,"" wrote one user on Twitter.

""Sorry Joe. This is disturbing. And disqualifying,"" wrote another. ""I hope you're willing to go out and campaign hard for the Democratic nominee.""

Biden's incident wasn't the only example of a liberal getting chastised for being nice to someone across the aisle. CNN's Van Jones spoke at CPAC about criminal justice reform, giving credit to conservatives for spearheading the effort that led to the First Step Act. Liberals were not pleased.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-got-shamed-into-apologizing-for-calling-mike-pence-a-decent-guy,2019-03-01
Joe Biden suggests President Trump is responsible for violent deaths of black transgender women,"Former Vice President Joe Biden suggested that President Donald Trump's administration is responsible for the violent deaths of black transgender women.

Biden — who holds a 19-point lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — made his claim during a speech to the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday, CNN reported.

""We've already had five, just this year, five black transgender women killed violently in 2019,"" Biden said. ""It's outrageous. It must, it must, it must end.""

And as the crowd applauded, Biden broke in with a stern declaration: ""And the fastest way to end it is, end the Trump administration!"" Hoots and hollers and cheering followed.

The HRC — which bills itself as the largest LGBTQ advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States — listed seven black transgender women who died violent deaths so far this year.

What else did Biden say?

""This president, this White House has literally, literally a bully pulpit, is callously extending his power over the most vulnerable — implementing the most discriminatory policies like Muslim bans, turning away asylum seekers, putting children in cages,"" Biden added, according to CNN. ""And the current vice president uses religious freedom as an excuse to license discrimination. It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing.""

What has Trump said about the LGBTQ community?

Trump on Friday threw his support behind the LGBTQ community — the eve of Pride Month.

""As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,"" he said in a pair of tweets. ""My Administration has launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality and invite all nations to join us in this effort!""

A number of Twitter users got angry last month over ""LGBTQ for Trump"" T-shirts for sale on the president's 2020 campaign site, warning others with messages such as ""if anyone dares put on that 'LGBTQ for Trump' shirt, you should combust.""

Spotify deletes 70 episodes of 'The Joe Rogan Experience' as new racial slur controversy forces podcast host to issue apology: 'The most regretful and shameful thing I’ve ever had to talk about public,"Spotify quietly removed 70 episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast recently, according to a new report. The news was reported by JRE Missing – a website that automatically detects episodes of Rogan's podcast that have been purged from Spotify.

The deleted episodes feature a wide variety of guests such as progressive political commentator Kyle Kulinski, LGBT community activist Dan Savage, Vice Media founder Shane Smith, liberal podcaster Marc Maron, psychologist Stanley Krippner, MMA fighter Sam Sheridan, lifestyle guru Tim Ferriss, Tool singer Maynard James Keenan, ufologist Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, wellness company CEO Aubrey Marcus, director Kevin Smith, and actor Andy Dick.

There were also numerous episodes starring comedians that were taken down, including shows with Russell Peters, Theo Von, Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Christina Pazsitzky, Moshe Kasher, Pete Holmes, Amy Schumer, Dave Attell, Jim Norton, and Bill Burr.

Upon finding out that one of his episodes was deleted, Gad Saad – who is a professor, evolutionary behavioral scientist, Psychology Today writer, and author – wrote on Twitter, ""WTF?!""

Author and podcaster Michael Malice – who was a ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" guest six times – noted that Spotify deleted two episodes he appeared in. During a YouTube broadcast, Malice said he wasn't exactly sure why the shows were purged and that they both were recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic.

A possible reason for the mass deletion of pre-pandemic episodes could stem from a new controversy involving Rogan. This week, a compilation video went viral of Rogan saying the N-word in past podcasts. Rogan used the racial slur 24 times in the 23 resurfaced clips in episodes recorded years ago, well before his deal with Spotify.

Rogan issued an apology on Saturday morning for using the racial slur, calling it ""the most regretful and shameful thing I’ve ever had to talk about publicly.""

Rogan said the clips were taken ""out of context"" from ""12 years of conversations."" He explained that he was quoting other people in several instances of using the N-word.

“I know that to most people, there is no context where a white person is ever allowed to say that word, nevermind publicly on a podcast, and I agree with that now,"" Rogan said in an Instagram video. ""I haven’t said it in years. Instead of saying ‘the N-word,’ I would just say the word. I thought as long as it was in context, people would understand what I was doing.""

""It looks f***ing horrible. Even to me,"" he said.

""It’s a very unusual word, but it’s not my word to use,"" the comedian continued. ""I never used it to be racist, because I’m not racist, but whenever you’re in a situation where you have to say ‘I’m not racist,’ you’ve f***ed up, and I clearly have f***ed up.""

""I do hope that if anything this can be a teachable moment,"" Rogan added. ""I never thought it would be taken out of context and put in a video like that. Now that it is, holy s**t does it look bad.""





""Breaking Points"" host Saagar Enjeti – who has been a guest on ""The Joe Rogan Experience – declared, ""The effort to smear Joe Rogan as a racist is one of the most despicable efforts I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. They don’t actually care, they’re just trying to destroy him. We either live in a society where context matters or we don’t.""

Enjeti compared Rogan using the racial slur out of context to President Joe Biden quoting the N-word from a 1985 hearing.

""By their standard Joe Biden is a racist,"" Enjeti said.

In April, Spotify deleted roughly 40 episodes of Rogan's podcast. JRE Missing reported that a total of 113 episodes have been deleted since Joe Rogan signed a reported $100 million contract with the streaming giant.



Regarding certain episodes, Rogan said in March, ""There were a few episodes they didn't want on their platform, and I was like 'Okay, I don't care.'""

Previously, Rogan said Spotify's management ""haven't given me a hard time at all"" and they ""don't give a f***"" about the content and guests on his podcast.

Rogan and Spotify have faced heavy criticism in the past two weeks over claims of COVID-19 misinformation. The situation escalated when musicians threatened to remove their music libraries from Spotify, including Neil Young, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Joni Mitchell, India Arie, and Nils Lofgren.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-rogan-deleted-episodes-spotify,2022-02-05
Democrats demand John Wayne Airport change its name over iconic actor's controversial views,"Democrats in Orange County, California, want the county's Board of Supervisors to change the name of John Wayne Airport due to the iconic actor's ""white supremacist, anti-LGBT, and anti-Indigenous views,"" KCBS-TV reported.

What are the details?

The OC Democratic Party said Friday's resolution is part of a ""national movement to remove white supremacist symbols and names… [that produce] lasting physical and psychological stress and trauma, particularly to Black communities,"" the station said, adding that the resolution also calls for the reinstatement of the airport's original name, Orange County Airport.

County Democrats asked Fred Smoller — a Chapman University professor who's written about the issue — to speak to KCBS, and in a video interview he said that ""our John Wayne statue [in the airport] is Orange County's Confederate monument.""

Image source: KCAL-TV video screenshot

Smoller added to KCBS that ""the same way those monuments are coming down across the nation, I believe this monument should be removed and the airport returned to its original name which it had for 41 years, the Orange County Airport.""

Image source: KCAL-TV video screenshot

According its website, the airport ""was renamed by the Orange County Board of Supervisors on June 20, 1979, to honor the late John Wayne. To commemorate the Airport's namesake, the John Wayne Associates commissioned sculptor Robert Summers to create a bronze statue of 'The Duke.' The 9-foot statue, created at the Hoka Hey Foundry in Dublin, Texas, was dedicated to the County on November 4, 1982, and installed on a pedestal outside the Eddie Martin Terminal.""

What's the beef?



The station said county Democrats referred to Wayne's 1971 Playboy magazine interview as to why they want the airport's name changed.

In part of the interview, Wayne was told that activist Angela Davis ""claims that those who would revoke her teaching credentials on ideological grounds are actually discriminating against her because she's black. Do you think there's any truth in that?""

Wayne replied, ""With a lot of blacks, there's quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can't all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility. I don't believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.""

He also said, ""I don't feel guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago these people were slaves. Now, I'm not condoning slavery. It's just a fact of life, like the kid who gets infantile paralysis and has to wear braces so he can't play football with the rest of us. I will say this, though: I think any black who can compete with a white today can get a better break than a white man. I wish they'd tell me where in the world they have it better than right here in America.""

Speaking about Native Americans, Wayne said, ""I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them ... Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.""

And when asked what movies he would characterize as ""perverted,"" Wayne named 1969's ""Midnight Cowboy"" — which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight — and asked, ""Wouldn't you say that the wonderful love of those two men in Midnight Cowboy, a story about two f**s, qualifies?""

Anything else?

KCBS said airport officials have declined to comment and noted that it's up to the board of supervisors to decide on any name change.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-wayne-airport-name-change,2020-06-29
"'You sons of b***hes': Jordan Peterson refuses to bend the knee to 'toxic' Twitter, says he'd 'rather die' than delete tweet about transgender actor Elliot Page","Jordan Peterson faces a permanent ban on Twitter if he does not delete a tweet about transgender actor Elliot Page. The professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Toronto proclaimed that he would ""rather die"" than conform to Twitter's rules and delete the tweet in question.

Peterson's tweet posted on June 22 read: ""Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician.""

In the tweet, Peterson linked to an article titled: ""Elliot Page is ‘proud’ to introduce trans character on ‘Umbrella Academy.’""

The article highlighted a new Netflix show ""Umbrella Academy,"" where Page's character switches genders – much like the transgender actor did in 2020.

""The Rubin Report"" host Dave Rubin posted a screenshot of Peterson's tweet with the caption: ""The insanity continues at Twitter. @jordanbpeterson has been suspended for this tweet about Ellen Page. He just told me he will 'never' delete the tweet. Paging @elonmusk.""

Twitter said Peterson's tweet violated rules against hateful conduct.



Twitter’s hateful conduct policy states that users may not ""promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.""

""We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves,"" the policy notes. ""Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. This includes; women, people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual individuals, marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature and more harmful.""

""We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized,"" Twitter adds. ""For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category.""

Twitter suspended Peterson's account, and would not reinstate the account until he deleted the post about the transgender actor.

Peterson's daughter, Mikhalia Peterson, said Twitter is ""definitely not a free speech platform at the moment.""

The best-selling author defiantly responded to his Twitter suspension in a 14-minute-long YouTube video, during the diatribe he said he would not bend the knee to the ""toxic"" ""rat-hole"" social media platform.

“I’ve essentially been banned from Twitter as a consequence,"" Peterson said. ""I say ‘banned’ although technically I’ve been suspended. But the suspension will not be lifted unless I delete the hateful tweet in question, and I would rather die than do that. Hopefully, it will not come to that, although who the hell knows in these increasingly strange days.""

""Since Twitter did not do me the favor of actually specifying my crime – and there are many possibilities on that front – we, unfortunately, have to guess at why this has occurred,"" Peterson said. ""And that's actually a big problem in and of itself and also indicative of the utter carelessness of the Twitter organization with regard to the propriety of its own censorial actions.""

""I should at least know exactly what I did wrong if I'm required to acknowledge that my tweet violated the Twitter rules,"" he lashed out. ""What rules you sons of bitches? Exactly? Precisely? Because such things matter when the accusations start flying.""

Peterson explained, ""I don't regard pride as a virtue, it has been classically regarded as a sin.""

He questioned why it is called ""Pride Month"" and is not called ""LGBT+ month, or whatever else alphabet acronym which is currently insisted upon as the only acceptable enlightened terminology.""

Peterson theorized that referring to Elliot Page as her previous name ""Ellen Page"" was likely what got his Twitter account suspended.

""I committed the fatal crime of what has come to be known in the appalling censorial terminology of the insane activists as 'deadnaming,' which is the act of referring to someone who has transitioned – another hated piece of jargon and slogan –by the name and by the inference, the gender, really the sex, that everyone knew them by previously,"" he stated.

Peterson continued his rant, ""And how can I describe the fact that someone who was once a woman and really still is had her breasts cut off because she/he/they/their/they had fallen prey to a viciously harmful fad, without using the appropriate sex link pronoun and the real name of the real person to whom this was really done with his her their voluntary but unfortunate acquiescence.""



Peterson declared, ""I'm not taking down that tweet or acknowledging that my tweet violated the Twitter rules.""

""Up yours, woke moralists. We'll see who cancels who,"" he blasted. ""Twitter's a rat-hole in the final analysis. And I have probably contributed to that while trying to use, understand, and master that horrible, toxic platform.""

""It's a relief, in some real sense, to be banned,"" Peterson concluded. ""And I regard that under the present conditions as a badge of honor.""

Similarly, the satirical news website Babylon Bee was suspended from Twitter in March. The Babylon Bee was also suspended for ""hateful conduct"" for writing, ""The Babylon Bee's Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine.""

Levine – who is transgender – was named President Joe Biden's assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2021.

Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon proclaimed, ""We're not deleting anything. Truth is not hate speech. If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, then so be it.""

"'I Kissed Dating Goodbye' author attends Pride Parade after leaving Christian faith, announcing divorce from wife of 21 years","Joshua Harris — the former pastor and author of ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" — attended a Pride Parade in Vancouver, British Columbia, Sunday after grabbing headlines a month before by leaving his Christian faith and announcing that he and his wife of 21 years are divorcing.

Image source: Twitter

Pink News UK said Harris uploaded photos from the Pride Parade to his Instagram Story.

The Christian Post reported that Harris shared a photo of himself with Matthias Roberts, host of ""Queerology: A Podcast on Belief and Being,"" and gay rock singer Trey Pearson.

""Enjoyed swapping stories, gentleman!"" he wrote in the photo caption, the outlet said.

Pearson posted the same photo on Twitter:

Image source: Twitter

What's the background?

In July, Harris revealed on Instagram that he had ""undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus. The popular phrase for this is 'deconstruction,' the biblical phrase is 'falling away.' By all measurements that I have for defining a Christian, I am not a Christian.""

He also apologized to the LGBTQ community ""for the views that I taught in my books and as a pastor regarding sexuality. I regret standing against marriage equality, for not affirming you and your place in the church, and for any ways that my writing and speaking contributed to a culture of exclusion and bigotry.""

Not long before that Harris also said he and his wife are ""separating"" and that ""in recent years, some significant changes have taken place in both of us.""

In 2016, Harris apologized to Christians he hurt when he advised against dating in his best-selling 1997 book, ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye, calling it a ""huge mistake,"" the Christian Post reported.

How did LGBTQ community react to Harris at Pride Parade?

The day after Pearson posted the photo showing him at the Pride Parade with Roberts and Harris, he added some context.

""Joshua's book and purity culture was damaging to men and women,"" Pearson posted. ""The whole idea of that culture did a lot to me. Joshua was at Pride with his queer friends and I was happy to grab a beer with him, talk about his progression in faith, and his journey. He mostly wanted to hear mine.""

But at least one LGBTQ member wasn't happy.

""He has blood on his hands and doesn't belong at Pride until and unless he makes amends to those he's hurt over the years,"" one person reacted in reference to Harris. ""I am devastated to see you and Matthias supporting someone who's done so much harm because of one milquetoast apology that is obviously a remarketing attempt.""

Roberts appeared to apologize for the photo, saying Harris ""was already there. I was so interested to meet him, but should have thought more about how tweeting a photo would harm and retraumatize many. I'm so sorry. Everyone's anger and grief and disappointment in me is well placed.""

What are Christian leaders saying?

Heath Lambert of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville said a Harris-penned foreword would be removed from his book, ""Finally Free: Fighting for Purity with the Power of Grace,"" the Post reported.

""In 'Finally Free' I am trying to be clear about a Christian approach to sexuality,"" Lambert said, according to the outlet. ""Joshua's recent actions and statements only confuse that attempt at clarity and will lead others astray.""

""The Lord knows Joshua's heart,"" Lambert added. ""Was Joshua a Christianized unbeliever who never knew Christ? We do not know, but God does. Is he a Christian who has fallen into grievous sin, and is in need of restoration? We do not know, but God does. What we do know is that Joshua Harris is in absolute spiritual peril. He needs our love, and he needs our prayers. He has mine, and I trust he will have yours as well.""

The Gospel Coalition, from which Harris resigned in 2014, released a statement hoping Harris will return to the faith, the Post said.

""While we grieve Josh's decision (and have told him as much), we are not without hope (and we've told him that as well). We will continue to call on the God of sovereign mercy, the God Josh once extolled and the God who still sits on the throne,"" the organization said. ""We pray for our friend, for our churches, and for ourselves — that we may keep ourselves in the love of God (Jude 21), as God keeps us from stumbling (Jude 24).""

'The View' co-host forced to retract egregious accusation against Amy Coney Barrett: 'Sorry about that',"""The View"" co-host Joy Behar was forced to apologize on Tuesday after claiming one day earlier that Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett is a member of a ""hate group.""

What did Behar claim?

On Monday, the liberal commentator claimed that Coney Barrett's membership in religious group People of Praise is evidence that she belongs to a ""hate group.""

""Now, here’s my question. She is, you know, a religious person. She belongs to the People of Praise group, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled them a hate group, and their founder has questioned the so-called separation of church and state,"" Behar declared.

""They believe that sex should occur only within marriage and, of course, between a man and a woman. They’ve got very specific things that they believe,"" she added.

The remarks came as progressives demand Coney Barrett recuse herself from a case in which religious liberty and LGBT ideology clash. Critics have specifically cited Coney Barrett's connection to People of Praise as reason she must recuse herself.

But is what Behar claimed true?

The Southern Poverty Law Center, in fact, does not categorize People of Praise as a ""hate group.""

On Tuesday, she therefore retracted her previous claims defaming Coney Barrett and issued an apology. She claimed she had conflated People of Praise with another organization, but was vague about which exact organization that was.

""I have to clarify something I said yesterday,"" Behar said. ""I want to correct something I said on air when I stated that People of Praise had been deemed a hate group.

""I just got them mixed up with another group. It was inaccurate. So I don’t think that’s right that I should — I have to say, you know, sorry about that,"" she added. ""Anyway, I conflated them.""

When discussing Coney Barrett on Monday, ""The View"" co-host Sara Haines surprisingly disagreed with her co-hosts on the issue of Coney Barrett's recusal.

""I’m an avid LGBTQ ally and supporter and I believe in all of that, but I don’t think she should recuse herself for that very reason. This is not a religious opinion,"" she said.

""When you write these opinions they’re pages long. As the general public, we hear the headlines of the results, not how they got there,"" she explained. ""It’s kind of like a math problem. They have to cite and source every single part of what they do, and judges across this country go to work every day and have to set aside their personal beliefs.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-behar-apologizes-amy-coney-barrett,2022-11-30
"While mocking 'white anti-vaxxers,' Joy Reid blasts iconic guitarist Eric Clapton as a 'jerk' for his 'racist past' and pushing 'vaccine disinformation'","MSNBC's Joy Reid managed yet another over-the-top dramatic reading for the camera Monday, and this time it was for a segment titled ""The Absolute Worst.""

Never ye mind, also, the curious similarity to the ""Worst Person in the World"" segment Keith Olbermann peddled before he departed MSNBC in disgrace many moons ago.

What did Reid say?

The far-left host of ""The ReidOut"" got in the virtual face of iconic guitarist Eric Clapton, whom she accused of pushing ""vaccine disinformation."" Reid also was none too pleased that Clapton donated a van and money ""to British anti-vax group Jam for Freedom.""

She also ripped Clapton's already well-known stances on COVID-19 vaccines and lockdowns. He and legendary vocalist Van Morrison collaborated on an anti-lockdown song in 2020, and earlier this year Clapton said he suffered ""disastrous"" side effects from his COVID-19 vaccine shots and blamed ""propaganda"" insisting they're safe.

In June, the guitarist said his musician friends stopped talking to him over his stances — yet Clapton continued to speak his mind and take action, as he announced in July that he won't perform at venues requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccines.

Reid also called out Clapton for appearing in a photo with ""bounty hunter Texas Gov. Greg Abbott — because of course he did"" while on a tour of ""red states.""

The host then invoked a racial stereotype about ""white anti-vaxxers,"" saying ""what really stands out about"" them is that ""they act like their freedom has been taken. Taken from them! And they have this weird habit of trying to do that by co-opting the history of actually oppressed people, like former 'SNL' comedian Jim Breuer, who blamed the cancellation of his shows on segregation, of forcing people to show up with vaccines, and declared that — quote — 'I'm not going to be enslaved to the system.'""

Reid points out Clapton's 'racist past'

She then mined Clapton's ""racist past,"" as noted in a Rolling Stone article Monday that regurgitated things Clapton said dating back to 1968 and 1976, justifying its ""fresh examination of Clapton's past behavior"" due to the ""current controversy"" of his vaccine stance.

In other words, what Clapton said four or five decades ago wasn't enough for the far-left magazine to maul the guitarist in the years that followed — until, that is, Clapton declared things about COVID-19 vaccines Rolling Stone didn't like.

Reid was all in, of course, noting that Rolling Stone said Clapton ""used a derogatory term to describe his friend Jimi Hendrix in 1968, though the magazine points out it was — quote — 'hipster slang' at the time."" She added that ""at a concert in 1976, [Clapton] went on a racist rant that included him saying: 'Stop Britain from becoming a black colony. Keep Britain white.'""

More from Reid:

Clapton has apologized for his racist past, blaming it on his addictions to alcohol and drugs. But his behavior over the past year is also questionable. And, as ""Rolling Stone"" put it, Clapton went from setting the standard for rock guitar to making full-tilt racist rants and becoming an outspoken vaccine skeptic. Did he change, or was he always like this? I mean, maybe he's just a jerk. So, Eric Clapton, for your dangerous rhetoric on COVID precautions and vaccinations, you are tonight's ""Absolute Worst.""

Reid's own skeletons, hypocrisy

Lest we forget, Reid has more recent skeletons in her closet — the only difference is that she's not getting mowed down by her media brethren or canceled for them on social media.

But rapper Nikki Minaj didn't let Reid forget, pointing out during a recent Twitter battle with the MSNBC host that while Reid sat on a high horse calling out Minaj's vaccine hesitancy, Reid last September tweeted plenty of vaccine hesitancy herself.

Minaj also called Reid ""homophobic,"" presumably in reference to embarrassing past anti-LBGTQ blog posts attributed to her.

Like Clapton, Reid apologized — but unlike Clapton, Reid said she couldn't fathom that she wrote the blogs and just figured hackers were out to get her. Imagine that.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-reid-eric-clapton-jerk-vaccine-disinformation,2021-10-12
Juan Williams claims defending parents' rights is racist dog whistle: 'Code for white race politics',"Fox News political analyst Juan Williams claimed in a new essay that defending parents' rights is meant to sow racial division while masquerading ""as a defense of little children.""

What did Williams say?

Parents' rights have become a prominent issue in recent months as parents nationwide dispute a number of issues impacting schools, including COVID-related restrictions, radical LGBT policies, and certain teachings on race.

But according to Williams, defending parents' rights — which became a prominent issue in the Virginia gubernatorial race — is a racist dog whistle, or as the headline of his recent essay at The Hill claims, ""code for white race politics.""

""It is a campaign to stop classroom discussion of Black Lives Matter protests or slavery because it could upset some children, especially white children who might feel guilt,"" Williams wrote.



By making parents' rights a prominent issues, Williams charged that ""Trump-imitating Republican"" have struck ""political gold.""

Without evidence, Williams directly connected concerns over parents' rights to defending Confederate monuments, the 2017 Charlottesville riots, the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and segregation.

""There is a long history behind the latest racist political appeals. It is not long ago that racist southern politicians rallied against integration with an argument for 'states' rights,' a call to be free of federal laws seeking to end segregation,"" Williams wrote. ""Now the message is that white parents are being ignored when they complain that their children are uncomfortable learning about racism.""

Williams even expressed support for the letter the National School Boards Association sent President Joe Biden, demanding federal intervention over angry parents confronting school boards. The NSBA has since apologized for the letter.

Anything else?

Williams' essay reads like Democrat Terry McAuliffe's talking points.

In the closing weeks of the Virginia gubernatorial race, McAuliffe's two biggest attacks on his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, focused on Youngkin's position on parents' rights and former President Donald Trump. Although Trump has not played a role in the election, McAuliffe has continually tried to tie Youngkin to Trump.

In the end, Williams claimed the fight to defend parents' rights has nothing to do with parents' rights, but everything to do with ""stirring up racial division.""

Judge orders man who defaced LGBT mural to write 25-page essay on Pulse mass killing that FBI said was terrorism,"A Florida judge handed down a bizarre punishment last week to 20-year-old man who admitted to vandalizing an LGBT mural.

What is the background?

Last June, Alexander Jerich was slapped with a felony charge last summer after he defaced an LGBT mural — rainbow colors painted inside a Delray Beach intersection — by doing a burnout with his truck. His tires left a 15-foot skid mark on the painted asphalt.

In March, Jerich pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and reckless driving.

What happened now?

Last Thursday, Judge Scott Suskauer of the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida ordered Jerich to write a 25-page essay ahead of his sentencing hearing on June 8.

The topic? The 2016 mass killing at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando.

According to the Palm Beach Post, Suskauer believes Jerich has ""little understanding of the meaning of the rainbow-colored gay pride mural he defaced or the struggles of the LGBTQ community."" Suskauer thus ordered Jerich to write not only about the tragedy itself, but the 49 victims, their families, and why such mass killings happen.

""I want your own brief summary of why people are so hateful and why people lash out against the gay community,"" the judge reportedly told Jerich.

The assignment, while unorthodox in criminal proceedings, is particularly bizarre because the Pulse nightclub killer was not motivated by LGBT hate. In fact, the FBI declared terrorism as the official motive for the heinous crime because the killer declared allegiance to ISIS.

What about sentencing?

Prosecutors are pushing for Jerich to be sentenced to jail for 30 days. The founder and president of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, meanwhile, wants a one-year jail sentence, according to the Palm Beach Post.



At the hearing last week, Suskauer said he expected Jerich to be a ""thug"" or ""redneck"" or ""someone who displays complete disrespect for their fellow citizens,"" but Jerich's remorse apparently has the judge feeling merciful.

According to the Post, Suskauer said he did not want Jerich to go to jail for a year, nor does he want the felony criminal mischief charge to stand because he does not want ""to do that to a young man who has his whole life ahead of him.""

Instead, while Suskauer may consider some jail time, he indicated that he wants Jerich to perform community service for an LGBT organization. He may even order Jerich to return to the mural that he defaced each week to ensure that it is clean.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-orders-defendant-lgbt-essay,2022-04-29
"Federal judge rules Christian web designer has 'monopoly' over her own creativity, must give equal access to LGBT customers","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit on Monday said a Christian web designer who lives in Colorado must create websites that she says violate her religious beliefs.

In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court said 303 Creative founder Lorie Smith must design graphics and websites that ""celebrate same-sex marriages"" because Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act ""permissibly compels"" her to do so if she also is going to create websites that celebrate heterosexual marriages.

""The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,"" said John Bursch, an attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom who is representing Smith in her lawsuit against the Colorado law.

Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits any business that offers public services from denying an individual or group goods or services on the basis of sexual orientation or any other of several protected classes of identity covered by the law. It is the same law used by the Colorado Civil Rights Division to fine Masterpiece Cake Shop owner Jack Phillips, who has refused to bake cakes celebrating same-sex marriage or a transgender person's sex-reassignment surgery.

Smith filed a pre-enforcement challenge to CADA because she believes that being required to create a website for a same-sex wedding would violate her religious beliefs about marriage. 303 Creative has not yet offered wedding-related services but Smith intends to do so in the future.

Writing for the majority, Judge Mary Beck Briscoe said that Colorado has a ""compelling interest in protecting both the dignity interests of members of marginalized groups and their material interests in accessing the commercial marketplace."" She ruled that while CADA's protections are ""not narrowly tailored to preventing dignitary harms,"" the law requires Colorado to ensure ""equal access to publicly available goods and services.""

The fact that same-sex couples can obtain web design services from other businesses, not just 303 Creative, does not mean that homosexuals have ""equal access,"" according to Briscoe.

Permitting Smith to honor her religious convictions by refusing to celebrate same-sex marriages ""would necessarily relegate LGBT consumers to an inferior market,"" Briscoe wrote, ""because Appellants' unique services are, by definition, unavailable elsewhere.""

The judge's reasoning is that LGBT customers would be denied equal access to Smith's specific services, which constitutes a violation of Colorado's discrimination protections.

""To be sure, LGBT consumers may be able to obtain wedding-website design services from other businesses; yet, LGBT consumers will never be able to obtain wedding-related services of the same quality and nature as those that Appellants offer,"" Briscoe wrote. ""Thus, there are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those types of services.""

Briscoe asserted that Smith has something ""similar to a monopoly"" over her own creative talents.

""The product at issue is not merely 'custom-made wedding websites,' but rather 'custom-made wedding websites of the same quality and nature as those made by Appellants.' In that market, only Appellants exist,"" she argued.

Dissenting, 10th Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich said the Constitution protects Smith's beliefs and warned that Briscoe's logic would vastly expand the government's power over speech.

""This is, in a word, unprecedented,"" Tymkovich wrote. ""Taken to its logical end, the government could regulate the messages communicated by all artists, forcing them to promote messages approved by the government in the name of 'ensuring access to the commercial marketplace.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-rules-christian-web-designer-create-same-sex-marriage-sites,2021-07-27
"Civil rights activist calls for Jussie Smollett's arrest, claims he could have triggered 'race war'","Should actor Jussie Smollett face justice for allegedly orchestrating a hate crime against himself in order to bolster the narrative that America remains a dangerous place for minorities in the age of Trump? That's the question many are asking as mounting evidence points to a hoax.

One Los Angeles-based civil rights activist believes Smollett's alleged hoax is endangering the very community he is a part of — which is why he should be arrested and prosecuted.

What did the activist say?

""Today, Project Islamic HOPE is calling upon the arrest and criminal prosecution of 'Empire' star and actor Jussie Smollett. We believe Jussie Smollett lied about being the victim of a hate crime and being assaulted, and for us, it's a slap in the face,"" Najee Ali said Sunday.

Ali went on to say:

Jussie Smollett put people's lives at risk and could have created a situation that was much more damaging for those who are African American and for those who do identify with the LGBTQ community. We have many members of the black community and the LGBT community who have been the victims of racism and hate crimes, so for Smollett to say that he was a victim of racism and hate crime — and we believe that is a lie — certainly is an injustice to those true victims of racism and hate crimes.

""Jussie Smollett must be brought to justice for lying,"" Ali declared, adding that Smollett's ""campaign of lies"" eroded the ""benefit of the doubt"" he was given when he first claimed he was attacked.



Ali pointed out that one, among the many numerous problems with orchestrating a hate crime hoax, is that ""more extreme"" members of the communities Smollett belongs to could have retaliated against those Smollett accused of attacking him, namely white supporters of President Donald Trump.

""Smollett could have created a race war!"" Ali exclaimed.

Ali said that Smollett is due forgiveness if he apologies for lying. However, he emphasized that ""at the end of the day,"" Smollett ""must be held accountable"" and brought to justice because he ""put many lives in danger.""

Could Smollett face jail time?

While Chicago detectives have not yet confirmed Smollett orchestrated the attack against himself, new evidence points to a hoax. While lying is not a crime, Smollett filed a police report testifying to his claims. If it is confirmed Smollett lied, he could be charged with filing a false police report.

Under Illinois criminal code, filing a false police report is considered a disorderly conduct offense chargeable by a Class 4 felony. In Illinois, Class 4 felonies carry a one- to three-year prison sentence.

Meanwhile, there is the question of the racist letter Smollett received one week before the alleged Jan. 29 attack containing a white powered substance, which turned out to be aspirin. According to WBBM-TV, Smollett may have staged the attack because the letter did not generate the response he thought it should have.

It's not clear who sent the letter, although Chicago police collected evidence from the apartment of two Nigerian brothers who allegedly helped Smollett orchestrate his hoax that may indicate the letter was also a hoax.

The FBI is handling the investigation into the letter, WBBM reported.

Cops: 'Heavily redacted' phone records from Jussie Smollett 'do not meet' burden for 'criminal investigation',"Chicago police said the ""limited and heavily redacted"" phone records ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett turned over detectives ""do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation"" as cops continue looking into Smollett's claim he was the victim of a racist, homophobic attack late last month, WBBM-TV reported.

Smollett's music manager, Brandon Z. Moore, told ABC News he was on the phone with Smollett during the alleged Jan. 29 attack and heard a ""scuffle"" and a ""racial slur,"" but Smollett initially refused to release his phone to cops so they could verify the claim.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the New York Post that ""we offered to take the phone to download the data, and he expressed he couldn't be without his phone for several hours.""

Insufficient records

But while Smollett had a change of heart and gave police redacted phone records, the department said they are insufficient.

""We are very appreciative of the victim's cooperation. However, the records provided do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation, as they were limited and heavily redacted,"" police told WBBM in an email. ""Detectives may be following up with the victim to request additional data to corroborate the investigative timeline.""

Guglielmi added to the station that the redactions in the PDF file from Smollett are ""extreme"" but do include the hour before the alleged attack.

What's the background?

Numerous media outlets ran with a TMZ report saying the openly gay actor was beaten up after walking out of a Subway restaurant around 2 a.m. by two white men wearing ski masks who asked, ""Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire' n*****?"" before pouring bleach on him, putting a noose around his neck, and yelling, ""This is MAGA country!""— a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""

Chicago police told TheBlaze there was ""no mention of MAGA"" in initial reports, but when detectives followed up with Smollett later on the day of the attack, he recalled the attackers making those comments, and detectives completed a supplemental report.

Police didn't specify the race of the alleged suspects but did call it a ""possible racially charged assault and battery"" and that they are ""treating it as a possible hate crime.""

Smollett reportedly wore rope 'like a necktie'



Police told ABC News Smollett was seen on camera walking into an apartment with a rope around his neck and ""wearing it like a necktie"" before calling cops from inside the building.

CBS News said ""when police got to his apartment, they said a noose was still around Smollett's neck.""

Rob Elgas of WLS-TV in Chicago reported that ""when Smollett contacted police at 2:42AM, he was still wearing the rope around his neck. The alleged encounter occurred at 2AM. Police have the rope and it will be analyzed.""

Other curious details:

According to another tweet from Elgas, ""Smollett requested responding Chicago police officers turn off their body cameras as they arrived to take his report. A spokesman says this is not uncommon when officers enter a private residence.""

Elgas added that Chicago police have a security image of Smollett alone inside a Subway sandwich shop near the location of the reported crime, and that cops also obtained additional video placing him at the scene of the crime.

But sources told CBS News they've seen security video of Smollett outdoors early Tuesday morning and ""nothing of an assault.""

The weather in Chicago at midnight Jan. 29 — two hours before the alleged attack — showed a low temperature of 1 degree with 14-mph winds.

Guglielmi told The Associated Press that detectives have looked at hundreds of hours of surveillance video from businesses and hotels in the heavily monitored area and are expanding the search to include footage from public buses and buildings beyond the scene's immediate vicinity in the hopes of spotting the individuals who match Smollett's description.

""We haven't seen anybody, at this point, matching the description he gave,"" Guglielmi added to the AP.

Although police have since asked for help from the public in identifying two persons of interest from surveillance recordings near the site of the attack near the time it occurred.

The AP added that Chicago has one of the nation's most sophisticated and extensive video surveillance systems, including thousands of cameras on street poles, skyscrapers, buses, and in train tunnels — and that police said such cameras have helped them make thousands of arrests.

&lt;br&gt;

Smollett's neighbor doesn't believe the story

A neighbor of Smollett cast doubt on his story.

""I don't believe it happened the way he said it did,"" Agin Muhammad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the actor, told the Post. ""I've been in this neighborhood five years. I don't believe it, not around here. … Half the people are gay and the other half are black.""

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters that if police suspect Smollett's story is a hoax, he will be held accountable.

Other details

A threatening letter and drawing to Smollett was sent to the Fox television studio in Chicago on Jan. 22, police told ABC News, and it contained a powdery substance that investigators believe was likely crushed-up Tylenol.

The Post said last week it traced Smollett's likely route to the underpass from a 24-hour Subway sandwich shop where he bought a tuna sandwich and a salad, and that near the foot of a stairwell to the Loews, the paper found an empty hot sauce bottle that was partially filled with a clear liquid that smelled like bleach.

Guglielmi told the Post that after police seized the bottle it was turned over to the FBI for analysis; the FBI declined to comment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jussie-smollett-redacted-phone-records,2019-02-12
"Justices Thomas, Alito stoke liberal fear by suggesting SCOTUS gay marriage ruling could be overturned","Conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on Monday excoriated the high court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision — which uniformly mandated that all states recognize same-sex marriages — characterizing it as an assault on religious liberty and suggesting that the ruling could be overturned in short order.

What did they say?

""In Obergefell v. Hodges ... the Court read a right to same-sex marriage into the Fourteenth Amendment, even though that right is found nowhere in the text,"" Thomas wrote in a scathing statement, joined by Alito. ""Obergefell enables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe that marriage is between one man and one woman as bigots ... in other words, [it] was read to suggest that being a public official with traditional Christian values was legally tantamount to invidious discrimination toward homosexuals.""

Thomas wrote the court's denial to hear an appeal from former Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis, who was sued after objecting to issuing same-sex marriage licenses in the state.

Even in denying to hear Davis' case, however, Thomas made sure to note that her petition ""provides a stark reminder of the consequences of Obergefell."" Consequences that he said were ""created"" by the court and that ""only [the court] can fix.""

""Until then,"" — that is, presumably, until the case is overturned by the court — ""Obergefell will continue to have 'ruinous consequences for religious liberty,'"" Thomas concluded.

Why does it matter?

The sharp words were especially notable given the Supreme Court's conservative transformation over the last four years.

Time noted in its report that ""with Ginsburg's death and the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018, only three members of the majority in the gay marriage case remain: Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.""

Kennedy, a moderate, was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's position.

Should Barrett be confirmed, it would give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court. It would likely be a true majority, too, even as Chief Justice John Roberts, who is traditionally regarded as a conservative justice, has shown a tendency at times to play the middle since Kennedy's retirement.

Liberals were outraged

In response to the statement, LGBT rights groups and others expressed outrage and concern.

Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said, ""These comments made clear that the war on marriage equality, against the lives of same-sex couples, is alive and well"" even as the court ""hangs in the balance.""

Jim Obergefell, a lead plaintiff in the 2015 case, said, ""It is unthinkable that Alito, Thomas and others on the Supreme Court would want to take away that right and the dignity that comes along with it.""

""It is alarming that there are justices on the Supreme Court who want to overrule Obergefell, which is a precedent the court has reaffirmed, and which hundreds of thousands of couples have relied to seal their unions in matrimony,"" Yale Law School professor William Eskridge added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/justices-thomas-alito-slam-obergefell,2020-10-06
Singer Kacey Musgraves says voting for Trump is 'violence' against LGBTQ. Richard Grenell has words.,"Grammy award-winning country music singer Kacey Musgraves took to Twitter recently to declare that voting for President Donald Trump in November would be equivalent to an ""act of violence"" against the LGBTQ+ community.

Musgraves posted an image to her feed Friday night that said: ""If you love an LGBTQ+ person and you're planning on voting for Donald Trump in November, that's an act of violence against them.""



In a caption posted along with the image, the 32-year-old singer-songwriter wrote, ""to each their own but know what your vote means"" — a confusingly passive-aggressive message from someone simultaneously claiming that to vote one way would be violent.

In response to the tweet, former Trump administration acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, who is also the first openly gay member of a presidential cabinet, had words for Musgraves.

""Twitter should ban this piece of fake news. This isn't remotely correct,"" Grenell wrote on Twitter. ""Stop making gay rights a partisan issue, Kacey! You aren't helping gay people one bit.""

""We aren't tokens,"" he added.

Last year, Grenell, who was serving as the U.S. ambassador to Germany at the time, spearheaded a Trump administration effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality.

The move was reportedly launched in response to the Iranian government's execution of a 31-year-old gay man by public hanging.

In an op-ed in the German newspaper Bild, Grenell condemned the execution and argued that ""politicians, the U.N., democratic governments, diplomats, and good people everywhere should speak up — and loudly.""

He further called on world leaders to ""work harder to demand that U.N. members decriminalize homosexuality.""

Trump has often been demonized by the left as anti-LGBTQ despite being the first president to take office in support of gay marriage.

The administration, though perhaps more left-leaning on LGBTQ policy initiatives than many conservatives in America, took heat from the left earlier this year for ending an Obama-era regulation that prohibited health care discrimination against certain LGBT individuals.

The regulation under Obama had defined sex discrimination as including gender identity, or ""one's internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.""

The Trump Department of Health and Human Services announced it would return to an interpretation of sex discrimination using the ""plain meaning of the word 'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kacey-musgraves-richard-grenell-lgbtq,2020-08-31
"Kansas Republican lawmaker switches to Dem party, calls GOP's LGBTQ stance 'absurd'","Kansas State Sen. Barbara Bollier spent 43 years as a registered Republican and 10 years as a GOP lawmaker. But now she's switching parties because of Republicans' stance on LGBTQ issues and other causes.

""My moral compass is saying, 'I can't do this anymore,' and you throw that in with Donald Trump, and just from a moral position, I can't be complicit anymore,"" Bollier said in an interview with NBC News.

What happened?

Earlier this year, the Kansas Republican Party updated its platform with the following language: ""We believe God created two genders, male and female. Therefore, as defined by the Kansas Constitution, the benefits and privileges of marriage exist only between one man and one woman.""

""It's absurd,"" Bollier said.

She told NBC News:

When the party adopted an anti-transgender piece to their platform that really, as a physician, set me over the edge, because we have more than XX and XY, and gender is a very complicated and important thing.

Bollier has long reached across the political aisle and she endorsed Democrats Laura Kelly for governor and Sharice Davids for Congress. State Senate President Susan Wagle removed Bollier as vice chairwoman of the governing body's health committee in July after Bollier endorsed the two candidates.

The Kansas Republican Party earlier this year modified the wording of its platform to read: ""We believe God created two genders, male and female. Therefore, as defined by the Kansas Constitution, the benefits and privileges of marriage exist only between one man and one woman.""

What else did she complain about?

Bollier also told the news outlet she was opposed to the Kansas GOP's stance on Medicaid expansion and gun violence prevention matters.

She said gun violence is a ""crisis, including suicide.""

Bollier represents State Senate District 7, which she says is ""very moderate"" and has traditionally elected moderate Republicans for a long time."" The district includes suburban areas of Kansas City.

In fact, it reserves the right to refuse admittance or kick out students who support, promote, or condone such behavior, according to parental agreement language from Immanuel Christian School in northern Virginia.

Here's the section in which the prohibition appears:

I understand the biblical role of Immanuel Christian School is to partner with families to encourage students to be imitators of Christ. This necessarily involves the school's understanding and belief regarding biblical morality and standards of conduct. I understand that the school reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission to an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student if the atmosphere or conduct within a particular home, the activities of a parent or guardian, or the activities of the student are counter to, or are in opposition to, the biblical lifestyle the school teaches. This includes, but is not limited to contumacious behavior, divisive conduct, and participating in, supporting, or condoning sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bi-sexual activity, promoting such practices, or being unable to support the moral principles of the school. (Lev. 20:13 and Romans 1:27.) I acknowledge the importance of a family culture based on biblical principles and embrace biblical family values such as a healthy marriage between one man and one woman. My role as spiritual mentor to my children will be taken seriously.

What did an LGBT rights group have to say?

Not surprisingly, an official with an LGBT advocacy group ripped Karen Pence's decision.

""Why not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won't serve LGBTQ kids, kids of LGBTQ parents?"" JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, told the Huffington Post in a statement. ""The Pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.""

What did Karen Pence have to say?

Kara Brooks, spokeswoman for the second lady, told the outlet ""it's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack.""

""I am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do,"" Pence told USA Today in a statement. ""I have missed teaching art.""

What did a law professor have to say?

Robert W. Tuttle, a professor at George Washington Law School, told the Washington Post that Immanuel Christian's language on sexuality is typical of conservative Christian institutions and that the second lady is well within her rights to teach there.

Indeed, the Huffington Post noted that Virginia and dozens of other states say it's legal for private employers to discriminate on the basis of sexual and gender identity.



What else does the school stand for?

The school's employment application includes a section in which applicants initial and sign, agreeing to abide by certain standards of morality ""consistent with the Holy Scriptures.""

Language on page 11 reads as follows:

I will strive to live a personal life of moral purity that is separated from the world according to Scriptures, as defined by the Statement of Faith of Immanuel Bible Church and agreed upon by the Elders and Pastors of Immanuel Bible Church. I understand that the term ""marriage"" has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive covenant union as delineated in Scripture and that God intends sexual intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other and that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity is engaged in outside of marriage between a man and a woman. Further, I will maintain a lifestyle based on biblical standards of moral conduct. Moral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, and sexual abuse or improprieties toward minors as defined by Scripture and federal or state law. Further, I am not, nor have been in the past, engaged in inappropriate conduct toward minors, nor do I have inclinations toward such conduct. Persons so involved or who condone such behaviors cannot be employees of Immanuel Christian School. (I Cor. 3:16, 17; I Cor. 6:19, 20; I Cor. 11:3; Romans 1:24-32; Gen. 1:27-28; 2:21-24)

Anything else?

Pence's spokeswoman also told the Huffington Post that the second lady previously taught at Immanuel Christian for 12 years while her husband was in Congress. The couple's daughter, Charlotte, attended the school, the Huffington Post added, noting the school's website.

Immanuel Christian School didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, the outlet said, adding that Pence will reportedly teach at the school twice a week until May.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/karen-pence-lgbt-school,2019-01-16
House Democrat claims the words 'pedophile' and 'groomer' discriminate against LGBT 'sexual orientation',"Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) complained on Wednesday that terms like ""pedophile"" and ""groomer"" are rooted in bigotry that discriminates against LGBT ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity.""

The shocking comments came during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing that featured testimony from survivors of last month's mass attack at Club Q, an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs.

Porter denounced using ""groomer"" and ""pedophile"" pejoratively because, she claimed, the words foment hate and dehumanize LGBT-identifying persons.

""This allegation of ‘groomer’ and ‘pedophile' it is alleging that a person is criminal somehow and engaged in criminal acts merely because of their gender identity, their sexual orientation, their gender identity,"" she said.

Porter's eyebrow-raising remarks were made in response to Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson, who condemned Twitter and other social media platforms for not aggressively removing alleged hate speech like the words ""groomer"" and ""pedophile.""

""It's about holding users accountable to those guidelines and acknowledging that when we use phrases and words like 'groomer' and 'pedophile' to describe people — individuals in our communities that are mothers, fathers, that are teachers, doctors — it is dangerous,"" Robinson claimed.

""It's got one purpose: to dehumanize us and to make us feel like we're not a part of this American society,"" Robinson continued. ""It has real-life consequences.""

What is their gripe?

Using the word ""groomer"" is a problem, Porter contended, because ""the 'groomer' narrative is an age-old lie"" that ""positions LGBTQ+ people as a threat to kids.""

""What is does is deny them access to public spaces, it stokes fear, and it can even stoke violence,"" Porter claimed.

That explanation, however, does not explain how the semantic import of either word stokes hatred or fear like they claim.

In this context, a ""groomer"" is someone who builds a relationship with children to later exploit them, often sexually, while a ""pedophile"" is someone who is sexually attracted to children. Sexualizing children is morally reprehensible, and sexually abusing children is, of course, illegal.

The term ""groomer,"" though, now often describes people who want to impress upon young children an ultra-progressive ideology of sex and gender, even if their parents disagree.

Porter did not provide any evidence of violence incited by the usage of ""groomer"" or ""pedophile.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/katie-porter-denounces-usage-of-pedophile-groomer,2022-12-15
Kellogg's launches LGBTQ-themed breakfast cereal 'All Together' to promote acceptance 'no matter who you love',"Kellogg's has launched an LGBTQ-themed cereal — ""All Together"" — to promote diversity and acceptance ""no matter who you love.""

Kevin Hart defends Dave Chappelle and says cancel culture has gone too far,"Comedian Kevin Hart came to the defense of Dave Chappelle and decried cancel culture while admitting that he has changed his approach to comedy in order to be respectful of others.

Hart made the comments in an interview with the New York Times.

“That man don’t have a hateful bone in his body. And I don’t say that because it’s hypothetical — I say that because I know him,"" said Hart of Chappelle, who has been accused of transphobic comments.

""I know his world,"" Hart continued. ""I know that he embraces the LGBT+ community, because he has friends who are close to him from that community. I know that his kids understand equality, fair treatment, love. I know that his wife embeds that in their kids. I know why people embrace him. He’s a good dude.""

Hart was also the victim of cancel culture in 2018 when resurfaced tweets sunk his hopes of hosting the Oscar awards ceremony. He later apologized for the jokes and Chappelle used his story to criticize cancel culture in one of his comedy specials.

Hart went on in the Times interview to opine that cancel culture had gone too far in society.

""If there is a joke, there’s an attempt to be funny. You can find a joke tasteful or distasteful. If you’re a supporter of a performer, then you’re probably OK with whatever’s happening. And if you’re not a fan, you’re infuriated and you’re outraged. Rightfully so — you have every right to be,"" he said.

""You also have a right to not support it,"" Hart concluded. ""But the energy that’s put into wanting to change or end someone, it’s getting out of hand.”

The newest protest against Chappelle originated from some students at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, where the comedian went to high school. Students are protesting the school's plans to name a theater after Chappelle after he has donated and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his alma mater.

Chappelle has responded to the controversy by challenging his critics to raise more money for the school than his supporters. He said that if they are successful he'll refuse to put his name on the theater.

Hart is on a campaign to publicize his new dramatic limited series on Netflix entitled, ""True Story,"" starring himself and Wesley Snipes.

Kindergarten teacher says he exposes kids to terms transgender and gender queer,"The Washington Post reported that a kindergarten teacher in Massachusetts said that he exposes children to the terms transgender and gender-queer, though he does not provide complete definitions since that would be too much for kids in kindergarten. The outlet reported that the educator wished to remain anonymous since his district had not cleared him to talk publicly.



The teacher discusses anatomy but does not categorize parts as being specifically male or female, according to the Post. ""We don’t say a penis belongs to a man,"" the teacher remarked — it goes with a human, he noted. The kindergarten educator teaches that if a physician declares a baby to be a boy when he is born, that child is not necessarily a boy. ""Someone who was born a boy may not feel they are a boy.""

The Post also reported that biology teacher Sam Long of Denver South High School, who is transgender, said that ""LGBTQ identities are a naturally occurring facet of human variation, and that is why we need to learn about them in the context of biology and human anatomy.""

Issues surrounding radical leftist gender ideology are highly controversial and remain the topic of significant debate throughout the country. Many parents do not want their kids to be exposed to the reality-defying gender-bending dogmas peddled by the left.

""There's years of research that demonstrate that curriculums that include respect for others regarding their sexual orientation and gender identity are more effective,"" director of the division of adolescent and school health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kathleen Ethier stated, according to the Post. ""When you make a school environment safe and supportive for the most vulnerable youth, you improve the school environment for everyone.""

The U.S. government has been celebrating the LGBT movement by recognizing June as so-called pride month. President Joe Biden issued a proclamation declaring ""June 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the achievements of the LGBTQI+ community, to celebrate the great diversity of the American people, and to wave their flags of pride high,"" he said in the proclamation.



The Marine Corps issued a tweet that included a graphic featuring bullets with brightly-colored tips, in a nod to the LGBT rainbow symbol. The Air Force also posted a tweet recognizing pride month.

Government entities, such as the Treasury Department, have even hoisted pride flags to celebrate the cause du jour.

"Kyrsten Sinema, first openly bisexual senator, is sworn in — but on the Constitution and not the Bible","Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) — the country's first openly bisexual senator — took her oath of office on Thursday by placing her hand on a copy of the U.S. Constitution, and not the Bible.

What are the details?

Vice President Mike Pence, who swore Sinema in as a U.S. senator, ended his part of the ceremony with "" ... so help you God?""

Sinema responded, ""I do.""

A spokesperson for Sinema told the Arizona Republic that the newly minted senator, who previously served as a U.S. representative, is ""always sworn in on Constitution.""

""Kyrsten always gets sworn in on a Constitution simply because of her love for the Constitution,"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that the book was from the Library of Congress and contained texts of the United States and Arizona state constitutions.

A recent release from the Pew Research Center reported Sinema is the one member of Congress who is ""religiously unaffiliated.""

At just over 88 percent, the overwhelming majority of those serving in the U.S. Congress identify as Christians.

What else?

Hemant Mehta at the Friendly Athiest lauded Sinema's decision to be sworn in on the U.S. Constitution.

""To be sure, Sinema isn't an open atheist, and there were a lot of books other than the Bible this year for newly elected members of Congress,"" Mehta wrote.

""But it's still nice to see a government official show people that her allegiance is to our country and our laws, not a holy book or the Ten Commandments,"" Mehta added.

Lady Gaga blasts Mike Pence at show: 'You are the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian',"Outspoken, pro-LGBT pop singer Lady Gaga blasted Vice President Mike Pence during a weekend concert after he defended his wife Karen teaching at a Christian school that prohibits ""homosexual activity.""

During her song ""Million Reasons"" in Las Vegas on Saturday, the singer stopped and had a few words for Pence that the crowd loved.

""To Mike Pence, who thinks it's acceptable that his wife work at a school that bans LGBTQ, you are wrong,"" Lady Gaga said while sitting a piano as the audience cheered. ""You say we should not discriminate against Christianity; you are the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian. I am a Christian woman, and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice, and everybody is welcome. So you can take all that disgrace Mr. Pence, and you can look yourself in the mirror, and you'll find it right there.""

The singer — who recently got rave reviews for her acting alongside Bradley Cooper in the remake of ""A Star Is Born"" — also tore into President Donald Trump over the government shutdown: ""If the f***ing president of the United States could please put our government back in business,"" she said while audience members yelled ""f*** Trump."" She added that ""there are people who live paycheck to paycheck and need their money.""

<br>

What did Mike Pence say that got Lady Gaga in a twist?

After Karen Pence was criticized for taking her teaching position at the Christian school, Mike Pence sat down for an interview with EWTN's Lauren Ashburn and decried the attack on Christian education.

""My wife and I have been in the public eye for quite a while but I have to tell you, to see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive,"" Pence said. ""We have a rich tradition of Christian education and, frankly, religious education broadly defined. We celebrate it. The freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution prohibits a religious test for holding public office, so we'll let critics roll off out backs.""

Baltimore Ravens star QB fires back after ESPN reporter accuses him of using 'anti-gay' slur: 'This is defamation',"Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson rebuked an ESPN reporter on Monday who accused him of using an ""anti-gay"" slur.

What is the background?

After the Ravens lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday by a score of 28-27, Jackson responded to a Baltimore fan who criticized him.

The fan, referring to Jackson seeking a fully guaranteed contract as one of the league's top quarterbacks, said that Jackson's performance on Sunday did not warrant such a deal. Jackson, however, vehemently disagreed.

""Boy STFU y’all be cappin too much on this app mf never smelt a football field never did shit but eat dick,"" Jackson responded.

What was the accusation?

Jackson deleted the tweet, but that did not stop ESPN writer Jamison Hensley from charging Jackson with using an ""anti-gay phrase,"" an accusation that in today's political environment often results in being canceled.

Hensley wrote:

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson responded to a social media post Sunday that criticized his performance with a profanity-laced tweet that included an anti-gay phrase.

Jackson responded to the accusation on Monday by accusing Hensley of defamation.

""This is Defamation of my character, Because not once have I ever mentioned or disrespect anyone’s Sexuality, sexual orientation, gender, Religion or Race. Your (sic) reaching…"" Jackson said.

Anything else?

Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh told media on Monday that he had met with Jackson to discuss the ""out of character"" remark. Still, he defended his quarterback.

Harbaugh explained that he tells his players ""not to get into the Twitter world right after the game, especially after a loss. It's never going to be positive, it's not going to be a nice place.""

""I think that's kind of reflected in Lamar's response because what he said was just so out of character for him. That's not the way he speaks. That's not the way he talks. That's not the words he ever uses. I've never heard him say things like that before,"" the coach added. ""I'm sure he's frustrated, just like we all are.

"Late-night host makes crude jokes about VP Mike Pence’s wife, says religious freedom in the US is ‘crazy’","Trevor Noah, the late-night host of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" took aim at Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, and the Christian school where she will begin teaching this week.

Reports Wednesday revealed that the vice president's wife would be returning to teaching art twice a week at a private school in Virginia.

What did Noah say?

On Wednesday's show, Noah took a swipe at religious freedom and the Pences' marriage.

""Mike Pence's wife, Karen — or 'Mother' as she's called during their BDSM late-night kink sessions — announced she is going back to work,"" Noah began, and went on to play footage of the announcement.

Noah pointed out the school's strict, Bible-based rules, which, he pointed out, ""bans gay and transgender students and makes job candidates sign a pledge they won't condone homosexual activity.""

Noah made sure to mark his surprise that a Christian school would base its rules and regulations on conduct and admittance on the Bible.

""I'm sorry, what? No gay kids allowed?"" the late-night host joked. ""How is that a school policy? Like, do they just have an assembly one day where the principal is like, 'Listen up: at this school we pound p****, am I clear? Hands up. Who in here is interested in the spring musical — trick question, you're out, you're out, you're out, you're all out!""

What else?

Noah went on to claim that using religious freedom to discriminate is a ""crazy"" notion.

""I'm not going to lie,"" Noah said. ""I think it's crazy that if you want to discriminate against anyone in America all you have to do is go, 'Oh, it's because of my religion! I'm not discriminating!'""

He added, ""I want to try that. I want to say, 'No short people allowed at my shows because I want all my friends to be close to Jesus and you couldn't be further away.'""

Lawsuit alleges Starbucks fired Christian barista who refused to wear LGBT 'pride' shirt,"A New Jersey woman has filed a lawsuit against Starbucks claiming that she was fired from her barista job because she refused to wear a company t-shirt that promoted LGBT ""pride.""

The lawsuit was filed on Nov. 19 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.

What are the details?

According to the lawsuit, Betsy Fresse, a Christian from Newark, was attending a meeting in her manager's office at the Glen Ridge location in June 2019 when she noticed a box of Starbucks-branded ""pride"" t-shirts, NBC News reported.

Fresse proceeded to ask her manager if she would be required to wear one — which would violate her religious beliefs — and she was allegedly assured that she would not.

But several weeks later, Fresse was contacted by Starbucks' ethics and compliance department about not wanting to wear the shirt. She told the company official that doing so would compromise her religious beliefs. Then, on Aug. 22, 2019, the lawsuit alleges that Fresse was fired because ""her comportment was not in compliance with Starbucks' core values.""

More from NJ.com:

While court papers state that Fresse ""holds no enmity toward individuals who ascribe to the LGBTQ lifestyle and/or make up the LGBTQ community, (she) believes that being made to wear a Pride T-shirt as a condition of employment would be tantamount to forced speech and inaccurately show her advocacy of a lifestyle in direct contradiction to her religious beliefs."" Those beliefs, according to the lawsuit, include the idea ""that marriage is defined in the Bible as between one man and one woman only, and that any sexual activity which takes place outside of this context is contrary to her understanding of Biblical teaching.""

Fresse has also filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The government agency, however, said in August that it could not determine whether Starbucks wrongly terminated Fresse by engaging in religious discrimination, according to NJ.com.

Fresse is seeking back pay with interest, compensation for emotional suffering, punitive damages, and payment of her attorney fees.

What did Starbucks say?

In a statement provided to the New York Post, a representative for the coffee chain said they are prepared to fight Fresse's claims in court, denying that she was required to wear the ""pride"" shirt.

""We are very aware of the claims by Mrs. Fresse, which are without merit and we are fully prepared to present our case in court,"" the spokesperson said. ""Specific to our dress code, other than our green apron, no part of our dress code requires partners to wear any approved items that they have not personally selected.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawsuit-alleges-starbucks-fired-christian-barista-who-refused-to-wear-lgbt-pride-shirt,2020-11-29
"Lawsuit targets Alabama law that prohibits gender transition meds, surgeries for those under 19","Mere days after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation that makes it felony to prescribe or administer puberty blockers and gender transition hormones to individuals younger than 19, the commonsense bill — which also makes it a felony to conduct gender reassignment surgeries on people in that age bracket — is already facing a legal challenge. The law is slated to take take effect next month.

The suit is being lodged by two physicians, along with two parents who are each waging the suit for themselves and on behalf of their respective transgender kids. One of the parents has a 17-year-old transgender boy, while the other has a 13-year-old transgender girl — a transgender boy is biological female who identifies as a boy, while a transgender girl is a biological male who identifies as a girl.

""The plaintiffs are represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign with King & Spalding LLP and Lightfoot, Franklin & White LLC,"" according to the Human Rights Campaign, which is a pro-LGBTQ advocacy group.

The suit warns that if the 13-year-old kid, referred to as ""Mary Roe"" in the filing, is forced to stop taking puberty blockers, the child will descend into an abyss of angst.

""For Mary to be forced to go through male puberty would be devastating; it would predictably result in her experiencing isolation, depression, anxiety, and distress. Mary’s parents are also concerned that without access to the puberty-blocking medication she needs, Mary would resort to self-harm as a means of coping with her psychological distress or even attempt suicide,"" the suit declares.

The swift legal challenge highlights the deep cultural divide in the U.S., as some Americans support protecting kids from leftist gender ideology while others promote the radical concepts.

""By signing SB 184 Governor Ivey has told kind, loving, and loyal Alabama families that they cannot stay here without denying their children the basic medical care they need,"" said Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, who is one of the plaintiffs, according to the Human Rights Campaign's press release. ""She has undermined the health and well-being of Alabama children and put doctors like me in the horrifying position of choosing between ignoring the medical needs of our patients or risking being sent to prison.""

""I believe very strongly that if the Good Lord made you a boy, you are a boy, and if he made you a girl, you are a girl,"" Gov. Ivey, a Republican, noted in a statement last week. ""We should especially protect our children from these radical, life-altering drugs and surgeries when they are at such a vulnerable stage in life. Instead, let us all focus on helping them to properly develop into the adults God intended them to be.""

"Lawsuit: College 'demoted, harassed,' then 'effectively fired' psychology prof for 'conservative' gender views","Attorneys for a University of Louisville psychology professor filed a federal lawsuit against the school last week saying their client was ""demoted, harassed, and then effectively fired"" for his ""conservative"" views on gender, according to Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal outfit.

What's the background?



ADF said the university hired Dr. Allan M. Josephson in 2003 as chief of the ""then-struggling"" Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology, which he turned around, ""building a program that now has a national reputation."" Josephson, the suit says, has been a medical doctor since 1976 and has built an international reputation since that time.

Josephson also has served as an expert witness in numerous cases involving gender dysphoria in children and adolescents and has held the view that sex is binary and fixed at birth — and that parents should help their children feel more comfortable with their biological gender through therapy, the suit says. Josephson also was a panelist for The Heritage Foundation, a conservative group, in the fall of 2017 on the topic of treating youth with gender dysphoria.

But the University of Louisville's LGBT Center caught wind of Josephson's participation in the panel and his previous testimony and asked the school to discipline him, the suit says.

The suit adds that another professor in the school's child psychology division — with barely three years of clinical experience — ""claimed that Dr. Josephson's belief that a young child (even a four-year-old) does not have the cognitive maturity to declare that he or she is actually a member of the opposite sex was evidence of his discrimination against individuals experiencing gender dysphoria.""

In addition, the suit says Josephson was told his gender dysphoria views differed from ""the official curriculum of the school"" — although no such curriculum existed at the time.

Josephson was soon demoted from his position of chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology because ""the majority [of Division faculty] disagrees with your approach to management of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria,"" the suit said.

""For over a year after the demotion, Defendants continued to retaliate against Dr. Josephson by subjecting him to a hostile, humiliating work environment,"" the suit said, which included treating him as a junior faculty member, preventing him from attending faculty meetings, and stripping his supervisory duties and travel budget.

In February, the suit says, Josephson was told his contract wouldn't be renewed once it expired in June.



What else did Alliance Defending Freedom say?



""Universities are supposed to be a marketplace of ideas, but the University of Louisville is turning itself into an assembly line of one thought,"" ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said. ""Dr. Josephson has had a long and distinguished career at the University of Louisville, leading and rebuilding its child psychiatry program. Public universities have no business demoting or firing professors simply because they hold a different view than their colleagues or the administration, but that's exactly what's happened here.""

ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, added that ""universities should welcome differing viewpoints and encourage civil discourse in their academic communities. Speaking with conservative groups — or holding conservative views — should not be disqualifying for academic service. Unfortunately, the University of Louisville's attempts to silence Dr. Josephson shut down debate and do a disservice to students and faculty alike.""

What does the University of Louisville have to say?

A university spokesman confirmed Josephson is employed as a professor in the division he initially led and works at its clinic, providing psychiatric treatment to children, Insider Louisville reported. The outlet added that the school ""does not comment on pending litigation. Lawsuits only present one side of the situation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawsuit-college-demoted-prof-for-conservative-gender-views,2019-04-01
Lawsuit seeking to force Christian universities to conform to LGBT-sanctioned ideology thrown out by federal judge,"An LGBT advocacy group sued the U.S. Education Department in hopes of forcing various Christian schools to systematically adhere to the ever-changing and frequently incoherent precepts sanctioned by gay- and transsexual-rights activists.

To achieve this end, they reportedly sought to bar students from using tuition grants, student loans, and other federal financial assistance at colleges and universities that work in accordance with religious beliefs on sexuality.

They failed.

Clinton-nominated Judge Ann Aiken of the U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon ruled on January 12 in favor of Christian colleges and against the plaintiffs.

The lawsuit

The Religious Exemption Accountability Project, an LGBT activist group, sued the Education Department in March 2021 on behalf of a gang of 33 current and past students at federally funded colleges.

The lawsuit's alleged aim was to ""put an end to the U.S. Department of Education's complicity in the abuses and unsafe conditions thousands of LGBTQ+ students endure at hundreds of taxpayer-funded, religious colleges and universities.""

According to the suit, the plaintiffs sought ""safety and justice for themselves and for the countless sexual and gender minority students whose oppression, fueled by government funding, and unrestrained by government intervention, persists with injurious consequences to mind, body and soul.""

The College Fix indicated that the kind of ""oppression"" that these activists sought to combat would include religious schools' prohibitions on students being in gay relationships as well as policies preventing men who masquerade as females from entering women's locker rooms.

According to the Washington Post, the suit further alleged that the religious exemption conferred to the schools, allowing them ""to have discriminatory policies,"" is unconstitutional because they receive government funding.



Title IX applies to all schools that receive federal funding.

Title IX says, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""

There is, however, a religious exemption under Title IX stating that ""an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization"" can uphold its values, even if regarded as discriminatory, so long as they are ""consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.""

The suit referenced 25 schools across the country.

Bob Jones University president Steve Pettit suggested that, if successful, the suit would foist a ""single government-sanctioned ideology"" on religious schools across the country.



The decision

Reason reported that Aiken more or less recognized that the government ""has no constitutional obligation to prohibit sex discrimination (or race discrimination, religious discrimination[,] political discrimination, or what have you) by private institutions, even ones that get government funds.""



Aiken wrote, ""Plaintiffs have submitted no allegations of discriminatory motivation on the part of those enacting the religious exemption. To the contrary, Plaintiffs argue that when Congress enacted Title IX, protections for—or discrimination against sexual and gender minorities—were 'of no concern.'""

The judge also noted that ""the Supreme Court has stated that 'a law is not unconstitutional simply because it allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose.'""

Aiken added, ""Plaintiffs also fail to allege facts to demonstrate that it is Defendants—the government actor— that has burdened Plaintiffs religious beliefs.""

The judge elsewhere made mincemeat of the activists' allegations, suggesting they are ""difficult to string together.""

While the Clinton-nominated judge suggested that ""the relief requested will result in the Plaintiffs receiving the dignity and equal treatment they seek,"" she ultimately decided to dismiss the case and deny the motion for preliminary injunction.

At rainbow's end

Activists were enraged by the result — that Christian universities can continue to affirm their values rather than the designs of LGBT social engineers.

Plaintiff Elizabeth Hunter said, ""The government's choice to ignore both the injustice done to me, and the injustice weaponized against hundreds of LGBTQ+ students is deeply disappointing. We deserve better, our country deserves better, and history deserves better. The silence and erasure of LGBTQ+ students should not be a precedent.""

Plaintiff Lucas Wilson, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Calgary, said he was ""enraged,"" claiming the ""court's decision that there is no legal remedy for the harm done to us LGBTQ+ students makes the government complicit in both allowing and perpetuating homophobia and transphobia.""

Wilson, a foreign national, added, ""Very simply, the court could and should have decided to protect queer students; these taxpayer-funded religious schools ought not be privileged over LGBTQ+ students' safety and vitality.""

While LGBT activists are riven over the court's decision, others are touting Aiken's ruling as a victory for freedom in America.

David Cortman, vice president of U.S. litigation for Alliance Defending Freedom, said, ""A federal district court today rightly rejected an unfounded assault on the religious freedom of faith-based educational institutions. Title IX, which applies to schools receiving federal financial assistance, explicitly protects the freedom of religious schools to live out their deeply and sincerely held convictions.""

""A group of activists asked the court to strip that protection away from schools that educate the next generation and advance the common good. The court correctly concluded that Title IX’s religious liberty exemption doesn’t violate any of the plaintiffs’ claimed rights,"" added Cortman.

LBGTQ rainbow flag flying at US embassy to the Vatican for Pride Month — and backlash is swift,"An LBGTQ rainbow flag is flying at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See for the month of June, which is Pride Month.

""The United States respects the dignity and equality of LGBTQI+ people,"" the embassy said on its Instagram page regarding the display of the rainbow flag. ""LGBTQI+ rights are human rights.""

What are the details?

An embassy statement to EWTN News Nightly says in part, ""The United States will lead by the power of our example and pursue policy to end violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics.""

EWTN reported that in previous years the rainbow flag was not flown for Pride Month at the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See but was flown at the U.S. Embassy to Italy. The outlet said the Vatican had no comment.

The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is not in Vatican City but in the same compound as the U.S. Embassy to the Italian Republic, according to LifeSite.

'Shame on our State Department'

As you might imagine, backlash against the display of the rainbow flag was swift.

Nebraska Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts was not pleased with the move, noting on Twitter that ""as a Catholic, I'm curious to know if the Biden-Harris Embassy in the Holy See will promote respect for Catholic teaching on family and freedom of conscience — or whether we can simply expect more political stunts like this.""

Evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham also offered strong words in opposition to the gesture: ""Shame on our State Department for allowing the American Embassy at the Vatican to fly the LGBTQ pride flag. What an insult to the Catholic Church! This flag is promoting an agenda, not a country, & to give it equal billing with the American flag is wrong.""

Others expressed similar sentiments on the embassy's Instagram page:

""Your job is diplomacy NOT touting immorality,"" one commenter wrote.

""This is contrary to Catholic teaching and a slap in the face to actual practicing Catholics,"" another user declared. ""Funny how you don't post this flag in Saudi Arabia and other countries…""

""Actually it's the month of the Sacred Heart,"" another commenter said. ""Not the month of using a flag for false niceties.""

Anything else?

As TheBlaze recently reported, Republican U.S. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York introduced a bill to prevent political flags other than the American flag from being flown outside U.S. embassies around the world in response to the Biden administration authorizing U.S. embassies to fly LGBTQ and Black Lives Matter flags.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lbgtq-rainbow-flag-us-embassy-vatican,2021-06-04
Leaked videos show Disney employees boasting about forcing LGBT agenda into content,"Leaked videos show Walt Disney Company executives and other high-level employees boasting about implementing a ""gay agenda"" through the company's work, whose primary audience is children.

Journalist Christopher Rufo obtained video from an inside ""all-hands"" meeting in which Disney employees discuss Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, which protects students in kindergarten through third grade from receiving classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Disney has expressed outrage over the bill, which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed into law on Monday.

'Gay agenda'

In one video, executive producer Latoya Raveneau — who works on shows like ""Rise Up, Sing Out"" and ""The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder"" — explained she had a ""baffling"" experience when she joined Disney and her pro-LGBT ideas were welcomed.

""In my little pocket of Proud Family Disney TVA, the showrunners were super welcoming. [SVP] Meredith Roberts and our leadership over there has been so welcoming to my not-at-all-secret gay agenda,"" Raveneau boasted.

""Maybe it was that way in the past, but I guess, like, something must have happened ... and then like all that momentum that I felt, that sense of ‘I don’t have to be afraid to have these two characters kiss in the background.’ I was just, wherever I could, just basically adding queerness,"" she admitted. ""No one would stop me, and no one was trying to stop me.""

'Many, many, many LGBTQIA characters'

In another video, Disney corporate president Karey Burke — who describes herself as ""the mother of two queer children, actually, one transgender child and one pansexual child"" — said she was dumbfounded when she learned Disney had produced content with only a ""handful of queer leads.""

""We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough leads, and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters,"" Burke said.

Burke also appeared to make reference to Disney's Reimagine Tomorrow initiative, which pledges, in part, that ""50% of regular and recurring characters across Disney General Entertainment scripted content will come from underrepresented groups.""

Another video showed a Disney production coordinator disclose that Disney is committed to ""exploring queer stories"" and creating stories with enough ""gender nonconforming characters,"" while another video showed Disney diversity and inclusion manager Vivian Ware boast about eliminating the words ""ladies, ""gentlemen,"" ""boys,"" and ""girls"" from language at Disney theme parks.

Lesbian ponies coming to Discovery Family kids show,"The children's show 'My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic' on Discovery Family Channel will be introducing a new lesbian couple .. of ponies.. in an episode airing the week of June 16, one of the show's writers announced.

The episode ""The Last Crusade"" will feature ponies Aunt Holiday and Auntie Loft, and writer Michael Vogel tweeted about the TV premier of the two characters, relating the moment to Pride Month.



That tweet resulted in a few flame wars on Twitter, (which Vogel pretty successfully avoided being dragged into but did snark-Tweetabout), as well as various messages of support for the move.

He also made sure to be expressly clear about the characters, and not to try to walk a line of ambiguous implication.



They are lesbians.

— mktoon (@mktoon) June 15, 2019

Daily Wire's Paul Bois points out that in an interview with Buzzfeed, Vogel, who is gay, stated that ""diversity and representation"" are his top concern in writing kid's shows.

""Diversity and representation are important for kids for so many reasons, and it's my first priority on everything I work on,"" Vogel told Buzzfeed. ""'My Little Pony' has always been about friendship and accepting people (or ponies) that are different from you. So it just felt like something important to do.""

Vogel has, in the past, Tweeted about LGBT actvism, as well as on the topic of Christians and Christianity, and that came up again after the news about the episode got around social media.

The writer is expressly framing the depiction of the characters in terms of activism, and as an effort to advance the ideals and values he holds. That is important to note, because when anyone who does object says so, they'll be characterized as paranoid for suggesting it's a form of activism, despite the fact that the writer intends it to be so and treats it as such himself.

Still, the respectful and calm tweeting, and the abundance of LGBT characters and storylines on TV will probably mean this creates less of splash than it would have just a few years ago, and will end up under considerably less controversy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lebian-my-little-pony-discover-kids,2019-06-16
Left-wing drama teacher at Georgia high school charged with sexual exploitation of children,"A liberal, ""bisexual"" drama teacher at a Georgia high school was charged last week with two counts of sexual exploitation of children.

The Washington County Sheriff's Office announced that 32-year-old Michael Allan Dendy of Milledgeville was arrested Friday after being the subject of investigation for several weeks. Dendy reportedly continued working with kids as the department chair of Washington County High School's drama department right until his arrest.

The arrest

In addition to sexual exploitation of children, Dendy has reportedly been charged with three counts of computer pornography, three counts of improper contact by a teacher, and identity fraud using identifying information of a minor over whom he exercised custodial authority.

Officials indicated that additional charges and arrests are ""likely.""

The sheriff's office told WJBF that an investigation was opened in December following a complaint.



Dr. Rickey Edmond, Washington County School superintendent, said, ""It's just been a terrible situation that we're having to deal with so our focus now is really working with our children and our parents and try to continue on.""

A spokeswoman for the Washington County School District told TheBlaze that the district ""is cooperating with the Sherriff’s Office and other local agencies.""

When asked about Dendy's employment status, possible red flags in recruitment, how long the board of education knew about allegations against Dendy, and what security measures had been taken in the wake of the arrest, the spokeswoman stated, ""The Washington County School District is prohibited from commenting on an active investigation or matters regarding personnel. The safety of our students is a top priority and will continue to be at the forefront of our decision-making processes.""

A source familiar with the matter spoke to TheBlaze on condition of anonymity, claiming that as of now, there has been ""no public comment from the system and no parent meeting of the theater kids. ... [The] superintendent keeps shoving things under the rug and trying to hide things from the public.""



The board of education is tentatively set to meet on Feb. 2 at 501 Industrial Dr. in Sandersville, Georgia.

Red flags

According to his LinkedIn, Dendy has worked in kid-centric environments in multiple states, including at St. Charles High School in Waldorf, Maryland; Griffin High School in Griffin, Georgia; children's toy store Magic Box Toys in New Orleans, Louisiana; the Midsummer Musical Theatre Experience for campers ages 8 to 15 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi; and Starkville High school in Starkville, Mississippi.



The Dispatch reported that Dendy left the Starkville-Oktibbeha Consolidated School District in 2016. When he returned later that year to watch his former students' theatrical performance, the district banned Dendy from all of its campuses.

At the time of his exile, Dendy told the Dispatch that he had been ""told to resign so they could still give me a recommendation if I tried to get another teaching job,"" but in fact, he had been forced to leave the district in 2016.

Starkville Oktibbeha Consolidated School District Board superintendent Dr. Tony McGee had not responded to TheBlaze's request for comment concerning Dendy's exit from his role at the school at the time of publication.

TheBlaze's source indicated that since becoming the drama teacher at Washington County High School in July 2020, Dendy has ""had lots of talks with the kids about him being gay and very WOKE content like drag in schools, [BLM], etc..""



The source noted that Dendy is rumored to have been the administrator of a private Instagram account called WACO Confessions, as well as what may have been corresponding Google forms and a Discord channel.

Kids would allegedly share personal and often sexual information with the administrator of the account, who would post the anonymized details to the feed. Allegedly, the account evolved such that kids would fill out Google docs with their ""confessions,"" then ultimately share nude images with the admin ""in trade for a confession.""

One of Dendy's apparent re-blogs from Tumblr appeared on his Twitter account, which read: ""do you ever just look at little kids and think 'damn, you're gonna be one fine as f*** ...""

When the Post Millennial reported on a drag story event targeting children in November, Dendy tweeted, ""Glad to see the event doing so well!!""



Another user wrote, ""Y r people wanting sex offenders to be around children.""

Dendy replied, ""If I wanted sex offenders around children I’d tell them to go to their local church.""

Dendy's arrest came just days after new details emerged regarding the LGBT activist couple in Georgia arrested this past summer on suspicion of using their two adopted children to make child porn.



TheBlaze reported that in addition to allegedly raping and brutalizing two little boys, William Dale Zulock, 32, who worked as a supervisor at the county's Georgia Department of Driver Services, and Zachary Jacoby Zulock, 35, stand accused of pimping out their child captives to a pedophile ring in Georgia.

"Leftists call Chick-fil-A 'white supremacist, imperialist, capitalist' cult, demand university ban it","A college student environmental group referred to Chick-fil-A as a ""white supremacist, imperialist, capitalist"" cult and demanded that the University of Georgia ban the popular fast-food restaurant chain, Campus Reform reported.

Athens EarthStrike — which apparently boasts some members of the school's Athens Young Democratic Socialists of America group — said Chick-fil-A's ""non-compostable packaging leads to much of the university's food waste"" and that the restaurant ""does not sustainably source poultry, which contributes to climate change via greenhouse gas emissions,"" student publication The Red & Black reported.

Therefore, Athens EarthStrike told the paper, UGA should ban Chick-fil-A.

""The industrial, white supremacist, imperialist, capitalist cults of Chick-fil-A and the Georgia poultry farms as a whole exemplify violence,"" the group added to Campus Reform. ""One of the major poultry suppliers for Chick-fil-A is Koch. Koch targets the most vulnerable people in our immigrant communities to work as employees. Factories are built in low-income communities of color. These jobs are demoralizing, difficult and pollute the environment around them leaving communities in even worse living conditions.""

Athens EarthStrike also told the outlet that it is ""targeting Chick-fil-A because it is a central corporation in [Georgia]'s economy, and we think that it can do better if the people buying its products demand action. Chick-fil-A has made some strides in sustainability, but the company is short-sighted at best. While they plan to transition to antibiotic-free chickens raised in barns rather than cages, this is little more than a cheap marketing ploy.""

What are the group's other demands?



Athens EarthStrike added to Campus Reform that Chick-fil-A should:

No longer use styrofoam cups;

Keep its promise to shift to hormone-free chicken; and

End factory farming.

But EarthStrike wasn't content with those requirements; it also told the outlet that Chick-fil-A is bad for UGA in a social and moral sense.

""We demand that UGA stops supporting a corporation that actively practices both gender discrimination and LGBT discrimination,"" EarthStrike added to Campus Reform. ""We are defending the freedom, livelihood, and health of the student body at UGA and will not stop until Chick-fil-A and UGA answers to these demands or leaves this campus!""

What did students have to say about the group's demands of Chick-fil-A?



""I personally think it's ridiculous,"" student Devon Spiva told the outlet. ""UGA missed its sustainability goals by miles, so attacking Chick-fil-A solely is not going to solve anything.""

Fellow student Erin Cooke — a former Chick-fil-A employee — added to Campus Reform that the restaurant is ""the opposite of wasteful"" but that EarthStrike's demands are far from shocking.

""I'm not surprised, honestly. It's nothing new,"" she told the outlet. ""Those on the left continually go after organizations and companies ... they are threatened by [and Chick-fil-A] no doubt is one of the largest and most popular Christian companies. If Chick-fil-A was removed on campus, there would be an uproar from the student body. It's always the most popular restaurant with lines consistently going out the door.""

What did the university have to say?

Campus Reform said UGA officials, when asked for a comment, simply said ""dining services continuously works to implement sustainable solutions on campus.""

What other diabolical stuff has Chick-fil-A been up to of late?



Chick-fil-A also has faced opposition because of its values, notably when officials from New Jersey's Rider University barred the restaurant from coming on campus because its ""corporate values have not sufficiently progressed enough to align with those of Rider.""

Pittsburgh's school board last October barred district employees and its schools from officially participating in a kids' run sponsored by Chick-fil-A due to support of traditional marriage at the corporate level, which has long irked LGBT and gay-rights advocates.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftests-demand-university-of-georgia-ban-chick-fil-a,2019-01-22
Leftist group that doxxed Kavanaugh plans another protest at his home after would-be assassin arrested there,"Ruth Sent Us, the radical left-wing group that posted the home addresses of six Supreme Court justices online last month, is planning to stage a protest outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home Wednesday evening, hours after an armed man was arrested there for allegedly threatening to kill Kavanaugh.

Early Wednesday morning, police took an armed suspect into custody outside Kavanaugh's home in Montgomery County, Maryland. The suspect had allegedly called emergency dispatchers and said he intended to murder the justice and then kill himself.

FBI Special Agent Ian Montijo filed an affidavit in court that said the suspect, Nicholas John Roske of California, told police he was upset with the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that indicated the court would overturn its abortion precedents and believed Kavanaugh would also vote to loosen gun control laws after the recent mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Roske allegedly found Kavanaugh's address online, bought a Glock pistol, and traveled to Maryland intending to kill him. He has been charged with attempted murder of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

The private home addresses of six Supreme Court justices, including Kavanaugh's, were posted online by Ruth Sent Us in May after a draft majority opinion for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was leaked to Politico. The draft document, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, explained the court's reasoning for upholding Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturning its precedent in Roe v. Wade.

Though there is not yet an official decision by the court, pro-abortion rights activists seethed and began possibly illegal demonstrations against the impending decision outside the private homes of the Republican-appointed justices.



When the Washington Post broke the news Wednesday that an armed suspect making threats against Kavanaugh's life was arrested outside his home, Ruth Sent Us downplayed the incident on Twitter and denied reports that the suspect was carrying a gun and a knife.

""We are committed to non-violence. Fundamentalists will talk non-stop about how our peaceful protests inspired this, rather than the daily mass-murders in America,"" the group tweeted. ""Oh, what was this 'weapon' the 'California man' had? If it was a gun or even a knife, police would say so.""

The FBI affidavit confirmed that the suspect, Roske, had a tactical knife and a Glock 17 pistol with ammunition in his possession when he was taken into custody. He was also carrying pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crow bar, pistol light, duct tape, hiking boots with padding on the outside of the soles, among other items, the FBI said.

When a Twitter user responded to Ruth Sent Us and said the group's tweet ""will not age well,"" the left-wing activists asserted ""Yes, it will,"" and said, ""We're protesting peacefully at his home again tonight.""

Subsequent tweets by Ruth Sent Us announced that the group intends to participate in protests outside of Kavanaugh's and Chief Justice John Roberts' homes in Chevy Chase, Md. Wednesday night.

""We offer our thoughts & prayers to Brett & Ashley Kavanaugh after a California man arrived by taxi near their home, armed with a gun & knife, then called the police on himself to confess his murderous rage against the abusive alcoholic 'Justice',"" the group mockingly tweeted. ""We didn't send him.""

According to another leftist activist group, Downright Impolite, the demonstrations will begin at 7 p.m. ET.

Republican lawmakers responded to the alleged threat against Kavanaugh by calling on the Democratic House majority to pass a bill providing additional security measures for Supreme Court justices.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) railed against House Democrats on the Senate floor Wednesday for blocking the bill — which passed unanimously in the Senate.

""House Democrats need to stop their multi-week blockade against the Supreme Court security bill and pass it before the sun sets today,"" he said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned in May that political violence directed at the court and its justices is ""likely to persist and may increase leading up to and following the issuing of the Court's official ruling"" on abortion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-group-that-doxxed-kavanaugh-plans-another-protest-at-his-home-after-would-be-assassin-arrested-there,2022-06-08
Outraged leftists claim civil rights will be overturned after abortion. But Alito's leaked opinion disproves them.,"Leftists and Democrats stoked fear after the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion revealed the court will overturn Roe v. Wade. They claimed the forthcoming decision is a bellwether for the revocation of other rights.

What was claimed?

Politicians, journalists, and lawyers who are outraged over the decision claimed that LGBT rights, civil rights, and other rights are next.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.): ""As we’ve warned, SCOTUS isn’t just coming for abortion — they’re coming for the right to privacy Roe rests on, which includes gay marriage + civil rights.""

Roberts vowed, ""To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed.

Left-wing Human Rights Campaign revokes Fox's status as a 'preferred LGBTQ' employer over accurate coverage of Disney's 'not-at all-secret gay agenda',"On Friday, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), a scandal-ridden, leftwing advocacy group, revoked Fox Corporation's — the parent company of Fox News — status as a ""preferred LGBTQ friendly employer"" and condemned the company's recent news coverage of the LGBTQ agenda.

CNN Business reported that the move to revoke Fox's standing came in response as ""Fox News relentlessly attacks Disney for the company's belated opposition to the 'Don't Say Gay' law and for the entertainment giant's efforts to incorporate the LGBTQ community into its films and other projects.""

In a statement explaining the decision, HRC said, ""Fox News has a history of sharing misinformation and disinformation about the LGBTQ+.""

""We know from our own research, which we put out earlier this week, what their disinformation and misinformation mean for the LGBTQ+ community: perpetuating stigma and marginalization of transgender and non-binary people,"" HRC continued. ""At a time when transgender people – especially transgender children – are under attack in statehouses across the country, rhetoric has real consequences.""

Aryn Fields, the HRC press secretary, said, ""I can confirm that Fox Corporation no longer has a score of 100 on the Corporate Equality Index.""

""We can no longer allow Fox Corporation to maintain its score if Fox News personalities and contributors continue to deny the existence of transgender people, minimize the violence transgender individuals face, refer to parents of LGBTQ+ youth as perverts, or equate leaders of LGBTQ+ diversity and inclusions efforts with sex offenders,"" Fields said. ""Each of these actions happened in the last 72 hours. Enough is enough.""

According to CNN, Fox News has ""in recent days portrayed Disney as a 'creepy' company aiming to sexualize young children and indoctrinate them with a radical LGBTQ agenda.""

However, recently leaked footage from an ""all-hands"" meeting inside the Walt Disney Company shows that Disney executives and creative leads are very focused on laundering LGBTQ+ narratives into content for children.

Evidently, the misinformation and disinformation that HRC accused Fox of spreading was, in fact, accurate.

During the meeting, Latoya Raveneau, the creative lead for projects like ""Rise Up, Sing Out"" and ""The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder,"" indicated that she was surprised that Disney was so accommodating of her efforts to include a ""gay agenda"" into children's content.

Raveneau said, ""In my little pocket of Proud Family Disney TVA, the showrunners were super welcoming. [SVP] Meredith Roberts and our leadership over there has been so welcoming to my not-at-all-secret gay agenda.""

Similarly, Karey Burke, Disney's corporate president, lamented the fact that Disney isn't doing enough to put the sexuality of gay characters at the forefront of their stories.

She said, ""We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough leads and narratives in which gay characters just get to be gay characters.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftwing-human-rights-campaign-revokes-fox-s-status-as-a-preferred-lgbtq-employer-over-accurate-coverage-of-disney-s-not-at-all-secret-gay-agenda,2022-04-02
Dem legal scholar who supports abortion shreds leftists' criticisms of Alito's leaked draft: 'Nothing radical',"Akhil Reed Amar, a constitutional scholar and professor at Yale Law School, thoroughly dismantled many of the left's critiques about the leaked Supreme Court opinion draft on abortion.

Two weeks ago, Politico published a leaked opinion draft authored by Justice Samuel Alito. Controversy immediately erupted over the draft because it showed the Supreme Court had voted to overturn key abortion precedents. But Amar, writing in an essay for the Wall Street Journal, explained the ""dire assessments"" related to the potential overturn of Roe v. Wade ""don’t stand up to scrutiny.""

On court precedents

The central critique of pro-abortion Americans is that the conservative-leaning court cannot possibly overturn Roe v. Wade because abortion is a settled legal issue.

But Amar pointed out the Supreme Court routinely overturns its own precedents. Plus, the legal doctrine of stare decisis does not apply to the Supreme Court in the same way it applies to lower courts.

""Supreme Court precedents strictly bind lower courts, but they do not bind the Supreme Court itself. Indeed, an essential function of the Court is to revise incorrect or outdated prior rulings. Over the last century, the Court has overruled itself about twice a year—roughly the same rate at which the Court has overturned acts of Congress,"" Amar wrote.

He added, ""Precedents fall for many reasons. Sometimes the world changes in ways that mock the logic and expectations of the old ruling. Sometimes opposing lines of cases evolve and clash, and something must give. Most fundamentally, sometimes the Court comes to believe that an old case egregiously misinterpreted the Constitution, so the old case must go.""

Regarding Roe v. Wade specifically, Amar described the case as ""ripe for reversal.""

""In the eyes of many constitutional experts across the ideological spectrum, it too lacks solid grounding in the Constitution itself, as Justice Alito demonstrates at length in his leaked Dobbs draft,"" Amar explained. ""Even the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was sharply critical of the decision.""

Amar is one of many legal scholars who support ""abortion rights"" but oppose the jurisprudence on which Roe stands.

On the slippery slope

Critics of Alito's opinion draft have argued — without evidence — that overturning abortion rights will lead to other rights being overturned, too, such as civil rights, LGBT marriage rights, and even interracial marriage rights.

Even though Alito wrote in his draft that this will not happen, Amar explained why this is the case.

""In keeping with a long line of cases and the spirit of the written Constitution, Justice Alito notes that rights which are neither explicit nor implicit in the Constitution’s text and history generally need strong roots in the mores and practices of the American people,"" Amar began. ""One way to measure these mores and practices is to count state laws: How many states recognize a putative right and how many try to abridge it? How often and how strictly are laws on the books in fact enforced?""

Therefore, when the majority of U.S. states permit or accept an issue before the court, the court almost always defers to the majority in keeping with the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. But Amar noted that abortion has never been one of those issues.

The ruling in Roe v. Wade, by contrast, has been under fierce and relentless attack for decades in most states. It has been unremittingly condemned in the quadrennial party platforms of one of America’s two major parties, a party that has won half of the presidential elections since Roe. Roe is also decisively different from various contraception and marriage cases because, as Justice Alito’s draft opinion stresses, abortion uniquely involves destroying unborn human life, typically long after conception and implantation.

Amar's conclusion?

The celebrated legal scholar admitted he is a ""Democrat"" who supports abortion but opposes Roe.

""The Court’s ruling in the case was simply not grounded either in what the Constitution says or in the long-standing, widely embraced mores and practices of the country. Perhaps I’m wrong in thinking that, and perhaps the Dobbs draft is wrong too,"" Amar said.

""But,"" he continued, ""there is nothing radical, illegitimate or improperly political in what Justice Alito has written.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/legal-scholar-who-is-democrat-and-supports-abortion-dismantles-leftists-criticisms-against-alito-s-leaked-draft,2022-05-16
Lesbian activist says she was ousted from Baltimore's LGBTQ Commission for using the wrong pronoun to identify a rapist who identified as trans,"A lesbian activist and former member of a city LGBTQ Commission in Baltimore, said that she was kicked off that commission for using the wrong pronoun to refer to a rapist who identified as transgender.

She said that her story was ""as unbelievable and absurd as it is common place.""

What's the story?

On Monday, Julia Beck spoke as part of a panel at the conservative Heritage Foundation. While not a conservative, Julia said that she found herself ""politically homeless,"" and explained why.

According to Julia, she had been kicked off the LGBTQ Commission for the mayor of Baltimore, despite being the sole lesbian on the committee, ""simply for stating biological facts.""

After a months long witch-hunt, I was found guilty of ""violence."" My crime? Using male pronouns to talk about a convicted male rapist who identifies as transgender and prefers female pronouns. It doesn't matter that he sexually assaulted two women in a women's prison, after being transferred there on account of his gender identity. Oh no, it is far more criminal for me to call a male rapist ""he,"" than it is for him to rape.

She recounted the story of how she was accused and an emergency meeting was convened to determine her future at the commission.

Hours went by, but I insisted that sex might actually be important to our work, as it was to my sexuality. But their decision was made long before that night, and i was voted out. The meeting made one thing crystal clear: inclusivity means all voices are welcome except womens. Except lesbians.

Julia accused the ""T"" in the gay rights acronym of ""entirely eclipsing the L, G, and B."" She argued that the current liberal view of gender actually ""cements sexist stereotypes.""

She spoke out against what she saw as a push to identify children who might not conform to traditional gender stereotypes as transgender and subjecting them to medical treatment.

""Children who would likely grow up to be happy gay adults are now being sterilized for defying sex stereotypes,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lesbian-activist-banned-misgendering-rapist,2019-01-29
"Lesbian couple sues fertility clinic after given male embryo: 'He was put there against my will, just like rape'","A New York lesbian couple is suing a fertility clinic after receiving a male embryo instead of a female embryo, likening the incident to rape.

What happened?

Heather Wilhelm-Routenberg and her wife Robin Routenberg-Wilhelm were reportedly assured by a fertility clinic in upstate New York that lab specialists could guarantee their child would be a girl, according to the New York Post.

But when Heather visited the doctor for her 15-week appointment, the couple was stunned: Heather was pregnant with a boy.

Their son was born in December 2020. Now, more than one year later, the couple is suing the CNY fertility clinic on 11 counts, including medical malpractice, breach of contract, and even battery.

What did the women say?

Heather told the Post that she ""flipped out"" when she learned she was pregnant with a boy because she felt like her body ""was taken hostage."" Heather claimed that ""he was put there against my will, just like rape.""

After learning their child was a boy, the fertility clinic engaged in a 7-week investigation to determine how the couple ended up with a boy. The couple was convinced the clinic had implanted someone else's baby. Heather admitted that during the course of the investigation, she had ""no connection to the baby inside,"" and she ""tried not to think about being pregnant.""



""Seven weeks later we got an email that this was our embryo. It was indeed male and it was indeed related to Robbie. No one else had our baby: There was no female baby coming,"" Heather said, the Post reported. ""I was so furious. It felt like a deep betrayal. How the f*** do you mess up that bad?""

Both women said they could not connect to the baby during the entire pregnancy.

After the baby boy was born, Heather said she could not bear touching him because it ""sent electric shockwaves through me."" She said she also experienced ""extreme anxiety"" because when she looked at her son, he would ""contort into the faces of all these grown men that I know."" She said she experienced ""complex postpartum depression,"" including ""several incidences of suicidal ideation.""

Now, the couple declares they love their son. But they are suing the clinic because they claimed the fertility clinic, by implanting a male embryo in Heather, robbed their son of an emotional connection with his mother.

""We think our son deserved that bond from the start,"" Heather said.

Why did they not want a boy?

The couple told the New York Post they did not want a son because Heather experienced sexual assault when she was younger, and because of gruff male stereotypes.

""We didn’t want to have a boy because of the assaults and because of the socialization of boys — there’s constant socialization of what it means to be a 'real man.' People say, 'Oh, he’s a boy, let him hit you,' and all the camouflage and guns don’t help. It reinforces masculinity, and that’s a reminder of the assaults every time,"" Heather told the Post.

Robin agreed, ""It’s not only about the in-utero and birth experience, it’s about the socialization that a boy has in the world — even while we fight against these social norms, this repeated narrative of forced masculinity — and we did not sign up for that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lesbian-couple-sues-fertility-clinic-after-given-male-embryo,2022-03-28
Lesbian couple says vandalism of their 'Little Queer Library' feels like 'censorship' and hatred,"A lesbian couple says their ""Little Queer Library"" has been vandalized numerous times and they say it feels like hatred and ""censorship.""

Krysta Petrie and Katie Cohen told WCVB-TV that their community library offering queer and other LGBTQ books has been vandalized four times in as many months.

The couple built the tiny library about two years ago.

The last vandal was a man who was captured on video surveillance grabbing all of the books and tossing them into a garbage bag. About $1,000 worth of books were taken, police said.

“This last time in addition to taking the books, they also scattered contents of the library on the ground, like the pencils and bookmarks and stuff like that, and then they ripped up our plants and put it into the book box,” Petrie said.

“They had a bunch of bags and spent 10 minutes, walked down sidewalk,” Cohen explained. “It’s like they know that we have a camera. They were careful to hide [their] face and come at night.”

The couple believes they know the motivation for the vandalism.

""There's really only a couple reasons why it could happen, one is straight up hate, LGBT hate. They just don't want us in the community or something,"" said Petrie.

""[It] really fells a lot like censorship,"" said Cohen.

Some of the neighbors are offering their support for the couple and their mission to provide LGBTQ propaganda to the community.

""This is ridiculous,"" said Diane Coveney, a neighbor who claimed, ""Waltham is better than this.""

Petrie added that one local child on his bike vandalized the library with paint markers. She conjectured that he was challenged to do it ""by someone else in the school system probably.""

"'Queer' activists disrupt, protest Pete Buttigieg event in San Francisco: 'Stop using your gay card'","Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg may be the first openly gay candidate behind a major presidential campaign, but some gay activists who interrupted and protested his fundraiser on Friday say they expect more out of his policy positions.

According to a story at The Guardian published on Friday, Buttigieg was answering a question about his husband at an event in San Francisco when he was interrupted by ""two queer activists"" who stood up in the audience. Video of the event from the same outlet shows the duo's shouts quickly being drowned out by boos and chants of ""boot-edge-edge"" from the surrounding sea of supporters.

www.youtube.com

""I respect your activism, but this is a gathering for supporters of our campaign and I just got a question about my husband and I'm really excited to answer it,"" the candidate says in response to the disturbance on video. The two were later taken out of the event.



One of the demonstrators said that the candidate's problems is his supposed moderate stances and the kind of voters to which he's supposedly trying to appeal.

""I'm definitely proud of the fact that a gay candidate has made it thus far,"" Celi Tamayo-Lee, one of the activists booted from the event, told the newspaper outside the event, ""but it's hard to enjoy or appreciate when his stances are so middle of the road and speak to a predominantly white, upper class audience.""



According to the story, the two were part of a larger group protesting outside the event, one of whom also raised race-and-class-based complaints about it.

""We need better, we deserve better,"" Adiel Pollydore, a 26-year-old protester who is black and ""queer,"" told the newspaper. ""There's a level of irony that this event costs hundreds of dollars to attend in the Mission, a historically Latinx and immigrant neighborhood. What does it say that this event is not accessible to the folks that live in the neighborhood where it's being held?""

According to the story, one of Buttigieg's supporters called the protesters ""homophobes"" after the event, to which one responded, ""We're all gay!""

According to PinkNews, the group behind the protest and the disruption is called ""Queers Against Pete,"" which takes issue with the candidate for ""claiming to be in community with us"" while being ""out of touch.""

An open letter from the group says that the former college town mayor ""simply falls short"" and is ""not fit to be President of the United States"" for a list of reasons including his stances on ""free"" college, ending cash bail, creating an ""alternative to police,"" his opposition to Medicare for All, and the fact that he hasn't pledged to halt deportations or decriminalize border crossings.

""He's not representative of our community. He may be representative of part, but not all,"" gay San Francisco filmmaker Jethro Patalinghug, who attended the protest, told Mercury News. He added, ""Pete has a record of dismantling houses in the South Bend and Indiana for black and latino communities.

LGBT activists lash out at Pete Buttigieg over his bell ringing for 'homophobic' Salvation Army,"Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is taking heat from LGBT activists, after photos emerged online showing him volunteering for The Salvation Army in the past. The activists claim the organization is ""homophobic,"" and several said his bell ringing has cost him their vote.

What are the details?

On Tuesday, LGBT publication Out magazine printed a story declaring ""Pete Buttigieg volunteered for the homophobic Salvation Army,"" reporting on photos of the candidate bell ringing for the organization's Red Kettle Ring Off in 2017.

Online activists reacted to the news with fury, accusing Buttigieg — who, is openly gay — of committing an offense so appalling that he lost their vote.







""This could only be worse if he was holding a Chick-fil-A in front of a Hobby Lobby,"" one Twitter user wrote in reaction to the article, referencing two other businesses accused of being anti-LGBTQ because of their owners' Christian beliefs.

Some called for the mayor to drop out of the presidential race over the photos, while others called Buttigieg names. Several also said Buttigieg let the LGBTQ community down with his actions. Another accused the candidate of ""pandering to white supremacists,"" and someone else ordered the mayor: ""turn in your gay card.""



Activists were also quick to accuse Buttigieg of rubbing salt in an existing wound, after the mayor said earlier this year that he would like to see the LGBTQ community find common ground with popular chicken chain Chick-fil-A — a frequent target of far-left ire.

Anything else?

Not everyone was critical of Buttigieg's past ties to The Salvation Army. In fact, several people rushed to his defense, noting the absurdity of the outrage.

Conservative columnist Brad Polumbo — who happens to also be gay — tweeted, ""It's a charity that helps poor people you bleeping idiots.""

Merriam-Webster adds three new transgender terms to dictionary update,"Merriam-Webster announced recently that it added hundreds of words to its dictionary, including three transgender terms.

Gender nonconforming, top surgery, and bottom surgery were among the 640 words that made it into the April update.

The more than 190-year-old company said that the revision ""mirrors the culture's need to make sense of the world with words.""

""It all begins, in each case, with evidence of words in use. Each word follows its own path at its own pace before its use is widespread enough to be included in a dictionary,"" the company explained on its website.

So, what do the LGBTQ terms mean?

The new LGBTQ terms are defined by Merriam-Webster as:

Gender nonconforming: exhibiting behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits that do not correspond with the traits typically associated with one's sex.



Top surgery: a type of gender confirmation surgery in which a person's breasts are removed or augmented to match their gender identity.



Bottom surgery: a type of gender confirmation surgery in which a person's genitalia are altered to match their gender identity.""

What is the reaction from the LGBTQ community?

Forbes contributor Ashlee Fowlkes, who writes about ""LGBTQ inclusion and equality,"" praised Merriam-Webster for adding the terms to the dictionary.

""The impact of these additions cannot be overstated,"" Fowlkes wrote in a column on Tuesday. ""The actions of the Trump administration have given rise to increased uncertainty in the transgender community.

""And so, in the midst of what might feel like an all-out attack on transgender-related protections, having your existence acknowledged and affirmed by such a well-established entity is invaluable.""

Some LGBT groups tweeted the ""great news.""

What do opponents say?

One Twitter user described the move as a continuation of ""the dumbing down of the English language.""

What are some of the other additions?



New words for business include, gig economy, and vulture capitalism.

Gig economy ""involves the use of temporary or freelance workers to perform jobs typically in the service sector.""

And vulture capitalism, which was ""first used in the 'greed is good' 1980s,"" made the cut. It now means ""a form of venture capitalism in which aggressive methods are used to buy a distressed business with the intention of selling it at a profit.""

There are also new idioms.

For instance, snowflake officially refers to both ""someone regarded or treated as unique or special"" and ""someone who is overly sensitive.""

The company extended the word purple to mean ""the blending of red and blue to the metaphorical level, purple can now refer to geographical areas where voters are split between Democrats and Republicans.""

And Goldilocks, the character from the 1939 fairytale ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears,"" found a place in the addition that astronomers will likely find is ""just right."" The metaphor refers to ""an area of planetary orbit in which temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold to support life.""

Dem mayor claims truck incident is 'terrorist attack' against LGBT people. Then the truth comes out.,"Democrats pounced on a tragic incident that unfolded Saturday at a Fort Lauderdale LGBT Pride celebration in which one person was killed when a truck ran into a crowd celebrating Pride Month.

But, as it turned out, the driver of that vehicle was probably not a hate-filled individual who specifically targeted the LGBT event.

What happened?

Two people were struck — and one of them later died — when a white truck accelerated into a crowd as the Stonewall Pride Parade was starting Saturday evening, WPLG-TV reported. The incident happened in Wilton Manors, Florida.

According to WPLG, ""The white pickup truck was lined up with other floats when it accelerated and ran over two men standing by."" The truck then crashed through a nearby gate and came to rest in a plant nursery.

Witnesses reportedly said the driver claimed he hit the people by accident. The driver, who was reportedly wearing Fort Lauderdale Gay Men's Chorus t-shirt, was quickly apprehended by police.

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who was participating in the event by riding in a convertible car, was almost struck by the truck. She later said:

I am deeply shaken and devastated that a life was lost and others seriously injured at tonight's Wilton Manors Stonewall Pride Parade. My staff, volunteers and I are, thankfully, safe. I want to thank our first responders for their heroic efforts as both police and emergency medical personnel stepped into action quickly. We're praying for the victims and their loved ones as law enforcement investigates and I am providing them with whatever assistance I can. I am so heartbroken by what took place at this celebration. May the memory of the life lost be for a blessing

The FBI has reportedly joined the investigation.

What claims were made?

Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis, a Democrat, claimed the incident was a deliberate attack, characterizing it as a ""terrorist attack"" against the LGBT community.

""This is a terrorist attack against the LGBT community,"" Trantalis told WPLG. ""This is exactly what it is. Hardly an accident. It was deliberate, it was premeditated, and it was targeted against a specific person. Luckily they missed that person, but unfortunately, they hit two other people.""

The mayor's claims were amplified by the media, and the hashtag #DeathSantis later trended on social media. Critics of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) blamed him and cited a recent law he signed providing civil immunity to some drivers who hit protesters.

What is the truth?

Justin Knight, president of the Fort Lauderdale Gay Men's Chorus, explained in a statement the truck driver was a member of his group.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic accident that occurred when the Stonewall Pride Parade was just getting started,"" Knight said. ""Our fellow Chorus members were those injured and the driver was also a part of the Chorus family. To my knowledge, this was not an attack on the LGBTQ community. We anticipate more details to follow and ask for the community's love and support.""

Did the mayor apologize?



In a statement released Sunday afternoon, Trantalis did not apologize for calling the incident a ""terrorist attack,"" though he acknowledged that ""a picture is emergeing of an accident in which a truck careened out of control.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lgbt-truck-accident-not-terrorist-attack,2021-06-20
Florida LGBT youth center deletes social media after disturbing sexual posts are revealed,"The leading ""off-gender""/LGBT youth organization in northeast Florida has deleted many posts and several social media pages after backlash over content allegedly marketed towards teens as young as 13 was revealed.

The Florida Standard reports that the organization called Jasmyn deleted its Instagram account just hours after the outlet reached out for comment. Several of the posts on its youth-targeted Instagram page included messages about bondage and watching pornography.

""Up until yesterday, JASMYN operated two Instagram accounts – one specifically for youth (@jasmynjax), and another for adults (@jasmynlgbtq),"" the Floridian publication reads. Adding that the organization's youth-facing Twitter and Facebook pages have been taken down.

In November 2022, Duval County Public Schools, a Florida school school district, cut ties with the organization over inappropriate ""program materials.""

Jasmyn CEO Cindy Watson described the decision as ""an overreaction to a far right extremist website spreading inflammatory misinformation about our HIV prevention work with young adults"" in reference to reports.

The content in question is a game called ""Dick Match"" and features illustrations of genitals, however the organization claims it was never presented to any children. ""It is not true that we play this card game, or anything sexually explicit like this, with young people under the age of 17 — certainly not with 13 year olds at JASMYN,"" said the CEO.

While WJCT News mentions ""a card game showing photos of genitals,"" News4Jax out of Jacksonville simply describes the game as an ""adult card game"" while describing the content that lead to the severed relationship.

However, the Florida Standard states that the youth-targeted Instagram account promoted an event involving the aforementioned game, without any ""adult only"" or ""18+"" disclaimers.

Other now-deleted posts offer additional disturbing content for an account that was allegedly intended for youth consumption.

In 2021, an Instagram story featuring sex toys in the shape of a heart was posted.

Another post from August 2021 describes dozens of sexual acts, positioning ""society's"" view of sexual acts as boring or limited.

Photos involving men in scantily-clad outfits wearing bras, cut-off shorts, and mesh shirts were used to allegedly promote dance lessons for ""youth 13-18.""

Along with Halloween party photos that frequently featured sex toys are now-private TikTok videos that feature a woman provocatively posing while holding a sex toy and wearing a ""Protect Trans Kids"" hoodie.

Other posts included gift card incentives for “Ages 13–24” to participate in ""3MV chats,” which are informational sessions designed to prevent men from contracting AIDS or STDs and encouraging them to practice safe sex. Typically, these studies have been focused on adults, with both Yale and Rochester University conducting studies with participants over 18 years old only.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lgbt-youth-center-deletes-socials,2022-12-06
LGBTQ activists pushing parents to bring children to pride parades: ‘Children can handle the kink’,"Some LGBTQ activists are apparently pushing some parents to bring their children to LGBTQ pride parades because they believe that it can only benefit the children involved.

What are the details?

HuffPost Canada published an article on Thursday highlighting several activists who advocate for children to attend LGBT pride parades.

The article, titled, ""Are Pride Parades Kid-Friendly? Parents Say Children Can Handle The Kink,""

One activist, a self-described ""semi-retired sex therapist"" named ""Ren,"" said that children are very safe at such places.

""I can't imagine a safer place for families to bring children,"" Ren said. ""[F]rom kink to nakedness, [it's] an excellent opportunity for parents to do unbiased sex education.

""Children benefit from seeing people loving one another, from seeing diversity and inclusion,"" the activist added. ""Children suffer from seeing violence and fear, hatred and divisiveness. We found and built our tribe at these gatherings.""

Another activist, writer S. Bear Bergman, added, ""First of all, nobody likes nakedness more than children.""

Bergman continued, ""On the list of things that I don't want my children ever to be exposed to are: compulsory heterosexuality, demonstrations of sexism, demonstrations of racism, demonstrations of ableism, violence. These are all way higher on the list than some homosexual's tuchus.""

What else?

Bergman insisted there's no valid reason for children to miss out on pride parades.

""[I]t's a fun day, there are a lot of bubbles, rainbow streamers, and enjoyable performances,"" he explained. ""It's their right as queer spawn. And as a parent, I might want to take my kids to Pride, because they might be lesbian, gay, bi, trans, queer, or two-spirit.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lgbtq-activists-pushing-parents-to-bring-children-to-pride-parades-children-can-handle-the-kink,2019-06-18

LGBTQ group Facebook post says campus veterans ‘jeopardize’ students’ well-being and their ‘patriotism’ is a problem,"A Facebook page for two LGBTQ activist groups at Oregon State University expressed wishes to prevent a campus veteran group from using a student lounge at the university.

The post explained said that permitting the student veteran group to use the lounge could alienate other students and their well-being, and pointed to the group's ""problematic"" patriotism.

What are the details?

The groups — the Pride Center and LGBTQ+ Multicultural Support Network — shared a since-deleted update on Facebook that said allowing the veteran group to use the Student Experience Center Involvement Lounge would be detrimental to the growth of other student groups as well as the community at large.

A portion of the post complained that ""communities that our organizations serve are vulnerable to the ideological and practical consequences"" due to the notion of the veteran group using the lounge.

The post also called for the university to ban the veteran group — the Veteran Student Association — from using the lounge.

""We also wish to express our concern for the particular type of American patriotism that would be promoted by centralizing the Veteran Student Association in the [Student Experience Center],"" the post read. ""US military interventions abroad have been responsible for killing our LGBTQ+ siblings.""

The post added, ""We aim to resist the pain that U.S. militarism has caused our siblings in struggle, and we denounce the glorification of the system that is responsible for this violence.""

The groups conclude the post by insisting that putting the veterans group in a centrally located campus spot ""jeopardizes the wellbeing of many vulnerable students, including those a part of the LGBTQ+ community.""

Image source: archive.today screenshot

What have people said?

Peter Halajian, president of the College Republicans at the school, told Campus Reform that the post is ""disgusting.""

“[N]o one is forcing the Pride Center to be in favor of any war; past, present, or future!"" he insisted. ""The fact that the mere sight of veterans services on campus is disturbing to them is just plain sad.""

""The Pride Center can't on the one hand claim to support veterans' well-being (or support LGBT+ veterans at all for that matter) and then be against a conveniently located center for them to get the services and support that they need,"" Halajian added.

On Thursday, the group shared a follow-up post after deleting the above-mentioned missive, explaining that the initial post represented ""the views of individual students,"" and not necessarily the groups at large.

A portion of the post read, ""You may notice that we have removed an open letter posted to this page on March 15, 2019, about the relocation of OSU's Military and Veteran Resources office. We have done so because the open letter was written by and represents the views of individual students, not the Pride Center or SOL: LGBTQ+ Multicultural Support Network as organizations, the department of Diversity & Cultural Engagement, or Oregon State University.""

""While Pride Center and SOL student staff have the right to make statements as individuals on issues that are important to them, the posting of this open letter violated our communication policy,"" the statement continued. ""We recognize the statement has been a source of pain for many individuals. At times such as these, we need to consider all members of our community and their diverse experiences in order to build the brave space we strive for, where community members engage in challenging, yet respectful conversations through conscious questioning and active listening.""

The posting concluded, ""We welcome and support our veterans. And we share with you that the Pride Center assistant director is working with the Military and Veteran Resources advisor to create healing spaces for those who are hurting, as well as dialogue spaces for the larger campus to move toward a stronger sense of community and mutual understanding. We will be sharing concrete next steps soon.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lgbtq-group-student-veterans-jeopardize-students-wellbeing,2019-03-26
LGBTQ sports outlet calls trans MMA fighter 'bravest athlete in history' for fighting women as a biological male,"An opinion columnist for the LGBTQ sports media outlet Outsports called transgender mixed martial arts fighter Fallon Fox the ""bravest athlete in history"" in a recent article. Fox is a biological male who fights women.

Fox came out as transgender in 2013 and was predictably criticized for attempting to compete in violent physical combat with women as a biological male who only identifies as a woman.

The Outsports writer, Cyd Zeigler, credited Fox for persevering through the harsh criticism and continuing to pursue a fighting career.

In 2013, when Fallon Fox came out publicly as trans in professional mixed martial arts, she was the target of a torrent of hatred I have literally never seen targeting an LGBTQ athlete. While certainly some writers took thoughtful approaches to understanding this emerging dynamic of trans athletes in women's sports, still many more, like Joe Rogan, were vicious for the sake of being vicious.



Yet Fox stood strong and continued to push for, and earn, her right to compete. Except for one fateful match, she also won every time she stepped into the professional ring.

One of the women Fox defeated in a fight, Tamikka Brents, said afterward that there was a noticeable difference between fighting Fox and fighting a woman. Brents suffered a concussion and suffered several broken orbital bones during the loss.

""I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night,"" Brents said.

Fox has undergone both hormone replacement therapy and gender transition surgery. Fox said because he no longer has testicles, he has lower testosterone than most women he fights, putting him at a disadvantage.

Rogan is facing backlash for his 2013 stance on Fox, especially in light of his sort-of endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the Democratic presidential nomination.

""She calls herself a woman but I tend to disagree,"" Rogan said in 2013. ""And she used to be a man but now she has had, she's a transgender which is (the) official term that means you've gone through it, right? And she wants to be able to fight women in MMA. I say no f***ing way.

""I say if you had a d**k at one point in time, you also have all the bone structure that comes with having a d**k,"" Rogan continued. ""You have bigger hands, you have bigger shoulder joints. You're a f***ing man. That's a man, OK? You can't have... that's... I don't care if you don't have a d**k any more.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lgbtq-sports-outlet-calls-trans-mma-fighter-bravest-athlete-in-history-for-fighting-women-as-a-biological-male,2020-01-24
"Lia Thomas, wins, race, Ivy League Championships","University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male, wiped out the competition while competing against women in a 500-yard freestyle on Thursday, taking the win at the Ivy League Championships after finishing the race more than seven seconds ahead of the second place finisher.

The decisive victory provides further evidence to critics who contend that biological males should not be allowed to compete in athletic events designated for women.

While racing a leg in an 800-yard freestyle relay on Wednesday, Thomas barely finished in first, edging out a Iszac Henig of Yale, a biological woman who identifies as a transgender man. While Thomas won the leg, Penn ultimately finished the race in third, according to swimmingworldmagazine.com.

Thomas participated in a 200 free relay on Thursday, but the team came in fourth.

While many Americans already oppose allowing men to compete in women's sports, the controversy surrounding Thomas has drawn significant attention.

The swimmer annihilated the competition in December by finishing a 1650 free clocking in about 38 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.

According to data collected across 13 Gallup polls conducted in 2021, 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as LGBT — only 10% of U.S. LGBT adults identify as transgender, which amounts to 0.7% of all U.S. adults, according to Gallup.

Correction: This story previously said that Thomas won a 1650 free by more than 38 seconds — the win was actually just under 38 seconds and the story has been corrected to note that Thomas won that race by about 38 seconds.

Exit polls: 6 in 10 Democratic Super Tuesday voters are liberal; 1 in 10 are LGBT,"Liberal voters are commanding the electorate in the Super Tuesday Democratic primary contests, according to exit polls conducted by NBC News.

The report found that a whopping 62% of voters polled considered themselves to be liberal, with over a quarter classifying themselves as ""very liberal."" Thirty-six percent said they considered themselves ""somewhat liberal,"" while only 37% avoided the liberal tag and said they considered themselves to be ""moderate"" or ""conservative.""

Additionally, the NBC News exit poll found that 10% of Super Tuesday voters identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.

Those who identified as LGBT were ""strikingly"" liberal, the report noted. Half of the LGBT voters said they considered themselves ""very liberal,"" while another 30% characterized themselves as ""somewhat liberal."" Just 4% said they considered themselves ""conservative.""

The NBC News exit poll was conducted in 12 of 14 states that held nominating contests Tuesday.

Super Tuesday is the biggest day on the Democratic primary calendar, with 1,357 delegates, or one-third of the total count, up for grabs.

Given the liberal hold on the electorate in a majority of Super Tuesday states, one might expect progressive candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to have a blowout night. But at the time of this story's publication, former Vice President Joe Biden, considered the moderate choice, had been projected to win Virginia and North Carolina, while Sanders was projected to win Vermont.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-lgbt-voters-super-tuesday,2020-03-04

Liberals lash out at Newsweek over opinion article linking transgender activism to homophobia,"Transgender activists and supporters lashed out at Newsweek on Friday after it published an opinion piece claiming some transgender extremism was motivated by homophobia.

The opinion piece penned by Ben Appel argued that some transgender activism was actually aimed at erasing homosexuality.

""Sure, the religious far right remains something of a threat, and I, like any other gay person, can still be stung by anti-gay slurs and can fear the threat of violence in less-accepting spaces. But today I am equally fearful of the radical activists I once longed to emulate, activists who push a regressive, anti-liberal agenda that reifies gender stereotypes, downplays the seriousness of long-term medicalization and ultimately seeks to abolish my identity—for without biological sex, there is no homosexuality,"" wrote Appel.

""Today, the least-accepting spaces for people like me are, of all places, the halls of LGBT rights organizations, where the threat might not be violence but is nevertheless terrible stigmatization and shame,"" he concluded.

Critics attacked Newsweek for daring to publish an article opposed to the aims of the transgender lobby.

""Nice of Newsweek to publish a 'please save the gays but destroy the trans' article. Top notch work there,"" tweeted one detractor.

""What the hell is this dude smoking? What kind of sick twisted view do you have to have to believe that trans kids are more accepted than gay, lesbian, and bisexual children? This is anti trans propoganda similar to the LGB Alliance. Shame on Newsweek for running this,"" replied one angry critic.

""The notion that people are trans just to avoid being gay, currently being legitimitized by Newsweek, is so so far from reality. Plus, it blatantly erases gay trans people. It is anti-trans bigotry, full stop,"" read one popular tweet.

""Hey @Newsweek would you like to explain why you published this deeply transphobic article spreading dangerous lies about trans people?"" responded another critic.

Others were even more incensed when author J.K. Rowling, who has become a target of the pro-transgender lobby, tweeted the article.

Libs of TikTok creator defiantly refuses to back down after identity unmasked: 'Never gonna happen',"The creator behind the Libs of TikTok account took a defiant stand Tuesday, saying in an interview that she will not back down in the face of intimidation from the mainstream media.

What is the background?

The Washington Post published a story on Tuesday unmasking the identity of the woman who runs the popular Twitter account.

The Post claimed the story was necessary because the account has impacted the public discourse. However, the story amplifies a narrative from Media Matters that claims the account is harmful to the LGBT community. In reality, Libs of TikTok simply reposts videos of teachers who espouse woke and progressive ideology, thus giving them more attention.

What did the creator say?

Speaking with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the creator of Libs of TikTok confirmed she will not back down.

""I think that what I am doing is very effective and I think that a lot of people wanted to shut me down, they wanted to intimidate me into silence,"" the woman said. ""Unfortunately for them, that’s just never gonna happen.""

Fortunately, the woman confirmed she is bunkered down in a safe location despite having her address unmasked because the Post initially linked to her real estate license, which included the personal details.



""The past two days have been very chaotic and overwhelming. I had to make some travel plans really fast that I was not planning on earlier,"" she said. ""There was a little bit of coordination that had to happen, and I am now in a location where I don't think anyone would find me, not at any of the locations that [reporter] Taylor Lorenz leaked or that anyone can find. But it’s been a little tough, but I'm not going to let this get me down.""

Anything else?

Since the Washington Post published the exposé, Libs of TikTok has amassed an additional 200,000 followers on Twitter. That means more people will now see content reposted by Libs of TikTok precisely because of the Post's story.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/libs-of-tiktok-creator-defiantely-refuses-to-back-down-after-identity-unmasked-never-gonna-happen,2022-04-20
"Los Angeles school hosts LGBTQ clubs for kids as young as 4 years old to teach transgender mutilation, 'two-spirit' sexuality","The Los Angeles Unified School District's Office of Human Relations, Equity, and Diversity hosted a 10-week online club for LGBTQ elementary school students, according to a Wednesday report from the Federalist.

The group — dubbed the ""Rainbow Club"" — promoted ""two-spirit"" sexuality and taught the intricate details of gender reassignment surgery.

The group hosted online meetings over a period of 10 weeks.

What are the details?

According to the report, the virtual club was geared toward ""LGBTQ+ elementary school students, their friends, and their grown-ups.""

The outlet reported that the District Office of Human Relations, Equity, and Diversity created a variety of ""short, student-facing Push & Play lessons for educators to utilize in their advisory classes.""



""Several of these presentations pushed leftwing gender theory, including one that even informed students of the 'two-spirit' Native American sexuality, which has allegedly 'survived centuries of colonial violence and prejudice,'"" the outlet added.

One such production featured a host who complained about European colonizers' effects on Native Americans after they ""imposed homophobia, rigid binary gender roles, and misogyny"" — which the host suggested were a byproduct of the Christian faith.

Another production titled ""Queering Culture"" discussed drag queen history, and a lesson titled ""LGBT Etiquette"" taught students to practice introducing themselves with their preferred personal pronouns such as ""he/him,"" ""she/her,"" ""they/them,"" and more. One of the speakers in the video also described the fact that there are only two sexes as the product of a ""mob mentality.""

The club also provided a handbook of definitions for its students, including various LGBTQ-themed terminology such as ""top surgery"" — the ""surgical removal of healthy breasts"" for gender transitions — and ""down low,"" a term that means ""men who identify as straight but who secretly have sex with men.""

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Unified School District told the outlet that the point of the club is to help children understand their identities.

""The Rainbow Club is an online meeting for parents and their elementary school-aged children to meet, connect, and talk about topics related to their identities,"" the spokesperson explained. ""The goal of the Rainbow Club is to support families of elementary aged children. The meeting is led by clinicians. Participants talk and do art projects.”

The club is set to reconvene next semester.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/los-angeles-school-lgbtq-clubs-for-kids,2021-12-15
Louisiana man admits to trying to murder and dismember a gay man he met on LGBT dating app Grindr,"A Louisiana man admitted to trying to murder and dismember a gay man he met on the LGBT dating Grindr, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney General.

Holden White was hospitalized with grievous wounds after he had his first date with Chance Seneca, who is now 21 years old.



White has said that he interacted with Seneca for a month without any red flags before the attack on June 20, 2020, that nearly cost him his life.

""He left the room to get something and then he came back. And when he came back he came up behind me and that's when he wrapped a cord around my neck,"" said White.

Seneca choked White so hard the blood vessels burst in his face and he passed out.

""The next thing I remember is being in the bathtub and he was slicing open my left wrist,"" said White, who said he was also naked at the time.

The man faded in and out of consciousness while Seneca watched him. He said that he remembered being stabbed in the neck.

He slipped into a coma and awoke three days later in a hospital. He was told that Seneca called the police and told them he had killed a man. White had six stab wounds to the neck and his hands were nearly sawed off.

""Seneca acknowledged that he intended to murder and dismember H.W. for the purpose of satisfying his homicidal urges, and that he had planned to continue murdering until he was caught or killed,"" read the statement from the Attorney General.



Seneca pled guilty to one count of kidnapping as a part of a plea agreement. He faces life in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced on January 25, 2023. He could also face hate crime charges.

White said that his mission in life was to make sure Seneca stayed behind bars to prevent him from hurting anyone else.

Pro-life cop wins settlement after being suspended for praying at abortion clinic,"The city of Louisville, Kentucky agreed this week to pay a $75,000 settlement to a Louisville Metro Police Department officer who was suspended last year for praying outside an abortion clinic while off-duty.

What are the details?

Officer Matthew Schrenger filed a lawsuit last October claiming his constitutional and civil rights were violated when he was placed on paid administrative leave for over four months while the police department conducted an investigation into his actions.

""A quiet, off-duty prayer, on a public sidewalk, resulted in Schrenger being immediately suspended for over four months, stripped of his police powers, and placed under investigation,"" the 13-year police veteran's lawyers wrote in the complaint.

Several months prior, on Feb. 20, Schrenger was photographed in his police uniform while walking and praying quietly near the EMW Women’s Surgical Center prior to the start of his shift. The officer insisted he was not protesting, but EMW staff claimed he intimidated patients and medical staff with his uniform and gun, WAVE-TV reported.

Schrenger also claimed in the suit that Democratic Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Police Chief Erika Shields, and others ""persecuted"" him for praying for pro-life causes outside of work while other officers participated in LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter demonstrations without receiving any discipline at all.

The department ultimately lifted Schrenger's suspension in June, 2021 and reinstated him to active duty after Shields found that the policy preventing uniformed officers from engaging in political activities had been enforced sporadically.

What else?

But Schrenger alleged in the complaint that as a result of the suspension, he suffered humiliation, lost pay, and ""lost much of his job satisfaction, due to LMPD’s purposeful mistreatment of him despite his many years of loyal and exemplary service.""

In a press release, the Thomas More Society, the law firm representing Schrenger, celebrated the success of the lawsuit and suggested the city’s ""quick offer"" shows it ""knows it committed a significant and inexcusable violation of a loyal officer’s constitutional rights.”

Senior counsel Matt Heffron added, ""The treatment of Officer Schreger was particularly galling considering other Louisville police officers previously had marched, while on-duty and in uniform, in political protests that apparently were approved by the police department.""

""The unfair discipline revealed undeniably content-based discrimination against Officer Schrenger’s personal pro-life views and violated his First Amendment rights,"" Heffron stated. ""He was treated very differently than other officers who had undeniably engaged in true political protest and activism while participating in LGBT and Black Lives Matter demonstrations.""

Schrenger's lawsuit sought damages, attorney fees, as well as back and front pay.

Progressive magazine editor encourages people to have sex with HIV-positive partners,"The editor of Queerty, a progressive online magazine and newspaper, encouraged readers to put aside their fears of catching HIV and strongly consider dating and even having sex with people who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.

In ""What you stand to lose by not having sex with people with HIV,"" David Hudson argues that gay men should consider ""the potential consequences of [their] particular decisions"" not to have sex with individuals who have HIV. ""Refusing to entertain the idea of dating an HIV-positive person might just mean you miss out on the love of your life,"" he said.

""If you find yourself single and contemplating why, bear in mind it might be because you blocked 'Mr Right' when you read he was HIV positive on Grindr,"" the editor said.

Hudson concludes, ""Of course, some will say, 'My perfect man doesn't HIV!' Well, I hope you're not too old before you realize: Nobody's perfect.""

The writer also noted that concerns with contracting the virus may be overblown. ""If someone is HIV positive, knows their status, is on effective medication and has consistently had an undetectable viral load, they cannot pass on the virus,"" he wrote. Plus, ""PrEP is also widely available in the US and several other countries to prevent people from acquiring HIV. And condoms are also, of course, widely available.""

""Choose less risky sexual behaviors""

However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while the use of condoms during sexual intercourse and taking medication can greatly reduce the risk of passing or contracting the virus, avoiding sex remains ""the only 100% effective HIV prevention option.""

""Choose less risky sexual behaviors,"" the CDC advises. ""The longer you wait to start having oral, vaginal, or anal sex, the fewer sexual partners you are likely to have in your lifetime. Having fewer partners lowers your chances of having sex with someone who has HIV or another STD.""

It is true that people who ""know their status"" and take medication are unlikely to transmit the virus, as the Queerty article claimed. The Department of Health and Human Services notes that individuals ""with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex,"" but not everyone who has HIV is aware they are infected.

Approximately 165,000 people in the U.S. are unaware they have HIV, according to government statistics.

HIV rates falling

The Queerty article encouraging readers to consider having sex with HIV-positive partners was released just as several cities are seeing fewer new cases of the virus.

In New York City, for instance, ""officials say they are on the cusp of the once unthinkable — ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic as new medicines and treatment drove down the number of new cases to a 17-year-low in 2018, Health Department stats show,"" reported the New York Post. Officials attribute the decline to investments in public health services and the availability of medicines.

Still, more than 6,000 people died of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. in 2016. That same year, HIV was the 9th leading cause of death for those ages 25-34, and for those ages 35-44, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/magazine_queerty_have_sex_with_hiv_people,2019-11-23
Bill Maher fires back at woke mob angry over Dave Chappelle's comedy special: 'Where does this insanity come from?',"Liberal comedian Bill Maher fired off a comprehensive defense of fellow comedian Dave Chappelle Friday after the stand-up comic faced backlash over his recent Netflix special.



What is the background?

Since the release of Chappelle's newest Netflix special ""The Closer,"" some Netflix employees — and a host of progressive activists — have voiced outrage over what they claim is ""transphobic"" material.

Some Netflix employees even staged a walkout this week in protest of Chappelle, and demanded Netflix take down his stand-up special. Netflix executives, however, have bucked such demands.

What did Maher say?

During a panel discussion on his HBO show ""Real Time,"" Maher pushed back against the woke mob's ""one true opinion"" about LGBT topics.

""There isn't just one true opinion. I'm a free-speech guy,"" Maher said. ""Now, I'm 'Team Dave' but that doesn't mean I'm anti-trans. We can have two thoughts in our head at the same time.""

Several minutes later, Maher tore into accusations that Chappelle is ""transphobic,"" and said being transgender doesn't make someone ""automatically right.""

""Words have meaning, but not anymore,"" Maher said. ""When I hear 'transphobic,' 'phobic' has a meaning: Fear. I'm not transphobic if I merely disagree with you. It's not hate,"" Maher said. ""One of the reactions from someone who worked at Netflix said, 'This is not an argument with two sides.' Well, right away you lost me. 'It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don't want us to be.' Well, that's just ridiculous. Dave Chappelle does not want you to not be alive.""

""You know, you're not automatically right if you're trans,"" Maher continued. ""You're completely equal, you're just not automatically right and it doesn't behoove everybody to get their mind around very new changes, I mean, we were boy and girl for a very long time. It's only been 10 years since — how long have we had gay marriage, you know? I mean, talk about the Democratic voter, I'm sure there's a guy in Ohio going, 'I just got on board with gay marriage, could you give me a minute?'

""This idea that we're not any gender when we're born is very new and very radical that you're born, it's just jump ball!"" Maher mocked. ""That's a very new idea and I'm not sure if I'm down with all of it and I don't have to be.""

New Rule: Time for a National Divorce? www.youtube.com

Later in the segment, Maher slammed an NPR review that claimed Chappelle, a black man, benefits from so-called ""white privilege.""

""Wait, now Dave Chappelle can have white privilege? I'm really confused now,"" Maher said. ""Can someone explain that to me?""

""Where does this insanity come from?"" Maher continued. ""I've done three editorials on white loathing. It's like a kink. White people needing to hate themselves. It's like the guy likes to be whipped and told he's a worm by some woman with a high heel in his neck. Isn't it?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maher-defends-chappelle-netflix-special,2021-10-23
"California man threatened to kill Trump-supporting pastor 'in the name of Allah,' feds say","Federal investigators revealed that a California man has been indicted for mailing threatening messages, including to Pastor Robert Jeffress, who the man threatened to kill ""in the name of Allah.""

Jeffress is pastor of First Baptist Church Dallas, but is perhaps best known for being an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

According to The Dallas Morning News, 32-year-old Darnell Ray Owens mailed a letter to First Baptist Church Dallas last year threatening to assassinate Jeffress.

""I will assassinate your pastor in the name of Allah,"" the letter reportedly said. ""I will burn down Christian churches ... this is a threat.""

An employee at the church opened the letter, which also contained an unknown white powder substance. Emergency officials quarantined the employee, later discovering the substance was nontoxic. The incident forced the church to take additional security precautions because the church was preparing for children's vacation Bible school at the time, the Morning News reported.

However, federal investigators say Jeffress' was not Owens' sole target. In fact, Owens is accused of mailing at least 45 similar letters, including to police departments, LGBT groups, and Christian groups.

A grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Owens last week on charges of threat or hoax involving a biological weapon and identity theft, which investigators charged him with for using fraudulent return addresses on his letters, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Owens faces five years in federal prison for each count involving a threat or hoax and two years in prison for each count of identity theft.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-threatened-kill-robert-jeffress,2019-04-02

We remain committed to fostering an environment free from discrimination, and defend the values of treating all equally, with dignity and respect. #PrideMonth #USMC,"" the Marine Corps tweeted.



In response to the post, MRCTV managing editor Brittany Hughes tweeted, ""Armed and fabulous. Should come in handy in the next war.""



""China is going to steamroll us, aren't they?"" tweeted Curtis Houck, managing editor of the Media Research Center's NewsBusters.

""Seriously? How does fixating on differences foster cohesion and unity?"" tweeted Christina Pushaw, who serves as press secretary for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

""The culture wars are not one the Marines were formed to fight. You represent all Americans & not just Woke socialists weaponizing sexual orientation to attack traditional nuclear family & Christian values. Tolerate, yes. Champion a side in a cultural debate? Not your mission,"" Kyle Becker tweeted.

""The job of the @usmc is to win wars. Full stop. Trying to make the Marines woke distracts from that mission.

That’s all we need,"" tweeted Dr. Rich McCormick, a Republican running for U.S. Congress in the state of Georgia.

The U.S. Air Force also issued a tweet on Wednesday recognizing Pride Month.

President Joe Biden issued a proclamation for Pride Month again this year, after previously doing so in 2021. But while last year's proclamation referred to LGBTQ+ people, the 2022 proclamation added ""Intersex"" and refers to LGBTQI+ people.

""I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. ... do hereby proclaim June 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Pride Month,"" Biden's proclamation states.

Pocan introduces bills to create LGBT museum,"Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, an openly gay member of Congress, has put forward bills related to establishing an LGBT museum in Washington, D.C.

One measure would create a commission to examine the possibility of forming a National Museum of American LGBTQ+ History and Culture, while the other bill would officially create such a museum, according to a press release.

""As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,"" Pocan said, according to the release. ""It is vital to remember our collective past – particularly when certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that harm LGBTQ+ youth and our community at large. Let's tell these stories, and honor the many contributions the LGBTQ+ community has made to this nation with a museum in Washington, D.C. I look forward to the passage of this legislation and to visiting this museum in the near future.""

According to the press release, the measure to create a commission would call for that body to craft ""a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the museum through public contributions"" and to get ""an independent review of this fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the museum and its operations and maintenance without reliance on federal funds.""

The group would also be tasked to ""Report on the availability and cost of acquiring collections for the museum, identify potential locations for the facility in Washington, D.C., and determine its regional impact on other museums,"" as well as to provide ""Congress a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the museum,"" the press release stated.

The measure would instruct that the group's recommendations discuss whether the LGBT museum should belong to the Smithsonian Institution, according to the press release. Following the conclusion of the commission's efforts and the issuance of their recommendations, the legislature could weigh the other measure to officially create the museum.

NC Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson takes defiant stand as he faces calls to resign after calling homosexuality 'filth': 'I will not back down',"North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) is taking a stand as he faces calls to resign for describing homosexuality as ""filth.""

What is the background?

While speaking at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove, North Carolina, in June, Robinson described ""transgenderism"" and homosexuality as ""filth,"" while condemning such concepts from being taught in school.

""There is no reason anybody, anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality or any of that filth,"" Robinson said. ""And yes, I called it filth. And if you don't like it that I called it filth, come see me about it.""

North Carolina state Sen. Jeff Jackson (D), who is running for U.S. Senate, demanded Robinson resign for the remarks. Gov. Roy Cooper (D), The Human Rights Campaign, and even the White House has since condemned Robinson.

In a recent interview with WRAL-TV, Robinson said he would not apologize for his remarks, and pointed out a double standard in politics.

""We will not be intimidated. We will not back down. We will not change our language,"" Robinson told WRAL. ""The language I used, I am not ashamed of it. I will use it in the future because, again, it is time for parents in this state to take a strong stand for their children.""

He later said, ""I am tired of folks on the right being demonized for our speech while folks on the left burn, beat, rob, loot — take over entire cities and get a pass.""

What is Robinson saying now?

In a video posted to Facebook on Saturday, Robinson responded to the growing outrage online.

Robinson explained that he does not hate LGBT people. In fact, he vowed to always support their rights to express themselves, which he believes the government has no role in regulating.

However, Robinson said he opposes sexualized curriculum in public schools, again rebuking curriculum that promotes ""transgenderism"" and other ""sexually explicit"" material.

Still, Robinson said he would not back down from his remarks.

""This whole thing has been an attempt to, once again, change the argument and silence voices on the right,"" Robinson said.

""Let me tell you plainly right here and right now: I will not back down,"" he added. ""I will not be silenced and I will not be bullied into submission. I will continue to fight for the rights of our children to receive an education that is free from sexual concepts that do not belong in the classroom — and I don't care who likes it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mark-robinson-takes-stand-lgbt-comments,2021-10-10
"'Friends' co-creator apologizes again, now for using wrong pronouns for Chandler Bing's father: 'That was a mistake'","Marta Kauffman, co-creator of ""Friends,"" is once again apologizing over certain aspects of the hit sitcom that are considered politically incorrect today.

""Friends"" aired for 10 seasons between 1994 and 2004 and is widely considered one of TV's most successful sitcoms. The show's six-member ensemble cast still earns tens of millions of dollars per year from the show, even though it ended nearly two decades ago.

What did Kauffman say?

Speaking with the BBC in a forthcoming interview, Kauffman apologized for the sin of misgendering the parent of ""Friends"" character Chandler Bing, who was played by Matthew Perry.

In the show, Bing's biological father is portrayed as a transgender drag queen named ""Helena Handbasket."" Actress Kathleen Turner played the role.

Now, Kauffman says it was a mistake to refer to the character as a male.

""We kept referring to [Helena] as 'Chandler's father,' even though Chandler's father was trans,"" Kauffman said. ""Pronouns were not yet something that I understood, so we didn't refer to that character as 'she.' That was a mistake.""

Kauffman also reiterated the importance of creating a ""tolerant"" set, explaining she has fired crew members for making jokes.

""I like very much to create an environment where we have a happy set and a happy crew,"" Kauffman said. ""It's very important to me that where we are is a safe place, a tolerant place, where there's no yelling.

""I fired a guy on the spot for making a joke about a trans cameraperson,"" she boasted. ""That just can’t happen.""

The admission comes more than a week after Kauffman made headlines for apologizing for the lack of diversity on the set of ""Friends."" At the time, Kaufmann also announced a $4 million donation to help make amends for the sin.

Anything else?

Interestingly, Turner addressed her role in ""Friends"" several years ago, saying that she would not accept the role today.

""Of course, I wouldn’t do it [today] because there would be real people able to do [the part],"" Turner said in 2019.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marta-kauffman-apologizes-pronouns-chandler-dad,2022-07-07
Maryland school district unveils LGBTQ propaganda targeting toddlers with highly sexual concepts,"The largest school system in Maryland has unveiled a new book list loaded with LGBT-activist propaganda aimed at elementary schools and tailored to children as young as 4. The objective of the sexual content is to ""reduce stigmatization and marginalization of transgender and gender nonconforming students.""

What are the details?

Fox News Digital reported that a recent Montgomery County Public Schools PowerPoint presentation referenced a set of activist books that will be distributed to classrooms, from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. The books seek to undermine the concept of a gender binary at an early age and immerse children in the vernacular of LGBT activists, teaching toddlers words like ""drag queen"" and ""intersex.""

Pre-kindergarteners will read or be read ""Pride Puppy!"" a book about a young child celebrating ""Pride Day"" with his grandfather. It is touted as an ""affirming and inclusive book that offers a joyful glimpse of a Pride parade and the vibrant community that celebrates this day each year.

Kindergarteners (i.e., children ages 5 and 6) will take a break from learning to tie their shoes and mastering the alphabet to read ""Uncle Bobby's Wedding,"" a book about a gay wedding.

Move over, ""Clifford the Big Red Dog."" First-graders will read ""Intersection Allies,"" a ""gleeful entry into intersectional feminism for kids ... offering an opportunity to ... connect to collective struggle for justice.""

After a few years, kids in the MCPS district will be ready for ""Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,"" a book about the black transsexual son of the activist chair of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Board.

Shaping the confused minds of tomorrow

It's not enough that the books are in the curriculum. MCPS wants to make sure the message is getting across.

MCPS pre-K teachers were provided with a resource guide linking them to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's glossary of ""LGBTQ+ words.""

Accordingly, teachers can provide toddlers with activist-approved definitions for words such as: ""non-binary""; ""transgender""; ""pansexual""; ""cisgender""; and ""gender expression.""

The glossary tells teachers how to frame several of the words and concepts at different grade levels. For instance, for ""sexual orientation,"" the HRCF tells indoctrinaires that ""you might say who you love or are attracted to.""

The resource guide for the second-grade LGBT content provides stock answers to student's questions.

If, for example, a student says, ""They can't get married, they're both men,"" the teacher is prompted to respond by saying, ""When people are adults they can get married. Two men who love each other can decide they want to get married, be a family and care for each other.""

Teachers are instructed to ""disrupt the either/or thinking"" and emphasize that ""people of any gender can like whoever they like. People are allowed to like whoever they want"" and that pleasure should be the determining factor behind students' choices pertaining to the clothes they wear, the books they like, and the play they engage in.

Optional?

MCPS told Fox News Digital that the readings are not mandatory and that families will be notified ahead of their full implementation. Notwithstanding the MCPS' claim, the ""Sample Responses to Caregivers' Questions"" suggest otherwise.

In response to the question ""Why can't I opt out of this just like I can for Family Health & Life?"" the stock reply is, ""In these picture books and discussions students are learning about the diversity of identities that exits in the world and in our classroom. ... All children and their families deserve to see themselves and their families positively represented in our school community.""

Parents who suggest that their kids are ""too young to be learning about gender and sexuality identity"" are to be told, ""Children are already learning about it and mostly see 'straight' and 'cisgender' representation around them. ... By learning about the diversity of gender, children have an opportunity to explore a greater range of interests, ideas, and activities.""

The guide suggests that educators ought to tell parents who ask about keeping their children home that LGBT content will be ""embedded throughout"" and not only in specific instances — in other words, that it's unavoidable.

MCPS' dysphoria incubator

While MCPS seeks to expose children to LGBT activist rhetoric at an early age, it also provides them with an incubator for their resultant identity crises.

Montgomery Community Media reported that on Nov. 9, MCPS hosted a workshop entitled ""Supporting Transgender Students."" The workshop ran students, guardians, and teachers through the Montgomery County Board of Education's Gender Identity Guidelines, which MCPS adheres to.

It is clear from the guidelines that MCPS, which reportedly saw a 582% increase in the number of students identifying as ""gender nonconforming"" in the past two years, is willing to keep parents in the dark about their kids' ""gender support plan[s].""



The document states, ""Prior to contacting a student's parent/guardian, the principal or identified staff member should speak with the student to ascertain the level of support the student either receives or anticipates receiving from home. In some cases, transgender and gender nonconforming students may not openly express their gender identity at home because of safety concerns or lack of acceptance.""

In the event that parents may not be on board with the school district playing into their child's dysphoria, ""Student Welfare and Compliance (SWC) should be contacted.""

In such cases, ""staff will support the development of a student-led plan that works toward inclusion of the family, if possible ... and recognizing that providing support for a student is critical, even when the family is nonsupportive.""

According to MCPS' guidelines, staff are not to disclose information ""about a student's transgender status, legal name, or sex assigned at birth"" to their parents or guardians.

""The fact that students choose to disclose their status to staff members or other students does not authorize school staff members to disclose a student's status to others, including parents/guardians,"" the document states.

In an effort to hide a student's confusion from their parents, the guidelines recommend covering up the school-home gender identity disparity: ""Unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise, when contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender student, MCPS school staff members should use the student's legal name and pronoun that correspond to the student's sex assigned at birth.""

In August, a judge dismissed a complaint against the MCBE and MCPS, which alleged that the previous version of these guidelines were designed to bar parental involvement ""in a pivotal decision"" in their kids' lives and constituted a violation of both the parents' state and constitutional rights.



The Washington Post reported that Obama-nominee Judge Paul W. Grimm of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland sided with the MCBE's arguments that the guidelines ""are certainly rationally related"" to achieving the MCBE's ""legitimate interest in providing a safe and supportive environment for all MCPS students, including those who are transgender and gender nonconforming.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maryland-school-district-unveils-lgbtq-propaganda-targeting-toddlers-with-highly-sexual-concepts,2022-11-15
Transgender woman targets Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips with ANOTHER lawsuit,"Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips is being sued yet again.

Attorneys for Autumn Scardina, a transgender woman, filed a lawsuit in state court last Wednesday alleging Phillips discriminated against their client and engaged in deceptive and unfair trade practices.

The lawyers — Paula Greisen and John McHugh — claim that ""Masterpiece Cakeshop, at the direction of Phillips, refused to sell a birthday cake to Ms. Scardina because of her status as a transgender woman.""

They further allege Phillips engaged in illegal trade practices because his shop ""widely publicized that they would sell baked goods, including birthday cakes, to the public, including the LGBT community,"" but allegedly refused to provide Scardina with a cake only after learning that she is transgender.

Jack Phillips Lindsay Pierce, The Denver Post

Scardina is the same person who has filed previous discrimination complaints against Phillips. In fact, the state dropped one complaint in March in which Phillips refused to bake a cake celebrating Scardina's gender transition. In exchange, Phillips also dropped a religious discrimination complaint against the state.



The cake in question now is a pink cake with blue frosting, a design Scardina told the cakeshop ""had personal significance for her because it reflects her status as a transgender female.""

Still, Scardina's motive is clear: She is removing the Civil Rights Commission from the equation in order to force the judicial system to determine whether Phillips violated Colorado law.

""By filing separately, we are taking the state out of the equation,"" Greisen told Colorado Public Radio. ""I fully believe we will win in the state courts ... and I don't believe there is any First Amendment or religious implications that would allow them to discriminate.""

""We simply want the law to be enforced,"" Greisen claimed. ""Because if not, you allow a business to send a message: go ahead, refuse service to these people, it's OK, when the citizens of Colorado have said it's not.""

Phillips believes Scardina has long targeted his shop with requests she knows violate his religious beliefs in order to harass him. She even once requested a cake to celebrate Satan that featured ""a large figure of Satan, licking a 9"" black Dildo.""

How did Phillips respond?

Jim Campbell, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, the nonprofit Christian legal group that represents Phillips, called Scardina's latest actions ""yet another desperate attempt to harass"" Phillips.

""A new lawsuit has been filed against Masterpiece Cakeshop that appears to largely rehash old claims. The State of Colorado abandoned similar ones just a few months ago. So this latest attack by Autumn Scardina looks like yet another desperate attempt to harass cake artist Jack Phillips. And it stumbles over the one detail that matters most: Jack serves everyone; he just cannot express all messages through his custom cakes,"" he said.

Scardina is requesting a jury trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/masterpiece-cakeshop-jack-phillips-another-discrimination-lawsuit,2019-06-11
"Matt Walsh's children's book that targets radical gender ideology is #1 on Amazon's 'Best Sellers in LGBTQ+ Books' list, and GLAAD and Media Matters for America are not pleased","Conservative commentator Matt Walsh's book ""Johnny the Walrus,"" which takes aim at leftist gender ideology through a story about an imaginative boy who pretends to be a walrus, is currently ranked number one on Amazon's list of ""Best Sellers in LGBTQ+ Books,"" but some are taking issue with the book being included in that category.

Brennan Suen of Media Matters for America tweeted that it is ""totally unacceptable that @amazon is listing Matt Walsh's anti-trans children's book as an 'LGBTQ+ Book' -- also goes to show how easy it is for conservatives to manipulate sales and make money off this grift.""

The pro-LGBTQ organization GLAAD retweeted Suen, declaring, ""This is horrible. @AmazonHelp Please remove this book from the LGBTQ category immediately. It is absolutely not an LGBTQ book. It specifically targets transgender people with hateful and dehumanizing rhetoric.""

Alex Paterson of Media Matters for America tweeted that, ""Amazon needs to stop misidentifying Matt Walsh's anti-trans propaganda as an 'LGBTQ book,' which is promoting harmful anti-trans views to its consumers interested in LGBTQ stories.""

While the book was released last week, Amazon currently shows that it is only available for pre-order with a release date of March 29, 2022. The Daily Wire website has the book for sale with a note that reads, ""Reserve your copy today from the next shipment, expected to ship in early 2022.""

""Folks you have to admit this is all extremely funny,"" Walsh tweeted on Sunday. ""Me becoming a number one bestselling LGBT author is the twist no one saw coming.""



Transgender ideology remains a topic of signifiant cultural contention, particularly in matters such as whether biological males who identify as females should be permitted to utilize female restrooms and compete in female sports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/matt-walsh-s-johnny-the-walrus-book-that-targets-radical-gender-ideology-is-1-on-amazon-best-seller-s-in-lgbtq-books,2021-12-09
Matt Walsh says his best-selling 'Johnny the Walrus' book was removed from Amazon's LGBTQ section as well as Target's website: 'The canceling begins',"As of Thursday, conservative commentator Matt Walsh's ""Johnny the Walrus"" — a children's book that skewers leftist gender ideology by way of a story about a boy who pretends to be a walrus — was ranked number 1 on Amazon's list of ""Best Sellers in LGBTQ+ Books.""

But not any more.

No, his book didn't slip in the rankings. Instead, Walsh pointed out Friday that Amazon removed ""Johnny the Walrus"" from the LGBTQ+ section entirely.

""This is an unconscionable attack on gay rights and a horrific example of homophobia and gay erasure,"" Walsh quipped in his tweet about the issue.

Sure enough, a cursory glance Friday afternoon at Amazon's top 100 LGBTQ+ books section showed no signs of ""Johnny the Walrus"" among the offerings. (Although glaringly it's still ranked number 3 on the ""most wished for in LGBTQ+ books"" — which tells you either Amazon needs a new delete button or that shoppers are on a different wavelength.)

Et tu, Target?

What's more, Walsh pointed out Friday that ""Johnny the Walrus"" was removed from Target's website.

Walsh added that ""no explanation has been given"" for the book getting wiped from Target.com. ""The canceling begins,"" he added in his tweet.

Indeed, a search Friday afternoon for ""Johnny the Walrus"" on Target's site showed a whopping 320 items — some were books about ""Johnny"" (including a bunch about Johnny Cash), and there were some books about walruses. But Walsh's book was not listed in the results.

What's the background?

Prior to ""Johnny the Walrus"" getting harpooned, GLAAD and Media Matters for America were were hoppin' mad.

Brennan Suen of Media Matters tweeted that it's ""totally unacceptable that @amazon is listing Matt Walsh's anti-trans children's book as an 'LGBTQ+ Book' -- also goes to show how easy it is for conservatives to manipulate sales and make money off this grift.""

Now it sounds like Suen's happier:

GLAAD retweeted Suen and offered its own takedown: ""This is horrible. @AmazonHelp Please remove this book from the LGBTQ category immediately. It is absolutely not an LGBTQ book. It specifically targets transgender people with hateful and dehumanizing rhetoric.""

Anything else?

Despite the censorship, Walsh kept winding up and throwing at the left, more than likely because they refuse to leave the batter's box — which is a testament to Walsh's expert trolling in this case.

""I am beginning to feel deeply marginalized and unsafe as an LGBT author and thought leader,"" he also tweeted Friday, presumably wiping away a waterfall of tears.

Walsh also noted Friday that ""Jussie Smollett is not the victim of an anti-gay hate crime but I am.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/matt-walsh-says-his-bestselling-johnny-the-walrus-book-was-removed-from-amazon-s-lgbtq-section-as-well-as-target-com-the-canceling-begins,2021-12-10
Matt Walsh takes extraordinary measure to speak at school board meeting after rules changed at last minute,"The Loudoun County School Board reportedly changed the rules for an upcoming school board meeting at the last minute to prevent conservative commentator Matt Walsh from speaking at the meeting.

What is the background?

Walsh went viral last month after he confronted the Metro Nashville Public School Board over the district's face mask mandate for elementary school students.

""You the school board have decided that our kids should go to school all day, every day wearing muzzles like rabid dogs. I have listened to your arguments and I've noticed that they're missing a few things, namely, evidence, data, science, common sense, and basic human decency. You presented no facts at all, so let me do that now,"" Walsh said.

After a short speech in which Walsh explained the data on children and COVID-19, chided the school board for ""depriv[ing] [students] of the ability to see each other's faces,"" and questioning what a face mask does ""to a child's developing immune system,"" Walsh concluded, ""It's a disgrace and you should all be ashamed. Thank you for your time.""

What happened now?

Just like in Nashville, Walsh is planning to voice his opinion at an upcoming Loudoun County School Board meeting in northern Virginia.

However, according to the Daily Wire, the school board changed its rules at the last minute to block out-of-town speakers, like Walsh, from speaking at the Sept. 28 meeting. Now, only local residents are permitted to speak at the public meeting.

The Loudoun County School Board revealed this week changes to speaker eligibility for the upcoming board meeting. Eligible speakers now must meet strict residency requirements, and will be forced to show proof they meet the new rules before speaking.

""The School Board is making these changes in order to ensure that the voices of our parents and the LCPS community are heard rather than out-of-town agitators who would make Board meetings a platform for national politics or to enhance their own media profiles,"" School board chair Brenda L. Sheridan said.

So what did Walsh do? He announced Friday that he signed a lease in Loudoun County to comply with the new residency requirements, therefore making him eligible to speak at the board meeting.

""Loudoun County changed the rules so that only residents can speak at the school board. In unrelated news, I'm proud to announce that I am now a resident of Loudoun County. Just rented a home in the area. I'll have the lease agreement. See you at the meeting!"" Walsh announced Friday.

On Facebook, Walsh explained why he wants his voice to be heard at the Loudoun County School Board meeting.

""The Loudoun County school board in VA has imposed a radical trans policy allowing males access to girl's restrooms and teams. Teachers are required to use preferred pronouns,"" Walsh wrote. ""To protest this madness, I'll be leading a rally outside the school board meeting on September 28.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/matt-walsh-signs-lease-loudoun-county-school-board-meeting,2021-09-25
Mazie Hirono snaps when reporter confronts her double standard on phrase 'sexual preference',"Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and other Democrats pounced on Amy Coney Barrett last week for using the phrase ""sexual preference"" during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing.

But Hirono seemingly gave Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden a pass for using the phrase when confronted by a reporter on Thursday.

What did Democrats say?

At the Senate hearing, Hirono scolded Barrett for uttering the phrase ""sexual preference,"" calling the term ""offensive and outdated."" Hirono reasoned that ""sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity,"" and therefore not a choice.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), a senior Senate Democrat, added, ""Judge Barrett using this phrase is shameful and offensive—and it tells us exactly what we need to know about how she views the LGBTQIA+ community.""

In response, Webster's Dictionary updated the definition of the word ""preference"" despite there being zero indication prior to Barrett's usage of the phrase that ""sexual preference"" was offensive. Webster's Dictionary actually claimed that using ""sexual preference"" is considered to be ""widely"" offensive.

As National Review reported, Democrats have a long history of using the phrase — just like everyone else. Biden even used it just a few months ago.

From National Review:

Joe Biden used the term ""sexual preference"" in May 2020, and the late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used it in 2017. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Dick Durbin — both Judiciary Committee members — have used the term in Senate floor speeches over the past decade.

...

The Huffington Post and The Atlantic have printed ""sexual preference"" instead of ""sexual orientation"" in the last six years. A gay-rights advocate used the term in a September 25, 2020, interview with the gay-rights magazine The Advocate. No one condemned or criticized any of the media outlets or Democratic politicians who used the term in the past decade.



What is Hirono saying now?

National Review reporter John McCormack confronted Hirono over Biden's recent usage of ""sexual preference,"" asking whether she would hold the Democratic presidential nominee to the same standard that she used against Barrett.

McCormack asked, ""Should Joe Biden apologize, too, like Amy Coney Barrett did?""

Hirono responded, ""Joe Biden is not up for the Supreme Court.""

""He's up for the presidency. So, he shouldn't apologize?"" McCormack followed up.

""People will decide,"" Hirono shot back.

""You don't want to call on him to apologize?"" McCormack asked again.

Hirono then snapped, ""Oh, stop it. The world is in flames.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mazie-hirono-double-standard-sexual-preference,2020-10-24
Media ignore story of Democratic congresswoman revealed to have been in scandalous 'throuple',"Freshman Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) was allegedly engaged in a three-way relationship, otherwise known as a ""throuple,"" with her husband and a 22-year-old female campaign staffer, conservative blog RedState reported Friday.

Text messages and even an explicit photograph showing a completely naked Hill brushing the hair of a person believed to be that staffer were among the evidence that RedState reported.

Because of Hill's position on two prominent congressional committees — the House Oversight Committee and the House Armed Services Committee — one would think the story would evolve into a full-scale scandal considering the legal and ethical implications of a congresswoman sleeping with members of her staff. Not only the legal implications, but the possibility that a lawmaker with access to highly sensitive national security details, potentially opened herself to blackmail.

However, you probably have not heard about the story because the mainstream media have not given the story one iota of attention. Indeed, the media's biggest outlets — including the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC News, ABC News, and CBS News — have not yet covered the story.

It is not clear why the media has been deafly silent on this story. There are, however, two facts about Hill that could shed light on the deafening silence. First, Hill is a Democrat. Second, Hill is a member of the LGBT community and is the first openly bisexual person to be elected to Congress.

What's the background?

According to RedState, Hill began an alleged long-term sexual relationship with the staffer after the young woman joined her campaign in late 2017. Thus the ""throuple"" — between Hill, the staffer, and Hill's husband, Kenny Heslep — was allegedly formed.

The alleged ""polyamorous"" relationship was long term and committed, according to RedState. The ""throuple"" even went on vacations together, including one to Alaska. RedState published photos of Hill and the staffer from that trip.

But the alleged relationship turned sour when Hill moved to Washington, D.C., in January after being elected to Congress. RedState reported, citing its sources, that Heslep and the staffer both noticed considerable changes in Hill's behavior. Text messages obtained by RedState showed that Hill broke off her relationships in May, citing political risk.

Afterward, Heslep learned that Hill was allegedly engaged in another extramarital affair with Graham Kelly, her legislative director. House ethics rules prevent sexual relationships between lawmakers and their staff.

Heslep filed for divorce after learning about the alleged relationship between Hill and Kelly, RedState reported.

What does Hill say?

Hill responded to the controversy Tuesday afternoon in a Politico story that framed the allegations as a right-wing smear attack.

Hill blamed the controversy on Heslep, who she accused of being an ""abusive husband.""

""The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,"" she told Politico. ""I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed.""

In her statement, Hill denied allegations that she was involved in an intimate relationship with Kelly.

""Allegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false. I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,"" she said.

However, Hill did not deny her relationship with the young female staffer.

U.S. Capitol Police are also investigation how nude photos of her were leaked and published, Hill said.

""Intimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent,"" she said in her statement. ""I have notified Capitol Hill police who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials.""

Hill said she has denied allegations of wrongdoing directly to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/media-ignore-story-of-democratic-congresswoman-revealed-to-have-been-in-scandalous-throuple,2019-10-22
Prominent medical journal says parents shouldn't have 'veto power' in transgender children's medical decisions,"A prominent medical journal published an article recently making the case that the parents of children claiming to be transgender should lose authority over their children in their medical decisions.

What are the details?

Writing in the Journal of Medical Ethics last month, bioethics professor Maura Priest argued when it comes to ""transition-related pediatric care,"" only the patient has the ability to truly weigh the costs and benefits of undergoing puberty suppression treatment — even if that patient is a child.

It is not the place of doctors or parents to stand in the way, she argued.

""If the medical community is to take LGBT testimony seriously (as they should) then it is no longer the job of physicians to do their own weighing of the costs and benefits of transition-related care. Assuming the patient is informed and competent, then only the patient can make this assessment, because only the patient has access to the true weight of transition-related benefits,"" Priest claimed.

""Moreover, taking LGBT patient testimony seriously also means that parents should lose veto power over most transition-related pediatric care,"" she added.

Evangelical theologian and author Nancy Pearcey spotlighted the news over the weekend in a tweet. Pearcey, who teaches apologetics and the Christian worldview at Houston Baptist University, is well known for her work in ""Love Thy Body,"" a book that deconstructs the faulty thinking behind secularism's views on sexuality.

In response to Pearcey's tweet, conservative commentator and BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey remarked, ""'Transition-related pediatric care' is something out of a dystopian novel. Absolutely criminal.""



What else?

Debate over whether children should be allowed to undergo gender transition treatment has become a hot topic in America over the last few years as the transgender movement continues to pick up steam.

Last October, President Joe Biden made headlines after suggesting that children as young as 8 years old should be able to change their gender. Before that, the nation watched closely as a young boy in Texas, James Younger, became the subject of a transgender dilemma and a child custody battle.

The author of the JME article, Maura Priest, is an assistant professor and bioethicist at Arizona State University who teaches in the School of Historical, Philosophical, and Religious Studies.

According to her biographical page on ASU's website, she also has a certificate in Pediatric Bioethics from Children's Mercy Hospital.

Anything else?

TheBlaze reached out to Priest for clarification about her views, including at what age she believes children should be able to make decisions for themselves about transition care.



In an email response, Priest noted that in a perfect scenario, ""Children's desires about transition-related medical care should be followed when those desires line up with the recommendations of a physician who is an expert in transgender medicine, and ideally, one who has been treating the child and communicating with both the child and parent for many years.""

But in a fuller explanation, she maintained that a child as young as 12 years old could — and perhaps should — be considered an ""equal party"" to discussions about their health care, specifically as it relates to their gender.

""The child should at first begin to sit in on the discussions between parent and pediatrician about their health. Once the child reaches a certain level of maturity, the child should become an equal part of the now 3-way discussion about their health care. While the way to determine the correct age for maturity is not something I have a conclusive thought on at the moment, my guess would be around age 12 they become an equal party to the discussion,"" Priest said.

Megyn Kelly sends a blistering message to Disney following company's 'gay agenda' video leak: 'They're no longer the Disney of yesterday',"Broadcaster Megyn Kelly blasted Disney after one of its executives made headlines for a video leak that indicated the company is set to push a ""gay agenda"" for children.

What's a brief history here?

The video in question showed Disney Corporate President Karey Burke — mother of transgender and pansexual kids — announcing that the company will integrate more queer leads into its child-targeted content.

In the video, Burke said, ""We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough leads, and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters,"" vowing to change those numbers for what she suggested is the betterment of children and the company at large.

What are the details?

During Wednesday's podcast, Kelly hit out at Disney and warned parents to closely monitor what their children are watching.

“So Disney and she have apparently made clear that they are going to be putting as many LGBTQIA+ in as many Disney movies as possible,” Kelly started off after playing a segment featuring Burke's remarks. “That they want these characters to become ubiquitous in the Disney movies, and I think that is totally unnecessary and out of line. I don’t want you to work out your wokeism on my kid, OK? Do a movie that teaches tolerance, kindness, support for your fellow human beings.”

She continued, slamming the term ""two-spirit people"" and more.

“Don’t shove two-spirit people, which by the way is not a thing, and pansexual — I had to look it up, you know what that means? It means you’re attracted to everybody,"" she said. ""So you’re bi, I guess. That’s not a thing; that’s already a thing; they already have a letter. I’m sorry, but please, all these glommers who just want attention, it’s a new thing!”

Kelly added that it's high time parents understood the type of content Disney is gearing up to serve their children and called on them to closely vet what their charges are consuming.

“Don’t put a Disney movie on in front of your kid before you fully come to understand what it’s going to be promoting, who it’s going to be starring, and what agenda they’re pushing,"" she warned.

Megyn Kelly's indictment of media after Club Q tragedy speaks even louder after newest revelation,"Megyn Kelly slammed the media on Tuesday for exploiting violence — like the massacre at LGBT nightclub Club Q — to score political points.

What is the background?

Democrats and the media seized on the Club Q shooting to argue that opposition to the progressive LGBT agenda is responsible for the horrific massacre.

NBC News reporter Ben Collins, for example, went viral on Tuesday for placing blame for the Club Q attack, and other similar tragedies, at the feet of conservative media, targeting specifically Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Anything but full-throated acceptance of the progressive LGBT agenda is the same as inciting violence against the LGBT community, the narrative alleges.

What did Kelly say?

During the opening of her SiriusXM radio show, Kelly hammered Democrats and the mainstream media for using the massacre to blame their political enemies.

""The left and Democratic leaders continuing to place blame on conservatives before the motive is even known in connection with this Colorado nightclub shooting,” Kelly said. ""I mean this happens every time — every time.

""Nancy Pelosi going as far as to accuse people who supported Donald Trump’s presidency for the deadly shooting,"" she scoffed. “They can’t even respect the dead for 2 minutes. I mean before the bodies get cold, they want to pin it on politics.

“Can we wait and see? 'Cause this guy pulled guns on and threatened to bomb his own mother a year ago, so it’s possible he had some mental health problems that were unresolved,"" she continued. ""It’s a situation similar to the Nancy Pelosi attack on her husband by this guy who was clearly a lunatic, whose most recent writings seemed out there and aligned with Q-Anon, but we’re talking about a mentally unwell person.""

Later in the show, Kelly targeted the media who claim the Club Q massacre is ""right-wing-inspired violence"" in which the Republican Party, Donald Trump, and conservative commentator Matt Walsh are responsible.



""Somehow, because this is a gay club, LGBTQ, this is their fault. It's a pattern. We've seen it so many times, but it still is alarming — and it's deeply immoral,"" Kelly said.

Her guest, Clay Travis, agreed. In fact, the media is culpable, he suggested, because they help make mass killers famous, they ignore the everyday violence that occurs across the nation, and they do not help discover a real solution to violence.

Kelly agreed.

""The media completely ignores what's happening in Baltimore, what's happening in Chicago, what's happening in Philadelphia,"" she said. ""They don’t care. They only care about these things because they can look for what they think is a political motive, or in any case ... they can look for the guns.""

What about the newest revelation?

Liberals pounce on leaked audio of Melania Trump talking about children at the border and her Christmas decorations,"Liberals and other critics of the president pounced on a leaked audio of first lady Melania Trump talking to her former friend about reaction to her Christmas decorations and controversy around children detained at the border.

In the audio, which aired on CNN Thursday, the first lady can be heard angrily criticizing the reaction to her Christmas decorations, and complaining that the media wasn't reporting on her efforts to help children detained at the border.

""They say I'm complicit. I'm the same like him. I support him. I don't say enough. I don't do enough,"" the first lady said on the recording.

""Where I am, I put, I'm working like a, my ass off at, Christmas stuff that you know, who gives a f*** about Christmas stuff and decoration? But I need to do it, right?"" she continued.

""OK, and then I do it, and I say that I'm working on Christmas planning for the Christmas. And they said, 'oh what about the children that were separated.' Give me a f***ing break. Where were they saying anything when Obama did that?"" she said.

The first lady went on to complain that she tried to reunite a child with their mother but that the media refused to cover the story.

""I was trying to get the kids reunited with the mom. I didn't have a chance. Needs to go through the process and through the law,"" she said.

""They would not do the story because, they are not, they would not do the story, because they are against us, because they are liberal media. Yeah, if I go to Fox, they will do the story. I don't want to go to Fox.""

Liberals pounce

While the first lady was clearly upset at the reaction from her critics, some like Muslim commentator Dean Obeidallah misrepresented her comments into something more sinister.

""After listening to the #MelaniaTapes where she says about the children separated at border 'Give me a f***ing break' it's clear that Melania's jacket she wore to visit the kids was a comment on how she viewed the children: 'I really don't care,'"" said Obeidallah.

""OMG!!!!!! @CNN is airing the #MelaniaTapes and they are horrific. Melania says kids love being in cages,"" claimed LGBT activist Rob Gill.

""Oh. My. God,"" reacted actress Alyssa Milano.



Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) took the opportunity to demand that the president and the first lady stop ""disrespecting"" Christians.

Sixteen members of the Penn women's swim team ask the NCAA to protect them from men in women's sports,"The University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team has finally had enough.

The sixteen members of the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team sent a letter to school and Ivy League officials asking them to prohibit Penn’s trans female swimmer from competing in the NCAA championships, reports the Washington Post.

“We fully support Lia Thomas in her decision to affirm her gender identity and to transition from a man to a woman. Lia has every right to live her life authentically,” wrote the swim team members, “However, we also recognize that when it comes to sports competition, that the biology of sex is a separate issue from someone’s gender identity.”

Lia Thomas — formerly known as ‘Will’ — competed on men’s swim teams for years. He was even a part of the Penn men’s swim team before deciding to start taking hormones to try and transition into becoming a woman. Thomas, who is actively suppressing his testosterone levels, benefits immensely in competition since he has the skeletal and muscle structure of a grown man.

“Biologically, Lia holds an unfair advantage over competition in women’s category, as evidence by her ranking that have bounced from #462 as a male to #1 as a female,” the letter continues, “If she were to be eligible to compete against us, she could now break Penn, Ivy, and NCAA Women’s Swimming records; feats she could never have done as a male athlete.”

Likely fearing retribution, the women who wrote the letter did not attach their names or deliver it themselves. They had Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a 1984 Olympic swimming gold medalist, lawyer, and leading women’s sports advocate deliver it on their behalf.

In a phone interview, Hogshead-Makar confirmed that she sent the letter because the swimmers were told “we would be removed from the team or that we would never get a job offer” if they spoke out against the inclusion of a man in women’s sports.

Previously, a father of a University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team member said that members of the team “realize that they will never, ever be able to beat” Thomas in competition. The father continued by stating that Thomas “is most likely going to be representing you and I and all other Americans at the Olympics,” since his success on the women’s team will prevent his female team members from earning spots on the Olympic women’s swim team.

Expressing dismay the father asked, “What do you say to your daughter? You got Lia up on the blocks, taking a spot from a cisgender woman on the Olympic team. How do I tell my daughter that could be you one day? You can’t. You can never be her.”

Recently, a team member of Thomas pointed out that despite Thomas having male genitalia, as he is a man, he shares a locker room with his female teammates.

The team member said, “It’s definitely awkward because Lia still has male body parts and is still attracted to women.”

“It’s really upsetting because Lia doesn’t seem to care how it makes anyone else feel,” the swimmer continued, “The 35 of us are just supposed to accept being uncomfortable in our own space and locker room for, like, the feelings of one.”

Both the father of the swim team member and the swimmer expressing concern over a man in the women’s locker room spoke on the condition of anonymity fearing that their statements would cause damage to the lives of themselves and their loved ones.

Hopefully, the team’s letter will encourage school and NCAA officials to enforce policies that treat these women fairly.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/members-of-the-p,2022-02-07
Methodist Christians who oppose same-sex marriage agree to separate into new 'traditionalist' denomination,"The United Methodist Church announced an agreement to split into two separate denominations over the issue of same-sex marriage and the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy, according to the New York Times.

Those who hold to the belief that the church should not support same-sex marriage and should not ordain gay clergy will separate into a ""traditionalist"" denomination if the agreement is approved in May at the denomination's annual conference.

The schism is the result of two three-day mediation sessions in Washington. A committee of church leaders determined that separating was ""the best means to resolve our differences, allowing each part of the Church to remain true to its theological understanding.""

At last year's conference, 53 percent of leaders and lay members voted to tighten the prohibition of homosexuality within the church, calling the practice ""incompatible with Christian teaching.""

Because the United Methodist Church is international, stances on this issue varied greatly in different countries, many of which are not as culturally accepting of homosexuality as the United States has become. From the Washington Post:

The United Methodist Church, unlike those denominations, is worldwide, not almost entirely American. Nearly one-third of the church's membership is in Africa, and speakers from outside the United States — including Liberia and Russia — were among the most vocal proponents of the traditional plan.



Jerry Kulah, head of the UMC Africa Initiative, said he was sorry the church had spent so much time and money debating questions about homosexuality. ""The progressive groups are loud, but they don't have the numbers,"" he said. If the church had voted to affirm LGBT inclusion, he said, it would have become a ""laughingstock"" in Africa.

The Bible explicitly speaks against homosexuality in the Old Testament and New Testament, but many churches in the U.S. in various denominations have chosen to move away from those prohibitions and begun to perform same-sex marriages and appoint LGBT leaders.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/methodist-church-set-to-split-over-same-sex-marriage,2020-01-03
"In 'Snow White' reference, WaPo cartoonist depicts Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holding basket of poisoned apples as the bodies of children lay on the ground","In a reference to the classic story ""Snow White,"" Washington Post political cartoonist Michael de Adder depicted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) holding a basket of poisoned apples as the bodies of three children who apparently ate the tainted fruit lay on the ground — the basket is labeled ""don't say gay"" and a shirt on one of the children reads, ""trans kids.""

""I'm protecting Florida's children from you,"" the DeSantis figure says to Snow White and Mickey Mouse.

""Snow White did not die from eating the apple. She fell into a coma. It was in the movie. So if she didn't die from eating the apple, those kids are not dead. People here have lost their minds,"" de Adder wrote in a now-deleted post.



When someone asked de Adder why he had deleted the post, the cartoonist replied, ""I stand by it.""



The morbid cartoon comes as leftists rail against the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill that the Sunshine State governor signed last week.

One of the provisions in the measure prohibits teaching students in kindergarten through third grade about sexual orientation and gender identity.

""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,"" the text states.



The Walt Disney Company issued a statement last week declaring that it will push for the legislation to be spiked in court or repealed by the state legislature.

""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,"" Disney's statement declared.

DeSantis said that Disney had gone over the line.

""This state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of Florida. It is not based on the demands of California corporate executives. They do not run this state. They do not control this state,"" DeSantis declared.

Former NFL player Michael Sam says the LGBT community used him as a poster boy and then abandoned him,"In an emotional interview published on Yahoo News, former NFL player Michael Sam recounts how his life fell apart after he was celebrated as the first openly gay player in the NFL.

Sam also criticizes the LGBT community, among others, for not helping him after his life had spiraled out of control.

He faced a firestorm of public outcry and scrutiny when he was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in 2014, and cameras showed him kissing his then-fiance in celebration.

After playing for the Rams and being released, he was picked up by the Dallas Cowboys but was released without playing one down for the organization.

Sam says he began to abuse drugs and alcohol and lost control of his life.

When he found himself in a one-bedroom apartment in Dallas by the Fall of 2016, he reached out to the LGBT community who had championed him before, as well as other sports organizations and businesses.

Despite the previous support they had shown him, ""no one would give me a job,"" he said.

""Where was the support that I got for coming out?"" Sam added. ""I felt like I was used by everyone.""

He was partying, working out and hooked on cocaine. ""I felt lost and worthless,"" he said.

Sam has since stopped abusing hard drugs after an ayahuasca retreat in Peru. He is working to heal his broken relationship with his family.

Michigan Supreme Court says ban on sex-based discrimination also bans sexual orientation discrimination,"The Michigan Supreme Court has declared that a state law prohibiting sex-based discrimination also bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation — the 5-2 ruling marks a significant blow for Michiganders who oppose the LGBT agenda.

""At issue for our consideration is whether the prohibition of discrimination 'because of . . . sex' in the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (the ELCRA) ... encompasses discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We hold that it does,"" the decision states. ""Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily constitutes discrimination because of sex.""

The case involved Rouch World, LLC, which had declined to host a same-sex wedding, and Uprooted Electrolysis, LLC, which refused to provide hair-removal services to a transgender woman. In both instances, the owners of the facilities felt that providing the requested services would have violated their religious beliefs.

The owners of Rouch World ""explained that hosting and participating in a same-sex wedding ceremony would violate their sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a sacred act of worship between one man and one woman,"" the opinion noted.

And in the other matter, ""the owner of Uprooted Electrolysis, perceived the requested services to be centrally connected to Wolfe’s transgender identity and asserted that delivering these services would violate her sincerely held religious belief that sex is an immutable gift from God,"" according to the ruling.

""I take no issue with the merits of the policy adopted today by a majority of this Court,"" Justice Brian Zahra wrote in a dissent. ""And this Court’s duty is to say what the law is, not what it thinks the law ought to be. But this is exactly what a majority of this Court has done here. The majority opinion declares that the ELCRA's prohibition of discrimination 'because of . . . sex' precludes discrimination because of sexual orientation—an interpretation that eluded the Legislature, the courts, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission (the MCRC), the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (the MDCR), and the people of Michigan for the vast majority of the ELCRA’s 45-year existence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-supreme-court-sexual-orientation,2022-07-29
Michigan town defunds 'groomer' library over its insistence on including graphic LGBT content in young adult section,"After a protracted battle over its LGBT content, residents of Jamestown Township, Michigan, voted no (62.5% to 37.5%) on August 2 to a 10-year millage renewal and increase for the Patmos Library. (A millage rate is the tax rate used to determine local property taxes.)

Bridge Michigan has reported that 84% of the library’s $245,000 annual budget derives from the now rejected millage, which means, according to library board president Larry Walton, Patmos will likely run out of funds in early 2023, despite the library having $325,000 in reserve. It will also mean residents won't have their property taxes raised by $24.

Walton accused those who voted to defund the library over its LGBT content of being “short sighted.”

Nathan Triplett, president of the ACLU of Michigan, lauded Walton and his team for ""refus[ing] to give in"" to the demands of residents of a county that voted for Donald Trump over Joe Biden by a 20-point margin.

Another Twitter user suggested Walton had held the library hostage over LGBT pornography.

Executive director of the Michigan Library Association, Debbie Mikula, told Bridge Michigan that among the 40 public library millage rates that were voted on across the state on Tuesday, most passed. Patmos Library, she suggested, was exceptional given its ""cultural issues.""

In the weeks leading up to the vote, concern was expressed over the content on display and in circulation at Patmos Library.

In one instance, some parents reportedly took issue with the inclusion of Maia Kobabe's ""Gender Queer: A Memoir"" in the library's collection. Kobabe's comic book contains illustrations of sex acts, including one encounter involving a sex toy, and has been touted as ""a tool"" to help others understand pronoun use and the meaning of ""nonbinary."" When asked to remove the book from circulation, the library board instead set it behind the counter.

The board kept 59 other books with LGBT themes — including ""Spinning"" and ""Kiss Number 8"" — on the shelves (some in the young adult section) despite similar backlash.

Kelly Jensen, writing for Book Riot, blamed ""conservative propaganda"" for painting Patmos Library ""as an institution with groomers."" She highlighted the efforts of a small group named the Jamestown Conservatives, which has a private Facebook page with 146 members, created on May 24. Jensen assigned them the victory: ""Jamestown Conservatives, a right-wing group ... is responsible for helping defund their public library.""

Jensen also warned fellow liberals: ""We will continue to see groups like Jamestown Conservatives across the country get onto public library and school boards to make decisions on the curriculum and materials all students have access to.""

Jamestown Township resident Sarah Johnson told Bridge Michigan after voting against the millage renewal: ""We're all for the library. I use it. We want to make a statement that we want some say in the books.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-town-defunds-groomer-library,2022-08-04

Miss Staten Island comes out as bisexual — then gets banned from St. Patrick's Day Parade,"Madison L'Insalata, Miss Staten Island, decided to take action after learning that the local Pride Center was denied participation in the borough's St. Patrick's Day Parade, WABC-TV reported.

""I thought this might be a good time to really make a statement and take a stand,"" she told the station, ""and I wanted to announce that I would be marching in the parade with rainbow colors and showing that and coming out and saying that I was bi because I wanted people to see the colors, and I wanted there to be discussion, and I wanted people to talk. I wanted there to be change.""

What happened next?



A few hours after she came out publicly as bisexual, L'Insalata told WCBS-TV that parade organizers banned her from marching.

Jim Smith, director of Miss Staten Island Scholarship Pageants, called her with the news late Saturday night after parade organizer Larry Cummings told him that L'Insalata and another pageant queen who supported her were banned from Sunday's festivities, WCBS added.

""I was like stunned by the whole thing,"" Smith told the station. ""I wasn't prepared. He just said we're worried about her safety, like he's doing us a favor.""

How did L'Insalata react?



While watching the parade from the sidewalk decked out with her ""Miss Staten Island"" sash and sparkling tiara, L'Insalata told WABC she doesn't buy the safety concerns.

""It seems like it might have more to do with me coming out as bi and saying that I'd be wearing my rainbow scarf that I have here, and them not being OK with that,"" she told the station.

L'Insalata was Miss Richmond County two years ago and has marched in the parade before. She said she tried to march with pride flags but was told not to.



What did Cummings have to say?

Cummings couldn't be reached for comment on the L'Insalata controversy, but he told the Staten Island Advance last month in regard to the borough's Pride Center ban that ""it's a non-sexual identification parade, and that's that. No, they are not marching.""

When asked if the Pride Center would ever be allowed to march in the parade, Cummings told the paper, ""Don't try to keep asking a million friggin' questions, OK? The fact of the matter is that's what it is, OK? And that's that.""

20 Major League Baseball teams have promoted or funded groups involved in child gender transitions,"Twenty of the thirty Major League Baseball teams have promoted or funded groups that advocate child gender transitions, according to a report from National Review.

The report says that teams have included LGBT-themed ""Pride Nights"" that have led to their support of groups that ""encourage or provide sex-change procedures and gender-transition hormone treatment for minors as young as 12.""

Other groups push ""social transitions,"" which have to do with switching clothing, names, and pronouns for children as young as 3 years old.

In one example, the Detroit Tigers encouraged ticket buyers to donate to various organizations related to the LGBT movement. Among those were PFLAG of Detroit, which is dedicated to ""donating Gay, Lesbian, Bi-sexual, and Transgender-positive books to public libraries for a greater understanding of the real lives of our children.’”

The Boston Red Sox donated $200,000 to Fenway Health, an LGBT clinic, as a part of their 2018 LGBT “Spirit Day” celebration. Fenway Health offered services including hormonal drugs, puberty blockers, and sex-change surgeries for adolescent children.

The comprehensive report listed all of the 20 teams with their support for numerous transgender organizations. It also noted that surveys show MLB fans to be among the most conservative, just behind those of the National Hockey League.

Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, told National Review that MLB fans needed to pressure the organization against such one-sided partisan support.

""The reality of Major League Baseball — one of our last conservative institutions, if you will — not just going woke in terms of lip service, but actively funding something that is nefarious and evil, is a real gut punch,” Roberts said.

“What it highlights for me and for all of us at Heritage, and movement conservatives around the country, is that we have to be focused, as conservatives, on retaking the institutions that are able to be reformed,"" he added. ""I think Major League Baseball is probably one of those.”

Among those who have previously pushed back against MLB's push for the LGBT agenda were players on the Tampa Bay Rays who refused to wear LGBT ""pride"" themed jerseys in June.

"Mom savages school board with powerful testimony against leftist, anti-police, ‘communist’ curriculum: Stop ‘emotionally abusing,’ ‘indoctrinating’ our kids!","A Carmel, New York, mother tore a school board to shreds during a recent meeting as she said that the district was guilty of indoctrinating children into believing they are inherently racist and bigoted, that police officers are murderers, and other leftist talking points.

What are the details?

Viral video captured the moment mom Tatiana Ibrahim castigated school board members for being ""thieves"" and ""liars"" who are allowing schools and teachers to emotionally abuse district students.

Ibrahim showed up at the meeting to discuss the board's proposed budget, which many parents spoke out against.

She told the school board members that she voted against the new budget because she was not happy about the ""communist"" curriculum within the district and ""indoctrination"" of young, impressionable children.

In extremely heated remarks, the fiery mom said, ""My message to this district and the members of the Board of [Education] — stop indoctrinating our children! Stop teaching our children to hate the police! Stop teaching our children that if they don't agree with the LGBT community that they're homophobic!

""You have no idea each child's life,"" she railed. ""You don't know what their family lifestyle consists of. You don't know the makeup of their life. You have children, like mine, who [are] Muslim and I'm Christian.""



Ibrahim continued, ""[Educators] purposely, themselves, expose themselves on social media. Talking about calling for the death of a former president. Or saying that any child that doesn't believe in Black Lives Matter should be canceled out. Is this what my tax dollars is paying for?""

She also took aim at teachers who promote anti-cop agendas.

""You're teaching our children to go out and murder our police officers. Do you want the proof? I have the proof!"" she insisted. ""Is that what scares you? The proof? That a parent actually standing up against all of you? Is that what scares you? To call out the names of these people?""



""You work for me,"" Ibrahim spat. ""I don't work for you. You have a duty. We are entrusting our children to you. We teach our children morals, values. When they grow up to commit crimes and end up in prison, and kill a police officer. It's our fault? No, it's your fault. You're emotionally abusing our children and mentally abusing them. You're demoralizing them by teaching them communist values. This is still America. ... And as long as I'm standing here on this good ground Earth of God, I will fight.

Mom suing school over 13-year-old daughter's 'protected' secret gender transition issues stark warning to parents across the country,"A Florida mother suing her 13-year-old daughter's school for encouraging her gender transition without parental consent recently issued a stark warning to fellow parents across the country: The same thing could happen to them under similar protocols in place at schools nationwide.

""This is happening all over the nation,"" warned January Littlejohn during an interview on Fox News Monday morning. ""This same protocol is in place in many, many schools across districts everywhere, and even the guides being used to dictate these transgender support plans that cut parents out even have the same language.""

The Tallahassee-based mom and mental health professional, joined by her attorney Vernadette Broyles, explained to the network that her case is not an isolated one.

""This is a very systematic way that parents are being excluded from important decisions occurring with their children, and further, social transition is a medical intervention that schools are grossly unqualified to be taking these steps without parental involvement,"" she said.

Littlejohn recalled that after her daughter expressed confusion over her gender during the COVID-19 pandemic, school administrators responded by enrolling her in a ""transgender support plan"" — without seeking parental approval.



When questioned regarding the plan, the school allegedly declined to disclose any information, claiming Littlejohn's daughter was ""protected by a non-discrimination law.""

""Eventually we did see the transgender support plan, which was a six-page document that they completed with my daughter, that was 13 at the time, behind closed doors, where they asked her questions that would have absolutely impacted her safety, such as which restroom she preferred to use and which sex she preferred to room with on overnight field trips,"" Littlejohn said.

Broyles added that she filed a lawsuit, arguing that Littlejohn's parental rights were violated, and soon discovered that her client's situation was similar to many others playing out around the country.

""We filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts, [and] there are lawsuits in Wisconsin, Maryland, Oregon, California,"" the attorney said. ""This is a national agenda, and parents need to recognize they have the right to direct the upbringing, education, care, medical decisions, mental health decisions of their child and they need to assert that right with their school.""

In their lawsuit against Leon County Schools officials last October, January and her husband, Jeffrey, claimed the defendants ""violated their fundamental rights"" as parents by ""implementing a protocol which explicitly circumvents parental notification and involvement in critical decisions affecting their children’s mental, emotional and physical health.""

In filing the suit, the Littlejohns are seeking injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and damages for the violations. The school filed a motion to dismiss, and the Littlejohns filed an opposition in response, Broyles said. They are now awaiting a judge's decision.

""What the school district did is tantamount to saying children need to be protected from their parents, rather than by their parents,"" Broyles told the Washington Examiner late last year. ""This guidance that they had in place and their actions convey the message that parents are presumed to be dangerous to their children.""

The Littlejohns' lawsuit is considered to have been the catalyst for Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, which was recently signed into law over and above frenzied backlash from progressive LGBT advocates and mainstream media outlets.

The legislation bars discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms and assigns scaleable guidelines for appropriate discussions on the controversial subject matter in grades thereafter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-suing-school-over-daughters-transition-issues-warning,2022-05-02
"Mother blasts lenient sentence for transgender woman who sexually assaulted daughter, 10, in restroom","A mother in Scotland ripped the lenient sentence handed down to a transgender woman who sexually assaulted her 10-year-old daughter in a supermarket restroom, the Courier reported.

The mother — who isn't being named in order to protect her child's identity — was furious that 18-year-old Katie Dolatowski is serving the sentence in the community with ""tagging orders"" rather than in jail at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court, the paper said.

""I don't have any confidence whatsoever that he will not go out and do something equally as bad or worse,"" the mother told the Courier.

What happened?

When the victim emerged from a restroom stall on March 4 of last year, Dolatowski grabbed the girl by the face, shoved her back into the stall, and ordered her to remove her pants, the paper said.

Dolatowski also told the girl a man was outside who would kill her mother, the Courier added.

But the girl punched Dolatowski in the face, stomach, and groin and ran to her father and siblings waiting outside the restroom, the paper said.

A month prior to the incident, Dolatowski filmed a 12-year-old girl on a toilet in another supermarket by holding a cellphone over the stall divider, the Courier added.

Dolatowski admitted to both crimes, the paper said, but Sheriff James Williamson gave Dolatowski what he said was a ""stringent"" community-based sentence while being banned from contact with children.

Dolatowski was considered a ""moderate risk"" of reoffending, the Courier reported, but Williamson apparently wasn't keen on jail time. ""I have come to the conclusion that the public will be better protected by the imposition of a stringent community payback order,"" he said.

A court heard that Dolatowski had been in the social care system since the age of 3 and had mental health issues, the paper said.

What else did the victim's mother say?

The 10-year-old victim's mother told the Courier that her daughter was hysterical after the attack and has had flashbacks about it: ""This is something that will remain with her for the rest of her life.""

""He was stalking the toilets,"" the mother added to the paper. ""He went there specifically to attack a child. We were so, so lucky that nothing worse happened. It was only her reaction that stopped that. It could have been a 5-year-old child that wouldn't have been able to fight back.""

As for Dolatowski's troubled background, the mother told the Courier that ""a lot of people have been in care, but they do not go out and assault children. I don't care that he has issues or what his background is: He is a pedophile, and he has been let out on a supervision order.""

She added to the paper that she feels ""very, very let down.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-blasts-sentence-transgender-attacked-daughter,2019-02-20
Mother saved her 10-year-old from a school that covertly transitioned her. Now she's fighting back and speaking out against the 'medicalization of children',"Schools across America are affirming the gender dysphoria of children without parental consent.



While some educators have been exposed for intentionally confusing children on matters of sex and identity, entire school boards are doubling down, with some battling in court to keep facilitating students' so-called transitions without telling parents.

When Jennifer — who omitted her surname for the sake of her child's privacy — caught her school covertly transitioning her 10-year-old daughter; she rescued her little girl and began homeschooling.

In many similar cases, the cards appear stacked against parents, particularly those unable to homeschool but wary of strangers confusing their kids and putting them on paths to sterile, drug-dependent, and disenchanted lives.

Jennifer recognized that while her little girl was spared, she wouldn't be the last targeted; that educators, school administrators, pharmaceutical companies, psychologists, and other power- and profit-incentivized parties were just getting started.

Recognizing that other parents may need help and that this is a battle worth winning, Jennifer and other parents are now going on the offensive.



TheBlaze recently spoke to Jennifer about the fight her volunteer organization, Partners for Ethical Care, is taking to the loose coalition of bad actors apparently eager to transmogrify children, usurp parental rights, and turn a profit at the expense of innocence.



What are the details?

In November, Jennifer told Wesley Yang, who runs the Substack ""Year Zero,"" about how her school first socially transitioned her 10-year-old daughter without informing her.



""The school was using a name that she made up, so not her name that was given to her, and different pronouns,"" said Jennifer.

Jennifer's daughter no longer used the girls' bathroom. Had she been 13 or older, she would have been able to use boys' facilities without Jennifer knowing, but as she was still only 10 at the time, she instead used the office washroom.

A school therapist would regularly meet with Jennifer's daughter, ultimately in excess of five hours.

In these meetings, the therapist would reportedly employ biologically inaccurate pronouns in reference to the little girl and egg on the child's temporary identity crisis.

One teacher went so far as to suggest that Jennifer's little girl be assigned to a boys' cabin at camp.

For the most part, the school elected not to keep Jennifer's family in the loop.

""It just felt so much like an injustice,"" she told TheBlaze. ""I knew I was gonna try to do whatever I could to push back against it.""

Despite fearing that Child Protective Services might break up her family, citing her refusal to accommodate the so-called transition, Jennifer ultimately pulled her daughter out. CPS fortunately never came, and Jennifer now homeschools her child.



Her daughter's previous confusion, exacerbated by her LGBT friend group and by social media, dissipated over time.

While her battle for her daughter's well-being was over, Jennifer's war against the ""medicalization of children"" was just beginning.

Partners for Ethical Care

While Jennifer and her family enjoyed the requisite stability to homeschool, she recognized that not all parents have that as an option. She also suspected that soon, CPS and other state agencies would be weaponized against families antipathetic to the medicalization of their children.

""I do remember at some point, my mother's saying to me, 'This is so huge. ... What are you going to be able to do?' I said I don't know, but if I don't, who will do something?"" said Jennifer. ""Everything has to start somewhere, right?""

Jennifer noted that at the time, she wasn't aware of some of the other groups committed to protecting children from the transsexual agenda but is now well acquainted with the work of Stephanie Davies-Arai of Transgender Trend and others in the U.S. extra to the ""vast underground network of parents"" committed to the fight.

Keen to undertake an initiative of their own, Jennifer, Alix Aharon of the Gender Mapping Project, Jeannette Cooper, and several others banded together in fall 2020.

Jennifer recalled the sentiment early on: ""We're like, let's start this organization. Let's fight. Let's fight the medicalization. ... We were looking to create awareness because there didn't seem to be much outside of our tiny bubble. And to gather stories to potentially help [in legal efforts].""

The group they founded is called Partners for Ethical Care.

""No child is born in the wrong body"" is the understanding underpinning the work undertaken by the volunteers behind PEC, all committed to stopping the ""medicalization of children.""

As part of its campaign to raise awareness, PEC shares testimonials on both its website and podcast from families adversely affected by transsexual ideology as well as from those who have ""desisted"" (i.e., ended social and or medical transmogrifications.)

PEC also provides parents with resources detailing methods by which they can opt their kids out of gender education programs and find ""gender-critical"" therapists, as well as what to look out for in the way of deceptive practices widely employed by school administrators and educators.

The awareness and resource campaign is critically important, suggested Jennifer, since the fight against the medicalization agenda targeting minors and the true nature of the underlying problem is ""under a media blackout, especially in left-wing media, mainstream media.""

Best practices

Jennifer highlighted three major ways parents can confront this threat posed to their children.

First, she suggested that parents should regulate and monitor their kids' interactions online.

""The biggest thing is for parents to keep their kids off the internet for as long as possible,"" she said. ""My daughter did learn some of these things in an online forum — a drawing forum.""

Whether it's on Discord or in online games, ""The internet is a predator's playground right now.""

According to Jennifer, both predators and the ideologically motivated seek out the vulnerable online.

Narrowing kids' exposure to content that inspires and promotes gender dysphoria online is important but only a partial measure.

Second, Jennifer suggested that parents need to stand up for their kids in their school districts.

Any ground conceded by parents regarding how their children are to be raised is ground that will ultimately be taken by bad actors. Thus, parents need to keep ""standing up for their kids and trying to change the harmful policies"" in schools.

""I will say it's scary for a lot of people to go up [against school boards and educators],"" she said, noting how parents critical of transsexual bathroom policies and the crimes they enabled in Loudoun County, Virginia, ""got framed as terrorists.""

Jennifer suggested that the PEC, like the parental rights movements combatting transsexual propaganda and policies in Virginia and the coalition of Muslim and Christian parents who recently sued a school board in Ohio, are not, contrary to the suggestion of some LGBT activists, ""powered by hate.""

""We are not getting paid. We're doing this out of love. We're doing this because we care that much,"" she said.

Third, ""every parent should look into the gender policy at their school. Information is power.""



This can be hard, she said, because often, schools keep their real intents and policies hidden.

The foundation for these three tactics is awareness.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-fighting-back-and-speaking-out-against-the-medicalization-of-children,2022-12-21
Mother protests after being turned away from father-daughter dance with son,"A New Hampshire woman is protesting the 20-year tradition of her community's father-daughter dance, after being told the event was reserved for fathers and daughters.

What are the details?

Mother Jennifer Meade told the Valley News she bought four tickets to the event last weekend by the Carter Community Building Association. She arrived with her boyfriend, daughter and son, and says she and her son were kicked out. Her boyfriend and daughter decided to leave, too.

Meade is now protesting over the event's gender exclusion.

""In this day and age, it's not like your gender should define what type of parent you really are,"" she told the Valley News. ""I don't understand why I have to be a dad to celebrate Valentine's Day with my kids.""

CCBA executive director Shelby Day disputed the mother's claim, saying, ""(Meade) was not kicked out. She was encouraged to remain in the building and to hang out in our game room downstairs.""

""It's a father-daughter dance,"" Day explained. ""That is what this (event) is about.""

The CCBA also has a mother-son dance slated for the spring, and a family dance will be held in the fall.

Anything else?

Meade isn't alone in her feelings. A growing number of father-daughter dances across the country are being forced to allow mothers and boys to participate to be more inclusive, or canceled altogether in what many are calling an overreach of politically correct culture.

In 2017, the Crocker/Riverside Elementary School's Father-Daughter dance in Sacramento was changed to a family dance after a few parents asked that the event be more inclusive. School principal Daniel McCord told KTXL-TV he didn't receive any pushback over the decision, saying the community was supportive.

""However the child wants to define their family, whoever they want to bring with them they're able to do that,"" McCord said, saying the change was a teaching moment for students.

Last week, the principal of Staten Island Public School 65 told the PTA to pull the plug on its annual father-daughter dance because of the New York Department of Education's new Gender Nonconforming Student Guidelines, prohibiting events with ""gender based practices.""

Department spokeswoman Toya Holness told the New York Post that schools ""must ensure that such events are gender-neutral and open to all students and their person(s) in parental relation.""

The DOE's LGBT community liaison, Jared Fox, further explained: ""Father-daughter dances inherently leave people out. Not just because of transgender status, just life in general. These can be really uncomfortable and triggering events.""

But many parents aren't happy with the decision, and have taken to social media disputing the school's decision.

Mother Akaia Cameron, whose third-grade daughter attended the event with her father last year, told the Post, ""All this gender crap needs to just stop.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-protests-after-being-turned-away-from-father-daughter-dance-with-son,2019-02-14
"Asian country approves execution by stoning, whipping for 'crime' of homosexuality under Sharia Law","The small Asian country of Brunei has approved new measures that would allow anyone who engaged in homosexual activity to be stoned or whipped to death. The new legislation is part of the country's push to adhere more closely to Sharia Law.

Where is Brunei?

Brunei shares the island of Borneo with Malaysia. In 2018, it had a population of 450,565, according to the CIA World Factbook. Most of the population (78.8 percent) is Muslim, although there are significant Christian (8.7 percent) and Buddhist (7.8 percent) minorities.

The country is run by an absolute monarch, Sultan and Prime Minister Sir Hassanal Bolkiah, who has ruled the country since 1967.

What do the new laws say?

The new laws are part of the introduction of what the Independent described as a ""Sharia Law-style system for criminal punishment."" Homosexuality was already illegal in the country, but did not incur the death penalty.

Amnesty International called on Brunei to ""immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments, and revise its penal code in compliance with its human rights obligations."" Other human rights groups have also called on Brunei to repeal this new law, which is scheduled to take effect on April 3.

The country also reportedly added amputation as a penalty for theft, even if the culprit is a child.

The country also has existing laws against not praying on Fridays or getting pregnant out of wedlock, as part of the Sharia Penal Code of 2014. At the time, the country toned down the punishments for homosexuality due to international pressure, including a boycott at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California, which is owned by the Sultan.

Brunei is not the only country to enact such laws. Homosexuality can also earn a death sentence in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/muslim-country-approves-execution-for-homosexuality,2019-03-27
Muslim parents in UK protest LGBT curriculum that some describe as brainwashing,"More than 200 Muslim parents and children protested Thursday outside a primary school in England over the school's LGBT curriculum that some parents have condemned as brainwashing, Fox News reported.

The program, dubbed ""No Outsiders,"" was developed five years ago by Andrew Moffat, the assistant head of Parkfield Community School in Birmingham, who is gay.

""This is a brainwash. We bring our children here so they can later work as a solicitor or a teacher, not to be taught about being gay or a lesbian,"" Abdul Ma, 46, told the Sun in an earlier interview.

Thursday's protest was one of many that have occurred in recent weeks over ""No Outsiders"" lessons that Moffat claims were meant to educate the 4- to 11-year-old students about accepting differences among those in society, according to BBC News.

The parents, who are mostly Muslim, have participated in the weekly protests over the lessons they believe promoted gay and transgender lifestyles to the young students.

""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun. ""You are using our children as an experiment.""

On March 1, many parents reportedly withdrew their children from the school for a day.

What did the school say?

The school recently issued a letter stating it would not be teaching the curriculum for the rest of the school year.

""Up to the end of this term, we will not be delivering any No Outsiders lessons in our long-term year curriculum plan, as this half term has already been blocked for religious education. Equality assemblies will continue as normal and our welcoming No Outsiders ethos will be there for all,"" Parkfield educators wrote in the letter, according to the BBC.

What else?

Organizers reportedly said that the parents would continue their protests until the school does away with the curriculum altogether.

School officials said it would have conversations with concerned parents about the lessons before the beginning of the next school year",https://www.theblaze.com/news/muslim-parents-in-uk-protest-lgbt-curriculum-that-some-describe-as-brainwashing,2019-03-07
Muslim member of Human Rights Commission denies calls to resign after he called gays an 'abomination to the Human Race',"The mayor of Virginia Beach, Virginia, is calling for a Muslim member of the Human Rights Commission to resign after anti-gay comments were unearthed.

Mayor Bobby Dyer said in a media briefing Friday that it was ""no longer appropriate"" for commissioner Kenick El to continue on the board.

El posted the comments to his personal Facebook account, which included referring to homosexuality as an ""abomination to the Human Race,"" and also a mental illness.

He says that he will not resign, and that he will continue to serve for the sake of supporting human rights.

El also posted an article about a transgender person sexually abusing a child, and added a comment many found offensive to the LGBTQ community.

""This is why we need to stop giving men in dresses passes,"" he wrote.

""I have daughters and I won't accept them sharing a restroom with a grown man suffering from this mental illness,"" he added. ""Men trying to be women and women trying to be men is really confusing our children and I'm tired of seeing this nonsense promoted to our children.""

The LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach has called for his ouster, and many, but not all, of the other commissioners have joined that demand. They are looking for ways to have El removed from the commission.

"Muslim soccer player refuses to wear rainbow jersey backing LBGTQ, sits out game — now leftists smell blood: 'Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime'","Idrissa Gueye — a Muslim soccer player for French team Paris Saint-Germain — refused to wear a jersey adorned with rainbow-colored numbers in support of an LBGTQ agenda and sat out his team's 4-0 Saturday win against Montpellier, the Daily Mail reported.

Now, one activist group wants an investigation, and others want Gueye punished.

What are the details?

The Daily Mail said players across France wore the special jerseys over the weekend in solidarity with the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, which takes place Tuesday.

Gueye's manager Mauricio Pochettino said the player's absence from the match was for ""personal reasons, but he is not injured,"" the outlet added.

But the Daily Mail, citing French outlet RMC Sport, said Gueye was out because he didn't want to wear the jersey with rainbow colors; the Daily Mail added that its sports news section has contacted Gueye's representatives for comment.

'Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime'

Rouge Direct — which the Daily Mail said fights against homophobia in sport — is calling for action and wants the French League and Gueye's team to find out why he missed the game.

""Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime,"" Rouge Direct tweeted Sunday. ""The [league] and the [team] must ask ... Gueye to explain [himself] and very quickly. And punish him if necessary.""

President of the France LGBT+ Sports Federation Eric Arassus told RMC Sport that Gueye ""is a great player, but religion is not a part of the sport. Every player took part [in the rainbow jersey initiative] except him. He should be sanctioned. Gueye’s excuses show that the club [PSG] and league let homophobia happen,"" the Daily Mail said.

Gueye, 32, regularly shares messages about his faith on social media, the outlet added.

L’Equipe newspaper reported that Gueye missed last season's match during which the rainbow jerseys were worn due to gastroenteritis, the Associated Press said.

How have others reacted?

Reactions on Twitter to Gueye sitting out the game seemed mixed, though it seems, so far, most folks support his decision:

""Idrissa Gueye is Muslim. He has never (not to anyone's knowledge) mistreated or discriminated against any member of the LBGTQ community,"" one user said. ""Forcing him to be a poster boy for a something against his faith, however, is very disrespectful, borderline Islamophobic even.""

""He has every right not wear some stupid LGBTQ+ flag on his [jersey] ... what happened to freedom of choice?"" another user asked. ""Why are these devils trying to shove it down everyone’s throat ... Massive Respect Idrissa Gueye ... I’m now a fan.""

""Hope more footballers are like Idrissa Gueye,"" another user said. ""We should never allow people to shove their extreme and insane ideology down in our throats.""

"Nancy Pelosi, Democrats blame 'MAGA Republicans' and 'anti-LGBTQ bills' for mass shooting at LGBT club","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi drew a clear connection between ""MAGA Republicans"" and the mass attack at an LGBT nightclub in Colorado Springs.

What did Pelosi say?

In one statement on Sunday, Pelosi condemned the ""despicable"" attack at Club Q, which she noted fell ""on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance.""

""The attack on Club Q, which fell on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, is despicable — further shattering the sense of safety of LGBTQ Americans across the country,"" she said.

Then, in a second statement commemorating Transgender Day of Remembrance, Pelosi took a direct shot at ""MAGA Republicans,"" blaming them for violence — like the attack on Club Q — against LGBT people.

""That fight remains more urgent than ever, as right-wing extremists target transgender Americans’ most fundamental rights and freedoms,"" Pelosi said,

""Whether spouting dangerous rhetoric from cable news desks or openly bullying schoolchildren from the halls of power, MAGA Republicans are cruelly undermining the safety and well-being of our transgender community,"" she charged.

What did others say?

Other Democratic lawmakers, organizations, and media outlets alleged that people who disagree with the LGBT agenda are essentially responsible for the heinous attack.

For example, the Denver Democrats said in a statement:

There’s a clear link between these kinds of attacks and extremists’ blatantly false and hateful rhetoric about the LGBTQ community. We’ve seen an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ bills — nearly 300 just this year — which are rooted in archaic and ugly ideologies that only seek to sow more division and traumatize a group of people who simply want the same rights as everyone else.

Rep. Alexandria Ocaiso-Cortez said, ""After Trump elevated anti-immigrant & anti-Latino rhetoric, we had the deadliest anti-Latino shooting in modern history. After anti-Asian hate w/COVID, Atlanta. Tree of life. Emanuel AME. Buffalo. And now after an anti-LGBT+ campaign, Colorado Springs. Connect the dots, @GOP.""



Meanwhile, news outlets like the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times also tried to connect Republicans and the Club Q attack.

What are officials saying?

Despite the heavy-handed rhetoric, officials confirmed Monday they have not yet discovered sufficient evidence to conclude the perpetrator was motivated by hate for LGBT people.

"Washington National Cathedral cowers to woke mob, apologizes for letting famed pastor Max Lucado preach. His offense? Holding biblical views on sexuality and marriage.","The Washington National Cathedral took heavy fire for allowing popular evangelical pastor and author Max Lucado to preach at its virtual Sunday service last weekend. Though the church initially defended its decision as part of a move to build bridges, leadership later caved to pressure from left-wing activists and nearly tripped over themselves apologizing for the mistake of allowing Lucado to speak.

Lucado's offense? He holds biblical Christian views on sexuality and marriage.

He didn't preach on those topics Sunday — his sermon was about the Holy Spirit, the Christian Post reported — but the fact that he has a history of standing up for traditional biblical values on social issues was enough to have him silenced, the woke mob said.

What happened?

After the Episcopal Church's Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Paul in the City and the Diocese of Washington invited Lucado to speak at the cathedral in Washington, D.C., LGBT activists were livid.

The reliably liberal denomination known for its left-wing views on marriage and sexuality had betrayed the gay community by inviting a nondenominational evangelical pastor like Lucado who follows traditional Christian teachings on marriage and sexually, and the woke mob couldn't have that.

So they did what mobs do: sought to intimidate their target into compliance and force their opponent to be silenced.

Activists launched a petition days before Lucado's sermon demanding that the church rescind its invitation to Lucado, claiming that his ""teaching and preaching inflicts active harm on LGBTQ people.""

They accused him of pushing ""[f]ear-mongering and dehumanizing messages"" and preaching ""the kind of dangerous theology that promotes oppression of and violence toward the LGBTQ community.""

According to the petition, ""Lucado has inflicted serious harm"" and should not be given a platform.

On Feb. 6, the cathedral's dean, the Rev. Randy Hollerith, sent a response to the petition. Hollerith said that he and the church have long been supporters of ""LGBTQ inclusion"" and that they ""believe the Gospel calls us to nothing short of full embrace and inclusion."" He also added that he understood why the petitioners would be concerned about Lucado's past statements on sexuality and that it ""grieves"" him when churches ""are used as weapons against God's LGBTQ children.""

But, he said, there was good reason to invite Lucado: We must find common ground, which comes by peacefully engaging with people we might disagree with.

He wrote:

Let me share why we invited Max to preach. We have to come out of our corners, find common ground where we can, and find ways to live with and see each other as the beloved children of God that we are. We have all grown too accustomed in our silos and echo chambers. In order to start the process of rebuilding, we need to hear from each other.



That does not mean we will always agree. In fact, I don't agree with Max's views on LGBTQ issues. We can still hold our convictions and cling to our values in the midst of disagreement. But the work that we cannot ignore is the vitally important task of what Isaiah called “repairing the breach."" That starts, first and foremost, with those with whom we disagree. When we only engage with those with whom we agree on every issue, we find ourselves in a dangerous (and lonely) place. My hope is that all churches and faith communities will find ways to open their doors to perspectives different from their own.

And retired Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church, defended the cathedral's invitation in a video Sunday morning after Lucado's sermon, saying the church should be a house of prayer for ""all the people of God — all — and sometimes that includes we don't agree with much at all.""

Fallout continued

But that wasn't enough for Lucado's critics. They had wanted his sermon canceled, and when it wasn't, they turned up the outrage and increased their criticism of church leaders, according to a report from the Episcopal News Service.

By Wednesday, the church leaders had had enough and scrambled to offer apologies to the mob for the horrible ""mistake"" of inviting someone with a record allegedly causing so much pain to speak.

Dean Hollerith blamed his ""straight privilege"" for failing to understand the ""pain"" Lucado had caused in the past and the ""depth of injury his words have had.""

""I made a mistake and I am sorry,"" Hollerith said.

Washington Bishop Mariann Budde echoed the dean's statements and offered her own mea culpa.

""I would like to apologize for the hurt caused in inviting Max Lucado to preach at Washington National Cathedral,"" she wrote. ""I have heard from those who were not only wounded by things Max Lucado has said and taught, but equally wounded by the decision to welcome him into the Cathedral's pulpit.""

Hollerith and Budde announced that they are going to hold a ""listening session"" on Feb. 21 for anyone who wants to share their LGBT experiences within the church.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-cathedral-apolgizes-for-allowing-max-lucado-to-speak,2021-02-12
National conservatives win decisive victory in Italy — Giorgia Meloni set to become country's first female prime minister,"Giorgia Meloni is set to become Italy's first female prime minister, with early official results confirming exit poll suggestions that her national conservative coalition, known as Centro Destra, has won enough seats to gain a parliamentary majority. The Fratelli d'Italia, which Meloni founded in 2012, won just 4.4% of the vote in the 2018 election. It is now Italy's largest party, with over 26%. The coalition to which it belongs received over 43% of the vote in Sunday's election.

Upon learning of her victory, Meloni told supporters that ""Italy has chosen us, and we won't betray her"" and that her party will ""govern for everyone.""

The winning coalition, which will now run the EU's third-largest economy, is composed of Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), former Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's Lega, and former Prime Minister Silvia Berlusconi's Forza Italia.

This victory comes just weeks after the rightist Sweden Democrats made substantial gains in the Nordic country's national elections with the second-largest share of the vote.

Meloni's views, Italian implications

According to Giovanni Capoccia, professor of politics at the University of Oxford, although Meloni's coalition lacks a supermajority to change Italy's constitution unilaterally, it does hold a majority in both Italy's Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.



Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, suggested on the BBC that the three keywords best used to describe what Meloni stands for are ""ultraconservative values, anti-immigration and nationalism.""



In 2019, Meloni gave a speech to supporters in Rome, declaring: ""I'm Giorgia, I'm a woman, I'm a mother, I'm Italian, I'm Christian! You won't take that away from me!""

Meloni has previously stated she:

supports a naval blockade preventing illegal aliens from the Near East and Northern Africa from flooding into Italy;

opposes gay adoption and the LGBT lobby;

opposed COVID-19 passports;

believes in the defense of ""national interests and popular sovereignty"";

""a just relationship between government and taxpayers,"" emphasizing economic freedom;

seeks to ""protect religious and moral values,""

says ""Yes to the culture of life, no the abyss of death"";

says ""No to the violence of Islam, yes to safe borders"";

would ""pull out of China's Belt and Road Initiative""; and

would ""stay united"" with the rest of the EU as it relates to Ukraine versus Russia.

Luca Tomini, a political scientist at Free Brussels University, told EuroNews that ""what we need to expect is a more Eurosceptic position of the Italian government on several issues. There will be probably a realignment of Italy along with the government of Poland especially.""

The European Union has a fraught relationship with Hungary and Poland, particularly as the eastern European nations have pushed back against Brussels' LGBT policies and emphasized the priority of their own laws and sovereignty.

Earlier this month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, when asked about the Italian election, claimed, ""If things go in a difficult direction — and I've spoken about Hungary and Poland — we have the tools,"" intimating Brussels could financially penalize EU governments that are regarded as in violation of central policy.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki responded, calling Leyen's claims ""scandalous,"" suggesting, ""She said Brussels had the tools to discipline Italy if it created a government that would not be in favor of Brussels. ... Is this the Europe we want? ... The Eurocrats in Brussels dictate what the government should be?""

At the 2020 National Conservatism conference in Rome, in a speech she dedicated to Pope John Paul II and former President Ronald Reagan, Meloni stated that one of the great challenges ""facing us today is defending national identity and the very existence of nation-states as the sole means of safeguarding peoples' sovereignty and freedom.""



""We did not fight against, and defeat, communism in order to replace it with a new internationalist regime,"" said Meloni, ""but to permit independent nation-states once again to defend the freedom, identity, and sovereignty of their peoples.""

Although Meloni and her coalition have been characterized as fascistic, she suggests they are guardians of democracy. ""Whether the false democrats like it or not,"" she said, ""national conservatives in every latitude are actually the only real democrats, because it is only defending the nation-state that we defend the political sovereignty that belongs to the citizens of that state.""

Giorgia Meloni: God, Homeland, Family | NatCon Rome 2020 youtu.be

At a 2022 CPAC convention, Meloni told an American audience: ""Our individual freedom is under attack, our rights are under attack, the sovereignty of our nations is under attack, the prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack, our children's education is under attack. Faced with this ... the only way to be rebellious is to preserve who we are, the only way to be rebellious is to be conservative.""

Leftist panic and outrage



As with the implications of the Swedish election, the results of Sunday's Italian election have not been well received by the European and international left.

Enrico Letta, the leader of Italy's leftist Democratic Party, described the success enjoyed by Meloni's alliance as a ""sad day for Italy and Europe."" Letta indicated he will now seek continued leadership of the party as of its next congress.

Pietro Castelli Gattinara, associate professor of political communication at Université Libre de Bruxelles, told Vox that the rise of popular rightist movements in Europe is ""not that different from what we have been seeing in the U.S. with the radicalization of the Republican Party, what we are seeing in India with President [Narendra] Modi, what we have seen with Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.""

Gattinara suggested such political gains are, in part, connected to and resultant of a ""mainstreaming of far-right ideas, especially with respect to some topics such as ethnic diversity, immigration, and gender issues.""

Meloni as prime minister will, said Gattinara, ""be a reboot of the Berlusconi years ... but with a much stronger attention to some of the issues that are at the core of our far-right ideologies, I think, in particular, in terms of gender equality, in terms of civil rights, abortion rights, in terms of migration, in terms of religion.""

Some have already taken to social media to urge resistance to the new democratically elected government.

Italian writer Roberto Saviano wrote: ""I read #Saviano in trend because the voters of Meloni 'invite' me to leave the country. These are warnings. This is Italy that awaits us. They are already drawing up a first black list of enemies of the homeland, in spite of those who said that Fascism is something else.""

Whereas some have claimed that the conservative victory in Italy signals ""the elected return of Fascism,"" others, including Sara Gonzales, BlazeTV host of ""The News and Why It Matters,"" have indicated that this is instead part of a trend of ""People all over the world ... waking up!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-conservatives-win-decisive-victory-in-italy-giorgia-meloni-set-to-become-countrys-first-female-prime-minister,2022-09-26
NBC reporter trips and stumbles as she tries so hard not to misgender alleged Club Q perpetrator: 'Him— them',"NBC News correspondent Niala Charles tripped and stumbled on Tuesday while trying not to misgender the person accused of committing mass murder inside a Colorado Springs LGBT nightclub.

While reporting on the more than 300 criminal charges filed against the alleged perpetrator, Charles tried to use the suspect's preferred pronouns — ""they"" and ""them"" — but it was clear she struggled to maintain coherence.

""The defense says its client uses 'they/them' pronouns, which doesn’t indicate their sexual identity and clearly hasn’t stopped the district attorney with charging them with bias,"" Charles reported. ""Prosecutors say there’s a voluminous amount of evidence here in this case to support those charges, and as for the penalties, in the state of Colorado, there isn’t a death penalty, so the suspect is looking at a possible life in prison.""

Toward the end of her report, Charles' brain appeared to misfire as she actually misgendered the alleged perpetrator.

""In court today, the suspect was in a yellow jumpsuit and significantly less bruised than when we saw them in their last court appearance after two people charged him — them — and prevented them from doing even more damage, hurting even more people,"" she said.

What is the background?

The suspected shooter's lawyers filed court documents last month that disclosed their client identifies as ""non-binary.""

""[Our client] is non-binary. They use they/them pronouns, and for the purposes of all formal filings, will be addressed as Mx. [the alleged perpetrator's last name],"" a footnote in a court filing said.

The development left some media personalities stunned because it undercut the narrative that a right-wing lunatic filled with anti-LGBT hate is responsible for the massacre at Club Q. How can that be when the alleged perpetrator himself identifies as being a member of the broader LGBT community?

Indeed, since the court filing, the media has been mostly silent about the case.

On Tuesday, prospectors filed 305 criminal charges against the suspect, including ""bias-motivated crimes,"" which are Colorado's version of hate crimes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-reporter-gender-club-q-supsect,2022-12-07
Nearly twice as many young women identify as liberals than young men amid worsening trend,"An analysis of Gallup Poll data recently conducted by the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life (SCAL) found that 44% of young women, ages 18-29, identified themselves as liberal in 2021, whereas only 25% of young men did so. The delta between the two sexes' left-leaning identification is the largest recorded in 24 years of polling, and indicative of a significant leftward shift by young women.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, less than 30% of women identified as liberal. However, after such ideological identification wavering in the low thirties between 2008 and 2012, that number began to skyrocket in 2014.

Since 1998, the highest level of male liberal identification recorded was in 2016 (29%), but that has dropped in the intervening years.

SCAL's ""American Storylines"" suggested that there are a number of factors driving this leftward trend of young women, including more time spent in academia (especially relative to men), a diminished likelihood of being or getting married, increasing secularity and homosexuality, and the socio-political impact of the Dobbs ruling which overturned Roe v. Wade.

Unmarried

Daniel Cox, a senior fellow in polling and public opinion at the AEI, noted that significantly more women under the age of 30 today are unwed (15%) as compared with twenty years ago, when roughly one-third were married. In 1972, 55% of women ages 18-29 were married.

Cox cited a 2017 study by Christopher Stout, Kelsy Kretschmer, and Leah Ruppanner which indicated single women whose interests are not aligned with or ""Institutionalized"" with a spouse or a family may be less likely to support policies that would advance such otherwise shared economic prospects.

In a phenomenon the researchers termed ""linked fate,"" rather than acting in mutual interest with a spouse, they may instead choose to act collectively with other members of their gender in support of policies that are not necessarily family-centric.

Although young men are likewise less likely now to be married now than were previous male cohorts in their age range, they nevertheless have not made a giant ideological shift leftwards.

Another significant factor linked to marriage (or at the very least to heterosexual coupling) is the impact of parenthood. A Tulane University study published last month revealed that parenthood prompts individuals to become more conservative — to prioritize safety, stability and family values.

The study also showed that those ""motivated to care for children"" may be less likely to show preference for policies that undermine the family and marriage or promote destabilizing forces such as adultery and promiscuity.

College-educated

Last year, the Atlantic reported that in 2020, U.S. colleges enrolled 1.5 million fewer students than five years prior and that men accounted for over 70% of the decline. Every year since the mid-1980s, women have earned more bachelor's degrees than men.

Cox suggested that the formal educational outpacing of men by women is reflected in the gendered delta in liberal identification, largely because ""of the stronger connection between educational attainment and political behavior."" This has been demonstrated in recent elections, where women have ""become a much more loyal Democratic constituency.""

In the 2018 midterm elections, 59% of women voted Democrat. In June-September 2022 polling, only 39.4% of women noted Republican support.

A 2018 study revealed that among 8,688 tenure track, Ph.D.-holding professors from 51 of the 66 top ranked liberal arts colleges in the U.S., the mean Democrat-to-Republican ratio was 10.4 to 1. If military colleges West Point and Annapolis were excluded, the ratio became 12.7 to 1.

In addition to the strong influence of such leftist academics, Cox suggested that extracurricular campus life has a profound political impact on students. Students are surrounded by others similarly susceptible to leftist influence, and segregated from conservative or working class views that may not be represented or permissible on campus.

Irreligious

Cox stated that young women have ""experienced the most dramatic change in religious identity,"" having undergone a five-fold increase in religious unaffiliation since the late 1990s. The figure now stands at 38%, 17 points higher than the general population.

Traditional religiosity and religious commitment have been correlated with the expression of more conservative views.

Gay

Cox suggested that young women's embrace of liberalism may also be driven by their rapid relative identification as gay, lesbian, ""queer,"" ""bisexual,"" or ""transgender.""

The SCAL reported in April that while 75% of young men say they are only attracted to women (91% of senior men noted an exclusive attraction for women), only 56% of women reported being attracted to only men.

A September 2021 article in ""Public Opinion Quarterly"" revealed that ""LGBT Americas are distinctively liberal ... in their general political predispositions, electoral choices, and attitudes on a wide range of policy matters.""

Roe v. Wade

According to an October 4 SCAL report on findings from an August 2022 American Perspectives Survey, young women are far less concerned about economic issues than their male peers, and far more concerned about restrictions on baby-killing.



Whereas 46% of men in the age group are following the news about abortion, 64% of the female cohort are following very or somewhat closely. When it comes to inflation and gasoline prices, 70% of men are paying close attention, whereas only 55% of female respondents reported paying close attention.

While abortion has captured a great deal of the public's attention, only 36% of Americans rank it as a critical issue. However, 61% of young women regard it as the ""most important issue."" By way of comparison, only 32% of young women cite crime as a critical issue, 7% than the overall average.

In a recent piece for FiveThirtyEight, Cox contrasted the relatively conservative views on abortion held by millennials to those views held by Gen Z.

Owing to their waning religiosity, women 29 and under may care less for religious-based arguments against the killing of the unborn. Additionally, other pro-life arguments may be less attractive to them, particularly if they have been impressed by the popularized suggestions that their education, careers, and personal freedoms from responsibility are the keys to happiness and success. Cox wrote, ""It's possible that support for abortion rights is rooted in the idea that an unplanned pregnancy might undermine these aspirations.""

21-year-old Rose Merjos told The Hill that ""I would always choose a candidate that's pro-abortion."" The Wesleyan University government major claimed, ""Almost everyone either knows someone who has had an abortion or has had one themselves.""

Merjos suggested that women are ""liberalize[d]"" by their involvement in campus groups and political community organizations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nearly-twice-as-many-young-women-are-devolving-into-leftists-than-young-men,2022-10-07
Netflix removes 'LGBTQ' tag from Jeffrey Dahmer biopic following backlash: Report,"Netflix has reportedly accommodated the demands of social media users who recently became enraged after the streaming service giant tagged a biopic about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as ""LGBTQ"" content.

On September 21, Netflix debuted ""Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,"" a 10-part, fictional dramatization of the life, confession, arrest, and conviction of Dahmer. Dahmer pled guilty by reason of insanity to murdering 16 men and underage boys in Milwaukee and Ohio between 1978 and 1991, though a jury later found him to be mentally competent. He was charged with but not convicted of another murder.

Under the pretense of taking nude photos of them or otherwise engaging with them sexually, Dahmer lured most of his victims to his residence or the residence belonging to his grandmother. He then drugged them, strangled them, and dismembered their bodies. In some cases, Dahmer preserved some of their body parts for masturbation purposes. Police discovered several severed heads, hearts, penises, and even complete skeletons in his apartment. Dahmer also admitted to engaging in necrophilia and cannibalism.

Most of Dahmer's victims were gay and racial or ethnic minorities.

Ostensibly because Dahmer was a homosexual and most of his victims identified as members of the gay community, Netflix tagged the series as ""LGBTQ"" content. Many on social media then complained about the association between Dahmer and the LGBTQ community.















One TikTok user called @lizthelezbo also asked ""why the f***"" Netflix would tag the series as ""LGBTQ"" since ""this is not the representation we’re looking for,"" even if it is ""technically true"" that Dahmer was gay.

Netflix has since removed the ""LGBTQ"" tag, though it is unclear when it did so.

A family member of one of Dahmer's victims has also taken to social media to explain that docuseries like ""Dahmer – Monster"" constantly ""retraumatiz[e]"" victims' families.

On Thursday, Eric Perry, a cousin of Rita Isbell, the oldest sister of Errol Lindsey, whom Dahmer murdered in 1991, tweeted: ""I’m not telling anyone what to watch, I know true crime media is huge rn, but if you’re actually curious about the victims, my family (the Isbell’s) are pissed about this show. It’s retraumatizing over and over again, and for what? How many movies/shows/documentaries do we need?""

""Like recreating my cousin having an emotional breakdown in court in the face of the man who tortured and murdered her brother is WILD. WIIIIIILD,"" he added.

Dahmer was convicted in 1992 and given 16 life sentences. In November 1994, fellow inmate Christopher Scarver murdered Dahmer while he was performing his work duties. Scarver also confessed to bludgeoning another inmate, Jesse Anderson. Scarver, a schizophrenic who had already been convicted of murder, was given two additional life sentences for the deaths of Dahmer and Anderson.

According to reports, Dahmer became a born-again Christian and was baptized into the Church of Christ before his death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/netflix-removes-lgbtq-tag-from-jeffrey-dahmer-biopic-following-backlash-report,2022-09-26
Nevada lawmaker comes out as a cisgender pansexual during floor speech,"A Nevada state lawmaker came out as a pansexual in a floor speech of the state's Assembly on Thursday afternoon.

Sarah Peters spoke about the progress of the LGBTQ+ agenda in the state of Nevada before finishing her speech with a statement of her own personal sexual preferences.

""I rise in support of National LGBT Health Awareness Week. In the past decade, Nevada has made unprecedented progress in being a more equitable home for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community,"" said Peters in the speech.

She went on to tout a report calling Nevada the best state in the union for people who are LGBTQ+.

""Today, as a pansexual cisgendered woman I stand out for equity and remind us to be inclusive in our LGBTQ+ community while we work to make Nevada a more equitable place for all,"" she concluded.

Numerous members of the Assembly applauded for Peters' statement.

The speech was tweeted out by the official account of the Nevada Assembly Democrats which praised Peters for her courage.

""We are incredibly proud of her courage and advocacy for #LGBTQ+ community!"" they tweeted.

She followed up with a tweet voicing her fears about coming out as a pansexual.

""Hi. Being celebrated for my queerness is weird. Being bisexual and pansexual comes with so much guilt and questioning,"" she tweeted.

""Am I queer enough? Am I gay enough?"" she asked. ""What if I end up heteronormative, am I straight? Y'all, we are all enough and worth celebrating!""



Peters is an environmental engineer who is married to a Marine combat veteran with three school-aged children. In 2018 she ran for the Assembly on a platform promising to protect the environment from the policies of the former Trump administration.

Pansexual people, as explained by KSNV, are sexually attracted to all genders and sexes, ""or regardless of sex and gender."" This is considered distinctly different from bisexual people.

In Peters' campaign video from 2018, she includes photos of herself at a rally to protest the presidency of former President Donald Trump, while wearing a pink ""pussy hat"" popular among liberal activists.

New Jersey mandates LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum for schools,"Following in California's footsteps, New Jersey is now the second state to force schools to have an LGBTQ curriculum.

What happened?

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Thursday signed legislation that requires every state school to teach students about the ""political, economic, and social contributions"" of LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.

Under the legislation, all middle and high schools must have instructional materials – including textbooks – that ""accurately"" portray LGBTQ people. The coursework will begin with the 2020-21 school year.

""Governor Murphy was honored to sign legislation requiring New Jersey school districts to teach about the rich contributions and accomplishments of our LGBTQ community and those with disabilities,"" Christine Lee, a spokesperson for Gov. Murphy, said in a statement obtained by NBC News. ""The Governor believes that ensuring students learn about diverse histories will help build more tolerant communities and strengthen educational outcomes.""

Any reaction?

NBC's report offered two reactions; both from LGBTQ support groups.

Garden State Equality, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, was pleased with the legislation.

In a statement, the group's executive director, Christian Fuscarino, said: ""It's critical that our classrooms highlight the achievements of LGBTQ people throughout history. Our youth deserve to see how diverse American history truly is — and how they can be a part of it one day, too.""



The Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network said that the curriculum can improve attendance.

""These lessons have also been linked to reduced absenteeism, with 17 percent of students in schools with an inclusive curriculum missing school in the past month because of feeling unsafe compared to 33 percent of students who attend schools without an inclusive curriculum,"" according to a GLSEN statement.

The LGBTQ student advocacy group also said that ""including lessons that promote respect and appreciation for diversity will help to reverse current rates of bullying and harassment LGBT students face on a regular basis.""

New lawsuit alleges YouTube is discriminatory against LGBTQ+ community,"A group of LGBTQ+ content creators is suing Google-owned YouTube because they believe YouTube is discriminatory when it comes to serving up related community content.

What are the details?

According to the Washington Post, the content creators in question insist that YouTube is suppressing their content, which reportedly restricts ability to sell advertising and bring in new subscribers.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday, also says that content policies are not enforced equally and ""gives a pass to producers with large audiences, even when their content is hostile to gay, lesbian, or other communities."" The suit, which is seeking class action status, also notes that the company engages in ""unlawful content regulation, distribution, and monetization practices that stigmatize, restrict, block, demonetize, and financially harm the LGBT Plaintiffs and the greater LGBT Community.""

Peter Obstler of Browne George Ross, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said that discrimination is ""embedded into the business model"" of the company.

""By controlling an estimated 95 percent of public video communications that occur in the world, Google and YouTube wield unparalleled power and unfettered discretion to apply viewpoint-based content policies in a way that permits them to pick winners and losers,"" he said.

What else?

The group of content creators also allege that the company's algorithms and personnel blacklist LGBT-related content, including terms like ""gay,"" ""lesbian,"" and ""bisexual.""

The lawsuit also notes that YouTube-produced videos are able to electively shut off comments on its products while still earning advertising revenue.

The Post reported that a spokesperson for the company would not comment on the impending litigation.

New poll finds that younger generations’ acceptance of LGBTQ movement is waning,"A new poll has found that non-gay Americans ages 18-34 have expressed less support of the LGBTQ community since 2016.

What are the details?

GLAAD commissioned the Harris Poll, which found that support for the LGBTQ community fell 28 percent from 2016 to 2018. According to CNS News, ""the percentage of non-gay Americans"" of the same age group ""who felt comfortable in personal situations involving LGBTQ persons increased.""

""For example,"" the outlet reported, ""the percentage of normal Americans who felt 'uncomfortable' in learning a family member is LGBTQ rose from 24 [percent] to 36 [percent].""

The survey was conducted in January 2019 on 1,970 Americans over the age of 18.

Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the nonprofit organization, said, ""The decline in acceptance of [members of the LGBTQ community] and rise in discrimination found in the survey corresponded to an increase in hateful rhetoric in our culture.

""While young people are identifying as LGBTQ in higher rates than ever before, there has also been an uptick in non-LGBTQ young people pushing back against acceptance,"" Ellis said. ""The younger generation has traditionally been thought of as a beacon of progressive values.

""We have taken that idea for granted and this year's results show that the sharp and quick rise in divisive rhetoric in politics and culture is having a negative influence on younger Americans,"" she added.

Ellis also noted that the survey was a wake-up call for the gay rights and equality organization.

""Headlines that stated 'LGBTQ acceptance is eroding' were a call to arms for GLAAD and so many around the country,"" Ellis said. ""GLAAD doubled down on our formula for making culture change and has now trained nearly 10,000 individuals through the GLAAD Media Institute.

""With the knowledge that erosion in acceptance was primarily happening among younger males, GLAAD launched a program dedicated to working with the video game industry on LGBTQ inclusion, to bring LGBTQ characters and stories to a world where male audiences were consuming content,"" she noted.

Ellis concluded, ""Closing the gap to full acceptance of LGBTQ people will not come from legislation on judicial decisions alone, but from creating a culture where LGBTQ people are embraced and respected. This year's results demonstrate an urgent need for GLAAD to reach younger Americans with stories and campaigns that build acceptance.""

What else?

According to the poll's findings, 65 percent of females were accepting of the LGBTQ lifestyle in 2016, but only 52 percent of women surveyed for the new report considered themselves to be accepting. Conversely, 62 percent of males were accepting of the community in 2016, but that number fell to 35 percent by 2018.

At least 36 percent of people surveyed for the latest poll reported that they would be uncomfortable to find out that a family member is gay, while just 24 percent of people answered in the affirmative for the 2016 poll.

Also, 34 percent of respondents admitted that they would be uncomfortable to discover that their physician is a member of the LGBTQ community. In 2016, 24 percent said they would be uncomfortable.

The report adds:

Five years ago, GLAAD partnered with The Harris Poll to launch a unique index to measure Americans' attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people and issues. In the first three years of the Harris Poll study, the Accelerating Acceptance report showed positive momentum year-over-year, with Americans stating they were more comfortable with LGBTQ people and more supportive of LGBTQ issues. … Last year, however, the acceptance pendulum abruptly stopped and swung in the opposite direction. More non-LGBTQ adults responded that they were 'very' or 'somewhat' uncomfortable around LGBTQ people in select scenarios. … The decline in acceptance and rise in discrimination found in the survey corresponded to an increase in hateful rhetoric in our culture.

New York Democrats push for transsexuals with intact male genitalia to be jailed with real women,"New York Democrats reintroduced legislation Wednesday that would permit male felons to be jailed with women in the event that they identify accordingly.

Assembly Bill A709 is an updated version of the ""Gender Identity Respect Dignity and Safety Act"" sponsored by assemblywoman Nily Rozic last session, which appears to have fizzled out in committee. There was a corresponding bill in the state Senate.

The act, co-sponsored by assembly members Emily Gallagher, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Charles Lavine, and Jo Anne Simon, requires that criminals imprisoned in state and local correctional facilities who claim to ""have a gender identity different from their assigned sex at birth be addressed and have access to commissary items, clothing and other materials that are consistent with the person's gender identity.""

For instance, a biological male with his male genitals intact must be provided with a tampon in the event that he has requested one and has also stated he identifies as a woman.

Should the bill pass, correctional officers would be required to address transsexual, ""gender nonconforming, nonbinary, or intersex"" convicts ""in a manner that most closely aligns with such person's gender identity, including the name and pronouns specified by that person.""

The preferred name in question need not correspond with the name on the convict's government-issued identification.

If a male convict identifies as a woman, he would also have ""the right"" to be searched by a female correctional officer or staff member.

Prisoners are to be given so-called ""affirming medical care"" to maintain their ""sex characteristics,"" including, but not limited to, hormone treatments and post-op drugs, if so desired.

Perhaps most controversially, the bill states that criminals must be ""placed in a correctional facility with persons of the gender that most closely aligns with such person's self-attested gender identity unless the person opts out of such placement.""

To evidence their mental severance of biological sex from gender, a convict need only say so, although a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or a ""variation in their sex characteristics"" are also valid.

Complaints by other prisoners who do not wish to be housed with a member of the opposite sex (e.g., real women) will be ignored. However, the commissioner could overcome the placement if ""there is clear and convincing evidence that such person presents a current danger of committing gender-based violence against others.""

The feminist activist group Keep Prisons Single Sex USA noted on Twitter that this exception to the proposed rule sets a high provability standard for the likelihood of re-offense and that the phrasing of ""current danger"" as opposed to historical danger would ensure that a man who previously abused women could still be jailed with female prisoners.

Keep Prisons Single Sex USA added that ""if a male inmate does not present a 'current danger of committing gender-based violence,' but engages in misconduct towards female inmates, like sexual harassment,"" he would not be returned to a men's prison.

A coalition of transsexual activist and leftist groups penned a letter to members of the state House and Senate in May 2022, suggesting that New York ""has not done enough for our community members experiencing incarceration.""

This coalition of social constructivists suggested that a ""person's genital status"" should not be factored into decisions over what type of facility a convict should be assigned to.

The letter suggested that transsexual convicts ""are subjected to daily misgendering, abuse, and other inhumane treatment.""

According to the LGBT activist organization Equality New York, this bill would be a check against a purported trend in the New York State criminal justice system of transsexual criminals being refused basic rights.



The ACLU of New York claimed that this bill would keep transsexuals safe.

Not all are optimistic about the prospect of women's prisons being flooded with men.

Amanda Stulman of Keep Prisons Single Sex USA wrote to the bill's sponsors on Thursday, noting, ""This Bill provides that, unless they opt out, fully genitally-intact, sexually-functioning incarcerated males are presume eligible to be housed in women's prison if they assert – at any time – a gender identity other than 'male.'""

Extra to noting that the bill is opaque about what it means by ""gender,"" as in its reference to ""gender-based violence,"" Stulman argued the legislation would incentivize men to request cross-sex housing.

Under the law, if a transsexual's request for transfer is denied, he can initiate proceedings for ""injunctive relief and damages, including reasonable attorney fees.""

Stulman suggested, ""These terms invite declarations of 'gender identity' differing from one's sex with the prospect of (a) being awarded placement in a women's incarceration facility; (b) a monetary reward; (c) attorney fees paid by the state.""

The law, according to Stulman, may also run afoul of women's rights, particularly those with deeply-held, Constitutionally-protected religious beliefs requiring that they not be around naked men.

New York Times gushes over 'rising drag stars of America.' Those 'stars' are children.,"The New York Times on Saturday published a glowingly positive article on child drag queens.

Many people have insisted that allowing children to perform as drag queens and in similar fashions is detrimental to their development and an outright promotion of child abuse.

What are the details?

Titled, ""Sashaying Their Way Through Youth,"" the outlet's Alice Hines wrote that the young children are the newest ""rising drag stars of America.""

The feature showcased Desmond Napoles, a 12-year-old ""drag kid"" who has performed countless shows and has the support of his parents. Napoles has previously insisted that he is gay.

Hines wrote, ""Desmond and his mother would still make it to the object of Desmond's excitement: DragCon, the convention hosted by RuPaul in New York City in early September. It would be Desmond's third year in a row. He isn't a different person in drag so much as a more outgoing version of himself, he said. 'I'm always fierce, fabulous and not playing video games,' he said. 'I'm being AH-MA-zing.'""

Desmond's mother, Wendy Napoles, adds that she sees herself as a typical mother.

""Other moms are a soccer moms,"" she told the outlet. ""They take their kids to practice, to games, they cheer for their kids. That's how I see myself with drag.""

Wendy most recently complained that a convicted pedophile made ""highly inappropriate"" remarks about her son. Wendy and her husband Andy have permitted their son to perform in drag shows and also to be featured in magazines and on websites to promote his style as well as his hobby.

Desmond appeared on NBC's ""Today"" in 2018 and revealed that he began watching ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" when he was just 3 years old. Watching the show, he said, changed his life.

""Drag is for anyone, no matter what sex, age, gender, identity, ability, or race,"" Desmond's mother told Pink News in 2018.

Desmond's ""innocent"" hobby isn't without its ramifications, however: He told the outlet that he has cut back on his performing because large crowds and people grasping at him for a hug have made him anxious in recent times.

The feature also spotlighted a 9-year-old male drag queen named Keegan — otherwise known as Kween Keekee.

Keegan's mother, Megan, insisted that she and her family do not aim to encourage fame in their child.

""Our goal has never been to make K famous,"" Megan told the outlet. ""We allow Instagram to be a public account as we don't feel we need to be pressured to hide our child, and because we think his story could help other kids.""

Megan said that she took to Instagram in order to set Keegan up with male adult drag queens to serve as peers and mentors.

Hines wrote, ""As recently as the 1970s, when dressing as another gender could lead to arrest on charges of vagrancy or 'perversion' in many jurisdictions, drag was an adults-only affair, relegated to underground spaces and rich in sexual innuendo.""

""But as gay culture has gained mainstream acceptance, the number and variety of locations where drag is welcome have grown,"" Hines added. ""G-rated story hours are now offered at public libraries. Kids — and parents intent on raising them outside of traditional gender norms — are keen to perform.""

California gov signs bill that will soften criminal penalty for LGBT adults who have sex with underage teens,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a controversial bill into law on Friday that could soften the criminal punishment for LGBT adults who are convicted of sex crimes against underage teenagers.

According to KABC-TV, Newsom signed the bill without fanfare, likely due to the highly controversial nature of the legislation.

Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images

What is the background?



The bill — SB 145 — was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), an openly gay man, and seeks to prevent LGBT adults who sodomize or perform oral sex with underage teenagers from being automatically placed on the California sex offender registry upon their criminal conviction.

As TheBlaze reported:

The legislation calls for a judge to use discretion on assigning an individual to the sex offender registry if their victim was between the ages of 14 to 17 and the age difference between the offender and the victim is less than 10 years.

Weiner claimed the bill ""eliminates discrimination against LGBTQ youth in our criminal justice system.""

The bill was passed by the California Legislature in late August, with most Democrats supporting the legislation and Republicans opposing it, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported.

What was the reaction?

Responding to the bill becoming law, Weiner continued to claim the bill's purpose is only about ""ending discrimination.""

""Today, California took yet another step toward an equitable society,"" Weiner said in a statement. ""It's appalling that in 2020, California continues to discriminate against LGBTQ people, by mandating that LGBTQ young people be placed on the sex offender registry in situations where straight people aren't required to be placed on the registry. SB 145 simply ends that discrimination by treating LGBTQ young people the exact same way that straight young people have been treated since 1944.""

But not every Democratic lawmaker was thrilled about the bill.

State Rep. Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat, said upon the bill's passage, ""I cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registrable offense. We should never give up on this idea that children should be in no way subject to a predator.""

Meanwhile, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Republican, slammed Newsom.

""As a parent I'm appalled that last night our governor signed a law maintaining a 24-year-old can have sex with a 14-year-old and it not be considered predatory,"" Faulconer reacted. ""An adult who commits ANY sex act on a minor 10 years younger must be registered a sex offender. Law must be changed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/newsom-signs-bill-lgbt-adults-sex-offender-underage-teens,2020-09-13
New California law allows transgender inmates pick prison,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a new law on Saturday allowing transgender inmates to be placed in prisons based on their gender identity.

Previously, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation housed men and women in separate correctional facilities, and transgender inmates were housed based on their biological sex. The new California law will allow transgender inmates to be housed based on their gender identity rather than their sex assigned at birth.

The Transgender Respect, Agency, and Dignity Act notes that officers must privately ask inmates during the intake process on how they identify as. Transgender, nonbinary, or intersex inmates can request to be placed in a facility that houses either men or women based on how they identify as.

The law says the CDCR cannot deny requests for the preferred prison based solely on the inmates' anatomy, sexual orientation, or ""a factor present"" among other inmates at the facility, the law states.

However, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation can deny the request of preferred prison if there is ""management or security concerns."" If a request is denied, the state must give the inmate a written statement explaining the decision and give the inmate a ""meaningful opportunity"" to object, The Hill reported. If at any time the inmates raise concerns about their health or safety, the state must reassess their housing, according to the law.

The law also requires officers to do body search on inmates based on the search policy of their chosen gender identity. And the law also requires officers to address transgender inmates based on the pronouns of their choice.

Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco who authored the bill, said that SB 132 would protect ""particularly trans women who are subject to high levels of assault and harassment in men's facilities.""

""It's just a false narrative about transgender people and about transgender women in particular that they're somehow not really women and are just trying to scam their way into women's bathrooms or facilities in order to do bad things,"" Wiener said. ""Overwhelmingly the people who are being victimized are trans people.""



Opponents of the law, such as Chris Bish, Republican candidate for California's 6th congressional district, claim that the law puts biological female inmates at risk, especially for sexual assault.

Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York City, and Rhode Island have similar laws where inmates are housed based on gender identity and not biological sex.

"NFL declares, 'Football is gay. Football is lesbian. Football is beautiful.'","The NFL on Monday joined the rest of corporate America in marketing to LGBT Americans for Pride Month with the release of a new commercial declaring that football is gay, lesbian, queer, transgender, bisexual, and a whole bunch of other things.

The 30-second advertisement begins by stating ""football is gay"" as drums roll and people cheer in the background.

""Football is lesbian. Football is beautiful. Football is queer. Football is life. Football is exciting. Football is culture. Football is transgender. Football is queer. Football is heart. Football is power. Football is tough. Football is bisexual. Football is strong. Football is freedom. Football is American. Football is accepting. Football is everything. Football is for everyone,"" the commercial announces.

The ad is titled, ""Football is for everyone,"" and it is intended to ""send a strong message of acceptance from the league to fans and players,"" according to Outsports. It is also a direct response to Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib coming out as gay last week, a spokesperson for the league said.

""I am proud of the clear message this spot sends to the NFL's LGBTQ+ fans: This game is unquestionably for you,"" NFL diversity director Sam Rapoport told Outsports. ""I will be playing its first line over and over in my head all season.""

In a statement, the NFL touted its partnership with the Trevor Project in creating the ad. The Trevor Project is a nonprofit organization that provides crisis information and suicide prevention services to gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth.

""In the new film 'Football is for Everyone' from the NFL in partnership with The Trevor Project and creative agency 72andSunny Los Angeles, the league redefines the game to be inclusive of all different types of fans, coaches and players.

"NHL player, citing his faith, doesn't warm up with team wearing LGBTQ colors before 'Pride Night' game. ESPN writer who covered controversy bashes player on Twitter.","Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov, citing his religious beliefs, refused to skate before Tuesday's ""Pride Night"" game since his teammates were wearing LBGTQ colors for their warm-up, ESPN reported.

The 26-year-old defenseman told reporters after the Flyers' 5-2 home win over the Anaheim Ducks that he intended ""to stay true to myself and my religion,"" the sports network said.

Provorov said he is Russian Orthodox.

""I respect everyone,"" he added to reporters. ""I respect everybody's choices.""

The Flyers wore rainbow colors on their warm-up jerseys and used sticks with rainbow tape, which ESPN said are being auctioned by Flyers Charities with proceeds going toward the team's ""efforts to grow the game in diverse communities.""

Provorov was the only Flyers player who didn't have a jersey or a stick up for auction after the game, the sports network added.

Flyers coach John Tortorella said he didn't consider benching Provorov for not taking part in the warm-up, ESPN reported: ""With Provy, he's being true to himself and to his religion. This has to do with his belief and his religion. It's one thing I respect about Provy: He's always true to himself. And so that's where we're at with that.""

ESPN writer who penned story bashes Provorov on Twitter

The author of the ESPN story cited above — Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer for the sports network — exercised a fairly even hand in his article, but he blasted Provorov on Twitter:

""Ivan Provorov is the only @NHLFlyers player not to have a Pride jersey up for postgame auction,"" Wyshynski tweeted. ""The sale of pregame jerseys and rainbow sticks benefit Flyers Charities and efforts to grow the game in diverse communities. Provorov owes them a donation.""

Responding to a Twitter user who declared Provorov doesn't owe ""s**t"" to Flyers Charities for holding to ""his belief,"" Wyshynski shot back: ""He literally refused to participate in a charity fundraising event for his team. This isn't skipping Pride because he refused to wave from a float. He does, in fact, owe them s**t.""

Wyshynski wasn't done:

Wyshynski also issued a message to ""all the homophobes"" taking shots at him on Twitter:

Wyshynski wasn't alone

As you might guess, Wyshynski wasn't the only sports media figure to get personal undergarments in a wad over the situation:

Anything else?

The Flyers, like many professional sports franchises, are heavy supporters of the LGBTQ community and events like ""Pride Night.""

They're woke in other ways, too.

Readers of TheBlaze may recall that the Flyers in 2019 removed their Kate Smith statue outside the Wells Fargo Center over reports the late vocalist sang racially insensitive songs in the early 1930s.

Smith had been a Flyers legend for singing ""God Bless America"" before playoff games in the early 1970s when the team won its only Stanley Cup trophies — but in addition to removing her statue, the Flyers also said Smith's ""God Bless America"" no longer would be played at games and was erased from its library.

Members of Smith's family were outraged at the Flyers for the move and said Smith was not a racist. In fact, Smith told millions back in the day that ""race hatreds"" must be ""exterminated,"" and she also pioneered racial integration on television.

Best-selling novelist Nicholas Sparks under fire for reportedly trying to ban LGBTQ club at his Christian school,"Author Nicholas Sparks reportedly attempted to ban an LGBTQ club at his Christian school in New Bern, North Carolina.

What are the details?

According to a report from the Daily Beast, Sparks — who opened the Epiphany School of Global Studies in 2006 — was caught sending emails quashing the notion of an LGBTQ club at the Christian school.

Sparks, who co-founded the New Bern-area prep school, has reportedly been involved in a legal battle with Saul Benjamin — the school's former headmaster and CEO — since 2014 over what the former headmaster describes as purported harassment, racism, and homophobia.

Benjamin's suit against Sparks also includes claims of defamation and is seeking punitive damages for discrimination, breach of contract, and emotional distress.

Benjamin, a Jewish-born Quaker, said that he was teaching at the Morocco-based university Al Akhawayn in 2013, when he received a call about a position at Sparks' school.

""I've always been an educator, always globally focused, always keenly interested in the ways that different cultures and different religions and different communities try to help young people discover their potential,"" Benjamin told the outlet. ""That's not a speech, that's my faith.""

He was interested in the job and began working for the school in 2013.

Immediately, he said, he noticed issues with the ""school's attitude toward diversity,"" the outlet wrote.

One complaint obtained by the Daily Beast states, ""Sparks and members of the Board unapologetically marginalized, bullied, and harassed members of the School community whose religious views and/or identities did not conform to their religiously driven, bigoted preconceptions.""

Sparks is said to have rejected Benjamin's complaints.

The Daily Beast obtained emails purported to be between Sparks and other school officials that appear to show Sparks and company ""repeatedly taking issue with Benjamin's attempts to make the school inclusive to all faiths, races, and sexualities.""

One message allegedly written by Sparks blasted Benjamin for ""what some perceive as an agenda that strives to make homosexuality open and accepted."" In another, Sparks purportedly proposed a ban on a student protest at the school, which came on the heels of two lesbian students allegedly planning to ""come out"" during chapel. A third email reportedly from Sparks said Benjamin has ""misplaced priorities at the school level (GLBT, diversity, the beauty of other religions, as opposed to academic/curricular/global issues, Christian traditions, etc).""

Benjamin also accused Sparks of spreading rumors questioning the headmaster's mental health.



One message purported to be from Sparks stated, ""While I am not a doctor — and as scary as this may sound to you — I do believe that [Benjamin] is suffering from a mental illness of some sort. What that is — Alzheimer's, a variance of bi-polar, something else — I have no idea.""

Benjamin said that when he attempted to improve relations with Sparks, he was rebuffed and ridiculed, which included allegations of racism.

Benjamin said that when he arrived at the school, its composition was ""overwhelmingly white and Christian,"" according to the outlet, ""with just two black students enrolled that year.""

He also complained that after he began working at the school, he heard reports that students were attempting to open up a discussion about sexuality with teachers and that students had informally formed a peer group to discuss sex identities and orientations. Rumors reportedly began to swirl, which centered on an idea that Benjamin had formed a ""gay club"" within the school.

The Board of Trustees insisted at a meeting that the club be banned, according to the Daily Beast, and accused Benjamin of ""promoting a homosexual culture and agenda"" within the school.

A month after the board meeting, Benjamin said he heard rumblings of a student-led protest in which the two aforementioned lesbian students planned to paint themselves naked and announce their sexuality during chapel. Benjamin reportedly told the two girls that it was not appropriate and that it was ""a time for healing, not heroics."" During that week's chapel, Benjamin said he spoke out about bullying and loving your neighbors.

He claimed that his speech stirred up even more animosity.

In the following weeks, Benjamin and Sparks reportedly corresponded via email, and Sparks said that he was unhappy about the ""diversity and tolerance"" issues.

One portion of Sparks' alleged email said, ""I told you this would happen ... if you didn't follow our advice, which was simply 'don't rock the boat on this particular issue.'"" Sparks reportedly provided guidance on how Benjamin could get along better at the school, which included making sure ""all Christian traditions feel especially Christian, especially as we move into the Christmas season.""

The email continued, ""Regarding diversity, I've now told you half a dozen times that our lack of diversity has NOTHING to do with the school or anyone at the school. It's not because of what we as a school has or hasn't done. It has nothing to do with racism or vestiges of Jim Crow. It comes down to 1) Money and 2) Culture.""

Sparks also purportedly defended the decision to strike down the LGBTQ club and insisted that ""not allowing them to have a club is NOT discrimination.""

""Remember, we've had gay students before, many of them,"" the email continued. ""[The former headmaster] handled it quietly and wonderfully. ... I expect you to do the same.""

Just days after the above-mentioned email, Sparks purportedly called Benjamin before a meeting with the school's Board of Trustees. Benjamin said that Sparks' behavior during the meeting was unbecoming of his position, acting in a ""loud, ranting, and physically intimidating manner."" During the meeting, Sparks also reportedly called Benjamin a liar and demanded he resign.

Benjamin did, in fact, resign, having only served in his position for a total of 98 days.

Sparks has denied all allegations and pointed to his perception that Benjamin was ""aloof, even rude, elitist, and dismissive of ... beliefs or backgrounds."" He also insisted that Benjamin was responsible for authorizing an official LGBTQ club, which was against policy.

The case is scheduled for a trial in August, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nicholas-sparks-allegedly-tried-to-ban-gay-club-at-christian-school,2019-06-13
MSNBC anchor says the 'dehumanization' of GOP parental rights bills is comparable to Russian soldiers raping children in Ukraine,"MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace said that the ""dehumanization"" of of LGBT children by parental rights bills put forth by some Republican governors is comparable to the war atrocities where Russian soldiers reportedly raped Ukrainian children.

Wallace made the comments on Wednesday while speaking to Bulwark writer Tim Miller about parental rights bills passed by some Republican governors to ban teachers from talking about transgender and other sexual topics in early public school education.

""And I worry that in covering [Virginia Gov.] Glen Youngkin (R) and his politics of parental choice, all the focus was on how well it worked, and even in our conversations about [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis (R), it's about how well they're serving him,"" Wallace said.

""The truth is dehumanization is a tactic for politics is from war, dehumanization is a tactic, that's being used right now, the Russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them,"" she continued emphatically.

""Dehumanization as a practice, is a tactic of war, it's being deployed in politics, and people like you and I sometimes lose the plot, and admits its effectiveness, its, not its substance, but even the analysis of these tactics loses sight of what, of what, this speech bring us back to, which is, dehumanization has a cost right now, right now, as its deployed,"" Wallace added.

""And, and, Chasten Buttigieg made this point when 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was introduced, kids will die!"" she concluded.

Miller agreed with Wallace and registered no opposition to her overheated rhetoric.

""Yeah, I think that’s right,"" Miller responded. ""Their cruelty and inhuman behavior is inexcusable.""

Among the many reports of war crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there have been some unconfirmed claims that Russian soldiers are sexually assaulting children.

"Rapper Nicki Minaj blasts 'dumb a**' Joy Reid for chastising her COVID vaccine hesitancy on MSNBC, rips Reid as hypocritical and 'homophobic'","After rapper Nicki Minaj went viral Monday for stating her COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy on Twitter, MSNBC host Joy Reid chastised Minaj on TV for using her ""platform"" of 22 million followers to ""put people in the position of dying from a disease they don't have to die from.""

Well, Minaj wasn't about to take Reid's tongue lashing without a fight — and fired back at the far-left host, calling Reid a ""dumb ass"" and ""homophobic"" and ""thirsty to down another black woman (by the request of the white man).""

What are the details?

Minaj indicated on Twitter that she wouldn't be attending the Met Gala because it required attendees to be vaccinated.

""They want you to get vaccinated for the Met. If I get vaccinated it won't for the Met. It'll be once I feel I've done enough research. I'm working on that now,"" Minaj tweeted Monday. ""In the meantime my loves, be safe. Wear the mask with 2 strings that grips your head & face. Not that loose one.""

Shortly afterward Minaj tweeted that her ""cousin in Trinidad won't get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you're comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.""

How did Reid respond?

Reid was in full finger-wagging mode against Minaj during the host's ""ReidOut"" program.

""You have a platform, sister, that is 22 million followers, OK? I have 2 million followers. You have 22 million followers on Twitter,"" an animated Reid said. ""For you to use your platform to encourage our community to not protect themselves and save their lives — my God, sister, you could do better than that! You got that platform ... it's a blessing that you got that! That people listen to you. And they listen to you more than they listen to me!""

Reid added: ""For you to use your platform to put people in the position of dying from a disease they don't have to die from, oh my God. As a fan, as a hip-hop fan, as somebody who is your fan, I'm so sad that you did that, so sad that you did that, sister. Oh, my God!""

Minaj fires back

Minaj wasted no time hitting back at Reid: ""This is what happens when you're so thirsty to down another black woman (by the request of the white man), that you didn't bother to read all my tweets. 'My God SISTER do better' imagine getting ur dumb ass on TV a min after a tweet to spread a false narrative about a black woman.""

The rapper used a racial slur in another tweet, calling Reid a ""lying homophobic c**n."" The ""homophobic"" remark presumably refers to Reid getting called out a couple of years ago over anti-LBGTQ blog posts attributed to her — for which she apologized although she couldn't fathom that she wrote them. So Reid figured hackers were out to get her.

Minaj also referred to Reid as ""Uncle Tomiana"" and pointed out that while she sat on a high horse calling out Minaj's vaccine hesitancy, Reid last September tweeted plenty of vaccine hesitancy herself: ""I mean, will anyone ... anyone at all ... ever fully trust the @CDCgov again? And who on God's earth would trust a vaccine approved by the @US_FDA?? How do we get a vaccine distributed after this broken, Trumpist nonsense has infected everything? Even if Biden wins?""

As of Tuesday morning, Reid on her Twitter page has not answered Minaj's pushback.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nicki-minaj-blasts-joy-reid-vaccine-hesitancy,2021-09-14
Nobel Prize-winning biologist: Trans movement's 'unscientific' claims are 'madness' —  taking hormones is 'inherently dangerous',"Dr. Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1995. As a biologist, she has long studied DNA, biochemistry, and embryonic development. On August 22, Emma, Germany's leading feminist magazine, published Chantal Louis' interview with Nüsslein-Volhard, in which the biologist both attacked core claims advanced by trans activists and criticized their anti-scientific basis.

Suggesting that an ignorance of basic biology may be to blame for the ""unscientific"" claim that there are many genders, Nüsslein-Volhard noted (in German; the following is a Google translation) that ""all mammals have two sexes. There's the one sex that produces the eggs [and] has two X chromosomes. That's called female. And there's the other one that makes the sperm [and] has an X and a Y chromosome. That's called male.""



After revisiting what she regarded as biological basics, Nüsslein-Volhard noted that the existence of hermaphrodites doesn't complicate matters or blur the lines between the sexes. ""The fact that there are hermaphrodites does not change the fact that there are two germ cells, eggs and sperm, and therefore two sexes.""

Just as ""intersex"" people (i.e., those with complete or partial sets of both male and female sexual organs) are not constituents or representatives of a third gender, Nüsslein-Volhard suggests that expressions of femininity in men or masculinity in women are not indicative of blurred lines but rather of varying hormonal levels and cultural influences.

The attempt to remedy the feeling of disconnect between one's sex and perceived gender — or that the two can be separated — Nüsslein-Volhard regards as ""wishful thinking."" She noted, ""There are people who want to change their gender, but they can't do it. You remain XY or XX. ... People retain their gender for life.""

Nüsslein-Volhard appeared to allow for some flexibility around the language and tack taken regarding gender. ""Of course, a girl can wish to be called by a boy's name."" Changing a name may not be problematic, but attempting to medically change the person that name signifies can be ruinous.

The professor suggested that artificially induced changes, such as hormone treatments, are not only unnatural but dangerous. Hormones, she claimed, ""add something to the body that is not intended there."" They can have a profound psychological and physical impact. ""The body cannot handle it well in the long run. Every hormone you take has side effects. Taking hormones is inherently dangerous.""

Nüsslein-Volhard is not without empathy for those with so-called gender dysphoria. She noted having struggled with her identity as a youth. In adolescence, she said, there were times she would have preferred to have been a boy, largely owing to socio-cultural concerns. ""Many girls are unhappy in puberty,"" she said, but permitting young people to determine their gender themselves ""is madness!""

There is, she indicated, both a futility and a conceit in the attempts made to transition from one sex to another by way of hormone treatments and genital reconstruction surgery. The biological basis, said Nüsslein-Volhard, cannot be changed. One's feelings are alterable by social and psychological circumstances, but biological sex is static.

For this reason, those men who claim to be women and physically compete with women benefit from the biological reality underlying their physiology. ""Because of his male hormones, this person is stronger and runs faster. It's basically like doping.""

In recent years, expressing and defending scientific facts concerning biological sex, as Nüsslein-Volhard has done in her interview with Emma, has resulted in legal and professional penalties for some and death threats for others.

""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling has, for instance, been subjected to an intimidation campaign and threatened with rape, death, and bombings for disagreeing with LGBT ideology as it pertains to womanhood and biological sex.

Caroline Farrow, a Catholic mother of five, was investigated by police in the United Kingdom for calling a transsexual man a man on Twitter.

This week, country music star Jason Aldean's wife, Brittany, was castigated for ""transphobic comments,"" having expressed gratitude to her parents for not ""changing"" her gender as a child.

The terms of the debate have similarly been targeted.

This summer, Merriam-Webster's online dictionary augmented the definition of ""female"" to include the trans movement's language, such that being female is now said to mean ""having a gender identity that is the opposite of male.""

In its 2022 fiscal year budget, the Biden administration replaced the word ""mothers"" with the term ""birthing people.""

Speaking to the anti-science component to trans activism, Nüsslein-Volhard argued that the resultant ""mixture of sensitivity and moral arrogance paired with ignorance is simply fatal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nobel-prize-winning-scientist-says-trans-movement-claims-are-unscientific,2022-08-30
Nonbinary AI voice created 'for a future where we are no longer defined by gender',"Step aside, Siri. Move along, Alexa. Researchers have developed an artificial intelligence voice named ""Q,"" which is neither male or female, ""for a future where we are no longer defined by gender.""

What are the details?

A collaboration of LGBTQ rights groups and technology firms created Q, which they say is the first genderless voice, for the purpose of ""end[ing] gender bias in AI assistants."" The developers argue that assigning a gender to a robotic assistant ""reinforces a binary perception of gender, and perpetuates stereotypes that many have fought hard to progress.""

For instance, according to the Daily Mail, ""experts say a female voice to an AI assistant reinforces stereotypes that females are supposed to helpful, nurturing an caring. Additionally, that they're more appropriate for administrative roles.""

In a promotion video announcing the launch, Q introduces itself, explaining: ""Think of me like Siri or Alexa, but neither male nor female. I am created for a future where we are no longer defined by gender.""





To create Q, researchers recorded the voices of individuals who identify as nonbinary — neither male nor female — and then modulated the collective pitch range. The group gathered feedback from 4,600 testers, tweaking Q until it was ""widely perceived as gender neutral,"" the Mail reported.

So, what are they going to do with it?

Q's creators hope the voice will be picked up by major development firms like Google, Apple, and Amazon, as an alternative to the male and female options offered by other voice assistants.

Thomas Rasmussen, a spokesperson for Copenhagen Pride (a group that helped build Q), told the Mail, ""With Q — a neutral voice with no preassigned gender — we aim to get the attention of leading technology companies that work with AI to ensure they are aware that a gender binary normativity excludes many people and to inspire them by showing how easily it would actually be to recognize that more than two genders exist when developing artificial intelligence devices.""

""This is about giving people choices and options,"" he added. ""It is about freedom and inclusion.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/non-binary-ai-voice-created-for-a-future-where-we-are-no-longer-defined-by-gender,2019-03-12
"'Non-binary' Anglican priest, 'making a huge difference in normalising it for children,' accused of 'grooming'","The Church of England's first so-called non-binary priest has gone beyond accepting his newly manufactured identity by ""going into schools, doing assemblies and making a huge difference in normalising it for children.""

A black conservative who was reportedly barred from the priesthood has suggested that this LGBT evangelization is tantamount to ""grooming.""

What are the details?

Bingo Allison is a 36-year-old father of three and a priest ordained in the Church of England.

Allison told the Liverpool Echo that God guided him away from the two sexes delineated in the Book of Genesis, resulting in a schism between the ""strongly religious"" and conservative tradition he was raised in — which, he suggested, ""Some might call ... bigoted"" — and a new ""gender-queer"" lifestyle.

Allison suggested that after encountering the term ""gender-queer"" seven years ago while completing his vicar training, ""Everything suddenly clicked.""

""I didn't know any trans people, and I think I probably met two gay people in my life,"" said Allison. ""So it was like another planet almost to me. There were a few times when I really questioned things. But because I didn't really have the vocabulary to describe my experience, it just kind of didn't go anywhere.""

With a newfound handle on the latest LGBT activist terminology, Allison claims to have revisited Genesis 1:27, in which the King James Bible and the English Standard Version both state, ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.""

Allison said the language of ""male and female"" contra ""men and women"" struck a chord.

""It was a deepening spiritual experience, I properly felt God was guiding me into this new truth about myself,"" he said.

Since mentally severing gender from sex, Allison has become an activist in his own right.

The Telegraph reported that Allison uses social media to spread the word of the LGBT movement.

In February 2020, Allison posted an image to Instagram in which he was wearing a purple hairband, eyeshadow, and make-up. The caption read, ""Going to church because Jesus loves sparkly eyeshadow. #girlslikeus #transisbeautiful #nonbinary #eyeshadow.""

The Anglican priest's LGBT evangelization is not limited to online engagements.

""When I'm wearing my collar it lets children know that is okay and that there is a place in church and the outside world for people like me,"" he said.

Allison claims he has been involved with local secular LGBT youth groups, in which he seeks to ""normalise"" his identity.

Calvin Robinson, an Anglican trainee vicar who was reportedly barred from becoming a Church of England priest on account of his traditional views, has publicly taken issue with Allison's LGBT ministry.

In response to the Liverpool Echo article about Allison, Robinson tweeted, ""'Gender-queer' seems counter-Scriptural. 'the first openly non-binary priest to be ordained in the CofE' seems like vainglory. 'The 36-year-old attends schools and assemblies ... in the hope they can inspire others who find themselves in a similar situation' seems like grooming.""

Robinson's intimation that the promotion of highly-sexual concepts to school children might amount to grooming is not his only reservation about Allison's approach.

Robinson, a black conservative who has expressed antipathy for identitarian leftist groups like BLM and suggested that women should not be ordained, appears to have voiced traditional and conservative Anglicans' reservation about the ostensible co-option of the faith by LGBT activists.



According to the Telegraph, Robinson trained to be a priest for years at the University of Oxford. He was set to begin a curacy at a parish in Holborn, London. However, Bishop Jonathan Baker of Fulham turned him down for the role in February 2022.

Beside Robinson's fidelity to tradition, an email exchange between Church of England bosses indicated that his claims that Britain was not a racist country disqualified him.

Sarah Mullally, the white, female bishop of London, reportedly told Robinson, a black man, to ""listen to the lived experiences of ethnic minorities.""

Bishop Baker cautioned in another message: ""He is very active on Twitter and has a huge following (100,000 followers!). His political agenda is I guess what you would call libertarian anti-woke, anti-identity politics, Covid-skeptical etc.""

Were racial politics not a pressing matter in the church, Robinson's rejection of LGBT activist conventions and beliefs would likely have been.

Extra to internalizing critical race theory precepts, senior members of the Anglican church have similarly embraced LGBT activism, terminology, and agendas.



Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford and senior Anglican cleric, backed same-sex ""marriage"" and instructed clergy that they were not only to conduct gay ""marriages"" for their congregation, but were also themselves able to wed a same-sex partner.

This decision runs contrary to Anglican canon law, which prohibits the blessing or marrying of gay couples.

The Church of England has also issued pastoral guidance, adopted at General Synod in 2018, delineating how to approach and accommodate transsexuals.

For Anglicans already baptized who have become transsexuals, ""the House of Bishops commends the rite of Affirmation of Baptismal Faith as the central feature of any service to recognize liturgically a person's gender transition.""

The guide further recommends identifying ""the preference of a transgender person in respect of their name and gendered (or other) pronouns.""

Extra to baptism, at least one Anglican church has transmogrified its hymns to keep up with LGBT activists' preferences.

TheBlaze reported that All Saints with Holy Trinity in Loughborough updated the words to ""God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen."" Instead of referencing Satan as well as Christ the Savior, the church substituted in ""queer and questioning"" ""women, who by men have been erased.""

It's not only transsexual parishioners for whom the Church of England has made accommodations.

In Wales resides the church's first transsexual priest, Reverend Canon ""Sarah"" Jones, who suggested to ITV that God is ""non-binary.""

Jones said, ""Look, there are different sorts of churches with different sorts of views on all sorts of things. But there are a lot more inclusive churches than you might think.""

For Robinson, inclusivity in the Church of England meant his exclusion.

"Nonbinary person complains of being asked, 'Are you a boy or a girl?' during haircuts, being forced into 'female or male' boxes. Reaction is brutal.","A nonbinary person was featured in a video earlier this month sharing the struggles of getting a ""simple"" haircut when those providing the service ask, ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" and also being forced to fit into society's ""female or male"" boxes.

'I'm some thing on the outside existing beside the world as it rolls by all pink and blue'

The unnamed person — who appears courtesy of BBC Scotland — complains that ""I'm more of that 'other' (if that's even an option) like I'm some thing on the outside existing beside the world as it rolls by all pink and blue.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

The individual also shares that usually there are two options when it comes to a haircut: There's a salon, which oozes ""that womanly world of perfumed femininity with which I feel like I have little affinity."" Then there's the barber shop, ""which isn't much better since this voice and these swells in my chest make me feel like an infiltrator.""



The speaker adds that those providing haircuts often ask, ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" and ""Am I trans, am I gay, and I don't know what to say. Sometimes I pick my labels to make other people feel OK, but it's never enough to say where I'd like to be trimmed or shaved ... they need to know my sex.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

The person notes that haircutters say it's the only way they can determine the appropriate rate, as women's haircuts are typically more expensive than men's.

In conclusion

The individual sounds a tad hopeful in the end, noting that in the last few years ""drag queens"" and ""out queer celebrities"" have made a big splash upon culture — and then finishes things off with a bang: ""We're queer, and we're here ... could you just cut our f***ing hair?""

Brutal response

A number of Twitter users didn't hold back their contempt for the nonbinary person's complaints:

""This really is the new Greatest Generation. My heart goes out to each and everyone of them. Haircuts are the new Normandy beaches.""

""Wtf is wrong with snowflakes? Just go to a unisex hair salon. It's not hard is it.""

""Have we failed entirely as a society? Do we really now pay attention to people that feel unsafe & 'unwelcome' getting their hair cut? Does EVERYTHING have to be unisex to accommodate a tiny minority that keeps inventing problems on a daily basis? How about some gratefulness?""

""When life is too easy so you need to fabricate some form of struggle.""

""Please send this person to Venezuela for a month. People seem to have entirely forgotten what real problems look like.""

""I'm a women. About 4 years ago I had a mohawk with shaved sides, done by a hairdresser and maintained for a short while by a local barber. No one cared that I was a women, no one. I mean, absolutely no one objected to me having short hair in either the hairdressers or barbers.""

Oh, and this one:

"With over 30,000 North Carolina residents left without power, leftists circulate conspiracy theory that conservative vandals are to blame","Tens of thousands of people have been left in the dark and cold after two power substations in North Carolina were blasted with gunfire over the weekend.

While engineers work to restore power and law enforcement seeks those responsible, leftists are circulating unsubstantiated rumors online, suggesting that right-wing activists seeking to shut down a drag show on Saturday night were responsible.



What are the details?

Around 8 p.m. on Saturday, power outages swept Moore County.

According to PowerOutage.US, over 45,000 residents experienced blackouts. Charlotte-based utility company Duke Energy's outage map indicated that as of early Monday afternoon, over 35,000 people were still without power.

Duke Energy officials suggested that residents could possibly be powerless until Thursday, because the damage is extensive and the repairs needed are complex.

A spokesman for the company said, ""Unlike perhaps a storm where you can go in and reroute power somewhere else, that was not an option in this case, so repair has to be complete; in many cases, some of that equipment will have to be replaced.""

The county declared a state of emergency, claiming that the electric grid had been ""intentionally attacked.""



The outages began in the Carthage area and then spread to the southern parts of Moore County.

A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. nightly curfew has been put into effect. The Triad Business Journal noted that the curfew will remain in effect until power is restored. Schools have also been closed in the county.

With temperatures at times almost down to freezing, county officials announced on Sunday that the Moore County Sports Complex in Carthage had been turned into a shelter.

An intentional attack

The Moore County Sheriff's Office issued a statement, saying that the ""mass power outage across the county is being investigated as a criminal occurrence.""

Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields told reporters on Sunday that while a motivation had not yet been found, it was clear that someone had pulled up and ""opened fire on the substation, the same thing with the other one.""



The vandals had allegedly breached the gates at both substation sites.

Although Fields would not state whether the outages were resultant of domestic terrorism, he underscored how the incident ""was a targeted, intentional attack and was not random.""

""I can promise you, to the perpetrators out there, we will find you,"" said the sheriff.

Gov. Roy Cooper (D) tweeted that an ""attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.""



Cooper also indicated that the state is providing support as needed.

Leftist rumors

When asked whether the shooting may be linked to a Saturday night drag show at the Sunrise Theater in Southern Pines, Sheriff Ronnie Fields said, ""We've not been able to tie anything back to the drag show.""

Fields' admission did not stop leftists and LGBT activists from advancing their preferred narrative online.



Script-reader Ethan Embry claimed that ""group of christofascists has shot at power substations in Moore county to shut down a drag show happening in town. 40,000 residents are without power, people who need power for medical devices, families who need to stay warm, plunging a community into darkness. A terror attack.""



Fellow script-reader Melissa Jo Peltier, similarly convinced that critics of drag shows that sexualize children were responsible, demanded, ""Arrest them all.""

Civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo intimated that Libs of Tiktok might be partly responsible.

So-called artist Barbara Malmet expressed certainty not only that the drag show was the reason the substations were hit, but that those responsible also happened to be white.

Journalist Andy Ngo noted that, without any evidence, transsexual activist Erin Reed named specific groups he figured must be responsible.



WRAL reported that the MCSO interviewed former U.S. Army psychological operations officer Emily Grace Rainey regarding a post she made on Facebook concerning the outages, which read, ""The power is out in Moore County and I know why.""

Rainey noted that the reason why was ""that God works in mysterious ways and is responsible for the outage.""

Sheriff Fields cast significant doubt on whether Rainey had anything to do with the blackout.

According to the Fayetteville Observer, the drag show in question had been open to children but due to pressure was subsequently made an 18+ event.

Sunrise Theater executive director Kevin Dietzel suggested that changing the age and thereby precluding children from witnessing the highly sexualized performances ""adds to the stigma that people in the drag community already feel. ... It adds fuel to the myth that the LGBTQ+ community is something that people need to keep their kids away from.""

The drag show took place without incident on Saturday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-carolina-county-may-go-without-power-for-days-after-targeted-attack,2022-12-05
"Gay, Norwegian filmmaker faces hate speech crime for saying male-to-female transgender people can't be lesbians or get pregnant, could get 3 years in prison","A gay, Norwegian filmmaker faces up to three years in prison for declaring that biological men are not capable of getting pregnant and becoming lesbians. The filmmaker is being investigated for hate speech crimes for remarks made about male-to-female transgender people.

Tonje Gjevjon — a gay, Norwegian filmmaker and actress — was informed on Nov. 17 that she was being investigated for possible hate speech crimes.

Gjevjon wrote a Facebook post that called out Norwegian LGBTQ activist Christine Jentoft — a representative for Norway's leading trans activist group and a transgender female who often uses the label ""lesbian mother.""

Gjevjon wrote, ""It’s just as impossible for men to become a lesbian as it is for men to become pregnant. Men are men regardless of their sexual fetishes.""

Gjevjon continued, ""Men with fetishes have been protected as a vulnerable minority through the foolish and constructed concept of gender identity is koko [sic].""



Authorities are investigating whether Gjevjon's post violated Norway's hate speech law.

Last year, Gjevjon confronted Norway’s minister of culture and reality regarding transgender people and women's rights.

Gjevjon stated, ""I believe it is absolutely necessary to place biological sex as the basis in all contexts where sex has legal, cultural, or practical relevance, and that equating sex with gender identity has harmful, discriminatory consequences for women and girls – especially lesbians.""

Gjevjon asked Anette Trettebergstuen, ""Will the equality minister take action to ensure that lesbian women’s human rights are safeguarded, by making it clear that there are no lesbians with penises, that males cannot be lesbians regardless of their gender identity, and by tidying up the mess of the harmful gender policies left behind by the previous government?""

Gjevjon wrote in the Norwegian outlet Klassekampen, ""I have stated that women are female, that lesbians do not have penises, that children should not be responsible for decisions they do not have the capacity to understand the scope of, and that no-platforming is harmful to democracy. For these opinions I have been canceled several times.""

In November 2020, Norway's parliament voted to criminalize hate speech against transgender people.

Norwegians found guilty of hate speech against transgender people face a fine or up to a year in jail for private comments and a maximum of three years in prison for public remarks.

Gjevjon claims that her Facebook post was deliberately written to call attention to the nation's hate speech law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/norwegian-filmmaker-transgender-hate-speech,2022-12-16
New York Gov Kathy Hochul signs bill to require utilities to use customers' preferred name and pronouns,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has signed a bill that will require utility corporations, municipalities, water-works corporations, and telephone service providers to utilize each customer's desired name and pronouns in communications, a move that comes as the left continues to press for societal acceptance and accommodation of radical gender ideologies.

""Legislation S.5325/A.6193 gives utility customers the right to be addressed and acknowledged by their preferred name and pronouns by requiring utility corporations, municipalities, water-works corporations, and telephone service providers to allow customers to use their preferred name and pronouns,"" according to a press release.



""Nearly 80,000 New Yorkers identify as transgender. This #TransAwarenessWeek, I'm proud to sign the Affirming Gender Identity in Utilities Act — common-sense legislation that gives New Yorkers the right to be addressed and acknowledged by their chosen names and correct pronouns,"" Hochul tweeted.

One person who responded the tweet wrote, ""We're drowning in this economy. What are you doing about that?""

""This is what you're concentrating on with all the issues in this state. Unreal how out of touch you are,"" another person declared.

Debate over the transgender movement continues to rage in the U.S., including over issues such as school bathrooms and sports, with many Americans rejecting the notion that biological boys should have the option to utilize female restrooms and compete athletically against girls.



Hochul made history earlier this year when she was sworn in as the Empire State's first female governor. She stepped into the governorship after Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned.

Following the release of a report that concluded he had sexually harassed multiple women, Cuomo faced intense pressure to step down, including from members of his own party.

NYC lawmakers push bill to create an official 'drag laureate' for the city,"America has come a long way in a short time.

Forget Drag Queen Story Hour.

Don't give a second thought the Vermont high school's homecoming game halftime ""drag ball"" for students and teachers.

Now some New York City officials are pushing to create an official ""drag laureate"" — a government-endorsed man dressed in women's clothing.

What's that now?

""RuPaul's Drag Race"" was once a TV show that was popular for being a novelty. Now, apparently, it's going to be the basis for policy.

The New York Post reported Tuesday afternoon that three New York City lawmakers have put up legislation to order city officials who oversee Gotham's museums and nightlife to tap a laureate of the city's drag scene.

If passed, the Post said, the bill will require the city's commissioner for cultural affairs and the head of the Mayor's Office of Nightlife, to select a drag laureate every year in order to prop up local LGBT businesses and promote the arts scene.

Naturally, taxpayer funds would be used to provide a stipend and ""in-kind resources"" for the laureate.

Democratic City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, the lead sponsor of the drag laureate legislation along with Democratic Councilmen Carlos Menchaca and Ben Kallos, said, ""The drag laureate would serve to champion and highlight the contributions of the drag community in New York City's business, arts and cultural spaces,"" the Post reported.

Van Bramer admitted that his bill, which was introduced in January and got its first hearing Tuesday, does not direct city officials on how to select the laureate, but he said he envisions some sort of RuPaul-style competition.

""It would sort of be a mini RuPaul's Drag Race,"" he said about the selection process, according to the paper. ""It's a lot of fun, if we allow ourselves to have some fun with this.""

The city council has yet to set a date to vote on the measure, but the drag community appears to be pretty excited about it.

Famous drag queen and LGBT activist Marti Cummings praised the bill, saying, ""A drag laureate role in our city would validate the art form,"" the Post reported.

""Drag is an art form that has no box to hold it in,"" Cummings continued. ""It's an art form that not only supports so many businesses, but it's an art form that also helps to teach and educate people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-official-drag-laureate,2021-10-27
NYC Health Dept. demands monkeypox be renamed to avoid 'racism' and 'stigma': 'Painful and racist history',"New York City is demanding the World Health Organization rename the ""monkeypox"" virus because of ""devastating and stigmatizing effects"" of the name.

What is the background?

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced last month his organization would change the name of ""monkeypox"" over concerns the label is racist.

However, six weeks later, the WHO has not followed through with the name change.

What is NYC saying?

NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan urged Tedros to promptly act on that promise and stop using the ""monkeypox"" nomenclature.

""NYC joins many public health experts and community leaders who have expressed their serious concern about continuing to exclusively use the term 'monkeypox' given the stigma it may engender, and the painful and racist history within which terminology like this is rooted for communities of color,"" Vasan wrote in a letter.



In fact, Vasan claimed ""misinformation"" about monkeypox is harming black people and LGBT people.

[E]arly misinformation about the virus led people to believe that it was spread to humans after people in Africa engaged in sexual activity with monkeys. This kind of false messaging created incalculable harm and stigma for decades to come.



Continuing to use the term “monkeypox” to describe the current outbreak may reignite these traumatic feelings of racism and stigma — particularly for Black people and other people of color, as well as members of the LGBTQIA+ communities, and it is possible that they may avoid engaging in vital health care services because of it.

Instead of ""monkeypox,"" Vasan suggested the WHO use more formal designations such as ""hMPXV"" or ""MPV.""

If the WHO and other health organizations do not alter their language, Vasan claimed people who contract monkeypox — a virus primarily spreading in gay communities — will face violence like Asian people did in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The WHO must act in this moment before it is too late,"" Vasan warned.

Anything else?

Despite a barrage of media headlines warning monkeypox could become the next pandemic, there have been fewer than 20,000 confirmed cases of the virus across the globe.

In the U.S., fewer than 4,000 cases have been confirmed.

Still, the WHO has declared monkeypox an international global health emergency.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-monkeypox-rename-racism-stigma,2022-07-27
NYC Pride bans police from events until 2025 in effort to 'create safer spaces',"NYC Pride, the group in charge of New York City's annual Pride March, announced over the weekend that it has moved to ban police from events until at least 2025 as part of an effort to make LGBT individuals feel ""safer"" and challenge officers to ""acknowledge their harm.""

What are the details?

In a press release on Saturday, the group argued its decision to prohibit police from events would ""create safer spaces for the LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC communities at a time when violence against marginalized groups, specifically BIPOC and trans communities, has continued to escalate.""

""The sense of safety that law enforcement is meant to provide can instead be threatening, and at times dangerous, to those in our community who are most often targeted with excessive force and/or without reason,"" the group stated, adding it is ""unwilling to contribute in any way to creating an atmosphere of fear or harm for members of the community.""

""Effective immediately, NYC Pride will ban corrections and law enforcement exhibitors at NYC Pride events until 2025. At that time their participation will be reviewed by the Community Relations and Diversity, Accessibility, and Inclusion committees, as well as the Executive Board,"" the press release continued.

Under the new guidance, all law enforcement officers — reportedly including members of the Gay Officers Action League (GOAL) — will be called on only when ""absolutely necessary as mandated by city officials"" and even then will be required to keep ""at least one city block away from event perimeter areas.""

According to NYC Pride, replacing New York City police and other law enforcement at events will be a combination of ""trained private security, community leaders, and volunteers.""

What else?

In the statement, the group also challenged law enforcement to ""acknowledge their harm"" and correct their course moving forward in order to perhaps begin to make ""impactful change.""

But in a statement responding to the news, the president of GOAL called the group's decision to ban police from events ""shameful"" and ""demoralizing.""

""Their response to activist pressure is to take the low road by preventing their fellow community members from celebrating their identities and honoring the shared legacy of the Stonewall Riots,"" Detective Brian Downey said in a statement ahead of NYC Pride's announcement, Fox News reported.

Other members of New York City law enforcement reportedly referred to the move as ""misguided"" and ""disheartening.""

""The idea of officers being excluded is disheartening and runs counter to our shared values of inclusion and tolerance,"" Detective Sophia Mason added. ""That said, we'll still be there to ensure traffic safety and good order during this huge, complex event.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-pride-bans-police,2021-05-17
NYC mayor desperately tries to lure LGBT Floridians to New York with a flamboyant billboard campaign,"Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has decided to capitalize on the progressive outcry over Florida's new Parental Rights in Education bill in a desperate attempt to reverse the tide of New Yorkersfleeing the city for more conservative localities.

What are the details?

In a press release issued Monday, the mayor's office announced the launch of a flamboyant billboard campaign in five Florida cities that attacks the Florida legislation — which has been profusely and inaccurately dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by media critics — as ant-LGBT and anti-free speech.

Its aim is clearly to woo LGBT Floridians to leave Florida and come take up residence in New York City.

Featured digital billboard ads will run in Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and West Palm Beach roughly through the end of May. They will contain messages such as ""Come to the city where you can say whatever you want,"" ""When other states show their true colors, we show ours,"" and ""Loud. Proud. Still allowed.""



""People say a lot of ridiculous things in New York. 'Don't Say Gay' isn't one of them,"" another message reads, according to documents provided by the mayor's office.

In a statement, Adams said, ""I am the mayor of New York City, but I have a message for Florida’s LGBTQ+ community — come to a city where you can say and be whoever you want. Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill is the latest shameful, extremist culture war targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Today, we say to the families living in fear of this state-sponsored discrimination that you will always have a home in New York City.""

What else?

Only time will tell if the campaign proves successful, though there are reasons to be skeptical at the notion that people will ditch the beachy income-tax-free Sunshine State in exchange for residency in pricey, crime-ridden New York City — especially over a bill that has widespread support among all voters, including Democrats.

The much-maligned Florida bill has been grossly mischaracterized by left-wing media pundits and cultural figures. Some have argued it will result in the deaths of Florida children, while others seem to genuinely believe it outlaws saying the word, ""gay.""

In actuality, the bill sets forward a popular rule: the barring of classroom discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms with scaleable guidelines for discussion on the controversial subject matter in grades thereafter.

That, according to the NYC mayor's office, amounts to ""a targeted attack on the LGBTQ+ population.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-say-gay-billboard-campaign,2022-04-04
AOC receives brutal reality check after claiming GOP critics 'are mad they can’t date me' and have 'deranged sexual frustrations',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) triggered a social media storm on New Year's Eve after she claimed that her Republican critics are ""mad they can’t date me"" and accused them of ""projecting their sexual frustrations"" onto her boyfriend.

What is the background?

Ocasio-Cortez faced backlash late last week after she was caught vacationing in Florida while her constituents in New York City battled skyrocketing COVID-19 cases.

National Review reported:

Ocasio-Cortez was spotted dining in Miami Beach, Fla., on Thursday, according to a tip received by National Review , on the same day that her native New York City reported a record number of Covid-19 cases.



Photos obtained by National Review show Ocasio-Cortez seated outside Doraku Sushi and Izakaya in Miami Beach Thursday afternoon, raising a cocktail in one and checking her phone in another.



How did AOC respond?

The New York Democrat responded by claiming her GOP critics are ""creepy weirdos"" who need therapy to address their ""deranged sexual frustrations.""

""If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Ya creepy weirdos.""

""It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women, & LGBT+ people in general,"" she added. ""These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.""

What was the response?

Ocasio-Cortez was hit with a reality check.

No, critics were not condemning her trip to Florida because they want to date her. Instead, Ocasio-Cortez's trip to Florida seemingly exposed her hypocrisy, critics alleged. Critics also noted that her response to the backlash was ""insanely narcissistic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-gop-critics-date-accusations,2022-01-02
"AOC pounces on Lindsey Graham, says he sounds 'insecure'","Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York pounced on Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina after the senator declared that leftists are attacking democracy in America.

""There is an assault on democracy in this country, but it is by the Left not the Right. It took us 50 years to overturn Roe vs Wade. We worked hard, won elections, and put conservatives on the court. 5 days after losing at Supreme Court, Democrats want to blow up the Senate!"" Graham tweeted on Thursday.

Ocasio-Cortez responded to Graham by tweeting, ""You sound insecure. As you should be. Your attempt to seize bodily autonomy from millions of women & LGBT+ people is a stain on our country. I don’t care how long you 'worked' to seize control of people’s bodies. That right belongs to individuals, not you. We will not comply.""

Democrats have been in an uproar about a Supreme Court ruling that enables states to ban abortions.

""The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" the opinion declared.

While pro-life advocates have been jubilant about the high court's ruling, pro-choice proponents have been railing against the Supreme Court, with many Democrats claiming that the decision marked a ""dark day"" the the nation.



""These people are crazy. They want to pack the Supreme Court. They want to abolish the Electoral College so New York and California can pick the president. They want to federalize all elections so they can ballot-harvest and do away with voter I.D.,"" Graham tweeted on Friday in a post appended to his Thursday tweet. ""I'm hoping people in America are watching what they're planning to do if Republicans don't take back the Senate,"" he added.

Earlier this week Ocasio-Cortez appeared to take issue with the predominance of male lawmakers in Congress.

""Quick reminder that the US Congress is 73% male and that’s the lowest it’s ever been, in case you want 1 small contributing glimpse as to why Roe hasn’t been treated w/ the urgency it deserved for ~50 years. (And why our politics are so gross towards women & LGBT+ people overall),"" she declared.

Women occupy 27.5% of Congress, according to the Center for American Women and Politics of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey — this includes 123 House members and 24 senators who are women.

While some female lawmakers share Ocasio-Cortez's left-wing views, other women in Congress are pro-life and oppose the LGBT agenda.

In response to the Ocasio-Cortez's tweet about the country's majority-male Congress, Christina Pushaw, who works as Gov. Ron DeSantis's (R-Fl.) press secretary, tweeted, ""Are you implying that only women can get pregnant?""

Ocasio-Cortez is one of the dozens of Democrats who have thrown their support behind a ""Trans Bill of Rights"" resolution.



According to a press release, the ""resolution provides a comprehensive framework to provide protections for transgender and nonbinary people, ensuring that they are not discriminated against or persecuted for their gender identity and expression.""

Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing lawmakers have been up in arms about the Supreme Court's move to strike down Roe v. Wade. While the decision enables states to ban abortions, it does not block states from allowing abortions to continue.

""The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the opinion.

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last week, ""Overturning Roe and outlawing abortions will never make them go away. It only makes them more dangerous, especially for the poor + marginalized.

Ohio substitute teacher fired after handing out 'Pride' bracelets to students,"Last week, a homosexual substitute teacher in Chillicothe, Ohio, was fired after handing out “Pride bracelets” to high school students. The incident occurred in the Huntington Local Schools district high school.

Jay Bowman, who has been a teacher for 30 years, was reportedly working as a substitute teacher when several girls in his classroom asked him about a “rainbow-colored First Capital PRIDE bracelet” he was wearing, reported WSYX, a local ABC affiliate in Columbus, Ohio.

Bowman’s employment was reportedly terminated after he gave similar gay pride bracelets to his students and explained to them what the bands symbolized.

To which Bowman said, “If a kid has questions. If a kid wants honesty, I don’t think I should be forbidden from providing that.”

Suggesting that his termination indicates the school’s willingness to violate the human rights of LGBT people, Bowman said, “I think the reaction to my violation when compared to other instances in the school where certain things are tolerated, was unfair, Bowman said. “Huntington Township is by in large a conservative area, and human rights are not a foreign entity at all, but it is outside the comfort level of a lot of people.”

Bowman insisted that him giving the students gay pride paraphernalia and explaining what the items symbolized from his perspective should not be considered recruitment. He also insisted that he was not responsible for the children he was supervising in the classroom.

“I don’t try to recruit anyone,” he said. “The parents are responsible for their kids. The parents are the ones who need to teach their kids right and wrong.”

Peter Ruby, the district’s superintendent, refused to answer questions about the incident on camera but issued a statement through the district saying that Bowman’s termination was because he violated school policy, not because of his sexual orientation.

“It is important for you to know that our Board policies restrict staff from discussing with students certain subjects, including political, religious, and personal beliefs. This past week, we received reports with specific concerns about possible violations of those policies by a substitute teacher in the district. After a brief investigation, we confirmed, by the substitute’s own admission, that he violated board policies by speaking to students about political and religious topics, as well as distributing bracelets.”

In the video, Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke explains the dangers of how misgendering someone is a ""form of abuse.""

What are the details?

In the video, Cooke says, ""Today is International Pronouns Day, which is a day particularly important to people who identify as transgender, or gender non-conforming.""

""Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal well-being,"" she warns. ""It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody, and that just isn't right.""

""Today,"" Cooke concludes, ""is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations, and understanding why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used for them. Have a good day.""

Anything else we ought to know?

Cooke's page on the Cheshire Constabulary website points out that LGBTQ activism is near and dear to her heart.

A portion of her biography reads, ""In June 2017, I was appointed the UK National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for the LGBT+ Portfolio. I am striving to ensure that all of our staff feel able to come to work and to be themselves; be honest about their lives outside of work, without fear of reprisals or attitudes they may face, but also that all staff are comfortable to ask appropriate questions and learn.""

""I also want members of the LGBT+ community to be able to walk through our communities knowing that they are safe and understood,"" Cooke's biography concludes.

Misgendering is apparently becoming rather serious business in the U.K.

Earlier in 2019, a British woman was arrested after misgendering a transgender activist.

Authorities charged Kate Scottow, a 38-year-old mother of two children, with ""malicious communications.""

Authorities detained and questioned Scottow for more than seven hours in connection with the incident. During the investigation, authorities took her photograph, DNA samples, and fingerprints. A court also banned her from referring to the transgender activist as a man.

After her arrest, Scottow took her story to the internet, where it went viral.

On online forum Mumsnet, Scottow wrote, ""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present. I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed) before being interviewed then later released under investigation ... I was arrested for harassment and malicious communications because I called someone out and misgendered them on Twitter.""

Openly gay New York Democrats oppose plan to open Chick-fil-A restaurants along I-90,"New York Democrats are attempting to stop a plan to open Chick-fil-A restaurants at rest stops along a state thruway, claiming that the fast-food franchise has a history of discriminating against LGBT people.

The New York State Thruway Authority is about to begin a $450 million project to modernize 27 service areas along I-90, and Chick-fil-A is one of several food vendors that will be installed at these locations. But on Friday, three openly gay Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter asking that the authority ""re-examine the list of approved concessions for these rest spots considering Chick-fil-A's action against the LGBTQ+ community.""

""Chick-fil-A and its founders have a long and controversial history of opposing the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and families,"" wrote state Assemblyman Harry Bronson (D-Rochester). The letter cites Chick-fil-A CEO Dan T. Cathy's public comments opposing same-sex marriage and claims Chick-fil-A's charity arm, the WinShape Foundation, has ""donated millions of dollars to organizations hostile to LGBTQ+ rights."" The letter cites a 2017 donation to the Salvation Army as an example.

While the Democrats praised the legalization of same-sex marriage and the adoption of LGBT sexual orientations and gender identities as protected classes in anti-discrimination law in New York, they expressed concerns that opening more Chick-fil-A restaurants would send ""a message to LGBTQ+ individuals and families that [the Thruway Authority] doesn't share the same commitment to their civil rights as New York State.""

""We are requesting that you re-examine the list of approved concessions for these rest spots considering Chick-fil-A's action against the LGBTQ+ community,"" the letter concludes.

Bronson said that by leasing state thruway authority property to Chick-fil-A, the state was giving the company an opportunity to make millions of dollars even though it is purportedly anti-LGBT.

""We can't say through those laws and through those policy positions and statements, that we support the dignity and human rights of LGBTQ individuals and their families and at the same time, have a state authority that's willing to enter into a 30-year-lease with a business that has a history of not recognizing the human rights of LGBTQ individuals,"" he told to WROC-TV.

The Rochester lawmaker has also launched a petition allowing state residents to co-sign the Democrats' letter in a show of solidarity.

In response, the Thruway Authority released a statement emphasizing its support for ""an inclusive environment that treats the tens of millions of people that travel our system with dignity and respect.""

""Our private partner in the Service Area redevelopment project, Empire State Thruway Partners, explored a selection of restaurants and finalized agreements with specific brands to operate at the redeveloped service areas to enhance and improve the travel experience for our customers. There are no state taxpayer dollars or toll payer funds supporting the redevelopment of the Thruway's 27 service areas,"" said Jonathan Dougherty, a spokesman for the Thruway Authority.

In a comment to Fox News, Chick-fil-A said it is ""excited about the partnership"" with New York and emphasized that the company does not have a political agenda.

""We want to be clear that Chick-fil-A does not have a political or social agenda, and we welcome everyone in our restaurants. We are proud to be represented by more than 200,000 diverse team members nationwide, and we strive to be a positive influence in our local communities,"" Chick-fil-A, Inc. said in a statement.

In 2019, after years of negative headlines in the media and outraged protest from LGBT individuals, Chick-fil-A announced it would stop donating to ""anti-LGBTQ"" organizations like the Salvation Army or the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. The concession has apparently not sated the company's critics, nor have revelations that the company has recently donated to partisan left-wing organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/openly-gay-new-york-democrats-oppose-plan-to-open-chick-fil-a-restaurants-along-i-90,2021-07-13
Openly gay radio host threatens to sue his station over a homophobic tweet. Except police say he sent the tweet himself.,"A New Orleans radio host is under fire after he reportedly sent a homophobic tweet from the radio station's official Twitter account to himself.

He later demanded the radio station, WWL-AM, pay him $1.8 million in compensation over the incident.

What are the details?

According to NOLA.com, openly gay radio host Seth Dunlap, 35, reportedly tweeted a slur from the station's verified Twitter account to his personal account.

Dunlap was reportedly facing financial troubles at the time of the incident, which took place days after Dunlap wrote a ""lengthy post on his Facebook page outlining the difficulties he had faced while working in sports media as a gay man,"" according to NOLA.

The tweet, which was sent earlier this month, prompted Dunlap to take a leave of absence from the station.

WWL released a statement revealing that it had turned over their internal investigation to the local police department.

The statement said:

WWL has completed its investigation into the highly offensive, unauthorized tweet sent from WWL's Twitter account on September 10, which directed a homophobic slur at Seth Dunlap. We determined that the most appropriate next step is to involve law enforcement. At this point, the investigation is in the hands of law enforcement and it is not appropriate for us to comment any further on the substance of our findings.

A New Orleans Police Department report revealed that Dunlap sent the offending tweet from his personal cell phone. The outlet reported that the department is considering the investigation as possible extortion. Such a charge could be punishable with up to 15 years in prison.

Dunlap's attorney maintains his innocence and says that her client didn't have access to the station's Twitter profile.

""It is truly reprehensible [the station] would be attempting to blame the victim of its own anti-LGBT culture, and they are only compounding the severe damage that Mr. Dunlap has experienced at the hands of [station parent company] Entercom.""

The station issued a statement Wednesday denying any involvement in promoting hate against the LGBT community.

""We apologize to our listeners, clients, partners and employees for this abhorrent, disrespectful act,"" the statement said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/openly-gay-radio-host-threatens-to-sue-his-station-over-a-homophobic-tweet-except-police-say-he-sent-the-tweet-himself,2019-09-27
Openly gay reality TV star claims his Christian faith moved him to write a children's book with his pansexual son,"Reality TV star Karamo Brown says his new children's book explores how each individual person is ""perfectly designed.""

Brown, most famous for his role in Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" says that he implemented the mantra ""I am perfectly designed"" — which he claims stems from his Christian faith and upbringing — for his own sons when they were young and growing.

The new book of the same name — ""I Am Perfectly Designed — features the family mantra as its title and is co-written by his son, 22-year-old Jason ""Rachel"" Brown.

Brown also has a 16-year-old son.

What are the details?

Brown, 38, who recently appeared on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" told USA Today that he always wanted to write a children's book.

Brown, who is openly gay and partnered, features a variety of diverse families in the book, as well as myriad sexual orientations and races — a move that he says was ""100% intentional.""

He told the outlet that he previously had a hard time coming to grips with kids' books that feature characters who are identical to one another, so he was moved to create a more inclusive work for children.

""That's just not true for the world,"" he insisted, and pointed out the importance of people seeing through the lens of different perspectives, sexualities, genders, and races.

""This is a mantra, 'I am perfectly designed,' that I'd tell my kids when they were younger,"" he said.

The reality star and author also touched upon his son Jason's sexuality, as the 22-year-old recently came out as ""pansexual."" A person with a pansexual orientation doesn't limit him or herself to any one particular sexual preference with regard to gender or orientation.

Brown admitted that his son often struggled with his identity growing up despite living in an LGBTQ-friendly family.

""We live in a house where he has two dads and I've worked with LGBT causes, worked with LGBT youth, and yet he still felt uncomfortable,"" Brown told the publication.

""We didn't grow up rich,"" Brown added. ""When I got custody of my kids, I was on a social worker's salary, which wasn't a lot. The kids got bullied — their dad was gay — and they would come home really sad, and I would just sit them down and remind them, 'You are perfectly designed.' Which was sort of a message I got growing up, because my parents were religious, I grew up in a church, and I was always told I was made just the way I am by God.""

What else?

Brown said that though Jason identifies as atheist, he isn't deterred.

""People are always like, 'How do you deal with that?'"" he said. ""And I'm like, 'I love my son.' Because that is what my religion says. It says you do not judge someone, you love them and respect them. That's what the religion and the Christ that I follow taught me.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/openly-gay-reality-tv-star-claims-his-christian-faith-moved-him-to-write-a-childrens-book-with-his-pansexual-son,2019-11-05
Openly gay US soccer star — who unleashed numerous f-bombs during team's World Cup parade — calls Christian player 'homophobic',"You remember Ashlyn Harris, right?

The goalkeeper for the World Cup-winning U.S. women's soccer team arguably is as well known for her Instagram stories chronicling her teammates' off-the-field antics. And in one featuring the squad's New York City victory parade last week, Harris unleashed quite a bit of profanity.

""Hide your kids, hide your wife, and lock your f***in' doors because we got the key to the motherf***in' city, and I'm comin' for all y'all bitches,"" Harris declared, among other salty pronouncements at other times.

Here's the clip. (Content warning: profanity):

Ashlyn Harris Instagram Stories // USWNT Parade of Champions + City Hall Ceremony // NYC // 7.10.19 youtu.be

A new target

And now Harris is coming after Christian soccer player Jaelene Hinkle.

You see, Hinkle made headlines of her own two years ago by withdrawing from the U.S. women's team a few weeks after it was announced the squad would wear rainbow-colored jerseys in honor of LGBT Pride month.

""I just felt so convicted in my spirit that it wasn't my job to wear this jersey,"" Hinkle said in a video feature from the Christian Broadcasting Network's program ""The 700 Club."" ""I gave myself three days to just seek and pray and determine what he was asking me to do in this situation ... I knew in my spirit I was doing the right thing. I knew that I was being obedient.""

CultureOfLife Africa founder Obianuju Ekeocha posted a clip of that video Sunday on Twitter, noting that ""apparently"" the U.S. women's soccer team ""is not a very welcoming place for Christians.""

With that, Harris — who's openly gay and engaged to teammate Ali Krieger — linked to Ekeocha's tweet on her own Twitter post and went off on Hinkle.

'You are homophobic'



""Hinkle, our team is about inclusion,"" Harris tweeted Monday. ""Your religion was never the problem. The problem is your intolerance, and you are homophobic. You don't belong in a sport that aims to unite and bring people together. You would never fit into our pack or what this team stands for.""

Image source: Twitter

Harris added a second tweet presumably still addressed to Hinkle: ""Don't you dare say our team is 'not a welcoming place for Christians.' You weren't around long enough to know what this team stood for. This is actually an insult to the Christians on our team.""

Image source: Twitter

But there's a big problem



Except the ""isn't a welcoming place for Christians"" statement came from Ekeocha, not Hinkle. In fact, not once in the clip posted by Ekeocha or in the full video did Hinkle say the U.S. women's team isn't a welcoming place for Christians.

US Soccer on Tuesday didn't immediately respond to TheBlaze's request for comment on Harris' apparent accusation that Hinkle said the women's team ""isn't a welcoming place for Christians.""

The New York Post also incorrectly reported that Hinkle said in the video interview that the U.S. women's team isn't a welcoming place for Christians.

Kyle Krieger — brother of Harris' teammate and fiancé Ali Krieger — responded to the Ekeocha tweet and accused Hinkle of ""bigotry"":

Image source: Twitter

""As someone close to the team, I know this is false,"" Krieger wrote. ""The players have an inclusive bible study, they pray before and after the WC games, and they are open to whatever faith you follow. Not all Christians are bigots. Hinkle, on the other hand, hides her bigotry behind her faith.""

NBC News said Hinkle — a defender for the North Carolina Courage in the National Women's Soccer League — didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Here's the full Hinkle video from ""The 700 Club:""

Anything else?

NBC News, citing LGBTQ sports site Outsports, added that about 40 lesbian and bisexual players participated in the Women's World Cup this year as opposed to fewer than 20 in 2015. NBC News also said the U.S. women's national soccer team had at least five openly LGBTQ players on the team this year, including co-captain Megan Rapinoe.

Rapinoe — who made good on a promise to ignore the national anthem before games as an ""f-you"" to President Donald Trump and later said she's ""not going to the f***ing White House"" — also tweeted that ""gays rule"" and ""science is science"" after the U.S. women's soccer team beat the Netherlands to take the 2019 World Cup.

'Milk’s favorite cookie' panned after going all in with woke LGBT coming-out ad: 'Your cookie must affirm your sexual lifestyle',"Oreo prompted conservatives on Twitter to roll their eyes this week after double-dipping into the world of hot-button socio-political issues yet again with a new ad urging people to be lifelong supporters of the LGBT lifestyle.

What are the details?

The two-and-a-half-minute short film, called ""The Note,"" featured a young Asian man nervously reading a coming-out note to his immediate family as he prepares to share the news of his sexuality with his extended family.

The tense scene concludes with the young man's mother encouraging her dispirited son. ""She might be my mother, but you are my son,"" she adds to the bottom of the note.

""Coming out doesn’t happen just once. It’s a journey that needs love and courage every step of the way,” Oreo said in a tweet along with the video, adding, ""Share our new film and let someone know you’re their #LifelongAlly.""

It's not the first time that ""milk's favorite cookie"" has delved into political waters. Earlier this year, the Nabisco brand inserted itself into the national conversation around transgender issues when it tweeted, ""Trans people exist."" Before that, it released another short film about a lesbian couple coming out to parents.

To onlookers, it seems that the company prides itself on being outspoken on issues completely unrelated to cookies.

But in an interview with Fast Company, Oreo senior brand manager Olympia Portale insisted the forced marketing message was a ""natural place"" for the company to go, given its notoriety as a ""family brand.""



""'The Note' is not Oreo’s story,"" she explained, though going on to say, ""Oreo is there to lend our megaphone to the community we want to support. To illustrate the message we, as a brand, want to stand behind is a great place to start.""

How are people reacting?

Conservatives on Twitter and elsewhere responded with chagrin after being force-fed the woke messaging.

""Sexuality has NOTHING TO DO with the cookie experience,"" tweeted Newsmax host Greg Kelly. ""Basically cookies are 'asexual' — why is the WOKE LEFT messing around with OREOS?!?! STOP THE INSANITY.""

""What on earth does this have to do with cookies?"" added Tommy Joe Ratliff.

Blaze Media's Jessica O'Donnell quipped: ""Finally this ad is made. I wasn’t sure what to do. I felt so guilty eating a cookie because I wasn’t sure what its stance on LGBT issues was.""

LiveAction's Lila Rose stated, ""Stop sexualizing children, @oreo.""

""Your cookie must affirm your sexual lifestyle,"" the Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro said. ""Again, the chief reply here seems to be: 'How dare you notice that a cookie company is now running ads on sexual orientation?' Guys, the story is that every woke corporation now believes it must become an activist LGBTQIA+-%6& outlet. And yes, that's a story.""

Writing for the Daily Signal, columnist Nicole Russell asserted, ""LGBT activists complain about being caught in the middle of the culture war, even as they fuel the controversy at every turn, even rendering cookies like Oreos woke.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oreo-lgbt-short-film-reactions,2022-04-07
Orlando Pride women's soccer team apologizes for removing 'GAY' banner after players flood comments of complaint post,"The Orlando Pride apologized to the LGBT community this week after a group of supporters were told they couldn't display a banner that said ""GAY"" at a match over the weekend, ESPN reported.

What happened?

The supporters group, called the Black Swans Drinking Club, wanted to display the banner on Saturday as the Pride hosted the Washington Spirit in the National Women's Soccer League opener. But stadium staff told the group they needed to remove the banner because it was deemed political.

The black banner, which simply said ""GAY,"" was intended as a protest against Florida's new Parental Rights in Education Bill, a measure that prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third-grade classrooms and aims to guide ""age-appropriate discussions"" of the subject matter in subsequent grades.

The bill, dubbed by critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, actually enjoys broad support among bipartisan voters, but misconceptions about it abound thanks to attacks from LGBT activists and mischaracterizations in the media.

Unhappy with the banner's removal, the Black Swans took to social media in protest. In an Instagram post, the group argued that the sign voiced a ""human rights"" statement rather than a ""political"" one.

Several Pride players soon joined in support of the Black Swans protest, flooding the comments section of the post with the word ""gay,"" over and over.

The backlash resulted in a meeting between team representatives and members of the supporters group.

What happened next?

On Tuesday, the Pride issued a joint statement with the Black Swans unequivocally apologizing for the decision to have the banner removed.

""These conversations resulted in one ultimate and important conclusion: a mistake was made when the Club asked the Black Swans to remove the banner that said 'GAY.' The organization admits it wrongly focused on signage policies and procedures, instead of allowing the important meaning of this message,"" the team said, noting that the Black Swans would thereafter be permitted to hang the banner during home matches.

The Athletic noted that the move to remove the banner in the first place was strange, since only a month earlier the Pride joined Major League Soccer's Orlando City SC to issue a statement condemning the Florida Parental Rights in Education bill.

The statement read, in part: ""We oppose the Florida legislation which promotes ostracization and discrimination of LGBTQ+ students in our schools and their families"" and ""our club[s] will continue to use our voices and our platforms to create inclusive, supportive, and safe environments for all.""

Orlando’s Exploria Stadium, home to the Pride, even has 49 rainbow seats installed as a tribute to the victims of the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub.

Anything else?

That said, loosely followed code of conduct rules do in fact prohibit ""political"" messages from being displayed in stadiums.

""NWSL fans have a right to expect an environment where fans enjoy the soccer experience free from fighting, thrown objects, attempts to enter the playing field, political or inciting messages, and disorderly behavior, including foul, sexist, racial, obscene or abusive language or gestures,"" a relevant section of the code of conduct states.



Nevertheless, the league and the club appeared to have folded under pressure from noisy activists.

In a statement to the Athletic on Tuesday, a league spokesperson said, ""The NWSL fan code of conduct currently prohibits ‘political or inciting messages,’ but it clearly requires a more thoughtful approach that takes into consideration intent and context. We want to create opportunities for our fans to continue to participate as their full selves, and that includes the activism that is often a core value for our supporters’ groups. We are committed to doing that work and will do so in partnership with supporters and their representatives.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/orlando-pride-gay-banner-apology,2022-03-24
Report: Oscars ratings are plummeting so badly that major advertisers are now making serious demands,"Advertisers who purchased commercial airtime for this year's Academy Awards show — which airs Sunday night — are so concerned about declining viewership and decreasing return on investment that they are now demanding ratings threshold guarantees.

What are the details?



Amid plummeting ratings, which have plagued Hollywood award shows over the last decade, ABC, which owns exclusive rights to host the Oscars, was ""forced to guarantee a ratings threshold to keep the deepest-pocketed buyers happy"" ahead of Sunday's show, according to Deadline.

""The Oscars are still a very big deal, but people aren't stupid, and year after year of declining ratings are getting us to a danger zone,"" an ""insider"" told Deadline. ""We are right on the edge of that danger zone — not close, but on it — and that makes advertisers very nervous.""

After years of record-low ratings, car companies, retail companies, and technology companies requested — and were granted — the ratings guarantees. The development was characterized as ""a wake-up call to everyone.""

An advertising executive for Disney — which owns ABC — unequivocally denied the guarantees in a statement to Deadline. Still, even if the guarantees exist, with more than 20 million expected viewers, the awards show would clear the threshold hurdle with ease.

This year's Oscars Awards show has already been mired in controversy when its host, comedian Kevin Hart, backed out of hosting the show after LGBT activists seized on him after unearthing ancient social media postings from Hart that they found offensive.

Oscars executives reportedly first tried to secure Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as this year's host, but was unable to do so. With Hart's departure, this year's show will go on host-less.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oscars-advertisers-ratings-gaurantee,2019-02-24
Osprey aircraft crashes in California,"An MV-22B Osprey aircraft with five U.S. Marines on board went down near Glamis, California, on Wednesday, according to the military.

""An aircraft belonging to [the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing] has crashed near Glamis, CA,"" a tweet on the U.S. Marine Corps Twitter account noted. ""Contrary to social media rumors, there was no nuclear material on board the aircraft.""

""Update from [the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing]: At approximately 1225 PST, an MV-22B Osprey crashed near Glamis, CA. We are awaiting confirmation of the status of the five Marines who were onboard the aircraft, which was stationed at MCAS Camp Pendleton with Marine Aircraft Group 39,"" a subsequent tweet noted. ""We ask for the public’s patience as we work diligently with first responders and the unit involved to identify what occurred this afternoon,"" another tweet added.

The Osprey has the capability to fly like a helicopter or an airplane.



""The MV-22B Osprey is a tiltrotor V/STOL aircraft designed as the medium-lift replacement for the CH-46E Sea Knight assault support helicopter. The Osprey can operate as a helicopter or a turboprop aircraft and offers twice the speed, six times the range, and three times the payload of the CH-46E,"" according to a description of the aircraft. ""The MV-22 Osprey’s mission for the U.S. Marine Corps is the transportation of troops, equipment, and supplies from ships and land bases for combat assault and assault support.""

Earlier this year, another Osprey crashed amid NATO training exercises in Norway, leaving four Marines dead.

The U.S. Marine Corps posted an eyebrow-raising tweet earlier this month with a graphic that included bullets featuring brightly-colored tips, in an apparent nod to the LGBT rainbow symbol.

""Throughout June, the USMC takes #Pride in recognizing and honoring the contributions of our LGBTQ service members. We remain committed to fostering an environment free from discrimination, and defend the values of treating all equally, with dignity and respect. #PrideMonth #USMC,"" the tweet stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ospreycrosprey-carrying-marines-crashes-california,2022-06-09
Outraged university students protest against scholar-in-residence over tweet decrying bisexual Superman,"Outraged students at Christopher Newport University in Virginia protested against the school's scholar-in-residence over a tweet she posted decrying DC Comics for making their Superman character bisexual.

Students said the tweet made them feel unsafe.

""Reading her tweet, we felt uncomfortable and scared in a place we are supposed to call our home,"" said sophomore Abigail Honeycutt to WTKR-TV.

The tweet from author Sophia Nelson questioned the wisdom of marketing bisexual Superman to children.

""I don't get why this is necessary. I don't! What if Christian parents of children reading comic books don't want their kids exposed to bi-sexual characters? This is being pushed on kids,"" read the tweet. ""Then parents have to explain it. Most cannot!""

Nelson later deleted it but not before it stole the safety from the university students.

""I was sad and angry, and I would want the university to public denounce her actions. It's not what we stand for. It's not a community of excellence,"" Honeycutt said.

Christopher Newport University President Paul Trible released a long statement promising to change their policies to appease the students hurt by the tweet.



Christopher Newport intentionally creates and values our community of diversity, equity and inclusion. We have a powerful University statement about that. It is at the heart of who we are. We also value and protect freedom of speech, and have a powerful statement about that as well. Upholding that freedom is most important when it is hard – when ideas conflict and opinions differ fiercely. In this moment it is important that we live into both of these university commitments.

Trible said Nelson would be brought to the campus in order to have an open dialogue about her beliefs with the students she hurt with a tweet.

She will have an opportunity to share who she is, her views and opinions, and her heart. She will talk about why she tweeted what she did. We will listen. And we will share our views, opinions and hearts – the pain, the anger, and the questions. She will listen. She will learn what it means to be a part of this community. Everyone may never agree, but we will support our LGBTQ+ students and colleagues, listen, and talk, and learn how to be different, together.

On Monday, Nelson took to her Twitter to decry the ""cancel culture"" that had targeted her.

""We are cannibalizing one another with #CancelCulture it has to stop or I promise you in a decade or less America will no longer be America,"" tweeted Nelson.

""It's bullying. They are mean, nasty bullies. Vicious with their words, with intimidation and hatred in their hearts. And there is no excuse for ever bullying another human being because they made a mistake, messed up, misspoke, were just caught being simply human,"" she continued.

""There is a wave coming. A movement of sick and tired Americans. Tired of being pushed around and bullied, canceled, targeted, harassed for our faith beliefs, for our values, for our free thought and free speech,"" Nelson added.

Bottom line: There is a wave coming. A movement of sick and tired Americans. Tired of being pushed around and bullied, canceled, targeted, harassed for our faith beliefs, for our values, for our free thought and free speech. Today it's me in the crosshairs. Tomorrow it's you. 8/

""Today it's me in the crosshairs,"" she concluded. ""Tomorrow it's you.""



Nelson is a former Republican who left the party over the election of former President Donald Trump. In a recent interview on MSNBC she said the GOP is unsalvageable and Republicans need to form a new party to replace it.

Oxford college plans 'equality conversation' on transgender issues — but bans speech that questions transgender agenda,"An Oxford college is being criticized for planning a discussion about transgender issues while banning any dissenting view from being aired during the event.

The discussion planned for Merton College will include ""perspectives on trans intersectionality,"" but will explicitly exclude ""language which denies the validity of trans identity.""

The talk is being marketed under the ironic name of an ""Equality Conversation,"" according to the Telegraph. Attendees must sign an agreement to not dissent in order to attend.

Critics quickly pointed out the problematic nature of banning free speech at the event.

""My understanding is that universities and colleges are supposed to be upholding free speech,"" said Oxford University professor Selina Todd.

Todd added that she was ""stunned"" by the regulation on free speech and said that it set a ""dangerous"" precedent.

""Merton College seemed to me a place where you could debate calmly and an informed matter,"" she added, ""and the way this has now been couched as 'you're not allowed to debate' has left me staggered.""

Oxford sociology professor Michael Biggs said, ""The code of conduct seems intended to instill anxiety in the audience, who cannot know what viewpoints are forbidden.""

Others called the ban ""intellectual cowardice"" and ""censorship.""

"Palestinian Authority bans LGBTQ group from West Bank, calling activities 'harmful to the higher values and ideals'","The Palestinian Authority has banned members of an LGBTQ advocacy group from conducting activities in Palestinian-controlled territories, threatening them with arrest and urging citizens to report violators, according to the Jerusalem Post.

The ban is aimed at the group Al-Qaws for Sexual & Gender Diversity in Palestinian Society, which recently held an event in the city of Nablus and was planning another for later this month in the same location.

A spokesman for Palestinian Authority Police said the LGBTQ group's activities were ""harmful to the higher values and ideals of Palestinian society"" and ""unrelated to religions and Palestinian traditions and customs, especially in the city of Nablus.""

According to the Post, PA Police will actively pursue members of Al-Qaws for arrest and prosecution, and encouraged citizens to report anyone they suspect to be involved.

Al-Qaws issued a statement in response to the ban:

The Palestinian police announcement about our activities is very unfortunate. It's very strange that they are accusing us of being a suspicious entity working to take apart Palestinian society. Al-Qaws is a Palestinian organization that has been operating since 2001, and is carrying out educational and professional programs on sexual and gender diversity. We totally reject the attempt to create an atmosphere of prosecution and intimidation, as well threats of arrest.

Al-Qaws has been operating since 2001, aiming to ""fighting for vibrant Palestinian cultural and social change, building LGBTQ communities and promoting new ideas about the role of gender and sexual diversity in political activism, civil society institutions, media, and everyday life.""

The Times of Israel reported that Ahmad Harb, commissioner-general of the Independent Commission for Human Rights, expressed fear that the police were inciting violence against LGBTQ people.

""The Palestinian police's statement regarding the barring of the gathering of 'gays' and activists from the Al-Qaws organization and threatening to pursue them and asking citizens to secretly inform on 'suspects' is very bad,"" Harb wrote on Facebook. ""It rises to the level of calling for 'community violence and inciting a crime.' Many understood this statement as a call to wastefully spill blood and take the law into one's hands by implementing killing operations.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/palestinian-authority-bans-lgbtq-group-from-west-bank-calling-activities-harmful-to-the-higher-values-and-ideals,2019-08-19
Panel rules that not using preferred pronouns violated transgender person's human rights,"How slippery is that slope? Apparently, not abiding by someone's ""preferred pronouns"" is now a human rights violation.

What happened?



Jessie Nelson — whom the CBC described as ""a non‐binary, gender fluid, transgender person who uses they/them pronouns"" — was hired in 2019 as a server at a restaurant in Gibsons, British Columbia, a town not far from the northern United States border.

In a complaint, Nelson alleged that some of the restaurant staff was hostile. The bar manager Brian Gobelle reportedly refused to use Nelson's preferred pronouns, instead using ""she,"" ""her,"" and other feminine names that are commonly used toward women. The situation reportedly boiled over just several days into Nelson's employment, resulting in Nelson's firing just four weeks after beginning work at the restaurant.

The restaurant owner reportedly told Nelson that the server had come off ""too strong too fast,"" was ""militant,"" had made people uncomfortable, and were not working well with the existing restaurant team.

Nelson later alleged discrimination on the basis of ""gender identity and expression,"" the CBC reported.

What did authorities say?

The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal handed down a decision last month finding the restaurant violated Nelson's human rights by not intervening quickly enough to ensure that staff used Nelson's preferred pronouns.

The tribunal also said Gobelle discriminated against Nelson.

In a 42-page ruling, tribunal member Devyn Cousineau said that ""pronouns are a fundamental part of a person's identity.""

""Using correct pronouns communicates that we see and respect a person for who they are,"" Cousineau wrote. ""Especially for trans, non‐binary, or other non‐cisgender people, using the correct pronouns validates and affirms they are a person equally deserving of respect and dignity.""

""When people use the right pronouns, they can feel safe and enjoy the moment,"" Cousineau added. ""When people do not use the right pronouns, that safety is undermined and they are forced to repeat to the world: I exist.""

Cousineau also awarded Nelson $30,000 in damages, one-third of which would be paid by Gobelle; the other two-thirds would be paid by the restaurant owners.

Cousineau also ordered ""mandatory training for all staff and managers about human rights in the workplace"" for the restaurant and told restaurant owners to update their employee policies to include a statement ""that affirms every employee's right to be addressed with their correct pronouns.""

Are pronouns fundamental to identity?

Perhaps someone should lend Cousineau a basic linguistics textbook.

Despite Cousineau claiming that ""pronouns are a fundamental part of a person's identity,"" pronouns are merely grammatical devices used in language to refer to nouns or noun phrases that have either been stated already or are assumed by context.

Pronouns, in fact, almost always have an antecedent, which is made clear by the context in which the pronoun is used.

In theory, languages do not need personal pronouns (I, me, you, he, him, she, her, it, we, us, they, them), the type of pronoun in contention here (as opposed to demonstrative or interrogative pronouns, for example). Many highly inflected languages, in fact, mostly use personal pronouns for emphatic purposes because verbal morphology encodes person and number (1st, 2nd, 3rd person and singular or plural). Using a personal pronoun becomes redundant.

English used to be highly inflected (Old English), but grammatical gender, cases, and complex verb conjugation dropped from the language over time. Because English verbs no longer encode person, it has thus become necessary to regularly use personal pronouns to clarify agency.

Personal pronouns, then, are not ""fundamental"" to a person's identity, dignity, or human rights.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/panel-rules-preferred-pronouns-human-rights,2021-10-04
"'Recipe for indoctrination and child abuse': 'Activist teachers' are having 'intimate' conversations on sex, gender with students as young as 6, parents' lawsuit claims","A group of eight parents recently filed a lawsuit against an Ohio school district claiming ""activist teachers"" were having ""intimate conversations"" with students as young as 6 years old about sex and gender, WBNS-TV reported.



What are the details?

The lawsuit accused Hilliard City School District teachers of taking steps to hide inappropriate conversations with students from parents and called the teachers' actions ""a recipe for indoctrination and child abuse.""

Josh Brown, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, explained that the parents are not seeking monetary damages but would like to see the district put an end to the inappropriate conversations about sex and gender.

""The district distinguishes as we do between counselors and teachers, counselors are supervised, they're trained to handle this. Teachers are being instructed by the teachers' union, specifically to hide this information from parents and how to do it,"" Brown said.

The parents' lawsuit argued that the sexual conversations with students have ""led to a very dangerous outcome.""

""The parents were contacted one day and told that the student was suicidal at school. And when they got to the school and talk to the social worker, they were told that the school was counseling and treating the child for gender dysphoria, and never informed the parent,"" Brown stated.

According to the lawsuit, several school officials were ""treating the daughter as a boy while their daughter was at school"" without the parents' knowledge or consent.

The complaint also seeks to put a stop to a survey given to students, which asked for the children's preferred pronouns while at school and their preferred pronouns when speaking to parents.

The parents' lawsuit sounded the alarm about a QR code on badges worn by some teachers, which linked to material providing ""instruction on sexual positions"" and book suggestions that are not approved by the district's standards. The ""I'm here"" badges, provided by the teachers' union, were worn to designate certain teachers as a ""safe person"" for LGBT+ students.

The district's response

In a Wednesday statement, Hilliard City School District Superintendent David Stewart said the parents' lawsuit is riddled with ""broad-brush accusations,"" ""misstatements of fact and mischaracterizations.""

However, Stewart confirmed several of the parents' claims.

Stewart acknowledged that some students were provided a survey asking for their preferred pronouns at school versus when speaking to parents. He noted that the district did not support the practice.

""Since that time, we have followed up and every teacher and administrator in every building should be aware of our guidance on this issue. While it may not be best practice, it is not illegal,"" Stewart said.

Stewart also confirmed that some teachers were wearing ""I'm here"" badges that included a QR code leading to ""objectionable material inappropriate for students."" However, Stewart argued that the QR code was on the back of the badge and, therefore, less visible to students. He added that he was unaware of any students accessing the badge's link.

""Any teacher who chose to wear one of the badges clearly understood that the resources at the link were intended for adults, not students,"" Stewart stated. ""The resources are provided for teachers' personal growth and professional development.""

Stewart and the union president decided that teachers could still wear the badges, but they must cover up the QR code.

The superintendent agreed with parents that only school counselors, not teachers, should be talking to students about medical or mental health. But, according to Stewart, in ""the single example cited in the lawsuit,"" the student's parents were informed by a ""professional social worker"" that the child was ""exhibiting the need for mental health counseling.""

""In Hilliard City Schools we work to prepare our students so that they are Ready for Tomorrow and we do this in partnership with students and their families. We will continue to do this for every child we serve, without exception,"" Stewart added.

Beloved children’s PBS cartoon features a main character who comes out as gay and marries his partner,"A cartoon character on government-funded PBS' hit kids' show ""Arthur"" has come out as gay, and the show's latest season shows the character marrying his male partner.

What are the details?

The namesake character's teacher, Mr. Ratburn, came out in the Season 22 premiere and married his partner.

The episode, which is titled, ""Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone,"" featured the couple's wedding.

According to TV Line, ""Arthur and his pals are shocked to discover that Mr. Ratburn is engaged.""

Arthur and company showed up to Mr. Ratburn's wedding, where they witnessed the nuptials.

The outlet reported that a 2005 episode of a related PBS show featured another gay character.

""A 2005 episode of the show's spinoff, 'Postcards From Buster,' found the titular rabbit visiting Vermont to learn how maple sugar is made,"" the outlet reported. ""While there, he met several children whose moms were lesbians, to which he commented, 'Boy, that's a lot of moms!'""

The show did not use LGBT terminology in either of the referenced episodes.

Anything else?

In 2005, PBS' former chief operating officer, Wayne Godwin, said gay characters would not necessarily have a place in the public television network's cartoons despite the 2005 episode of ""Postcards From Buster,"" which was not distributed to all markets.

""In fairness I would have to say a gay character is not one we would not include,"" he said at the time. ""The fact that a character may or may not be gay is not a reason why they should or should not be part of this series.""

Former Education Secretary Margaret Spellings spoke in opposition to the PBS program at the time and said that not all parents would want their children exposed to an LGBT lifestyle.

""The concern really was that there's a point where background [characters] becomes foreground,"" Godwin added. ""No matter if the parents were intended to be background, with this specific item in this particular program they might simply be foreground because of press attention to it and parental attention to it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pbs-cartoon-character-gay-wedding,2019-05-14
The PC police are going after Dave Chappelle over what he said in his latest Netflix comedy special,"Famed comedian Dave Chappelle is facing a lot of criticism over politically incorrect jokes he made in his latest Netflix stand-up special.

""Please f**king stop watching Dave Chapelle,"" tweeted a woman identifying as a transgender lesbian. ""The things he says get trans people murdered.""

Chappelle has been criticized previously for his transgender jokes, but he has fired right back against the culture of political correctness.

""What I didn't realise at the time was that I was breaking an unwritten and unspoken rule of show business,"" Chappelle said in the stand-up special titled, ""Sticks & Stones.""

""No matter what you do in your artistic expression, you are never, ever, allowed to upset the alphabet people,"" he continued. ""You know who I mean. Those people who took 20% of the alphabet for themselves. I'm talking about them Ls and Bs and Gs and the Ts.""

Chappelle was referring to the LGBT lobby, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.

""I feel bad for the Ts. But they're so confusing,"" he continued, ""the fact is if a person can be born in the wrong body, they have to admit that's a f***ing hilarious predicament.""

The LGBT news site Pink News describes the rest of the joke:

Chappelle then goes on to do a racist impression of a Chinese person, pretending that Chinese is ""how I feel inside"".

He continues in the same vein: ""Say Lebron James changed his gender… can he stay in the NBA? Or does he have to go to the WNBA, where he will score 800 points a game?""

Many transgender allies and advocates on social media account were offended by the jokes.

A Pennsylvania middle school reportedly tries to conceal student's gender preferences from their parents,"A middle school in Pennsylvania reportedly has been encouraging teachers to conceal a student’s preferred pronouns and gender preference from the student's parents.

The New York Post reported that an email conversation between teachers and a school counselor at the Charles F. Patton Middle School in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, revealed that the student “prefers the pronouns they/them.”

“She is fine too, but [the student] likes ‘they/them’ the best,” the school counselor said via email.

The educator also suggested that “if you are emailing home, it may be best to use she/her when referring to [the student].”

The teacher’s email reportedly contained “A Guide to Supporting Trans and Gender Diverse Students,” authored by the American Psychological Association.

Reportedly an email exchange also occurred between a school counselor and two teachers about a club at the Unionville High School called the “Gender Sexuality Alliance.”

The school website described the student organization as “a student-run club which provides a safe place for students to meet, support each other, talk about issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and work to end homophobia and transphobia.”

A counselor and teacher from the Charles F. Patton Middle School discussed how to start a similar club at their school or how they might be able to give their students the opportunity to attend Gender Sexuality Alliance meetings at Unionville High.

Emails also revealed that when an online assignment prompted a student to describe themselves as being ""pansexual,"" the school counselor encouraged the student’s teacher to “ask [the student] if they would be interested in starting some type of club or group to focus on LGBTQ+ topics/issues.”

Another teacher reportedly wrote, “Middle schoolers are NOT too young to know their sexual orientations and gender identities. LGBTQ-related content is age appropriate for them.”

Fox News reported that No Left Turn in Education, a group saying they “believe that K-12 education should be free from indoctrination and politicization,” heavily criticized the school’s actions.

The organization’s president, Dr. Elana Fishbein, said, “It is unconscionable for any teacher to go behind a parent's back to meddle in a child's mental, physical and emotional health. While us concerned parents get called domestic terrorists, it's the radical ideologues who actually threaten, harass, and intimidate parents who object to their woke agenda. No Left Turn in Education is standing up for these families and is holding officials accountable for enforcing the laws that are supposed to protect our kids.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pennsylvania-lgbt-middle-school,2022-05-09
Far-left PETA actually urges people to 'be more like Trump' — at least when it comes to pardoning turkeys,"The far-left People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is actually urging folks to ""just this once ... be more like"" President Donald Trump.

In the sense of pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys, at least — which Trump did Tuesday in the Rose Garden of the White House.

To get the word out, PETA put together 25,000 new #PETATrumpsThanksgiving coasters appearing this month at 10 high-traffic bars around the nation's capital, the animal rights organization said.

“Turkeys don't care what your political leanings are, but they're rooting for everyone to join in this Thanksgiving and save millions of birds' lives,"" PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said. “Let's vote for life and give thanks for all the delicious vegan holiday foods that offer the side benefit of good health.""

More from PETA:

At least 45 million turkeys are killed in the U.S. each year for Thanksgiving. In nature, these animals are protective and loving parents as well as spirited explorers who can roost in trees and run as fast as 25 mph. Turkeys in the wild can live up to 10 years, but those raised for food are normally slaughtered at 5 months old. The young birds are hung by their feet from metal shackles and dragged through an electrified bath. They're often still conscious when their throats are slit and they're dumped into scalding-hot water to remove their feathers.

Anything else?

The organization emphasizes that it ""does not directly or indirectly participate or intervene in any political campaign in support of or in opposition to any candidate for public office or any political party.""

Indeed, Newkirk wrote former President Barack Obama in 2012 asking him to do away with the turkey pardon as ""it makes light of the mass slaughter of some 46 million gentle, intelligent birds and portrays the United States' president as being in some sort of business partnership with the turkey-killing industry.""

""You understand so well that African-Americans, women, and members of the LGBT community have been poorly served throughout history,"" Newkirk wrote, ""and now I am asking you to consider other living beings who are ridiculed, belittled, and treated as if their sentience, feelings, and very natures count for nothing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peta-says-be-like-trump,2019-11-26
Pete Buttigieg's husband Chasten leads children in pledge of allegiance to LGBTQ flag,"A video clip of Chasten Buttigieg – the husband of Pete Buttigieg – leading children in a pledge to the LGBTQ flag has resurfaced and recently gone viral on social media.

Chasten was a guest counselor at the Iowa Safe Schools' Pride Camp in July 2019.

The husband of President Joe Biden's transportation secretary is seen on video leading children in a pledge to the rainbow flag – which is a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer pride.

Log Cabin Republicans of Richmond – the ""city's first and only group dedicated to representing LGBTQ conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom, and equality for all Americans"" – shared the controversial clip on Twitter.

""I pledge my heart to the rainbow of the not-so-typical gay camp,"" Chasten says in the same cadence as when reciting the American Pledge of Allegiance. ""One camp, full of pride, indivisible, with affirmation and equal rights for all.""

Then Chasten waves the LGBTQ flag above the heads of the teens – who put their rights hands over their hearts in the same manner as when pledging allegiance to the United States of America.

Culture Catch – a website that covers music, literature, film, art, and theater – reported that Chasten also participated in an activity of dressing potatoes up as drag queens at the camp with the minors.



That stage also included Chasten's visit to an LGBTQI camp for teens where he revealed: ""I went to a high school of 1500 kids, and nobody was out. It was extremely unsafe to be out . . . . I didn't even know anybody who may have been remotely gay."" If only he had had someone like Mayor Pete running for political office back then, life would have been so much easier. The campers concurred, and then they all got out their potatoes for Drag-tato Day and let loose with the makeup on the spuds. Chasten, too.

The video clip is from the ""Mayor Pete"" documentary that was released by Amazon Prime in November 2021 and followed Pete Buttigieg's failed presidential run in 2020.

The synopsis of the documentary:

Directed by Jesse Moss, ""Mayor Pete"" will take viewers inside Buttigieg’s headline-generating campaign to be the youngest U.S. President, providing an unprecedented intimacy with the candidate, his husband Chasten, and their team. The Amazon Studios documentary will show the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. during the earliest days of the campaign, through his unlikely, triumphant victory in Iowa and beyond — revealing what goes on inside a campaign for the highest office in the land, and how it changes the lives of those involved in it.

The movie review website Slant – whose writers ""have appeared on MSNBC, BBC, CNN, and NPR, and have written for the New York Times, the Village Voice, the Notebook, Reverse Shot, the Brooklyn Rail, Time Out New York, and other prominent publications"" – wrote a review of the documentary with the headline: ""'Mayor Pete' Pledges Sycophantic Allegiance to Personality Over Politics.""

The review claims that the documentary provides a ""cognitively dissonant portrait of U.S. politics"" and ""the film's approach is completely subsumed by the importance of the Mayor Pete persona as the means and ends of the candidacy, and particularly the relevance of Buttigieg’s status as the first openly gay candidate seeking a major party's nomination."" The site gave ""Mayor Pete"" one and a half stars out of four.

""Mayor Pete"" has a 54% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.5 rating out of a possible 10 on IMDb.

"Pete Buttigieg says he's steering clear of LGBT media because it's all 'too gay, not gay enough, wrong kind of gay'","South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg might be gay, but he doesn't read any LGBTQ media — mainly because he doesn't fit into any particular LGBT box.

What are the details?

Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate, told SiriusXM's Clay Cane that access to power is neither masculine nor feminine when it comes to gayness.

""I'm sure you've heard this before in LGBT circles that more masculine-presenting men have more access [to power],"" Cane said. ""How different would it be if you were quote-unquote more effeminate?""

Buttigieg responded by pointing out that he doesn't even give it thought, and would rather prefer to avoid media speculating about the degrees of his gayness.

""It's tough for me to know, because I just am what I am, and there's going to be a lot of that,"" he said. ""That's why I can't even read the LGBT media anymore, because it's all 'too gay,' 'not gay enough,' 'wrong kind of gay.' All I know is that life became a lot easier when I just started allowing myself to be myself. I'll let other people write up whether I'm 'too this' or 'too that.'""

Has there been much response from the gay community?

Phillip Picardi, Out magazine's editor-in-chief, was one person to address Buttigieg's remarks.

""When LGBTQ+ journalism is dwindling despite our rights being threatened at higher rates, why come for queer media?"" Picardi complained on Twitter.

Zach Stafford, the Advocate's editor-in-chief, placed the blame on mainstream media instead.



On Twitter, he wrote, ""Pete says LGBTQ media is to blame for the pieces dissecting whether he is 'gay enough' or not. However, those two big pieces were in Slate and The New Public. Not LGBTQ media.""

Chris Johnson, chief political and White House reporter for the Washington Blade, also addressed the Democrat's remarks.

""It's funny. I'd have thought the phrase 'I can't even read the LGBT media' would be something Trump would say as variation of his denunciation of 'Fake News.' But Trump didn't say that. It was Pete Buttigieg, a gay presidential candidate,"" he tweeted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-says-hes-steering-clear-of-lgbt-media,2019-09-19
Netflix posts blasphemous 'gay Jesus' Christmas film; Christians worldwide push petition demanding its removal,"Netflix is facing backlash for streaming a Brazilian parody film that portrays Jesus Christ as a homosexual, with more than 1 million signing a petition for its removal.

As of Friday afternoon, 1.4 million people had signed the Change.org petition for Netflix to remove ""A Primeira Tentação de Cristo,"" or ""The First Temptation of Christ,"" the petition suggesting the movie has ""seriously offended Christians.""

TRAILER - A PRIMEIRA TENTAÇÃO DE CRISTO (ESPECIAL DE NATAL - NETFLIX) youtu.be

What are the details?



A brief description for the film on Netflix's website says: ""Jesus, who's hitting the big 3-0 brings a surprise guest to meet the family. A Christmas special so wrong, it must be from comedians Porta dos Fundos.""

The trailer, shown on Netflix with captions in English, shows characters representing Jesus and his supposed gay lover coming home late at night only to find family and friends have gathered for a surprise party. The character representing Jesus attempts to push his companion back outside through the door to conceal his secret.

According to the LGBT site Pink News, Porta dos Fundos, which literally means ""back door,"" is a five-person comedy group from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who began by making sketches and parodies on their YouTube channel.

It is not the first time the comedy group has made a blasphemous film about Christianity. Last year, Porta dos Fundos released a film — which was also featured on Netflix — called ""The Last Hangover,"" which spoofed ""The Hangover.""

The film portrayed Jesus' disciples waking up to a missing Jesus and scrambling to piece together the events from the Last Supper the night before. That film won an international Emmy for best comedy.

The film has been hotly criticized

The film has been received with sharp criticism in Brazil, whose population consists of 90 percent professing Christians.

""It is a serious offense against Jesus Christ and the Christians! It has no historical evidence to support the insinuations presented,"" one petitioner said, according to Pink News.



""A movie that came to destroy the image of Christ who gave His life to save us. Netflix has featured series that the family can't join to watch. God created man and woman and no one can change that,"" another petitioner said.

Brazilian actor Carlos Vereza took to Facebook to call the film ""trash-porn"" and the filmmakers ""pretentious idiots"" who are bent on the ""deconstruction of family and religion.""

How did the filmmarkers respond?

The filmmakers responded to the petition calling the criticism ""tragic"" and ""sad,"" according to Yahoo News.

""Porta dos Fundos values artistic freedom and humor through satire on the most diverse cultural themes of our society and believes that freedom of expression is an essential construction for a democratic country,"" the group said in a statement.

The film was released on Netflix on Dec. 3 and is available to U.S. Netflix subscribers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/petition-remove-gay-jesus-film-from-netflix,2019-12-13
Poll finds American opinions about gender are changing — but not in favor of far-left agenda,"The number of Americans who believe that gender is ""assigned at birth"" — contra the pro-transgender narrative — has grown in recent years, according to a new survey.

What are the details?

While pro-trans rhetoric has reached a fever pitch over the last several years, fewer Americans are buying into the idea that gender is unrelated to biological sex.

A new Pew Research survey — based on interviews with 10,188 U.S. adults in May 2022 — found that 60% of Americans believe gender ""is determined by their sex assigned at birth.""

That is an increase from 56% in June 2021 and 54% in September 2017, which suggests that forcing Americans to accept the pro-trans narrative is backfiring.

Still, the survey showed that nearly 8 in 10 American adults believe transgender people face discrimination, and a majority (64%) support laws that would protect transgender people from discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces.



Interestingly, the survey also showed that a majority of American adults (58%) support ""proposals that would require transgender athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth."" On the other hand, just 17% of Americans reject such proposals, while 24% told Pew Research they neither support nor oppose them.

More Americans also support laws prohibiting physicians from helping children undergo gender transition than oppose them (46% to 31%).

Did political affiliation make a difference?

Unsurprisingly, the results predictably fell down party lines.

From Pew Research:

Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party are more than four times as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that a person’s gender can be different from the sex they were assigned at birth (61% vs. 13%). Democrats are also much more likely than Republicans to say our society hasn’t gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender (59% vs. 10%). For their part, 66% of Republicans say society has gone too far in accepting people who are transgender.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pew-research-survey-transgender-american-views,2022-06-29
Photo shows Drag Queen Story Hour performer in miniskirt exposing crotch as children sit close by,"A photograph shows a miniskirt-wearing Drag Queen Story Hour performer with an exposed crotch as children sit close by, according to a writer who attended the event earlier this month at Ridgedale Library in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and took the photo.

Anne Taylor noted in her Caffeinated Thoughts piece that about 22 children — ranging in age from infant to toddler, preschooler, and elementary schooler — were in attendance, along with adults.

Then what?

Taylor said performer Sasha Sota — who wore a pink miniskirt, spiked heels, and a shirt with an exposed midriff — ""strode in suggestively past the children, sitting down in a chair before several preschool-aged girls with his legs spread wide, exposing his nylon-covered crotch in front of children sitting at eye level. We noticed that he did this often while reading nervously before the children.""

Image source: Anne Taylor (used by permission)

Taylor noted that the librarian hosting the event reminded the adults that they are role models for the children and that “if anyone gets upset — even grownups — you can leave.""



She added that afterward Sasha Sota approached her and thanked her for attending:

He quickly sat down next to me on a stool. So I inquired how he got started in drag. He told me he loved theatre, and this is merely a way for him to stay connected. I asked, “All the time?"" He responded, “Oh, Yes! I'm in college studying theatre."" Taking note of how he nervously kept flipping back his wig, I inquired what he thought of children. He quickly responded, “Oh! I love children!""



I will point out that not all Drag Queens are pedophiles or convicted sex offenders. Being in theatre during my college years, I noticed that dressing in drag was viewed as an easy out where one could justify these individuals are merely ""practicing their craft."" What you don't see behind the act and the makeup is very dark: self-abuse, drugs, alcohol, and a lot of sex. That IS the nature of the drag community, period.

What did the library have to say?

TheBlaze on Tuesday reached out to Hennepin County Library for comment on the Oct. 17 event. Here's the library's full statement:

Storytime Together with Drag Performers is a relatively new program in the Hennepin County Library system and elsewhere. Drag performers historically were leaders in the fight for equality — including them in LGBT History Month observances is meant to both honor the history and provide a welcoming space for families who may not otherwise see themselves reflected in our public places.



We are all still learning — and unfortunately making mistakes. Most storytime performances involve a performer in brilliantly colored costume and theatrical makeup. They read books and share songs about characters who are different in some way, and who learn to accept and celebrate differences in themselves and others.



Every performance is different. That allows for a new show every day, but also introduces the possibility of new mistakes.



Partway through this year's schedule, we realized the need for a performer dress code. We followed up right away with each of the performers to ensure that their costumes are appropriate for the audience and activity.

Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, especially from LGBT families. As we continue to be both innovative and inclusive, we are committed to also be good stewards of our public spaces.

Anything else?

The ""Today"" show was accused of altering photos of Thomas when airing a segment about the controversial University of Pennsylvania athlete. Last week, Thomas became the first transgender athlete to win a Division 1 national championship.

During a March 17 segment, ""Today"" aired an allegedly altered photograph that clearly feminized Thomas by softening the swimmer's features and giving Thomas the skin complexion of a woman. The same photograph was aired — unaltered — two weeks earlier during a broadcast on March 3.

What did the photographer saying?

Erica Denhoff, the photojournalist responsible for snapping the pictures, told the Washington Examiner that she concluded the editing was ""intentional.""

""When I first noticed the airbrushing on the segment referenced, I thought something was honestly wrong with the video. But then, I watched it again and thought, 'Wait a minute, this appears to be intentional. Lia's features are softened,'"" Denhoff said.

""I then went to my original photo, on the sites that they could access to license the photo, and compared it and immediately saw a difference,"" she explained.

Denhoff said that she had been ""following the news to see how my images have been used to tell Lia's story"" when she discovered the jarring edit.

""To me, it definitely seems like something was going on with the airbrushing/noise reduction of all of Lia's photos in this segment,"" she explained. ""My photo that they licensed was an authentic photo. I'm surprised and disappointed that Today altered my image of Lia for this particular news segment.""

What did NBC say?

Pizza Hut book club recommends drag queen books to young children,"Pizza Hut's book club for young students promotes books to pre-kindergarten children about little kids dressing up as drag queens.

The Pizza Hut Book It program started in 1984. The Camp Book It program provides children with a free pizza if they complete a monthly reading goal.

The Libs of TikTok Twitter account revealed that the Pizza Hut book club recommends that young children read books about drag queens.

The Book It website states, ""This June we are celebrating Pride Month and the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community. These three books explore the uniqueness of every person, celebrate our individuality and encourage kids to see that what makes us different, makes us special.""

The Pizza Hut book club proposes that pre-K through third grade children read the ""Big Wig"" book.

Publisher Simon & Schuster describes ""Big Wig"" as an ""irrepressible"" picture book that ""celebrates drag kids, individuality, and self-confidence from the perspective of a fabulous wig!""

""When a child dresses in drag to compete in a neighborhood costume competition, he becomes B. B. Bedazzle! A key part of B.B. Bedazzle’s ensemble is a wig called Wig,"" the description reads. ""Together they are an unstoppable drag queen team! But Wig feels inadequate compared to the other, bigger wigs. When Wig flies off B. B.’s head, she goes from kid to kid instilling confidence and inspiring dreams in those who wear her.""

For children pre-K through first grade, the Book It program advocates the ""Be Amazing: A History of Pride"" book. The book is written by Desmond Is Amazing – a boy who started attending drag shows at 5 years old and performed a drag show in front of adults at a gay bar at age 11.

The book description reads, ""In 'Be Amazing,' drag kid Desmond is Amazing walks you through the history of the LGBTQ community, all while encouraging you to embrace your own uniqueness and ignore the haters.""

The book club suggests children in kindergarten through third grade read ""Pride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag."" The description says the book ""will help young readers understand pride and diversity as they learn about Harvey Milk and his fight for equality.""

For the same age bracket of children, Book It recommends ""Stonewall: A Building. An Uprising. A Revolution.""

""This is a picture book about the Stonewall uprising and the beginnings of the battle for LGBTQ+ rights,"" the description reads. ""Told from the point of view of the Stonewall Inn, a place where 'being different was accepted.' This book provides an important example of standing up for all people and their rights.""

Last year for Pride month, the Book It program promoted LGBTQ-themed books such as ""My Princess Boy,"" about a young boy who wears dresses and tiaras.

Pizza Hut's book club also advocates for young children to read ""Old Enough to Save the Planet,"" to ""inspire students to look at their own communities and make a difference. Learn about 12 student activists who are working on climate change in their communities.""

Another climate change activism book is ""Kids Who Are Changing the World,"" a book that highlights ""stories of individuals who have fought climate change and pollution.""

For pre-K through third grade children, Pizza Hut's book club recommends a book that offers kids ""more than 40 different activities that are all about activism, politics and the governmental process.""



The children's book club endorses ""She Persisted,"" which was ""inspired by the #1 New York Times bestseller 'She Persisted' by Chelsea Clinton and Alexandra Boiger comes a chapter book series about women who stood up, spoke up and rose up against the odds.""

Pizza Hut's book club plugged ""Kamala Harris: Rooted in Justice.""

Pizza Hut is owned by Yum! Brands – a Louisville-based restaurant conglomerate that operates more than 54,000 restaurants in over 155 countries and territories. Yum! Brands also owns KFC and Taco Bell.



Taco Bell is hosting multiple ""Drag Brunch"" events at restaurants around the U.S. this summer.

In 2021, Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs told the Wall Street Journal, ""We're excited about working with the Biden administration and share their goal to build back better particularly as it comes to the economy and fighting inequality.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pizza-hut-book-club-drag-queens,2022-06-03
Playboy releases October cover featuring a man dressed in women's lingerie and heels,"Gay Filipino social media influencer Bretman Rock, 23, has taken the cover of Playboy's 2021 digital issue.

The men's lifestyle magazine in 2020 featured singer-songwriter Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio on a cover, making him the first ever male cover star aside from the magazine empire's founder, the late Hugh Hefner.

What are the details?

Playboy debuted the cover on Friday and in a tweet captioned it, ""It's Bretman, bitch. Introducing the October 2021 digital cover with icon @bretmanrock.""

Rock on the cover can be seen dressed as a Playboy bunny, wearing bustier-style lingerie, towering platform-style heels, black bunny ears, a bowtie, and a cottony white tail.

Rock is gay, according to Pink News, and told the magazine, ""For Playboy to have a male on the cover is a huge deal for the LGBT community, for my brown people community and it's all so surreal. A total 'Is this even f***ing happening right now?' type of vibe. And I'm so pretty.""

The social media star has been the recipient of multiple awards, including a People's Choice award for ""Beauty Influencer"" as well as an award for ""Breakthrough Social Star"" at the 2021 MTV Movie and TV Awards.

What else is there to know about Rock?

According to Yahoo! News, the 23-year-old influencer rose to notoriety on YouTube and Vine for his beauty and makeup content.

Rock ended up releasing his own makeup line and ended up starring in a YouTube-streamed MTV reality show about his fame journey.

In 2019, Rock appeared as the cover model of Gay Magazine.

Teen Vogue reports that Rock in September — following a much-talked-about front row presence at New York Fashion Week — wore the same Robert Cavalli dress that late R&B superstar Aaliyah popularized in 2000.

Of the iconic dress, Rock said, ""We pulled it from a Roberto Cavalli archive. ... He just let me borrow it for the night. I like to pretend that it still smells like Aaliyah and I just hope that Aaliyah is looking down at this little brown Phillipino boy giving her dress justice 21 years later.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/playboy-october-cover-man-lingerie-heels,2021-10-04
Playing video games for a living? Inside the life of a Twitch streamer,"Sam Brown wakes up before the crack of dawn every day and begins getting ready for work. Like most people, he showers and trims his beard and does more to make himself presentable (albeit in a very different way) than the average Manhattan lawyer. He spends time reading about business trends affecting his trade. He drinks coffee and also prepares himself a GFuel, the beverage that is one of the primary sponsors of his livelihood. And he spends time every morning getting himself mentally ready for what he knows will be a grueling day ahead.

Brown has a serious job to do. He has video games to play. And for Brown, who streams daily under the internet name Hambinooo, video games are a serious business.

Brown, who just turned 27, is just at the right age to properly understand the amazement most middle-aged people have about the very concept that people would be paid professionally to stream video of themselves playing video games.

Brown's own father was an ardent video gamer, but when he was growing up as a teenager, his father constantly stressed to him the importance of getting a ""real"" job and focusing on video games as little as possible.

""My old man, even though he was a gamer himself, if he caught me playing too much video games, he would give me the, you know, 'go outside and mow the lawn or learn to something productive with your life' speech. Back in that day, even when I was a teenager, the idea that someone would pay you to play video games, no matter how good you were, was completely unheard of. No one even considered that someday it might happen.""

How does someone end up as a video game streamer?



Brown attempted to go the standard route himself.

""My family was big on traditional education. I have family members who went and got degrees from prestigious colleges like Stanford,"" Brown said. ""And that was what was expected, you go to college, you get a degree, then you get yourself a respectable job, and that's how it goes.""

However, he soon realized that the ""standard route"" was not for him.

""One day I just woke up and realized, you know, I'm not going to be in finance. I'm not going to do that with my life. And I'm not going to put myself hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt for a degree I'm not going to use. My generation was one of the first ones that was hit really hard with the conviction that for a lot of people, it's a scam, and it just ends up with you paying off massive student loans for the rest of your life for something you don't need or want,"" Brown says.

Even after leaving college, though, Brown still wasn't ready to take the plunge and attempt to become a professional gamer, which was just then becoming a thing, so he apprenticed at a hair salon with a buddy in New York for about a year, cutting hair for big name clients and preparing for life as a stylist.

But then, rather than go to college or continue as a hair stylist, Brown took a humongous risk on himself and decided to roll the dice on a career that would have been impossible to conceive of five years ago: a career as a professional video game player.

He and some friends decided to make a go of it on the pro circuit of the battle royale shooter PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (known in the gaming world as PUBG). They ground it out in ""scrims"" — gamer shorthand for scrimmages — for months until they finally broke into the pro scene with the gaming organization Lazarus. But for all but a select few who are lucky enough to sign with a well-funded organization, being a pro gamer offers a subsistence and quality of life level that is probably equivalent to a lower-level minor league baseball player. So in late 2018, Brown made another huge bet on himself and decided to quit professional gaming and make a go of it as a content creator.

For Brown, the gamble was more than just a gamble on a new career, it was a gamble on a whole new location, far away from his family and friends:

""I had to literally move to Raleigh, North Carolina, a place I had never been and a place I had never even seen, just because I knew I couldn't afford to live in a place as expensive as New York or New Jersey,"" Brown says. ""So I uprooted myself and my girlfriend came with me, and we moved to Raleigh just because it was cheap, and we knew we were taking a risk, and it wasn't one we could afford to take there.""

Brown is one of the lucky ones. After weeks and months of streaming for 10 hours a day to an audience of just a handful of people, his channel has taken off. He now has over 27,000 followers on Amazon-based Twitch, along with over 3,500 subscribers, which puts him comfortably in the range of mid-level streamers who can make a real living at it without getting rich ... yet.

Is this a real job?

And while Brown is obviously having fun at what he does, you shouldn't get it twisted: It is work. Hard work. Imagine the work that goes into producing a three-hour talk-radio show every day. The industry standard for talk radio is to have about 44 minutes of content per hour — the rest taken up by commercial breaks, traffic updates, and the like.

Brown essentially does a 10-hour talk-radio show every day, without commercial breaks, while playing one of the most demanding video games ever invented at a high level. He engages with the people who are watching him in the twitch chat, just like a radio host takes calls. He answers the same questions what seems like three dozen times a day:

""How did you get started streaming?"" ""What headset are you using?"" ""What's your favorite weapon in the game?""

He answers them all, over and over, with patience and a positive attitude, always treating each person like they are the first person to ask him that question. The amount of sheer talking he does requires him to go through gallons of water each day on stream. He does this six or sometimes seven days a week, which doesn't count the amount of time he spends talking with current and potential sponsors, networking with other streamers, and working on his craft. At the end of the day, he puts in easily the same intense 70-plus hour work load as an attorney grinding to make partner.

If Brown's schedule is grueling, streamer Cody Moczygemba — who streams under the name Moczy — is borderline insane, a marvel even among people who habitually work long hours and are used to being derided as people who ""play video games for a living."" A short stream for Moczy goes 18 hours. On a regular basis he streams for 24 consecutive hours at a time.

Moczy personally doesn't understand the fuss.

""I relate it to a normal person [who] gets up goes to work, right? That's eight or 10 hours. Then they come home, spend time with their friends or family, socialize, whatever, so that's another couple hours,"" Moczygemba says. ""Then they spend another couple hours doing what they want to do, which is maybe playing video games another couple hours. At the end of the day, we all spend 18 hours doing something — I just wrap it all up into one thing. I'm doing it all at once, and I do it all online.""

Like Brown, the San Antonio-based Moczygemba took a huge gamble on himself a couple years ago, abandoning a potential career in computer science in an attempt to make a go as a content creator:

""I was in college at the University of Texas San Antonio for computer science,"" Moczygemba says. ""And I had always known or felt like I wanted to do something with video games. I was always good at video games and really liked them. So I thought maybe I would make video games. But then when this streaming thing came up, I decided that I would give this an honest shot and see how it goes.""

The live content creator poses an existential threat to Hollywood

Brown and Moczygemba are part of the vanguard of a kind of content creator that poses an existential threat to the entertainment industry as we know it — a threat that the entertainment industry frankly does not even see coming.

Time was, people had to choose their entertainment from whatever palate the Hollywood industrial complex decided to produce. You turned on your TV, chose from a preset number of channels, and that was it.

Now, the average person under the age of 20 probably hasn't turned on a television in years. They infrequently go to movie theaters. They don't even watch Netflix or Hulu or Amazon streaming shows. They watch YouTubers, and Twitch streamers, and content that is made by ordinary people, often in their own home studios. Hollywood continues to produce more elaborate and costly content for Gen X and the baby boomers, but in 20 years or maybe less, they will find themselves shunted aside by a kind of content they don't even understand, much less credit.

If you fire up the Amazon-based Twitch, you will be confronted by a dizzying array of content possibilities, as varied as the people who create it. The biggest titles at the moment are ""battle royale"" games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and PUBG — all of which feature some variation of a Hunger-Games-esque be-the-last-man-standing motif. But you'll also find millions of people watching Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, or MOBA, games like League of Legends or Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft.

Older games like Grand Theft Auto V and League of Legends still have a huge following. Some streamers amass huge audiences playing truly old school original Nintendo games like Contra and Super Mario Brothers and finishing them at dizzying speed. At any given time, you'll find someone who has thousands of viewers playing AutoChess, which is... not really chess, and can't really be explained unless you watch it for yourself.

You'll find an equally divergent assortment of personalities playing these games. Fortnite whiz Tfue trash talks the dozens of ""plebs"" he blows away during every match. Variety streamer Herschel ""Guy"" Beahm dons the persona of a 1980s pro wrestler as Dr. Disrespect — loud, brash, intentionally campy and over the top. Michael Grzesiek, known as Shroud, has amassed a truly enormous following — over 6.5 million at last count — in spite of a low-key, borderline droll personality. Jake ""chocoTaco"" Throop streams as your dad, if your dad was really nice, into low-key music, and also really, really good at video games.

What about all the toxicity in video games?



Brown and Moczygemba are part of a rising cadre of streamers that cater to an audience that is tired of ""toxicity"" in video games.

""For a long time, there's been a stigma attached to video games, you know?"" Brown muses. ""A large part of that is the stuff people say to one another during video games. And that's just the anonymity of the keyboard and the mouse. People will say things to you using that anonymity that they would never say if they had to use their real name, much less say to your face. It's on the gaming community to change that stigma by their own behavior and part of that is on us as streamers to show the way.""

This is, surprisingly, easier said than done. The most mild-mannered person in the world will lose his temper sometimes if things are not going well during a video game. Playing video games on camera, in front of the entire world, for 50 hours a week, without losing your temper, is a nearly impossible proposition. It takes effort and control. But for the sake of the industry, some streamers believe it's important to try.

""I think, some people, if they can't get themselves in the right frame of mind mentally to handle the grind of streaming [without toxicity], they shouldn't be streaming, you know? There's no secret sauce to it,"" Brown says. ""You have to just make it a decision. You're going to make mistakes, but before you fire up the stream, you have to just get yourself in the mentality that you're going to do your stream right. And if you can't, maybe you shouldn't stream that day.""

The light dawned for Moczygemba in a different way.

""I used to be different, I used to not care what kind of language I was using and I let it all hang out,"" Moczygemba says. ""Then one day I was watching chocoTaco, and someone came in and sent him a message that said, 'I really appreciate your stream, my son and I watch it together and it's a great way for us to bond.' And that really struck me. And I thought to myself, 'Would most dads say that if they came to my stream and watched it?' Probably not, at that time. So I decided to change.""

Any parent who has ever stood over their kid's shoulder while they were playing online video games and watched or listened to the stream of toxicity can relate. And beyond the concern that parents have about what their kids are being exposed to, there's also the fact that it makes games less fun to play.

Moczygemba is concerned that if the community cannot clean up its act, then it will cease to be relevant:

""People are often toxic because they're competitive, right? They can't keep a lid on their competitiveness. So, they're mad because maybe they're trying to get ranked in a given game,"" Moczygemba says. ""But what they don't think about is, what if they are toxic to everyone along the way? They make the game less fun. And sure they might end up on the leaderboards, but they're going to be on the leaderboards of a dead game, because everyone who's playing it will have left because of the toxic behavior of other people who play it. So it's not very smart.""

Understanding the business of streaming. How do these people make money?



Moczygemba's concern reflects a growing level of business savvy from people who have learned that there's money to be had, if the leading lights of the industry play their cards right.

Streamers — at least on the Amazon-based Twitch — make money from a variety of sources. First, their viewers just flat out donate money, as appreciation for generating content. Second, for $5, you can get a monthlong subscription to a given streamer on Twitch, which allows you to watch that streamer without ads and also use their preset unique collection of emotes, and some portion of that goes to the streamer (with the rest, of course, going to Twitch). Third, the streamers get a portion of the advertising revenue Twitch gets from their non-subs. And fourth, of course, are sponsorships.

Computers and video games are a huge industry. The video game industry generated $43 billion in revenue in 2018, up an astounding 18 percent from 2017, according to reports. That figure is likely dwarfed by the revenue generated from the sale of the hardware that the games are played on, including high-end PCs, gaming keyboards, mice, headsets, monitors, and the like.

The computer industry, at least, has realized the potential that streamers have as influencers. Any streamer that pulls in over 50 viewers at once is sponsored by a dizzying array of products. ChocoTaco uses Logitech keyboards. Hambinooo uses Steelseries headphones. And on and on.

And of course, everyone is sponsored by GFuel, the ubiquitous sugar-free energy drink powder that has become a company that generates tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue almost exclusively by advertising to the gaming community — in fact, GFuel even markets flavors and products that are specific to your favorite streamer or esports team: Dr. Disrespect's Black on Blackberry. FaZe Clan's Battle Juice. Team Kaliber's Twisted Kandy. Or, if you prefer, you can go with plain old Pink Grapefruit.

The power of earned influence in the video game world cannot be overstated, and the temptation for undisclosed payola has led to considerable controversy in the gaming world. People want to use the same equipment as their favorite streamer, perhaps in the belief that it will help them play Fortnite or PUBG like he does. They also want to play the same games. If someone like chocoTaco or Shroud plays a game on stream, that can make the difference between a game surviving or dying, particularly for a small, independent gaming studio. Controversial Swedish gamer PewDiePie was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine in 2016 — probably for good reason.

Many streamers are conscientious of the power of their opinions and are scrupulous about disclosing when they are sponsored. Often you will see it disclosed in huge capital letters on the title of the stream itself: ""SPONSORED STREAM: Playing the new Call of Duty"" or something similar.

""I'm always careful to disclose when I'm doing something sponsored,"" Moczygemba says. ""And I love it when I have that opportunity because to me it feels like I can tell the community that I'm already being compensated for this time, so they shouldn't feel compelled to donate subs or make donations or whatever. I can be, like, 'No, guys, thank you for your generosity but this has been covered.'""

Others, however, may not be so scrupulous, and there's nothing that forces streamers to make these disclosures. At the end of the day, it's just their own reputation for honesty that's on the line.

What's it like to have your whole livelihood wrapped up in a 'censorship industry'?

One active concern among streamers is the stranglehold Twitch has had on the industry. That stranglehold was threatened earlier this month when Microsoft-backed streaming service Mixer announced that it had poached one of Twitch's largest streamers — Fornite savant Tyler Blevins, who streams under the pseudonym Ninja.

According to Blevins, he earned more than $10 million streaming on Twitch in 2018. For those who are keeping track, that is about four times what the average NFL player makes in a season. While the financial terms of Blevins' deal have not been disclosed, some streamers have openly mused that Microsoft must have dangled several multiples of $10 million in order to entice him to leave the security of Twitch. The massive play was an earth-shattering move in the streaming industry and announced that Twitch may finally have a meaningful competitor.

The budding competition between Twitch and Mixer has both positive and negative possibilities for streamers. On the one hand, both Brown and Moczygemba admitted some level of anxiety about having so much of their livelihood tied up in a company (Twitch) over which they have no control — and which might well ban them or deplatform them if they say or do the wrong thing on stream.

The threat is not an idle one. Canadian musician deadmau5 was also a popular video game streamer on Twitch before he was permanently banned from Twitch for saying ""f*g"" on stream. Dr. Disrespect recently earned a monthlong suspension for streaming from a public bathroom, and many streamers openly mused that if it had been a streamer with a smaller following than Doc's, it would have been permanent.

""I have always been aware that it's a censorship industry. From day one,"" Brown said. ""You always have to have it in your mind, and I always have, that my whole career — even my whole brand, if you can call it that — is dependent on what a moderation team of people from California who I don't know think of what I say or do on stream. So it's definitely an issue.""

The competition from Mixer means that big-name streamers, in particular, don't have to live in quite as much fear of Twitch moderation. And it also means that they have more bargaining power with Twitch in terms of asking for greater percentages of their subscription and ad revenue. However, it also potentially means that the streaming audience will be split. One of nice things about Twitch, for a streamer, is that all the other streamers are on Twitch. One of the main ways a streamer gains a new audience is by people surfing around Twitch while they are watching other popular streamers that they already follow.

In other words, the advent of Mixer might well be a boon for established streamers. But it might harm the growth of the smaller streamers who are trying to build an audience from scratch. Competition is almost always a good thing in any industry, but time will tell how this particular competition will shake out.

Can anyone really make a living as a professional streamer?

Of course, the advent of the professional video game streamer has caused no small amount of consternation in parents who are suddenly confronted with children who have a new excuse to keep playing video games for what is perhaps an unhealthy amount of time. They are practicing, see, so that they can be the next Ninja, or the next Tfue, or the next chocoTaco.

Now, not everyone has a realistic shot of being the next big name streamer. In the first place, video gaming — like any other physical endeavor — involves a certain amount of natural innate talent.

Anyone can certainly improve at any given video game with practice, but guys like Shroud and Ninja and chocoTaco rather obviously have some physical attributes — like reflexes, fine motor skills, and hearing, for example — that are off the charts. So in the same way that not everyone has a realistic shot of becoming an NFL player due to not being large enough, strong enough, or fast enough, not everyone has a realistic shot of possessing the elite gaming skills that are a prerequisite to building a large audience — which is to say nothing of having the kind of outgoing personality that builds a following.

But that won't stop many people from trying, even though the overwhelming majority of them sadly will fail. Just like most small businesses, the overwhelming majority of Twitch streamers never crack more than 10 concurrent viewers. The number who can build a regular following of several hundred, like Brown and Moczygemba, is easily less than one half of 1 percent. The number who can draw tens of thousands of viewers like Ninja, Shroud, Tfue and Dr. Disrespect, at least at present, can probably be counted on your fingers and toes.

And the work required to try is not for the faint of heart. For months, it will likely involve streaming to an audience of fewer than five, putting in countless hours of work for little or no reward, financial or otherwise. And, even if you do everything right, you need an astounding amount of luck.

Brown realizes that his success, and the speed at which he has achieved it, is not typical. Less than a year ago, he was streaming to an audience of sometimes fewer than a dozen people. Even after he quit his professional career and dedicated dozens of hours a week to streaming, he struggled to crack 50 concurrent viewers. Then, even though he never changed anything he was doing, one day the people started coming. Now, he regularly tops 1,000 concurrent viewers.

I asked him, ""Why is this happening? How have you succeeded where so many have failed?""

""I don't know, man."" Brown frankly responded. ""I really don't. I've even discussed this recently on calls with my business people and sponsors because they want to know and I don't know what to tell them. I'm doing the same things I've always done. I guess it's just like anything else, like being a musician or an artist, you don't have to just be good, you have to be lucky. You have to hope the universe rewards what you're putting out there and sometimes it doesn't. I've been lucky that it has in my case.""

Sounds like a sweet existence, though. Is it?



Some parts of it can be nice, once you reach the top. But the effort required to get there can be brutal and lead to a lonely existence. Moczygemba frankly admitted that his decision to become a full-time streamer led to the dissolution of his engagement with his longtime girlfriend, who couldn't believe that his dream was realistic or cope with his streaming schedule.

As research for this article, I watched several hours of Moczy's stream. By all accounts, he appears to be a perfectly presentable young man, with a trademark shock of fashionable blonde hair. He is funny, engaging, and intelligent. Based on his Twitch statistics, I can infer that he makes a decent living.

Assuming that he lived an active dating life now, I asked him, ""So how does that conversation go now, when you date? When you go on that first date and the question inevitably comes up, 'What do you do for a living,' how do you explain that?""

Without a touch of sadness or regret, he answers, ""You know, I'm really just not dating now. I'm not even trying at the moment. If I were to find someone, I would have to explain to them that my schedule is my schedule, and this stream is my life, and they would have to understand that. There aren't many people who can get behind that. So if it happens, it happens.""

Moczygemba has no regrets, however.

""Honestly, the most surprising thing to me about this whole experience is how many great friends — and I do mean true friends — I have made doing this. I wouldn't trade it for the world,"" he says.

Still, Brown — whose long-term girlfriend Alyssa is his marketing partner and an ever-present force in his chat and social media presence — seems to be the exception rather than the rule. The stigma associated with being a professional gamer is lessening, but it still exists. Rare is the romantic partner or potential partner who will stand by while someone explains that they are going to quit their paying job and stream themselves playing video games to 10 or 15 people at a time in the hopes that someday they can build an audience that might someday help support a family.

Which is why, for every Sam Brown who takes the plunge whole hog, there's a dozen Adam Van den Booms, grinding away a full time day job and then coming home and putting in hours of time trying to build a name as a streamer. Taking the plunge can be a terrifying experience, especially for people who have other jobs that do put food on the table.

And when that magic day does come, the fame itself comes with a price. As with any other industry that produces any amount of fame, the people who do not succeed often feel extraordinarily jealous. Unlike other industries, streaming video games on the internet allows for people to act on that jealousy in ways that can be harmful to the star.

The most frequent manifestation of this is the bane of every professional video game streamer: the stream sniper. Because these video games are streamed in real time, that presents an opportunity for people to intentionally get in the same match as a famous streamer and then use information gained from watching them on stream to know where their location is — a practice known as stream sniping.

Obviously, this gives the stream sniper an enormous competitive advantage over the streamer, particularly in battle royale games where knowing your opponent's location is at least half of winning a battle against them. The practice is widely considered unethical in the gaming world (and it can get you banned from both Twitch and most video game servers if you are conclusively caught), but the temptation for some is too great. Everyone wants to post their own clip on YouTube of the time they killed chocoTaco in PUBG, or the time they owned Tfue in Fortnite. So as a streamer grows in popularity, they have to face an increasing barrage of opponents who are essentially very determined, fame-hungry cheaters.

The frustration with stream snipers can very easily boil over when the streamer sees the same person cheating against them over and over. In fact, frustration over possible stream sniping led to the outburst that got deadmau5 banned for life. The full quote, in fact, was, ""f***ing c**k-sucking stream sniper f*g.""

Sometimes, the stream sniping goes beyond mere cheating for fame. Sometimes, it progresses into threatening comments and worse. Hackers have even engaged in DDoS attacks against the IP addresses of servers that chocoTaco plays on, ruining his ability to play the game for days at a time.

The level of negative attention the big level streamers receive causes many of them to exercise extreme caution with revealing even the most banal details of their personal lives. Rewind several weeks, and chocoTaco is streaming. Someone in chat asks, ""Where do you get your hair cut?""

""Where do I get my hair cut?"" he repeats. He pauses, and considers. The pause draws out and becomes uncomfortably long for what ought to be a fairly simple response to an eminently simple query. ChocoTaco kills a couple of people. I actually wonder for a moment if he has forgotten the question entirely. Finally, he settles on an answer, ""Um ... a place here in town."" It is an answer, but of course no answer at all. It is the answer of a man who has good reason to think carefully about revealing anything about his personal life to anyone online.

Then, of course, there is the sometimes brutal feedback from chat. While watching your favorite streamer, you can participate in their chat, and part of Twitch's ethos requires streamers to engage with their chat to at least some degree. ChocoTaco has spent thousands of hours of his life playing PUBG. He still spends over 40 hours a week playing it. Recently, he has taken up Fortnite occasionally as a change of pace. The constant barrage of negative comments from his chat every time he does so is truly appalling to behold — like Throop is their PUBG-playing monkey and the act of his playing a different game for a few hours has deprived them of something they are somehow entitled to.

The barrage of negative and sometimes insulting feedback from chat can be especially brutal for the relatively small population of streamers who are women. On the one hand, their chat fills up with lame come ons from obviously thirsty men, and on the other hand, they are often attacked by bitter people as being unworthy of the attention they receive.



Former model Avori, for instance, is an easy target for dismissal for many who don't look below the surface. She is bright, bubbly, and obviously good looking, which of course contributes to her appeal. When she streams PUBG, she has a neon pink sign with her name in the background. She frequently hums or sings the choruses of pop songs between matches (her chat jokingly asks for cotton for their ears during these interludes, in a running joke about her singing voice). Several months ago, she frequently groused on camera, ""I'm just not very good at this game.""

Of course, streaming, like any other kind of content, is about marketability. At the end of the day, what streamers are selling is a product, and the biggest part of that product is... themselves. There's no mystery here; Avori is putting out a great product that emphasizes what she's been given to work with — which, by the way, includes quite a lot of skill at playing video games. But that takes on a whole different connotation when women do it, even if they are obviously (like Avori is) a pretty darn good video player. If Dr. Disrespect is a little bit over-the-top on camera, and if there's a little more showmanship than you might otherwise get from a video game streamer, that's ""genius production value,"" but if you are a woman, you are instead ""an eThot.""

Then, of course, there is the boredom. Some streamers are lucky enough to maintain their audience no matter what game they play, but the vast majority of them are trapped by their audience into playing one particular game, 50 hours a week — against people who are for the most part of much lower skill level.

Rewind several weeks, and I find myself watching Tfue play Fortnite. An opponent approaches. ""Look at this guy,"" Tfue grunts, as he begins building an intricate structure around him. My untrained eye cannot tell anything about this random anonymous person's skill level, but in less than a second, Tfue has him sized up. ""Look at this guy,"" he repeats. ""Can you imagine losing to this guy?"" He continues building and editing an elaborate structure around him. ""Can you imagine actually losing to this guy? Can you imagine that actually happening to you?""

Finally, like a cat that gets bored with a mouse, he performs a final edit and mercifully ends the loser's misery. He slumps in his chair, and exits the game before it's even done. Then, for 30 minutes, he exits all competition and enters ""creative"" mode, just building structures by himself, a sullen glare on his face.

Many people criticize these occasional displays as abrasive and off-putting, but it's not that difficult to understand, in the end. If you paid Michael Jordan — and make no mistake, these gamers are every bit as competitive as Jordan — a good salary every year to dunk on middle-aged guys from the Y every day for 10 hours a day, he might be thankful for the paycheck, but he'd sure develop some contempt for his competition after a while. And one wonders how long he could keep it up, no matter how well he was paid.

Still, for those who can survive the grind, and block out the second-guessing and negativity, opportunity does await. Ninja will not be the last video game streamer who clears eight figures a year by streaming video games.

Already, parents are hiring video game coaches to teach their kids how to be better players in the hope that they will be either the next big streamer or the next big esports champ. Colleges have even begun offering esports scholarships.

Are some of these dreams unrealistic? Probably. Are they any more unrealistic than the millions of kids who have dreams of becoming rich playing professional sports? Probably not. In fact, they are probably less unrealistic in many cases. Of course, one principal difference between these unrealistic dreams is that in the case of the would-be athlete, the failed effort will get kids additional physical exercise, which research would suggest is much more beneficial for developing bodies than hours in front of a computer screen.

An industry under barrage after a series of mass murders

All of this, of course, occurs against the backdrop of a weekend of particularly horrendous violence in the United States, which the president of the United States blamed (at least in part) on video games. Although discussion of politics is more or less verboten in video game streaming world, when the leader of the free world shines a light on an issue, it brings a whole new level of attention to the problem.

And there is evidence that the spotlight is working. Walmart, for instance, refused to change their policy on gun sales, but didagree to remove violent video game displays from their stores.

The debate over the effects of violent video games is more or less tireless and is seldom informed by actual facts, because the facts themselves are not conclusive. There is some indication that video games, particularly in young people, is in fact correlated with increased aggression in play behaviors like kicking, hitting, and biting.

There is not, however, evidence that exposure to violent video games leads to actual violent criminal behavior in adults. Still other studies suggest that the very question itself puts the cart before the horse — which is to say that inherently aggressive or violent people seek out violent video games, not the other way around.

As with all things pertaining to the social sciences, the confident pronouncements of people who have so often and so recently had to admit error should be taken with several grains of salt. There is, at least, some level of inherent sense in the notion that playing video games in which you shoot people might lead people to imitate that behavior.

On the other hand, there's another level on which it doesn't. Probably the first video game to obtain mass popular culture status was Super Mario Brothers, and its emergence into the national consciousness did not lead to an increase in turtles being hit with hammers, or people attempting to jump unreasonable distances. Similarly, while first-person-shooter games are popular, so are games that feature unsafe driving of cars, or games where people hit each other with clubs or swords, and there has been a marked lack of concern about people attempting to model those behaviors after playing video games.

But when anything pertains to guns, people get weird. And so you have parents refusing to buy their kids toy guns only to see their kids fashion guns out of sticks anyway, or school kids being suspended from school because they chewed their pop tarts into the shape of a gun.

Streamers, who are conscious of the fact that they play to a worldwide audience, would likely retort that the largest video game markets aren't even in North America, but rather in Asia and Europe. Even within the context of North America, a disproportionate amount of video game talent and consumption occurs in Canada. And, of course, all of this ignores the somewhat salient fact that the actual number of mass shootings has remained relatively consistent over the last several decades, even since the introduction of the first person shooter with Id Software's game Wolfenstein in 1992.

Still, media attention on them, and the purported link to video games, has streamers who play these kinds of games feeling uneasy. But for now, their brand of content appears here to stay.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/playing-video-games-for-a-living,2019-08-12
Police arrest transgender activist for burning down own home in alleged hate crime hoax,"Police arrested a 54-year-old gay rights leader in Michigan for reportedly burning down his own home in August 2017 as a staged hate crime.

The fire killed five pets. No people were injured as a result of the fire.

What are the details?

After an investigation, authorities have accused Nikki Joly — who was once a local newspaper's Citizen of the Year — of setting the blaze that killed several animals in 2017.

Prior to the investigation, the local LGBTQ community celebrated Joly's efforts in helping to erect a community center for gay citizens, spearheading the creation of a gay pride parade, and even pushed for locals laws forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The incident was initially investigated as a hate crime, as Joly reported receiving threats in the days leading up to the fire.

Joly, a transgender activist in the area, reportedly burned his own residence down as a way to gain publicity and notoriety for his crusade of transgender activism.

Investigators said that Joly purchased $10 worth of gasoline on the day his rental house burned, and traces of gasoline were discovered on the activist's clothing. Gasoline was also discovered inside the home. Joly insisted that he purchased the gas to mow the lawn.

Also, the Metro reported that the loss of Joly's home prompted a $58,000 fundraiser to benefit him and his wife.

What else?

According to the report, Joly neither confirmed nor denied that he set the blaze to his home during an early police interview.

Joly, who appeared in court earlier in February, denied that he deliberately set the fire.

Daniel Barnett, Joly's attorney, said that it just wouldn't make sense for his client to do such a thing.

""He was citizen of the year,"" Barnett said. ""There was plenty of media coverage already before the fire.""

The case is ongoing. You can read more about the background here.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-arrest-transgender-activist-hate-hoax,2019-02-25
Police slap felony charge on man who did burnout on rainbow-painted street: 'Tear up that gay intersection',"A Florida man is facing harsh felony charges after he allegedly did a burnout over an intersection painted with rainbow colors in celebration of LGBT Pride Month.

What are the details?

While participating in a birthday celebration for former President Donald Trump last Monday, 20-year-old Alexander Jerich allegedly did a burnout with his truck on a newly painted rainbow street, WPTV-TV reported.

The incident happened in Delray Beach, Florida.

Video of the incident shows Jerich driving a white Chevy truck doing a burnout across the painted street. There is a blue ""Trump flag"" flying on the back of his truck.

More from WPTV:



According to Jerich's arrest report, a witness came forward on Wednesday and said he had attended the Trump birthday rally on Monday evening. The witness said he was two vehicles ahead of Jerich's truck, and he heard someone shout to Jerich, ""tear up that gay intersection."" The witness added that Jerich had a blue ""Trump flag"" leaning off the tailgate of his Chevy.

Jerich turned himself into police on Thursday, and he was booked in the Palm Beach County jail.

Police charged Jerich with criminal mischief over $1,000, reckless driving, and evidence of prejudice, which elevates the crime to a third-degree felony, WPTV reported.

Jerich was later released on $1,000 bond.

According to the Miami Herald, the LGBT mural ""was approved in December 2020 by city officials at a cost of $16,720... It was dedicated to the 49 lives lost in the Pulse nightclub shootings five years ago. The street painting, which covers the entire intersection, took several workers four days to complete.""

Anything else?

The Palm Beach Human Rights Council celebrated Jerich's arrest.

""BUSTED AND JAILED! Thank you Delray Beach Police Department for arresting Alexander Jerich and charging him with criminal mischief with evidence of prejudice (and reckless driving),"" the group wrote on Facebook.

Rand Hoch, president of the PBCHRC added in a statement, ""PBCHRC has requested the charges include defacing a memorial — a recently enacted law which would require this crime to be treated as a felony. If convicted of this offense, the perpetrator would be responsible for reimbursing the City of Delray Beach for the cost of repairing the damages in addition to the severe penalties for committing a felony.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-slap-felony-charges-on-man-who-did-burnout-on-rainbow-painted-street-tear-up-that-gay-intersection,2021-06-20
Policy letting transgender females compete against biological females now has prominent opponent: Attorney General William Barr,"TheBlaze last month highlighted a federal lawsuit filed by three biological female athletes who are challenging the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference's policy of letting biological males compete in girls' sports.

And now Selina Soule, Alanna Smith, and Chelsea Mitchell have a prominent ally: Attorney General William Barr.

What are the details?

Barr signed a ""statement of interest"" Tuesday arguing against the policy of the CIAC, the board that oversees the state's high school athletics, the Associated Press reported.

The conference lets athletes compete according to their identified genders and bases the policy on state law requiring schools to treat students similarly, the AP said. The CIAC also noted that its policy follows Title IX, the federal law that gives girls equal educational opportunities, including in athletics, the outlet added.

Hold on a sec

The Justice Department filing isn't down with that.

""Under CIAC's interpretation of Title IX, however, schools may not account for the real physiological differences between men and women. Instead, schools must have certain biological males — namely, those who publicly identify as female — compete against biological females,"" Barr and the other department officials wrote, according to the AP. ""In so doing, CIAC deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.""

What did the CIAC have to say?

CIAC Executive Director Glenn Lungarini told the outlet that its transgender policy is based on federal and state guidance and that multiple courts and federal agencies — including the Justice Department — have acknowledged the term ""sex"" in Title IX is ambiguous.

Lungarini added to the AP that the historical usage of the term ""has not kept pace with contemporary science, advances in medical knowledge, and societal norms.""

What did the ACLU have to say?

The American Civil Liberties Union is representing Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood — the biological male sprinters who identify as females and who have dominated girls' track in Connecticut — and told the outlet it's troubling that the U.S. government is entering the fray to ""make clear that it does not believe girls who are trans enjoy protections under federal law.""

""Our clients are two high school seniors who are just trying to enjoy their final track season of high school and who now have to contend with the federal government arguing against their right to equal educational opportunities,"" Chase Strangio, deputy director for Trans Justice at the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project, told the AP. ""History will look back on these anti-trans attacks with deep regret and shame. In the meantime we will continue to fight for the rights of all girls to participate in the sports they love.""

What's the background?

Alliance Defending Freedom — which is representing Soule, Mitchell, and Smith — argues that as a result of the CIAC policy ""two males were permitted to compete in girls' athletic competitions beginning in the 2017 track season. Between them, they have taken 15 women's state championship titles (titles held in 2016 by nine different Connecticut girls) and have taken more than 85 opportunities to participate in higher level competitions from female track athletes in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 seasons alone.""

Mitchell would have won the 2019 state championship in the girls' 55-meter indoor track competition, ""but because two males took first and second place, she was denied the gold medal,"" the legal firm said.

Miller won that race with a state record time of 6.95 seconds, the Associated Press reported. Yearwood took second place with a time of 7.01 seconds, and the third-place sprinter — Mitchell — hit the tape at a distant 7.23 seconds.

Soule finished eighth in the 55-meter sprint — and missed qualifying for the New England regionals by two spots, the outlet said. She told AP had Miller and Yearwood not run, she would've been in the regional race to show her abilities to more college coaches.

""We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it's demoralizing,"" Soule told the outlet. ""I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.""

As for Smith, she won the 400-meter dash at last June's New England Regional Championships — and no biological males competed in the event, ADF said. But when she lined up for the 200-meter dash, a biological male ran against her and won; Smith came in third.

""Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field. Forcing them to compete against boys isn't fair, shatters their dreams, and destroys their athletic opportunities,"" ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said. ""Having separate boys' and girls' sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut's policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.""

The spring track season is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but conference officials have put off a decision on whether to cancel it.

Holcomb added to the AP that because the lawsuit also asks for changes to the state record book, the lawsuit will go forward even if it's not resolved before the seniors graduate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/policy-letting-transgender-females-compete-against-biological-females-now-has-prominent-opponent-attorney-general-william-barr,2020-03-26
Politician who was charged with a hate crime for sharing a Bible verse on Facebook is unanimously cleared of all charges,"A Finnish court unanimously cleared a Finnish former politician Wednesday of all hate speech charges that stemmed from her sharing a Bible verse on Facebook.

What's a brief history here?

The politician, former Interior Minister Päivi Räsänen, was accused of a hate crime in 2019 after she took to Facebook and shared a Bible verse about homosexuality.

Räsänen shared the verse in criticism of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland over its participation in the Helsinki LGBT Pride events.

The passage, a New International Version translation of Romans 1:24-27, said:

24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

Räsänen, whose husband was a pastor in the church at the time, captioned the post, ""How can the church's doctrinal foundation, the Bible, be compatible with the lifting up of shame and sin as a subject of pride?""

Following the comment, Finnish police announced an investigation as to whether her quote was incitement against sexual and gender minorities — in short, a hate crime.

She later insisted that she was not trying to shame or insult ""sexual minorities.""

""As I prayed, I was convinced that now is the time to try to wake up the sleeping ones, not to jump out of a sinking boat,"" she said at the time. ""My purpose was in no way to insult sexual minorities. My criticism was aimed at the leadership of the church.""

""Only people who recognize their sins need Jesus, the forgiveness of our sins,"" she added. ""This is why we also must have the courage to call homosexual relations sinful.""

What are the details?

On Wednesday, Evangelical Focus reported that the Helsinki District Court dismissed all charges against Räsänen by unanimous vote.

In its ruling, the court said that it is ""not for the district court to interpret biblical concepts.""

Räsänen said she was happy with the outcome following the decision.

“This is the decision I expected,"" she said in a press conference. ""I very much appreciate that the decision recognises the importance of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. I am pleased that the decision appears to be very thorough and inclusive. It draws heavily on the European Court of Human Rights' principles of freedom of expression and also carefully goes through what I have said.”

She added, “Why was there so much international interest? Because they understand that if questioning freedom of expression can happen in reputable Finland, which has been ranked third in the international freedom of expression rankings, why not in any other country?”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politician-charged-with-hate-crime-for-bible-verse-unanimously-cleared,2022-03-30
Poll finds a majority of DEMOCRATIC primary voters support Florida's Parental Rights bill,"Even Democrats agree that children in kindergarten through third grade are too young to learn about sexual orientation or gender identity, according to a new poll.



A majority of likely Democratic primary voters in the state of Florida support controversial parental rights legislation that LGBTQ+ activists, the Democratic Party, and the national media have inaccurately called the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

These results come from a poll conducted by Floridians for Economic Advancement, a political action committee that supports candidates from both major parties. The group's survey asked 701 likely Democratic primary voters about language from the Parental Rights in Education bill that was recently passed by the Republican-controlled legislature and is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The survey asked, ""Should students in Kindergarten through 3rd Grade be taught about sexual orientation in the classroom by their teachers?""

By a margin of 52-36%, a majority of the most politically active Democrats in Florida said ""definitely no"" or ""somewhat no"" in response to that question.

The language used in the survey's question closely resembles the actual language of HB 1557, which says that ""classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

Florida Democrats and LGBTQ+ activists have waged war on this legislation, making it a top priority in their messaging. They inaccurately characterized it as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, a name adopted by local and national media, a name that falsely suggested that Republicans were attempting to make it illegal to talk about gay people in school.

The DeSantis administration has vigorously defended the bill, accusing Democrats and the media of waging a disinformation campaign against it.

“Most Floridians, no matter their orientation, agree that instruction on sexuality and gender theory is inappropriate in grades K-3,” said DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw, after the Daily Wire published the results of another poll that found bipartisan support for the Parental Rights bill.

NBC News reporter Marc Caputo, who shared the Floridians for Economic Advancement on Twitter, recently criticized the news media for inaccurately covering HB 1557.

“While legislative intent does matter, what does also matter, when you challenge legislation, is you first have to look at the four corners of the document, and see what it actually says,” Caputo told WFLA-TV in an interview Sunday.

“The bill does not say, ‘don’t say gay,'” he said. “It says, don’t teach about these issues, in general. So, you know, the reality is, ‘don’t say gay’ is technically not an accurate description.”

“We made a big deal during Trump years, and rightfully so, and critics did, that the news media needs to start calling lies lies, and be very clear if something was baseless, was without fact, was supported or not supported by evidence or without evidence, and if something was false, we’d say he falsely stated it,” Caputo continued.

“Well, to say this actually says ‘don’t say gay’ is false,” the NBC reporter asserted.

“For us to say, ‘oh, the “don’t say gay” bill,’ that would be a similar thing — similar, not exactly the same — of us during Obamacare saying, ‘Oh, well the Obamacare bill is the “death panel bill,” because that’s what the opponents call it.’ Well, it wasn’t the ‘death panel bill,'” Caputo said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-finds-a-majority-of-democratic-primary-voters-support-florida-s-parental-rights-bill,2022-03-24
Poll finds strong bipartisan support for Florida parental rights bill among those told what it actually says,"A proposal to keep sex and gender ideology out of lower grade school levels in Florida has strong support among most Americans, according to a new Daily Wire poll.

The cornerstone language of Florida's ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, HB 1557, is supported by nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults who were told what the bill says, though many survey respondents appear to hold misconceptions about the legislation. Democrats and LGBT activists have inaccurately called it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill in an attempt to smear the proposal and its supporters, claiming it is ""hateful"" and will ""harm"" children by banning classroom discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity up to a certain grade-level.

Many news reports have adopted the ""Don't Say Gay"" label as shorthand for the bill and have glossed over how it will apply to only ""kindergarten through third grade."" The survey found false beliefs about the bill appear to be common, including that 39% of U.S. adults — and 45% of Democrats — believe the Florida bill bans the word ""gay"" (it doesn't) and that 22% believe the bill forces schools to ""out"" LGBT students (also not true). Another 17% inaccurately believe the legislation would prohibit Florida students from saying they have a gay parent or relative.

To get a more accurate read on public opinion about the actual Parental Rights bill instead of the straw man built by its opponents, the Daily Wire's researchers quoted directly from the legislation with the following statement:



Below is a passage from a new state education law. Please indicate whether you support or oppose it. ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

Results showed that more than six in 10 Americans (64%) support banning classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, or at any grade level where such discussions are not presented in a manner that is age or developmentally appropriate. Only 21% said they oppose the bill.

Framed this way, the bill has strong bipartisan support, with 69% of Republicans in favor, 62% of Democrats, and 57% of self-identified independents as well. There was not a significant difference in support among whites (63%), blacks (66%), and Latinos (62%) or by age.

Further, majorities said it was ""inappropriate"" for teachers to instruct students in kindergarten through third grade on various sexual orientations (65%) and ""inappropriate"" to discuss ""gender identities, such as transgenderism"" (66%).

More than half of survey respondents (52%) said they support provisions in the Parental Rights bill allowing parents to take schools to court if they believe their children have been taught material related to these topics in a way they believe is inappropriate.



Additionally, 68% of parents said they support the Florida bill's classroom instruction regulations.

“Most Floridians, no matter their orientation, agree that instruction on sexuality and gender theory is inappropriate in grades K-3,” a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement to the Daily Wire. DeSantis supports HB 1557 and has challenged news reporters who've inaccurately described the legislation as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

The poll was conducted March 12-13 by the market research technology platform Lucid. It had a sample size of 1,000 people that was 37% Democrat, 32% Republican, and 31% independent, with a margin of error of 5% and a confidence level of 95%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-finds-strong-bipartisan-support-for-florida-parental-rights-bill-among-those-told-what-it-actually-says,2022-03-14
New poll finds majority of Americans support provisions of Florida bill related to banning LGBTQ issues in schools,"A new poll found that a majority of Americans supported the provisions of a Florida bill related to banning the teaching of LGBTQ issues in schools.

Florida's Parental Rights in Education act has been criticized by opponents as being homophobic, but the Morning Consult/Politico poll found support for some of its provisions among a majority of Americans.

When asked if they supported ""limiting lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity after third grade to 'age appropriate' discussions,"" 52% of Americans said they did.

Only 33% said they opposed such a limit.

When asked if they supported a ban on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade, 51% said they did.

Only 35% said they would oppose such a ban.

The poll results were split among partisan lines, with most of the support for the provisions coming from those who identified as Republicans, but they were also joined by a significant portion of people who identified as independents.

The poll also asked Americans if they supported bans on teaching of critical race theory in school and 43% said they opposed them while 40% said they supported them.

The legislation has been derisively dubbed the ""don't say gay"" bill by its opponents, and the deceptive nickname has been taken up by many in the media, leading many to misunderstand what is actually in the law.

After Disney was pressured into speaking out against the law, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis excoriated the company in a scathing statement of his own.

""In the state of Florida, we are not going to allow them to inject transgenderism into kindergarten,"" DeSantis said at the time.

""First-graders shouldn’t have woke gender ideology imposed in their curriculums, and that is what we’re standing for because we’re standing for the kids and we’re standing for the parents,"" he added.

The White House called the bill ""horrific"" and ""bullying,"" but dodged a question about why President Joe Biden supported a similar bill in 1994 as a U.S. Senator.

Poll: More than half of Virginia parents think that parents should tell schools what to teach,"According to a Fox News poll, over half of Virginia parents think parents should tell schools what to teach.

The outlet reported that when responding to the question, ""Do you believe parents should – or should not – be telling schools what to teach?"" 57% of Virginia parents indicated that parents should be doing so, while 34% indicated that parents should not be doing so.

Just 50% of likely Virginia voters answered that parents should tell educational institutions what to teach, while 40% of likely voters said parents should not do so.

The poll comes after Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe said during a debate against Republican Glenn Youngkin last month, ""...I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.""



McAuliffe previously served as Virginia's governor from early 2014 until early 2018.

WTKR-TV reported that it asked the candidate what part parents should play regarding school curriculum.

""Parents are very involved. We've got school boards. We've got the state board. We've got great curriculum here in Virginia,"" McAuliffe answered, according to the outlet.

The general election is Nov. 2.

Cultural debate continues to rage nationwide around issues such as critical race theory, LGBT topics, and transgender policies in public schools.

The Fox News survey was conducted Oct. 10-13, 2021, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), and included interviews with 1,004 Virginia registered voters and 726 likely voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file, who spoke with live interviewers on landlines and cellphones. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 for the likely voter sample, Fox News said.

Report: Pope Francis endorses same-sex civil unions in new documentary,"Pope Francis reportedly gave his approval to same-sex civil unions in a documentary released Wednesday, the first time he has done so as pope.

During an interview for the feature-length documentary ""Francesco,"" which premiered at the Rome Film Festival Wednesday, the pope departed from his predecessors and Vatican doctrine to call for same-sex civil union laws for those who identify as homosexual, Catholic News Agency reported.

""Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,"" Pope Francis reportedly said in the film.

According to CNA, the comments were made during a discussion on Francis' views on pastoral care for those who identify as LGBT.

""What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered,"" the pope reportedly said. ""I stood up for that.""

The film ""Francesco"" is a documentary exploring the life and ministry of Pope Francis. According to CNA, it ""chronicles the approach of Pope Francis to pressing social issues, and to pastoral ministry among those who live, in the words of the pontiff, 'on the existential peripheries.'""

Francis' reported remarks seem to confirm reports that he previously voiced support for same-sex civil unions before he became the pope.



In 2010, while Francis was the archbishop of Buenos Aires, he opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage. Sergio Rubin, the pope's future biographer, claimed in 2013 that the newly elected pope had supported civil unions as a compromise position to prevent the full legalization of same-sex marriage. Rubin's claims were disputed by Miguel Woites, the director of AICA, the Catholic news agency of Argentina.

Activist and former theology professor Marcelo Marquez made similar claims, telling CNN in 2013 that during a 2010 phone call, the pope, formerly known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, said he was in favor of gay rights.

""He told me. ... 'I'm in favor of gay rights and in any case, I also favor civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law,'"" Marquez claimed.

Pope Francis' new comments, specifically his reported statement ""I stood up for that,"" would indicate the reports that he supported same-sex civil unions before he became pope were true.

CNA noted that in his 2013 book, ""On Heaven and Earth,"" the pope wrote that laws ""assimilating"" homosexual relationships to marriage are ""an anthropological regression."" The pope also seemed to criticize adoption rights for gay couples, writing that if they ""are given adoption rights, there could be affected children. Every person needs a male father and a female mother that can help them shape their identity.""

Previously, the Catholic Church and Pope Francis' immediate predecessors opposed legal recognition of same-sex couples.

From CNA:

In 2003, under the leadership of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and at the direction of Pope John Paul II, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith taught that ""respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions. The common good requires that laws recognize, promote and protect marriage as the basis of the family, the primary unit of society.""



""Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour, with the consequence of making it a model in present-day society, but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity. The Church cannot fail to defend these values, for the good of men and women and for the good of society itself,"" the CDF added, calling support for such unions from politicians ""gravely immoral.""



""Not even in a remote analogous sense do homosexual unions fulfill the purpose for which marriage and family deserve specific categorical recognition. On the contrary, there are good reasons for holding that such unions are harmful to the proper development of human society, especially if their impact on society were to increase,"" the document said.

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger went on to become Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis' immediate predecessor.

"Film company halts distribution of popular former pastor Joshua Harris' documentary after his renunciation of Christianity, citing lack of 'integrity'","A film distributor that was set to manage author and former pastor Joshua Harris' forthcoming documentary has pulled out of the project, citing integrity as the reason.

Harris renounced his faith in July, telling his Instagram followers that he no longer considers himself to be a Christian. The Instagram post revealed Harris' admittance that he had ""undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus.""

Harris has since apparently deleted the original Instagram post.

What are the details?

According to Faithwire, Exploration Films — a faith-based film distributor — dropped Harris' forthcoming project, a documentary.

Stephen Penn, a spokesman for the company, said Harris' announcement that he was leaving Christianity behind left the company with no decision but to halt the project.

""Unfortunately Josh did not tip off his film team partners of these surprising changes before his public post — nor how this would change our company's distribution efforts of the film he had worked with us on to promote,"" Penn said.

Wishing Harris the best, and acknowledging that the author and former pastor is clearly ""searching for answers,"" Penn added that Harris' ""lack of transparency"" left the company no other choice.

""We have no other choice but to halt promotion of the film,"" he said.

He later told Faithwire that Harris' public declaration left the company ""in an awkward position,"" and hurt its distribution efforts throughout the Christian community.

""Discussions that are Christian in nature happen throughout the film, and the former pastor's public statements on marriage — and especially Christianity — undermine key parts of the film,"" he told the outlet. ""It puts our team in an awkward position to promote [the documentary].""

Penn explained that the company received myriad complaints from ""customers, ministries, and pastors demanding that they remove Harris' products from their shelves"" after the former pastor's remarks.

“Integrity in business,"" Penn told the outlet, ""is something that is very important for us.""

Anything else?

Harris, a former sexual purity proponent who wrote ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" in 1997, also announced that he recently split with his wife of 21 years.

Before his divorce, Harris distanced himself from the popular book, saying, ""I no longer agree with its central idea that dating should be avoided. I now think dating can be a healthy part of a person developing relationally and learning the qualities that matter most in a partner.""

""To those who read my book and were misdirected or unhelpfully influenced by it, I am sincerely sorry,"" Harris apologized.

Harris attended a Pride Parade earlier this month in Vancouver, British Columbia,, and uploaded photos from the Pride Parade to his Instagram Story. The Christian Post reported that Harris shared a photo of himself with Matthias Roberts, host of ""Queerology: A Podcast on Belief and Being,"" and gay rock singer Trey Pearson.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/popular-author-pastor-who-renounced-christianity-pays-the-price-for-denying-jesus-as-film-distributor-drops-documentary,2019-08-29
Critics accuse DC Comics of going 'woke' over comic book storyline with pregnant Joker character,"Critics of DC Comics are accusing the comic book company of going ""woke"" over a new storyline where Joker, a Batman villain, gets pregnant and gives birth.

The online furor broke out when critics began circulating a panel of the pregnant Joker from the current issue of ""The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing.""

The panel shows the Joker discovering he is pregnant. Many took the panel to mean that DC Comics was promoting the idea that men could get pregnant, a mainstay of the LGBTQ agenda that equates transgender women to biological women.

""DC Comics makes the Joker pregnant. Targeting children with their satanic agenda,"" read one tweet.

""It's impressive how DC comics managed to find a new low, I didn't think it was possible, but here we are,"" responded another critic.

""The Joker comes out as a Pregnant Transgender man in new DC comic,"" claimed another critic.

The storyline, however, does not make Joker a transgender person but instead the victim of magic. The villain asks Zatanna, a comic heroine, to have a family with him, but she instead puts him under a magic spell that makes him pregnant. When he tries to give birth, he instead vomits out a pile of clay that morphs into a child with his appearance.

Not all readers were outraged at the storyline. Some pointed out that the storyline was not meant to be in the main canon of the character, but from an alternate universe. Others said the tone of the comic was meant to be in line with those of the Silver Age of comics, which came between the years of 1956 and 1970 and which featured very weird elements of fantasy.

Matthew Rosenberg, the writer of the comic, mocked his critics in a tweet.

""The reason people are mad at me today is the funniest reason people have ever been mad at me,"" Rosenberg wrote.

While that storyline might be slightly exaggerated to fit the political culture war, DC Comics previously announced that it would have a gay version of Superman in their comic.

President Trump just torpedoed Roy Moore's Alabama Senate campaign before it started: 'Roy Moore cannot win',"Former judge and failed Senate candidate Roy Moore hasn't even officially announced his second attempt to run for an Alabama Senate seat, and President Donald Trump has already come out strongly against the idea.

Earlier this week, Moore was the recipient of a scathing rebuke from the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. Today, POTUS himself sent a clear message to Moore: Don't run.

""Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,"" President Trump tweeted. ""This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn't, and probably won't.""

""If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our Pro-Life victories,"" he continued. ""Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating....Judges and Supreme Court Justices!""

The president brings up some valid points in his tweets. Moore, burdened by a scandal related to relationships with underage girls, lost a special election that should've been a sure thing for Republicans. And while the GOP was able to extend its control over the Senate in 2018, not regaining the Alabama seat in 2020 would be a blow to the party in a severely pro-Trump state.

Moore, for his part, seems to be undeterred by the heavy criticism that just the idea of him running again brings.

Ever wonder why the mere mention of my name scares the ""hell"" out of the Washington DC establishment, liberals, and LGBT?"" Moore tweeted Wednesday morning. ""Like Pres Trump I want to see America great again, but that is a job only God can do!""

Presbyterian church features drag queen reading story to children about LGBTQ icon Harvey Milk,"Last Sunday, Dan Davidson briefly stepped out of his role as caretaker of Cincinnati's Mount Auburn Presbyterian Church and became ""Sparkle Leigh"" — dressed in drag with tons of makeup and glitter — to read a story to children during the service about LGBTQ icon Harvey Milk, the assassinated San Francisco politician who was openly gay, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.

Davidson wore a pink, flowing dress and a green curly wig, the outlet said, adding that the congregation clapped during ""exciting parts of the tale.""

Image source: Cincinnati Enquirer video screenshot

Mount Auburn is celebrating Pride month throughout June, the Enquirer said, adding that the sanctuary featured Pride flags on the front walls and rainbow candles onstage.

Pastor Stacey Midge told the outlet the service's offshoot of the Drag Queen Story Hour — typically held in public libraries — fits with the church's beliefs that God loves everyone.

Indeed, a man shared his coming story during the service as well, the Enquirer added.

What else do we know about Sparkle Leigh?



Sparkle Leigh performed as a drag queen in Seattle but looked for a different backdrop after experiencing a hate crime and being hit by a car while in full makeup, the outlet said.

In addition, Sparkle Leigh was drawn to partaking in Drag Queen Story Hour phenomenon to give children support, the Enquirer said: ""I'm excited just to be able to point to diversity and help kids not be afraid of people that are different but to embrace them and be able to learn from them and find out more about them.""



More from the outlet:

Sparkle estimated that about half of the people who come to the storytimes are members of the LGBT community, while the other half are allies. She mainly reads stories with LGBT themes or books featuring or written by people of color because children aren't often exposed to these types of stories.



Sparkle's own story on that Sunday in Mount Auburn had a particular kind of poignancy for her: Her conversion therapy sessions had taken place down the street from the church. The fresh message of acceptance resonated with her, as she hopes LGBT people can find a place in this and similar churches and that they won't let negative past experiences turn them away from religion.

""Love more, love better,"" Sparkle told the Enquirer. ""It's literally that simple.""

Presbyterian Church (USA) 'nonbinary/genderqueer category',"The left-wing Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is placing a ""nonbinary/genderqueer category"" into its denominational statistics.

""Each year, the Office of the General Assembly gathers statistical information from presbyteries across the country and provides a comprehensive breakdown on church membership, ethnicity and age distribution, as well as other information. But for next year's update, expect to see some changes in what is reported,"" a post on pcusa.org notes.

Manager of denominational roles and statistics Kris Valerius said, ""we've always asked how many female members there are in the church. We're now asking how many men, women and nonbinary/genderqueer members there are. We've never asked that question so we don't know how many people will fill it out.""

""If we want to be inclusive, then we have to start asking because you should be aware of who’s a part of your church,"" Valerius said, according to the post.

Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) allows for the performance of gay weddings and for the ordination of people who identify as LGBT.

""Ordaining bodies (sessions and presbyteries) are permitted but not required to ordain lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender persons. Candidates for ordination and/or installation must be considered as individuals on a case-by-case basis; it is not permissible to establish a policy that excludes a category of persons in the abstract,"" presbyterianmission.org explains.

While the denomination points to John Calvin as a key figure in informing many of its beliefs, it is highly unlikely that Calvin would have approved of the denomination's pro-LGBT positions.

San Francisco mayor to skip Pride Parade due to law enforcement uniform ban,"San Francisco Mayor London Breed said that she will not participate in the upcoming Pride Parade due to a ban against police wearing their uniforms while participating.

""I've made this very hard decision in order to support those members of the LGBTQ community who serve in uniform, in our Police Department and Sheriff's Department, who have been told they cannot march in uniform and in support of the members of the Fire Department who are refusing to march out of solidarity with their public safety partners,"" Breed said in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times.

In a joint statement, the San Francisco Police Officers Pride alliance, the LGBTQ+ members of the San Francisco Sheriff's Office, and San Francisco Fire Department decried the police uniform ban and noted that they plan to skip the parade.

""We, the police officers of the San Francisco Police Officers Pride Alliance, stand firm in our decision that we will not be pushed back into the closet. We, the LGBTQ+ deputies of the San Francisco Sheriff's Office, will not hide from anyone who we are. In solidarity with their fellow first responders, the San Francisco Fire Department is standing with our law enforcement partners. Barring a reversal from SF Pride, SFFD will not be marching in the San Francisco Pride Parade,"" the statement declared.

""The San Francisco Fire Department, Police Department, and Sheriff’s Department stand with their LGBTQ+ employees and support their decision to not march in order to take a stand against the discriminatory actions of the board of the SF Pride committee,"" the statement said.

San Francisco Pride interim executive director Suzanne Ford said that members of law enforcement may don other garments, like a shirt emblazoned with an SFPD logo, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.



""We didn't ask anyone to hide, or not to denote who they were,"" Ford said. ""We just did not want full uniforms, out of harm reduction to marginalized members of our community.""

""We've asked for this gesture, (which) would say to some members of our community who don’t feel safe around police, that the police heard our concerns, and responded in a positive way,"" Ford said, according to the Chronicle.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pride-parade-mayor-uniform-police,2022-05-24

Pro-transgender video for kindergarteners says a doctor can make a 'mistake' about a baby's gender. Clip just got removed from Maine's Dept. of Education website.,"A pro-transgender, pro-LGBTQ video for kindergarteners — which says a doctor can sometimes make a ""mistake"" about a baby's gender — has been removed from Maine's Department of Education website over ""age appropriateness"" issues.

What does the video say?

The ""Freedom Holidays"" video in question is one of about 400 optional instruction clips developed by teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic to help teachers engage remote learners, the Portland Press-Herald reported.

The video, which speaks directly to kindergarteners, begins with a teacher discussing holidays such as July 4 that celebrate freedom. But soon the teacher in the clip begins talking about ""LGBT+"" people and adds, ""We're not free.""

The teacher then defines the words ""lesbian,"" ""gay,"" ""bisexual,"" and ""transgender,"" noting that lesbians are ""women who love other women,"" gay men ""love other men,"" and bisexual people are men and women who ""love both men and women.""

Then the teacher tells the kindergarteners a ""transgender person is someone who the doctors made a mistake about when they were born."" Here's the breakdown:

""When a baby is born, the doctors will tell the parents what gender they think that baby is ... but some people when they get a little bit older realize what the doctors said was not right. They might say that 'the doctors told me I was a man, but I'm really a woman,' or they might say 'the doctors told me I'm a woman, but I'm really a man.' And so when they grow up and ... tell people that the doctors made a mistake about their gender, then they can transition to be the gender that they actually are.""

Here's the continued explanation for the kindergartener audience:

""So transgender men are people who the doctors thought was a woman when they were born, but when they grew up, they could tell people that they're actually a man, and so they transition to be a man. And transgender women are people who when they were born the doctors thought they were a man, but when they grow up, they tell people, 'No, I'm actually a woman,' and so they transition to be a women. And so that is who transgender people are.""

The teacher then tells the kindergarteners that the ""plus sign"" at the end of LGBT stands for ""a lot of other people who love in ways that society hasn't always allowed."" She says such restrictions were ""wrong because there are lots of men who love other men and lots of women who love women, and there are lots of people who are transgender.""

The clip concludes with the teacher saying the kindergarteners would learn about three famous LGBTQ activists who ""fought"" for the right to ""love who they wanted to love.""

Here's the video:

Freedom Holidays video youtu.be

What else happened?

The Press-Herald said the video was removed from the state's Department of Education website after it was featured in a Republican TV ad targeting Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.

The department and Mills agreed that the lesson behind the clip was inappropriate for kindergarteners, the paper said.

“The governor was not aware of the lesson, but she understands the concerns expressed about the age appropriateness and agrees with the Department of Education’s decision to remove the lesson,” Mills spokeswoman Lindsay Crete said Wednesday, the day the ad began running, according to the Press-Herald.

Crete added that Mills believes parents, community members, teachers, and local elected school boards should make decisions about classroom subject matter, noting Maine’s long-standing tradition of local control, the paper said.

“She will continue to empower parents and elected school boards to make decisions about their kids’ educations,” Crete said while adding that the governor “will continue to respect LGBTQ+ people as valued members of the Maine community,” the Press-Herald reported.

What did the state's DOE have to say?

The paper said the Maine Department of Education wouldn't specify why it couldn't recommend the “Freedom Holidays” lesson plan for kindergarten instruction, but spokesman Marcus Mrowka said the video “should have received further review by a DOE specialist” before it was posted online.

Mrowka also wouldn't say if the department screened other online lesson plans included in the MOOSE program – Maine Online Opportunities for Sustained Education – before being posted on the publicly accessible professional development platform, the Press-Herald added.

More from the paper:

MOOSE is not a state-mandated curriculum, Mrowka noted. No teacher or school district was required to use the Freedom Holidays lesson plan. MOOSE is made up of free, project-based lesson plans created by Maine teachers for optional use by other Maine teachers in their classrooms, he said.



But the online hub is undergoing a previously scheduled review by department staff, he said. It is part of a plan to update the lesson plans created in the first year of the pandemic and to consider new material created by teachers for the coming school year.

The kindergarten teacher who created the ""Freedom Holidays"" video was paid a $1,000 stipend for her work, Mrowka added to the Press-Herald.

What did Maine's GOP chair have to say?

Maine GOP Chair Demi Kouzounas told the paper the video's language pointing to same-sex relationships could confuse children and make them more susceptible to pedophiles.

“I’m concerned about the mixed messages that are obvious to anyone who has had kids: We teach them about ‘stranger danger’ and that their bodies are their own,” Kouzounas told the Press-Herald. “But this video talks about ‘people who love in ways that society hasn’t always allowed.’“

Anything else?

The sentiments expressed in the video isn't an educational outlier — even the part about doctors making mistakes about infants' gender.

You may recall a recent story about a transgender first-grade teacher who told a group of kindergartners, first-graders, and second-graders that when babies are born, doctors ""guess"" if they're boys or girls — but added that ""sometimes the doctor is wrong"" and ""makes an incorrect guess.""

University professor says heterosexuality is 'tragic' and causes all sorts of societal problems for men and women,"A professor at the University of California-Riverside says that heterosexuality is a ""tragic"" concept that perpetuates misogyny, funnels men into supporting toxic masculinity, and breaks up relationships.

What are the details?

As highlighted by Campus Reform, Jane Ward, a professor of gender and sexuality studies and self-described lesbian, says that ""heterosexual relationships"" are inherently bad for people and their interpersonal relationships because they highlight inequality.

In an December article for Insider, Ward argued that by all appearances, men and women don't actually like one another.

Insider's Julia Naftulin reported, ""She feels sorry for straight people, especially straight women, who typically report some of the lowest sexual satisfaction in society, Ward told Insider. But she also feels sorry for straight men, who are pigeon-holed into toxic-masculine culture that teaches them they both need, and yet should also demean, women.""

""It really looks like straight men and women don't like each other very much, that women spend so much time complaining about men, and we still have so much evidence of misogyny,"" Ward told the outlet. ""From an LGBT perspective, [heterosexuality] looks actually very tragic.""

Elsewhere in her discussion, Ward said that the COVID-19 pandemic is also ""revealing the tragedy of heterosexuality to people who might not have otherwise paid attention to it.""

Ward is also the author of a book titled ""The Tragedy of Heterosexuality.""

In a statement, Ward told Campus Reform that she wrote the book because she ""loves straight couples"" and hopes to better educate them.

""I wrote this book because I love straight people, and because the research on heterosexual marital satisfaction over the life course shows that straight couples are struggling to balance work and family obligations and this leads to frustration and resentment for many straight women, in particular,"" Ward told the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-heterosexuality-tragic-causes-societal-problems,2021-01-27
"'Nonbinary, transfeminine' prof threatens to kick students out for 'intentional misgendering'","A Brooklyn College professor threatened to kick students out of class for ""intentional misgendering"" other students — but once the administration found out, the school was having none of it, Campus Reform reported.

What are the details?

Campus Reform said it obtained the complete original syllabus of the course taught by Brandon Aultman, which includes a warning regarding ""intentional misgendering."" The outlet said the syllabus reads, in part:

Pronouns, Gender Identity, and Racial Insensitivity: My name is B. Call me B. I am nonbinary, transfeminine. For my information concerning the use of these terms please consult http://transstudent.org. I use gender-neutral pronouns (they/them). I adhere to a strict policy of respect for the gender, sexual, and racial identities of my students. Intentional misgendering, as with any attempt to slur another student's personal integrity on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion, will result in immediate dismissal from class for that session. Continued abuses will result in disciplinary action with the appropriate administrators.

Here's the syllabus via Campus Reform:

The outlet said Aultman teaches LGBT politics at the school. While Aultman isn't listed in Brooklyn College's faculty directory, the school's Media Relations Manager Rich Pietras on Friday told TheBlaze he believes Aultman is an adjunct professor. Brooklyn College is part of the City University of New York public college system.



The whip comes down

Campus Reform said after it contacted Brooklyn College, Pietras said the school was ""not aware of this classroom guideline."" Because the school ""believes that all classroom guidelines should be crafted to support learning,"" the outlet said the school asked the professor ""to not dismiss students from the session, but rather to consider a range of effective pedagogies instead and to use the college policy with regard to gender discrimination.""

A student who dropped the class after reading the misgendering warning told Campus Reform that ""failing to refer to someone by their preferred pronoun should not result in the immediate dismissal from class.""

""It is unreasonable to expect everyone to be accepting of the new standards of proper or acceptable behavior that the twenty-first century has made way for with its fast-changing dynamic,"" the student added to the outlet. ""[The professor] has asked his students to address him by the letter 'B' in addition to using the pronouns 'they/them' when making mention of him. It is one thing to ask to be referred to as a member of the opposite sex, but another thing to ask to be referred to in the third person.""

Campus Reform said another Brooklyn College professor — who sent the syllabus on behalf of the student and requested to remain anonymous — noted the lack of due process and threat to students' First Amendment rights.

""This is a particularly aggressive abuse of what is clearly a trend towards enforcing speech codes on students and faculty,"" the professor said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-kick-students-out-misgendering,2020-10-09
"Gallup polling, 7.1% of US adults, LGBT","According to data collected across 13 Gallup polls conducted in 2021, 7.1% of U.S. adults identify as LGBT or as something besides heterosexual.

While not all members of Generation Z have arrived at adulthood yet, Gallup reported that among those in Gen Z who were born between 1997 and 2003, a whopping 20.8% identify as LGBT. This contrasts with the 10.5% of Millennials, 4.2% of Generation X, 2.6% of Baby Boomers, and 0.8% of Traditionalists who identify this way.

The numbers clearly show that younger generations identify as LGBT in a significantly higher proportion than older generations.

""Given the large disparities in LGBT identification between younger and older generations of Americans, the proportion of all Americans who identify as LGBT can be expected to grow in the future as younger generations will constitute a larger share of the total U.S. adult population,"" Gallup noted.

A majority (56.8%) of the U.S. adults who identify as LGBT say they are bisexual, a figure that equates to 4% of U.S. adults, according to Gallup.

While 20.7% of LGBT U.S. adults say that they are gay, 13.9% identify as lesbian, 10% as transgender, and 4.3% as something else — Gallup noted that the sum of these percentages exceeds 100% because respondents could select more than one category.

The court last month heard that ""untrue"" and ""harmful"" allegations were made about the school on social media, including that a visiting imam claimed to parents there were ""pedophiles"" in the school, the outlet said, adding that other false claims included that the school had a ""pedophile agenda"" and staff were ""teaching children how to masturbate.""

""None of this is true,"" Warby said as he handed down the ban at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, BBC News said. ""None of the defendants have suggested it was true, and the council has proved it is not true.""

The lessons had been ""misrepresented by parents,"" he said, according to the outlet, adding the school doesn't promote homosexuality and seeks to weave the language of equality into everyday school life.

Lead protester Shakeel Afsar, who has no children at the school, told BBC News he's ""bitterly disappointed with the ruling and said the court is ""one-sided"" and that the judge, another official, and key witnesses had been white — as opposed to the ""diverse"" protesters.

""We can continue to protest in the same area that we have been protesting in since June this year,"" he added. ""These young children are not being taught the status of law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/protesters-mostly-muslims-permanently-banned-from-demonstrating-against-lgbtq-curriculum-at-uk-elementary-school,2019-11-26
Psaki calls Florida bill 'horrific' and 'bullying' — but dodges question about Biden supporting similar policy,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday condemned a Florida bill protecting the rights of Florida parents as ""horrific"" and ""bullying.""

At the same time, Psaki dodged questions about President Joe Biden's previous support of anti-LGBT legislation in the 1990s.

What happened?

During the daily press briefing, a reporter asked Psaki how a Senate bill amendment in 1994 — which Biden supported when he was a senator — is different than Florida HB 1557, a bill that protects parental rights in the classroom.

That bill amendment sought to ""prohibit Federal funds for instructional materials, instruction, counseling, or other services on school grounds, from being used for the promotion of homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative.""



The reporter asked, ""Why did [Biden] do that?""



Psaki, however, completely dodged the question, and instead attacked Florida.

""I think that you have seen the president speak passionately on his view that a bill like this that would discriminate against families, against kids, put these kids in the position of not getting the support they need at a time where that’s exactly what they need. It’s discriminatory. It’s a form of bullying. It is horrific. I mean, the president has spoken to that,"" Psaki said.

""In terms of his views and comments from 25 years go, I think the most important question now is why are Florida leaders deciding they need to discriminate against kids who are members of the LGBTQI community? What prompts them to do that? Is it meanness? Is it wanting to make kids have more difficult times in school and in their communities?"" she continued. ""I would pose that question to them and we can talk about it more tomorrow.”

The reporter pressed further, but to no avail.

""Was there a reason he supported the same policy though in the ’90’s when we were all in school?"" he asked

""I think what’s important to note here is how outspoken the president has been against discrimination, against kids, against members of the LGBTQI+ community and what we’re looking at here is a bill that would propagate misinformed hateful policies that impact children,"" Psaki deflected.

Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), responded to Psaki's comments by correcting the record.

""The word 'gay' does not appear in the parental rights bill. It has nothing to do with LGBT content specifically; it's about protecting young children from ALL inappropriate sexual content and gender theory instruction. It is the sole right of the parents to discuss those topics,"" Pushaw said.

What is HB 1557?

The legislation, which passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday, is designed to bolster parents' rights in public education.

For example, the legislation reinforces the ""fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing & control of their children,"" and also prohibits schools from adopting policies usurping parental rights to information about their children.

But Democrats are especially outraged by a provision in the bill that ""prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels.""

The text of the bill says:

Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.

Despite not using the word ""gay"" once in the bill, Democrats have crafted a genius PR campaign calling the legislation as the ""Don't Say Gay bill."" The claim has been repeated by politicians, media members and news outlets, and on social media without repercussions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/psaki-calls-florida-bill-horrific-and-bullying-but-she-dodges-question-about-biden-s-past-support-for-anti-lgbt-amendment,2022-03-09
"While happy to host drag queens, public libraries deny story-hour slot to Kirk Cameron for his new faith-based book: 'We have to start fighting back'","In libraries across the United States, toddlers are frequently invited to sit and listen to men dressed as women advance LGBT propaganda. Kids can show up at their local library to learn how to become drag queens.

American evangelist and actor Kirk Cameron has discovered that where public libraries across the nation are concerned, it is impermissible to alternatively share a children's book that celebrates faith, family, normalcy, and biblical wisdom.

'Queer-friendly' apparently means Christians need not apply

Cameron told Fox News Digital that at least 50 taxpayer-funded libraries have either denied or ignored his requests to host a story-hour program for parents and kids. These same libraries have, however, hosted drag queen story hours and ideologically charged all-ages LGBT events.

The evangelist's publisher, Brave Books, shared with Fox News Digital a number of the responses they have received from various libraries.

A library worker from the Rochambeau Public Library in Providence, Rhode Island, told Cameron and his publisher, ""We are a very queer-friendly library. Our messaging does not align.""

Accordingly, the library stated, ""No, we will pass on having you run a program in our space.""

When Brave Books pressed an official affiliated with the Providence library on whether the company could fill out an application anyway, the official responded, ""You can fill out the form to reserve space, to run the program in our space — but we won’t run your program.""

Rochambeau Public Library hosts ""Queer Umbrella,"" where kids ""can learn, discuss, and connect over queer history, art, community resources, and more!""

According to an event posting, ""Queer Umbrella"" is open to ""all members of the LGBTQ+ community who are 12+.""

The City Heights/Weingart Branch Library in San Diego similarly shot down the prospect of a reading by Cameron, suggesting that officials didn't ""think that's something that we would do.""

The library's representative reportedly cited the community's diversity as a determining factor.

A children's library representative affiliated with the Alameda County Library system in California flatly said, ""We are not interested.""

That same library location in San Lorenzo runs a ""special Kwanzaa storytime"" and, according to Fox News Digital, a legal workshop assisting people who want to change their gender on official documents.

A spokesman at the Indianapolis Public Library's central location all but said no, telling the publisher that ""we are really looking at authors who are diverse. Authors of color. That's really been our focus.""

After Brave Books explained that Cameron's book contains a diverse collection of stories and ideas, the library responded by saying, ""We are focusing on racial equity.""

'Battle for the hearts and minds of our children'

The book Cameron endeavors to read to children from is entitled ""As You Grow.""

Written by the father of six and illustrated by Juan Moreno, ""As You Grow"" tells of the upward journey of a tree and the ""words of wisdom that guided the tree.""

Instead of learning about sexually degenerate acts or alternative lifestyles, kids learn ""biblical wisdom and the value of producing the fruit of the spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control.""

While there are thousands of public libraries Cameron has yet to call on in hopes of sharing this message with the next generation, the evangelist told Fox News Digital that the rejections thus far are ""proof that more than ever, we are getting destroyed in the battle for the hearts and minds of our children.""



""Publicly funded libraries are green-lighting ‘gender marker and name change clinics’ while denying a story time that would involve the reading of a book that teaches biblical wisdom. How much more clear can it get?"" he added.

Matt Walsh of the Daily Wire and others suggested online that were Cameron ""dressed in women's underwear and reading a book about sexuality for five year olds, then he'd have libraries lining up to host him.""

Brave Books CEO Trent Talbot said, ""It is devastating to discover that many of our publicly funded libraries have now become indoctrination centers that refuse to allow biblical wisdom to be taught to our children.""

Cameron suggested, ""We have to start fighting back, or we will lose our kids and this country.""



They key, suggested Cameron, is not just calling out evil and degeneracy, but displacing it. That means regaining some control of public spaces, including libraries.

He previously told Fox News that with six children and grandbabies to think about, he personally has a great deal at stake.

""Drag queen story hour and all of that — it's not a mistake that this is going after the children because everyone understands that whoever controls the textbooks controls the future,"" he said.

Cameron noted further that ""it's no coincidence that we're seeing these dangerous and toxic ideas such as gender theory and CRT and these kinds of things targeted toward our kids [today].""

Last week, Cameron told Fox News' Shannon Bream that ""there are so many people today who see evil and hope that it just passes by them, that it comes to them last. ... We should engage evil and defeat evil whether it's in our home, our children's school, our culturally, politically, [or] spiritually.""

Public school teachers reveal they work with administrators to ignore the pronoun and name preferences of students' parents,"Elementary school faculty were caught bragging about ignoring requests from parents to refer to them by their given names and pronouns.

In late April, the virtual “Creating and Sustaining GSAs in Elementary Schools” meeting saw Katy Butler, a second-grade public school teacher at Harvey Milk Civil Rights Academy in San Francisco, California, ask her fellow panelists a question concerning pronoun use when referring to their students.

The Daily Mail reported that Butler asked the panel, “What should we do if a parent requests that we refer to their child by the pronouns associated with their sex assigned at birth instead of their preferred pronouns, and that we use a legal name instead of a student’s chosen name?”

Butler, the creator of Gender Inclusive Classrooms, the group that organized the panel, subsequently opened the floor to the other three panelists, who were all staffers at public schools across the country.

One panelist, Kieran Slattery, a fifth-grade teacher in Massachusetts who co-created Gender Inclusive Classrooms with Butler, proceeded to tell the forum that he ignores instructions given to him by parents.

Slattery, who teaches at Jackson Street Elementary, said, “So, I can respond with something that I’ve done. This came up for me – it’s come up in a couple different ways – but it's come up for me where caregivers asked. I actually refer to their child’s name … using the name they asked to be referred to and their chosen pronouns, and caregivers reacted very strongly.”

Slattery continued by saying that parents “followed up with me and the principal, and said, like, ‘I know you were using a different name than my child’s given name at birth and the pronouns we gave them, and I’m respectfully asking that you use the name and the pronouns that we gave them.’”

Slattery also said, “The laws in every state are different … and I can’t speak to the laws in everyone’s particular state, but I will say – again, the resources that we’ll give you after this have some helpful sites where you can look up what the rules are for your state.”

He indicated that before he proceeded with subverting the wishes of his students’ parents, he checked with school administrators to ensure they would support him in his quest to push gender ideology unto his students.

Slattery said, “Before I responded to the caregiver, I made sure I ran it by my principal and my superintendent just to make sure that they had my back.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/public-school-teachers-reveal-they-work-with-administrators-to-ignore-the-pronoun-and-name-preferences-of-students-parents,2022-05-15
'Put the taxes in the bag': Teacher gloats about not getting fired despite 'indoctrinating' students,"A Baltimore, Maryland, educator bragged on social media about keeping her teaching job despite ""indoctrinating"" students using taxpayer money, Fox News Digital reported.



In the video, Alexa Sciuto, a Spanish teacher at Pine Grove Middle School in the Baltimore County School District, gloated that her public school position is funded by taxpayers while dancing and lip-synching, ""F*** up on your b****.""

Sciuto faced criticism from a TikTok user after she posted a video of decorating her classroom with LGBT+ pride material.

The user wrote, ""None of this is what education is supposed to be about. Reading. Writing. Arithmetic. Why are you so f***ing hellbent on indoctrinating our children?""

The teacher responded to the comment by posting a video captioned, ""I just got fired for indoctrinating my students.""

Sciuto then wrote ""sike"" and stated that she was actually ""still employed."" The educator cheerfully danced next to the captions, ""Y'all will never take me alive"" and ""put the taxes in the bag.""

The video also featured an arrow pointing to a gif of money labeled ""your taxes.""

According to Fox News Digital, Sciuto claimed that ""professionalism is a patriarchal and White supremacist myth.""

In another TikTok post, Sciuto mocked parents concerned about woke ideology in the public school system.

In the video, Sciuto showed the numerous flags in her classroom and sarcastically stated, ""This is a public school. The LGBT community has gone too far.""

The teacher then grabbed the Maryland state flag and said, ""What the hell even is this? I can tell you one thing – I do not want my children exposed to whatever this flag represents.""

""Homeschool your kids before it's too late,"" Sciuto added.

The teacher deleted her TikTok account on Monday morning.

Sciuto posted a Reel to Facebook in October, which was also deleted on Monday, captioned, ""Public teachers r indoctrinating r kids with new pronouns.""

""It's me!"" Sciuto stated while lip-synching along to a song. ""I'm the problem.""

In addition to being a public school teacher, Sciuto performs stand-up comedy. In a Facebook post advertising her stand-up, the educator boasts, ""Come see what LibsOfTikTok, Newsmax, and at least two Maryland Municipalities tried and failed to dox HEADLINE.""

In another advertisement, Sciuto stated, ""I made a bunch of alt right ding dongs angry with rainbow decor, including some B listers such as Chaya Raichik (cartoon villain who runs @LibsOfTikTok on Twitter) and Eric Bolling, host of The Balance with Eric Bolling on Newsmax. Ben Shapiro hasn't seen me yet, but when he does rest assured he'll flip his yarmulke.""

"Rachel Levine claims no doctor disagrees with 'gender-affirming care' for children, says dissension is 'political'","Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, the leading transgender official in the Biden administration, claimed last week ""there is no argument"" against ""gender-affirming care"" for children.

What did Levine say?

Levine claimed in an interview with NPR on Saturday that the consensus among medical experts is that ""gender-affirming care"" is necessary.

Levine's assertion suggests that she believes every medical expert, across medical disciplines, believes that permitting children — who have not reached biological or cognitive maturity — to undergo potentially irreversible surgery or hormone therapy is the appropriate response to children who do not identify as their biological sex.

""There is no argument among medical professionals — pediatricians, pediatric endocrinologists, adolescent medicine physicians, adolescent psychiatrists, psychologists, etc. — about the value and the importance of gender-affirming care,"" Levine said.

Levine is a medical doctor trained in pediatrics and adolescent medicine.

Is Levine right?

Levine's claim is simply not true.

Just this month, the Florida Department of Health released a fact sheet disputing this claim, which is now the official position of the federal government thanks to the Biden administration.

The Florida DoH stated that due to a lack of ""conclusive evidence"" — particularly regarding the ""potential for long-term, irreversible effects"" — of providing children ""gender-affirming care,"" the state does not recommend ""social gender transition,"" the prescription of hormone therapy and puberty blockers, or gender reassignment surgery.

Levine addressed the Florida DoH fact sheet in the interview with NPR, unilaterally dismissing it as being based on ""political considerations."" She then claimed that her position is grounded in voluminous research and data, while claiming the position she opposes is not.

That is a dishonest claim, because there is a glaring shortage of data studying the long-term impacts of either position, which is why the Florida DoH said it would not recommend ""gender-affirming care."" The American Pediatrics Association admitted as much just four years ago. Not enough time has elapsed since then for the long-term impacts to be studied.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rachel-levine-no-argument-doctors-trangender-care-children,2022-05-02
LGBT protesters succeed in shutting down first Chick-fil-A in the United Kingdom,"According to the New York Times, LGBT advocacy groups in England have succeeded in convincing The Oracle shopping center in Reading not to renew Chick-fil-A's lease, leading the company to announce that it permanently close the Reading location at the end of this six month period.

Chick-fil-A opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Reading on October 10th. An LGBT group, Reading Pride, immediately sprang into action, organizing a protest called ""Get the Chick Out"" that was designed to close down the restaurant. As part of the protest, activists stood outside The Oracle shopping center and held signs and chanted at customers.

Reports indicated that in spite of the protests, the Reading Chick-fil-A was doing brisk business; however, management of The Oracle decided to cave to the protesters. In a statement released by Reading Pride, the group claimed that the mall had promised to ""review their selection process"" for future tenants in order to avoid angering the group in the future.

A spokesman for The Oracle declined to provide a comment on the issue to the Times.

While Chick-fil-A was initially reported to be considering an expansion into the London market, a spokesman for the company sounded a much more cautious note to the Times on the possibility of expanding elsewhere in England after the Reading experience, saying only, ""We are always looking and learning, and do so through pop-up locations, but nothing else to share right now.""

Chick-fil-A has likewise been the target of numerous protests by LGBT groups in the United States ever since the company's CEO Dan Cathy admitted in 2012 to donating groups that supported the ""biblical definition of the family unit,"" but has nonetheless grown to become the third-largest fast food chain in the country, behind only McDonald's and Starbucks, in spite of the fact that Chick-fil-A only operates six days a week and has far fewer locations than many fast food chains.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reading-england-chick-fil-a-closes,2019-10-19
Comedian Kevin Hart backs out of hosting Oscars following outrage over old tweets,"On Tuesday, stand-up comedian Kevin Hart was announced as the next host of the 91st Oscars ceremony in February. Hart accepted the honor, calling it ""the opportunity of a lifetime.""

Online critics balked at Hart being selected, calling him homophobic and pointing to a number of old tweets from the entertainer's past.

The comic backed out of the role on Thursday, saying he would rather step down than apologize at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' request. Later that day, he ultimately did issue a public apology to the gay community.

What are the details?

As news of old tweets from 2009 to 2011 went viral, several were deleted from Hart's Twitter account during the day on Thursday. Many contained gay slurs, which he reportedly stopped using on social media years ago.

After seeing this @benfraserlee tweet, I did a search for every time Kevin Hart tweeted ""fag,"" ""homo,"" or ""gay."" It was…a lot. And he seems to have basically stopped tweeting those words after 2011 — i.e. the year his first stand-up movie became a hit. https://t.co/P8nTOilFgxpic.twitter.com/6uzPhnvt4F

— Adam B. Vary (@adambvary) December 5, 2018

Hart initially responded to the backlash with an Instagram video, urging people to ""stop looking for reasons to be negative,"" saying, ""If u want to search my history or past and anger yourselves with what u find out that is fine with me.""

""My team calls me, 'Oh my God, Kevin, everyone's upset by tweets you did years ago.'"" the comedian says in the video. ""Guys, I'm nearly 40 years old. If you don't believe that people change, grow, evolve as they get older, I don't know what to tell you. If you want to hold people in a position where they always have to justify the past, do you. I'm the wrong guy, man.""

Hours later, Hart posted a second video on Instagram telling his followers that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had demanded he apologize for his past comments, threatening that they would otherwise find a new host.

""I chose to pass on the apology,"" Hart explained. ""The reason why I passed is because I've addressed this several times. This is not the first time this has come up. I've addressed it. I've spoken on it. I've said where the rights and wrongs were. I've said who I am now versus who I was then. I've done it. I'm not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I've moved on and I'm in a completely different place in my life.""

So, why did he back out?



As the fallout continued on social media, Hart announced on Twitter that he would back out of hosting the Oscars, saying he did not want to be a distraction to the ceremony and apologizing to the LGBT community for his past comments.

I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscar's....this is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.

— Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) December 7, 2018

I'm sorry that I hurt people.. I am evolving and want to continue to do so. My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart. Much love & appreciation to the Academy. I hope we can meet again.

Drag queen who goes by 'Annie Christ' reads to kids at public library as Drag Queen Story Time spreads,"If you're wondering whether or not the controversial Drag Queen Story Time phenomenon has been gaining or losing popularity, a video shot outside Pennsylvania's Lansdale Public Library this weekend should answer that question.

It showed two kids engaged in a counterprotest against those opposed to drag queens in full costume reading to children — and they chanted, ""Stop your hate! Drag is great!""

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

Other folks carried signs that read, ""God Thinks Drag Queens Are Fabulous"" and ""Love Is Love Is Love"" and chanted ""Love thy neighbor!""

'Annie Christ'



On Saturday morning inside the library, the individual reading books to children about tolerance and diversity went by Drag Queen Miss Annie, WPVI-TV reported.

But when performing for an adults-only crowd, this drag queen goes by ""Annie Christ"" — and wasn't pleased with protests against the story time.

""It's like an actor being in a rated-R movie not being able to read to kids,"" Annie Christ told WPVI. ""It's my side job; it's what I do at a club that's 21 and over.""

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

And despite the protests against the story time, WPVI said dozens of families flocked into the library outside Philadelphia to listen to the drag queen read.

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

What did others have to say?



""I wanna raise him to accept people and be nice to everyone,"" mother Missy Bonham told the station.

Tristan Bonham echoed that sentiment, telling WPVI ""treat people how you want to be treated.""

Outside the library, the station said police lined the middle of the street to separate opposing groups.

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

""Annie is in there sharing a message of acceptance and love and being able to be who we are,"" Elaine Ely told WPVI.

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

Marilyn Teed disagreed, telling the station ""little children, they think, 'Oh well, this is okay' when it's really not natural or normal.""

Albert Howard added to WPVI that ""If you want to do what you wanna do and be, that's fine. That's between you and God one day, but to teach the kids? No.""

Library Director Tom Meyer told the station people have been asking him why the library doesn't have Bible story times.



Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

""We do,"" he noted to WPVI. ""We've done it. It's happened.""

<br>

A broader look at the issue

Children-focused Drag Queen Story Times (or Hours, as they're also called) also have hit public libraries in Boston, Southern California, and Brooklyn, New York.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

One drag queen involved in pushing a story time reading for kids in Louisiana admitted that the events are meant to ""groom the next generation.""

LGBTQ activist S. Bear Bergman noted a similar sentiment in his 2015 Huffington Post piece, ""I Have Come to Indoctrinate Your Children Into My LGBTQ Agenda (And I'm Not a Bit Sorry).""

""I am here to tell you: All that time I said I wasn't indoctrinating anyone with my beliefs about gay and lesbian and bi and trans and queer people? That was a lie,"" Bergman wrote. ""All 25 years of my career as an LGBTQ activist, since the very first time as a 16-year-old I went and stood shaking and breathless in front of eleven people to talk about My Story, I have been on a consistent campaign of trying to change people's minds about us. I want to make them like us. That is absolutely my goal. I want to make your children like people like me and my family, even if that goes against the way you have interpreted the teachings of your religion.""

Kids are getting into the act, too



Some children also have gained notoriety by declaring themselves drag queens.

One started a kid-friendly drag club at his Brooklyn school.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Another child — Nemis Quinn Mélançon Golden — got into drag when he was 7, and then just a year later started going by his stage name ""Lactatia.""

""Anyone can do what they want in life,"" he told LGBT in the City on camera. ""It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. If you want to be a drag queen and your parents don't let you, you need new parents. If you want to be a drag queen and your friends don't let you, you need new friends.""

Hollywood big shot launching group that 'targets anti-LGBTQ candidates.' And he calls them out by name.,"Hollywood director and producer Ryan Murphy (""Glee,"" ""American Horror Story,"" ""Pose"") said he's launching a ""multi-million dollar organization that targets anti-LGBTQ candidates running for office"" — and called out his enemies by name during a Los Angeles event last week honoring the Trevor Project, a suicide hotline for LGBTQ youth.

""Why don't we consider ever targeting the people who are causing the problem here?"" he asked those gathered at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. ""The homophobes, the trans naysayers, and the small, restricted and dangerous minds who are causing so many young people to needlessly hate themselves and doubt themselves in our country, when what they should be receiving from us is love and support and understanding.""

Murphy — who recounted his difficulties as an ""out"" gay youth — encouraged his listeners to ""help the kids by showing the small-minded the door"" and noted that the midterm election results ""inspired"" him to do just that.

""One after one, anti-LGBTQ candidates who made hate speech and ideology part of their legacy fell away,"" he said to cheers from the audience. ""They were disgraced. ... The number was astounding to me ... over 20 anti-LGBTQ right-wing politicians and their horrifying views were gone in a day. Dana Rohrabacher. Mia Love. Jason Lewis. Pete Sessions. Gone. Bigots, all of them. And they were replaced by [Democratic] allies. New politicians who won't spread harmful and wrong rhetoric that can lead a young LGBTQ person to actually believe that they are not good enough or worthy enough to stay on this earth anymore.""

Murphy added: ""I want these hateful and wrong politicians to go and to stop polluting our moral and ethical ether.""



What's his plan?

Murphy said his show ""Pose"" on FX is rooted in ""activism"" and that it pledged all profits to ""trans-rights causes"" — and that the Pose Gives Back initiative has a new plan.



""In 2020, we're going to create and fund, with corporate sponsorship, a multi-million dollar organization that targets anti-LGBTQ candidates running for office,"" he said to more applause, adding that the group is going to target 20 ""senate and congressional candidates who think they can get votes by hurting and discriminating against us ... well, we can get votes too, and we can fight back.""

Murphy added, ""We are going to send a message which says you cannot make discrimination against us a political virtue anymore. You cannot keep killing our vulnerable young people by promoting and nationalizing your rural, close-minded, anti-constitutional viewpoints.""

Naming names

He then named some of the candidates the group will target.

""We say, 'Hello, Mike Lee.' The young, Ivy League-trained senator from Utah. Mr. Lee is a future leader of the GOP who just committed himself to the bad old days by introducing what has been called quote the vilest, anti-LGBTQ religious freedom bill of our time,"" Murphy said of the GOP senator. ""So we want to say, 'We see you, Mike Lee.'""

He also named Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) who's ""vying to become America's biggest bigot. His side business is rhetorical gay bashing. ... Let's show Rep. King that the queens are not having it.""

"Mayor cancels LGBTQ Pride flag raising at city hall. Now his administration is accused of 'blatant, unacceptable discrimination.'","The administration of Reading, Pennsylvania, has been accused of discrimination after Mayor Wally Scott canceled a gay pride flag-raising ceremony at city hall on Monday, WFMZ-TV reported.

Scott told the station he has nothing against the LGBTQ community but that displaying the Pride flag at city hall would be supporting a ""political movement"" — and no flags for political movements should fly at city hall.

""People don't realize how many people come here looking to put up flags for movements and stuff, and I'm just not part of that, and I don't think we should be,"" the Democrat added to WPVI-TV.

What did the LGBTQ community have to say?



The LGBT Center of Greater Reading issued a statement saying ""what was supposed to be a proud and historical moment"" turned into ""a show of blatant, unacceptable discrimination.""

""We are not a cause,"" the statement added. ""We are human beings protected by an anti-discrimination ordinance in the City of Reading.""

Berks Weekly posted video of spirited local reaction to the decision:

Orange County chairwoman pushes back against Democrats' calls to rename John Wayne Airport,"The chairwoman of the Orange County board of supervisors says John Wayne's name should stay put on the region's local airport, pushing back against Democrats' calls for the late actor's name to be scrapped over comments he made in an interview half a century ago.

What are the details?

On Friday, the OC Democratic Party passed a resolution calling for the name of the John Wayne Airport to be restored to the Orange County Airport, due to Wayne's ""white supremacist, anti-LGBT, and anti-Indigenous views.""

Wayne has been accused of holding bigoted views because of remarks he was quoted as saying to Playboy magazine during a 1971 interview that resurfaced last year, wherein he made controversial comments critical of black people, Native Americans, and homosexual men.

Calls to rename the airport come as institutions across the country have faced scrutiny for names or symbols linked to slavery amid weeks of protests over George Floyd's death and racial injustice.

But Michelle Steel, who serves as Second District Supervisor for Orange County and chairs the board, said Wayne should be remembered for the contributions he made to their community and the country — and argues the name of the John Wayne Airport should not be changed over his past statements.

Steel issued a statement Monday, saying:

John Wayne led the movement to make Orange County home to Vietnamese refugees, he was an ardent supporter of our men and women in uniform, and his family foundation has been a national leader in cancer research.



As an immigrant to our country, I am extremely sensitive to the actions and statements of people who perpetuate and make racist statements. The comments by John Wayne from 50 years ago are wrong and sad from someone who so many people across America hold in high regard.



While I have experienced racism first-hand, I do believe that a person should be judged on the totality of their actions and contributions to society which is why I support keeping the name John Wayne Airport.



John Wayne's contributions to families in Southern California and across America live on to this day. He personally worked to assist Vietnamese refugees resettle in America, many of whom still live here in Orange County. The John Wayne Cancer Foundation's investments in research have resulted in groundbreaking treatments and the establishment of a cancer institute in Santa Monica. Because of his dedication to our military and country, Mr. Wayne received both the Naval Heritage Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.

Anything else?

John Wayne's youngest son, Ethan Wayne, also spoke up to defend his father's legacy on Monday in the face of threats to rename the Orange County airport.

In a statement to Fox News, Ethan Wayne said, ""Let me make one thing clear: John Wayne was not a racist. I know that term is casually tossed around these days, but I take it very seriously. I also understand how we got to this point.

""There is no question that the words spoken by John Wayne in an interview 50 years ago have caused pain and anger,"" Wayne continued. ""They pained him as well, as he realized his true feelings were wrongly conveyed.""

Ethan added, ""Those who knew him, knew he judged everyone as an individual and believed everyone deserved an equal opportunity. He called out bigotry when he saw it. He hired and worked with people of all races, creeds, and sexual orientation. John Wayne stood for the very best for all of us — a society that doesn't discriminate against anyone seeking the American dream.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-orange-county-chairwoman-pushes-back-against-democrats-calls-to-rename-john-wayne-airport,2020-06-30
Pete Buttigieg gives advice on coming out as gay to 9-year-old boy,"Presidential candidate and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg advised a 9-year-old boy on how to come out to other people as gay at a campaign event Saturday night.

According to The Colorado Sun, the exchange took place at a rally in the town of Aurora, Colorado, on Saturday night. In one of the questions being pulled out of a bowl by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold (D), Buttigieg was asked by 9-year-old Zachary Ro, ""Thank you for being so brave; would you help me tell the world I'm gay too?""

Buttigieg responded to the question by praising the boy saying, ""I don't think you need a lot of advice from me on bravery; you seem pretty strong,"" to laughs, cheers and applause from the audience.

""It took me a long time to figure out how to tell even my best friend that I was gay, let alone go out there and tell the world,"" Buttigieg continued. ""And to see you willing to come to terms with who you are in a room full of a thousand people, thousands of people you've never met, that's really something.""

The openly gay candidate then proceeded to give the boy advice and encouragement about his decision to go public with the matter.

The first thing is, it won't always be easy. But that's okay, because you know who you are and that's really important.



The second thing I want you to know is that you'll never know who's taking their lead from you, who's watching you and deciding that they can be a little braver because you have been brave.



When I was trying to figure out who I was, I was afraid that who I was might mean that I could never make a difference. And what wound up happening instead is that it's a huge part of the difference I get to make. I never could have seen that coming, and you'll never know whose life you might be affecting right now just by standing here.

According to the Colorado Sun report, the crowd chanted ""love means love"" as the boy was brought to and from the event stage. Griswold also told the newspaper that the question was chosen out of the bowl at random, and that she didn't know it was going to come up.

After the event, the child told KDVR-TV that he felt ""inspired by Pete"" and also said that he thought the former mayor ""gave me some very good advice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-pete-buttigieg-gives-advice-on-coming-out-as-gay-to-nine-year-old-boy,2020-02-24
Straight Pride Parade in California next month? Council member says group behind it advocates 'hate crime stuff',"While it appears a controversial Straight Pride Parade is on track to take place Aug. 31 in Boston, another Straight Pride Parade might be coming to Modesto, California, next month.

But just don't ask council member Kristi Ah You to attend.

""I don't think we need to give a permit for anything that when you go to the [group's Internet] page it talks about whiteness, it talks about western civilization, it talks about being Caucasian,"" Ah You told KOVR-TV. ""That's all hate crime stuff to me; that's not OK.""

Image source: KOVR-TV video screenshot

The flyer calling attention to the parade reads, ""Join us to celebrate: Heterosexuality, Masculinity ~ Femininity, Babies — Born and Unborn, Western Civilization, Our Wonderful Country, Christianity. Celebrate Life!""

Image source: KOVR-TV video screenshot

The city of Modesto is considering awarding a permit for a Straight Pride march after the group behind it — the National Straight Pride Coalition — submitted an application to the event Aug. 24 in Graceada Park, the station said.

And it's been eliciting a lot of attention.

""We've been getting letters, emails, comments, and phone calls all day about it,"" Ah You added to KOVR.

What did a National Straight Pride Coalition representative have to say?



Don Grundmann of the National Straight Pride Coalition is organizing the event and told the station it's a cultural answer to their opponents — that is ""anyone that supports the LGBTQ lifestyle.""

""Essentially it boils down to two religious views of the world,"" Grundmann told KOVR. ""One is Christianity, which is represented by heterosexuality, a culture of life, and its opponent is the LGBT movement, which is represented by an opposing religion and an opposing view of life.""

The station added that when Grundmann was told that some in the LGBTQ community consider themselves Christians, he responded that ""there is no such thing as an LGBT Christian who stays LGBT.""

Hoping for a small turnout



While Ah You supports free speech, she told the station that the permit request isn't acceptable — and is hoping the event doesn't draw much attention.

""I think if we ignored it and let the people do whatever they're going to do, I think maybe four or five people would show up,"" Ah You, who represents District 3, noted to KOVR.

As for Grundmann, he told the station he'd like to see straight pride marches across America — and that a core group of supporters in Modesto are prepared to take part in the parade next month if the city approves it.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-straight-pride-parade-in-california-next-month-council-member-says-group-behind-it-advocates-hate-crime-stuff,2019-07-25
Watch: Rep. Nancy Mace outs transsexual extremist as a hypocrite who said SCOTUS justices 'should never have a peaceful moment in public again',"Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) exposed a transsexual activist's apparent hypocrisy during a House hearing Tuesday concerning ""anti-democratic extremist groups and the ongoing threat to democracy.""

Rules for thee, but not for me

The House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held its final hearing on the topic of ""Confronting Violent White Supremacy"" on Dec. 13, seeking to detail ""the consequences of inaction by contextualizing the proliferation of white nationalism and political violence.""



Republicans were permitted to invite one witness. Democrats invited five to speak.

Among the Democrats' witnesses was transsexual civil rights attorney and Harvard Law School clinical instructor Alejandra Caraballo.

Caraballo testified that there was a linkage between alleged ""extreme threats against the LGBTQ community"" and white supremacy, referencing the November Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs but omitting that it was allegedly perpetrated by a member of the LGBTQ community.

Caraballo suggested that efforts to shut down all-ages drag shows similarly had something to do with white supremacy and once again intimated a possible connection between anti-LGBT elements and the recent attack on power substations in North Carolina.

After Caraballo rattled off a number of grievances about the alleged extremist rhetoric endangering safety and democracy in America, subcommittee member Rep. Nancy Mace noted, ""Threats to our democracy come from those who seek to undermine our Constitution and our three branches of government.""

Mace added, ""We've got to take a stand to support the Constitution and the rule of law against those who debase our society with violence or harassment of government officials carrying out their constitutional duties.""

The congresswoman then posed a series of yes-or-no questions to the panelists, including ""Is rhetoric on social media a problem and a threat to our democracy?"" and ""Do you believe that rhetoric targeting officials with violence for carrying out their constitutional duties is a threat to democracy?""

Caraballo and the other panelists unanimously answered in the affirmative. Mace did not, however, appear to buy the transsexual extremist's answer.

Mace noted that only a few weeks after the attempted attack on a Supreme Court justice on June 25, Caraballo wrote in a now-deleted tweet, ""The 6 justices who overturned Roe should never know peace again.""

Caraballo's tweet went onto say, ""It is our civic duty to accost them every time they are in public. They are pariahs. Since women don’t have their rights, these justices should never have a peaceful moment in public again.""

After exposing Caraballo's apparent hypocrisy, Mace went farther, highlighting a tweet the transsexual extremist posted late last month, which said, ""It's so clear that Justice Alito is corrupt and SCOTUS as an institution is compromised. This is not a legitimate court issuing decisions. It's an organ of the far right that solely follows outcome determinative logic rather than any reasoned jurisprudence.""

Caraballo — who has called the Supreme Court ""christofascist"" and has routinely intimated on Twitter that riots are in order if gay activists don't get their way in the courts — was evasive when subsequently asked whether this particular instance of extremist rhetoric posed a threat to democracy.

The transsexual extremist claimed instead that these tweets had been provided without proper context.

Former Georgetown professor Asra Nomani, the only witness the Democrats did not invite to speak, observed the interaction firsthand.



Nomani later wrote, ""I sat next to this supposedly bad-ass keyboard #WokeArmy warrior Alejandra Caraballo @esqueer_ and I watched all of the fake keyboard courage just melt to mush when @RepNancyMace confronted Carabollo on the violent bravado. See what cowardice looks like.""

Mace indicated that her interest in virtual violent rhetoric across the political spectrum is not just a matter for professional and legal concern, but that it is also personal.

The congresswoman detailed how she had been ""accosted"" by a constituent in Washington on Jan. 5 — a traumatizing encounter Mace attributed to extremist rhetoric online.

""I carry a gun everywhere I go when I am in my district and I'm at home, because I know personally that rhetoric has consequences,"" said Mace.

She concluded by emphasizing ""that we have to call out the threats to our democracy emanating from where they come, whether it's the right or the left.""

Report: Disney will 'take action' against Texas for order calling 'sex-change' procedures for children 'child abuse',"As part of the Walt Disney Company's continuing effort to kowtow to its left-wing employees, the company will reportedly ""take action"" against Texas for the state's order to investigate ""sex-change"" procedures for transgender children as a form of child abuse.

The Daily Wire's Megan Basham reports that Disney CEO Bob Chapek led a company-wide meeting on Monday in which he apologized again for the company's initial neutrality toward Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill, which would ban teaching children in kindergarten through third grade about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Basham reports that Chapek thanked LGBT!+ employees for their feedback, admitted he made mistakes regarding the company's response to the Florida bill, and also said, ""The pain this community experienced was not just about this one piece of legislation but about not being there anytime this community has been hurt.”

The meeting reportedly featured a panel with speakers from LGBTQ+ activist groups and an address from Nadine Smith, the executive director of Equality Florida. A Disney staffer who spoke to the Daily Wire reportedly said the panel discussion was ""about wanting Disney to indoctrinate kids.""

After the discussion, the company's chief human resources officer, Paul Richardson, announced Disney will ""take action"" against Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott's order to have the state's Department of Family and Protective Services investigate reports of gender-dysphoric children undergoing ""sex change"" procedures as child abuse.

“Because of our presence in Texas, we want you to know that we’ve signed on to the Human Rights Campaign’s letter opposing the Texas bill that criminalizes parents who provide for their transgender children gender affirming care,” Richardson said, according to the Daily Wire.

The ""gender-affirming care"" Richardson referred to that is considered child abuse under Abbott's order would be ""sex-change procedures"" including castration, surgery to remove male genitals, surgeries to remove the female reproductive system, plastic surgeries to construct artificial genitals, so-called ""top surgery"" to remove female breasts, or any procedure that removes a ""healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue"" from children when not medically necessary.

Providing cross-sex hormones to children including puberty blockers, unnatural doses of testosterone for females, and unnatural doses of estrogen for males also potentially constitutes child abuse under Abbott's order.

The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ activist organization, purchased an ad in the Dallas Morning News earlier this month announcing that more than 60 major companies had signed on to its open letter opposing alleged ""hateful attacks"" against transgender people from Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The ad declares ""discrimination is bad for business."" It states, ""the recent attempt to criminalize a parent for helping their transgender child access medically necessary, age-appropriate healthcare in the state of Texas goes against the values of our companies. It’s not just wrong, it has an impact on our employees, our customers, their families and our work.”

Companies that signed on to the letter include Apple, Capital One, Dropbox, Google, IBM, IKEA, Meta, Microsoft, and more.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-disney-will-take-action-against-texas-for-order-calling-sex-change-procedures-for-children-child-abuse,2022-03-22
Report exposes Chick-fil-A's donations to the SPLC and other leftist groups,"Chick-fil-A reportedly donated $2,500 to the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2017, according to a new report.

The SPLC has designated Christian beliefs on same-sex marriage as ""hate.""

What are the details?

Tax records obtained by ProPublica reveal that Chick-fil-A made the donation in question.

Chick-fil-A also reportedly donated to the YWCA, which allegedly has a pro-choice stance, the New Leaders Council, which refers to itself as a ""hub of progressive millennial thought leadership,"" and other organizations with pro-choice ties.

Townhall reports that the restaurant chain also donated $50,000 to The Pace Center for Girls, which promotes a pro-choice stance.

""The education and advocacy group featured radical pro-abortion feminist Gloria Steinem ... as their keynote speaker for their most recent girls' Summit,"" Townhall writes.

Also, Chick-fil-A also reportedly donated to Chris 180, ""a pro-LGBT behavioral health and child welfare service agency.""

Earlier this month, the restaurant chain announced that it would restructure its charitable giving beginning in 2020, and would no longer fund organizations with traditional beliefs on human sexuality, such as the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian athletes.

Rodney Bullard, vice president of corporate responsibility and executive director of the Chick-fil-A foundation, said that they don't want to become ensconced in a ""cultural war.""

""We don't want our intent and our work to be encumbered by someone else's politics or cultural war,"" Bullard said. ""If something gets in the way of our mission, that is something that we are mindful of and cognizant of.""

What else?

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, encouraged Christians to take their business elsewhere following the news.

“Not only has Chick-fil-A abandoned donations to Christian groups including the Salvation Army, it has donated to one of the most extreme anti-Christian groups in America. Anyone who opposes the SPLC … is slandered and slapped with the 'extremist' label or even worse, their 'hate group' designation. It's time for Christians to find a fast food alternative to Chick-fil-A,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-exposes-chick-fil-a-donations-to-the-splc-and-other-leftist-groups,2019-11-27
"Republican bill in North Dakota would ban LGBT activists' reality-denying pronouns in state-funded organizations, including schools","Republican state Senator David Clemens has taken a stand against the systemic embrace and imposition of LGBT speech conventions in North Dakota, enraging activists.

Clemens, a Vietnam War veteran and father of four, introduced Senate Bill 2199 on Jan. 10 with fellow Republican Sens. Shawn Vedaa and Kent Weston, as well as Reps. Karen Anderson, Austen Schauer, and Bill Tveit.

The bill would require ""any entity receiving state funding, including a public school, an institution under the control of the state board of higher education, and a state agency or office,"" to use the pronouns referencing a given person's biological sex.

Accordingly, words referring to ""an individual, person, employer, employee, contestant, participant, member, student, or juvenile must be used in the context of that person's sex as determined at birth.""



If there is some confusion about a person's so-called ""gender identity,"" determination will be made on the basis of the individual's DNA.

This reality-affirming requirement would apply to the communications, policies, procedures, training, and records of state-funded institutions.

The penalty for using reality-denying pronouns in such documentation or policies is $1,500.

Clemens provided some clarity around the bill, stating, ""Say they’re a boy, but they come to school and say they’re a girl. As far as that school is concerned in this bill, that person is still a boy. If it becomes contested, the burden will be on the girl, the so-called girl, or the boy, to prove that he is a girl.""

The senator stressed that the bill would not ""outlaw an individual’s personal expression, but it does outlaw the use of public funds to promote or support anything that is contrary to a person’s biological sex at birth,"" to preclude state-funded organizations from ""promoting transgenderism.""

Republican Rep. Brandon Prichard intimated that this amounted to a defense of children's innocence, reported the Bismarck Tribune.

""There is a broader assault on children’s innocence in this country, and if somebody — if I don’t step up to it, I’m worried that no one else will,"" said Prichard.

KFYR reported that the bill did not pass the Republican-led state Senate Judiciary Committee, but since the committee lacks veto power, it will nevertheless advance to the Senate floor.

Activists keen on continuing to foist ideologically loaded neologisms on others are beside themselves.

Transsexual activist Katrina Koesterman of Tristate Transgender said the bill ""the general atmosphere of hostility and hatred towards the transgender community.""



Christina Sambor of the so-called ND Human Rights Coalition told KFYR, ""Respectfully, I see no way this law would pass any sort of legal challenge based on basic legal construction principles. It’s vague, fails to advance any legitimate state interests, and not only would cause impermissible, gender-based discrimination, its very purpose is gender-based discrimination.""

Some have taken to launching personal attacks, suggesting that Clemens looks like Captain Kangaroo, the titular character of a children's show that reportedly aired on CBS from 1955 to 1984.

The Bismarck Tribune noted that if this legislation fails, as many anticipate it will, there is hope yet with Republican Sen. Larry Luick's Senate Bill 2231.

Luick's bill — introduced at the request of the executive director of the state's Catholic Conference — would prohibit a government entity from requiring an employee to ""use an individual's preferred pronoun when addressing or mentioning the individual in work-related communications.""

Republican-dominated committee votes down South Dakota bill outlawing transgender medical treatments on children,"After the South Dakota House of Representatives passed a bill outlawing transgender medical procedures on children late last month, a state Senate committee — dominated by Republicans — voted down the bill Monday, which the Associated Press said likely means the Vulnerable Child Protection Act won't be considered by the legislature again this year.

The House passed the bill 46-23; the Senate committee voted it down 5-2, the AP said.

What are the details?

House Bill 1057 deems it illegal — a Class 1 misdemeanor — for doctors to perform gender-affirming operations or surgeries or prescribe hormone replacement therapy to assist gender transitions for anyone under the age of 16, Inforum reported, adding that the penalty for a Class 1 misdemeanor is a year in jail and a $2,000 maximum fine.

Here's what would be outlawed, Inforum noted:

Performing the following surgeries: castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, metoidioplasty, orchiectomy, penectomy, phalloplasty and vaginoplasty.

Performing a mastectomy.

Prescribing, dispensing, administering or otherwise supplying the following medications: Puberty-blocking medication to stop normal puberty, supraphysiologic doses of testosterone to females, supraphysiologic doses of estrogen to males.

Removing any otherwise healthy or non-diseased body part or tissue.

Conservative lawmakers in other states — South Carolina, Florida, Missouri, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, and New Hampshire — are pushing similar proposals, the AP said.

But some Republican state senators in South Dakota and the state's Republican Gov. Kristi Noem wondered about the prudence of moving forward with the bill, the outlet said, even though the GOP holds a super-majority in the Legislature.

More from the AP:

LGBT advocates and Democrats argued that the proposal would have stopped children with gender dysphoria from receiving medically necessary health care that improves their mental health. They demonstrated outside the Capitol before Monday's Senate Health and Human Services Committee meeting.



Quinncy Parke, a 17-year-old transgender teenager, testified before the committee and had one word to describe the feeling of seeing the bill die: ""ecstatic.""



""It's gone,"" Parke said. ""I don't have to worry about it until next year.""

What do the bill's backers have to say?

The sponsor of the legislation — Republican state Rep. Fred Deutsch — likened procedures that would have been outlawed to ""bizarre"" medical experiments conducted by the Nazis.

""To me, that's a crime against humanity when these procedures are done by these so-called doctors ... that dance on the edge of medicine,"" Deutsch told Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council recently. ""You know, I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor. I've had family members killed in Auschwitz. And I've seen the pictures of the bizarre medical experiments. I don't want that to happen to our kids. And that's what's going on right now.""

At first Deutsch doubled down on his controversial comments with the caveat that he wasn't likening doctors who treat transgender children to Nazis: ""I've been to a whole bunch of Holocaust museums all over the world. It's very personal to me. It's just a simple reflection that the pictures seem similar to me.""

But he soon told CNN he regretted the comparison: ""Comments I made based on my history of being the son of a Holocaust survivor are regrettable.""

Deutsch told the AP he wouldn't bring the issue again this year but added that the governor worked ""behind the scenes"" to oppose the bill.

""That's simply not accurate,"" Kristin Wileman, the governor's spokeswoman, told the outlet, adding that Noem never took a formal position on the bill.

What do the bill's opponents have to say?

Dozens protested outside the Capitol Monday, riding horses on the grounds, waving rainbow flags, and holding signs to support transgender people, the AP reported.

The outlet also said the South Dakota State Medical Association opposed the bill, arguing it discriminated against transgender people and interfered with physicians' ability to administer necessary medical treatment.

The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota also was against the bill — and applauded the committee's down vote, NBC News said.

""Though supporters claimed House Bill 1057 was aimed at protecting vulnerable youth, it was clearly fueled by a fear and misunderstanding of transgender South Dakotans,"" Libby Skarin, policy director for the group, told the network. ""It's time we stop these attacks and the very real harm they cause to transgender youth across our state. Let this be a signal to the South Dakota Legislature that discrimination against a marginalized group is a distraction from the needs of the state and hurts us all.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republican-dominated-committee-votes-down-south-dakota-bill-outlawing-transgender-medical-treatments-on-children,2020-02-11
12 Republicans vote with Democrats to advance bill codifying same-sex marriage into federal law,"One dozen Republican senators joined their Democratic colleagues on Wednesday to advance legislation protecting same-sex marriages.

Who are those Republicans?

By a vote of 62–37, the Senate advanced the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and codify into federal law same-sex and interracial marriages.

The Republican senators who support the bill are:

Roy Blunt (Mo.)

Richard M. Burr (N.C.)

Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.)

Susan Collins (Maine)

Joni Ernst (Iowa)

Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.)

Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)

Rob Portman (Ohio)

Dan Sullivan (Alaska)

Mitt Romney (Utah)

Thom Tillis (N.C.)

Todd Young (Ind.)

Congress began working to pass the bill this summer after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Pressure to codify the right to same-sex and interracial marriage was based on unrealistic fear that the Supreme Court may overturn landmark cases that legalized both types of marriage unions. But Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the opinion overturning Roe, made clear the court's ruling would not impact same-sex or interracial marriage.

Alito wrote:

The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.

The House passed the Respect for Marriage Act in July by a vote of 267–157, with the approval of 47 Republicans.

Before the bill becomes law, the Senate must formally approve it and send it back to the House for approval on amendments before it can head to President Joe Biden's desk.

Why did Republicans support it?

Romney, for example, explained he voted for the bill on legal principle, though he personally disagrees with same-sex relationships.

""While I believe in traditional marriage, Obergefell is and has been the law of the land upon which LGBTQ individuals have relied,"" Romney said in a statement. ""This legislation provides certainty to many LGBTQ Americans, and it signals that Congress—and I—esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.""

The Utah senator also praised the bill's protections of religious liberties.

In her statement, Collins said she supported the bill because it protects against discrimination and strengthens protections for religious liberty.

""This bill recognizes the unique and extraordinary importance of marriage on an individual and societal level,"" Collins said in a statement. ""It would help promote equality, prevent discrimination, and protect the rights of Americans in same-sex and interracial marriages. It would accomplish these goals while maintaining—and indeed strengthening—important religious liberty and conscience protections.""

The bill gained significant bipartisan support after a small bipartisan group of senators supported an amendment to protect religious liberties.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-support-respect-for-marriage-act,2022-11-17
Researchers claim that bachelorette parties are ruining LGBTQ+ safe spaces in Massachusetts – calling the process 'hetrification',"On Monday, two university educators warned readers of the Boston Globe that bachelorette party attendees in Provincetown, Massachusetts, are ""asserting their privilege"" in the local LGBT safe spaces. They accused these ""mostly white women"" of attempting to ""escape their straight world"" by attending local gay bars and drag shows during their festivities.

The two educators behind the op-ed are assistant professor of community health and director of the Health Promotion Center at York College Vincent Jones II and professor and director of gender, sexuality, and feminist studies at Middlebury College Laurie Essig.

Jones and Essig called bridal celebrations in LGBT spaces the process of ""hetrification,"" similar to gentrification. The educators blamed attendees of bachelorette events for ruining venues because they feel ""privileged to take over spaces of others.""

They claimed that, even though these women only ""temporarily invade"" queer spaces, their presence ""slowly diminishes the integrity of the space.""

The educators stated that these ""mostly white women"" want to celebrate in queer spaces to avoid ""the male gaze or sexual harassment.""

They wrote, ""The women are displaced by rape culture and seek refuge in queer spaces, but the queers are faced with tolerating the heterosexual gaze or not showing up at all.""

During their research, Jones and Essig discovered that the primary source of income for drag queens in the Provincetown area is bachelorette parties. They believe the influx of straight women enjoying these events is driving away members of the LGBT community.

Jones and Essig wrote, ""Many gay and lesbian spaces were the result of white gentrification of neighborhoods that were primarily Black and Latinx. But hetrification, unlike gentrification, is an appropriation not just of space, but of culture. According to our LGBTQ+ interviewees, the women suffer from a 'Will and Grace' complex. They think they can shout Cher lyrics and yell 'Yaaaasssss, Queen!' because they are welcomed into gay culture. Our research shows otherwise.""

The educators reported interviewing several bachelorette partygoers in Provincetown and were surprised to find that attendees were completely unaware that they were ""hetrifiers.""

Jones and Essig stated, ""The bachelorettes — all college-educated, well-off, and almost exclusively white — understood how hard the fight for gay rights is, and wanted to be respectful."" Nevertheless, the educators accused the women of ""post-homophobic homophobia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/researchers-warn-that-bachelorette-parties-are-ruining-lgbtq-safe-spaces-in-massachusetts-calling-the-process-hetrification,2022-08-09

People are upset a retailer offered an 'LGBT sandwich' to honor gay pride celebrations — but not for the reason you'd expect,"U.K. retailer Marks & Spencer is under fire after offering an ""LGBT"" sandwich to honor the nation's Pride celebrations.

The sandwich, which stands for ""lettuce,"" ""guacamole,"" ""bacon,"" and ""tomato,"" prompted many social media users to blast the company for comparing members of the LGBTQ community to ... well, to sandwiches.

What are the details?

According to the Daily Mail, Marks & Spencer launched the special edition sandwich to commemorate the year's LGBTQ Pride parade.

The sandwich's box reads in large letters ""LGBT,"" and features a rainbow-colored print.

The company charges about £3 per sandwich, and says it will donate more than £10,000 to LGBTQ-friendly charities.

The outlet reported that one consumer felt personally offended by the sandwich.

On Twitter, the user wrote, ""I felt so enraged I left. Basically equating us to a sandwich? Can't imagine them doing this with other marginalised groups.""

The outlet reported that another user wrote, ""Whilst it is 'good' a national company is raising awareness, this is blatant exploitation of a marginalised community for huge profit.""

British TV presenter Piers Morgan even weighed in on the offending sandwich.

""Gay sandwiches?"" he said. ""Is there no cynical virtue-signalling depth struggling companies now won't now plunge to make a profit?""

Morgan, a former CNN host, also added, ""So this magnificent gesture of pathetic tokenism will take them around ten minutes to pay off.""

He later added, ""I'm most cross on behalf of LGBT vegans & Muslims who've been further disenfranchised & marginalised by these bacon-laden gay sandwiches.""

Carrie Reiners of the Albert Kennedy Trust — which supports homeless members of the LGBTQ community and will benefit from the retailer's donation — expressed her glee at the retailer's effort.



She told the Daily Mail, ""We're thrilled to see M&S show visible support for the LGBTQ+ community this Pride, and are extremely grateful. The donation will enable us to continue providing safe homes and better futures for the young LGBTQ+ people we work with.""

Another social media user chimed in on the subject and wrote, ""Please stop taking extreme views you see on TV as representative for an entire demographic. Nobody is actually offended by a sandwich, the media want you to view LGBT ppl as snowflakes so they can invalidate very real LGBT issues/concerns!""

A spokesperson for the retailer said, ""The BLT is one of our most-loved sandwiches and we're really excited to give it a delicious twist for our customers to enjoy while celebrating Pride season.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/retailer-stirs-big-controversy-in-offering-lgbt-sandwich-to-honor-the-uks-pride-celebrations,2019-05-06
Faith-based retirement village denies lesbian couple’s request to move in. Couple sues — and loses.,"A married lesbian couple sued for discrimination when a Missouri retirement village denied their request for senior living — but a judge dismissed their case Wednesday.

What is the background?

Married couple Mary Walsh and Beverly Nance applied for housing at a St. Louis-area retirement community in July.

The village, Friendship Village Sunset Hills, which is a ""faith-based but nondenominational nonprofit"" independent living organization, denied their request.

Walsh said that she was disappointed with the decision and told the New York Times in August that she'd met people from within the community who seemed like they were very friendly.

""We'd met other people from the community, and they were very friendly,"" Walsh said. ""I was feeling good about it.""

The couple even went as far as putting down a $2,000 security deposit on their two-bedroom residence.

After reviewing the couple's application, the residence director at the facility called Walsh to inquire about the nature of her relationship with Nance.

""I said, 'We've been married since 2009,'"" Walsh told the outlet. ""[The director] said, 'I'm going to need to call you back.'""

The couple later received a parcel in the mail: the community's policy on cohabitation along with an application denial. According to the outlet, the policy placed certain limits on siblings, parents, grandchildren, and spouses — and same-sex relationships, married or not, did not fall within the approved policy guidelines.

""The term 'marriage' as used in this policy means the union of one man and one woman, as marriage is understood in the Bible,"" the policy stipulated, according to the Times.

So what did they do?

In response to the denial, Walsh and Nance filed a federal lawsuit claiming sex discrimination and that the community violated the Fair Housing Act and the Missouri Human Rights Act.

In a statement, attorney Julie Wilensky, of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said, ""Mary and Bev were denied housing for one reason and one reason only — because they were married to each other rather than to men.""

""This is exactly the type of sex discrimination the Fair Housing Act prohibits,"" Wilensky added. ""Their story demonstrates the kind of exclusion and discrimination still facing same-sex couples of all ages.""

ACLU of Missouri Legal Director Tony Rothert added, ""Mary and Bev were financially and otherwise qualified for residency in the Friendship Village community. Their exclusion from this community is the result of discrimination alone.""

Walsh concluded, ""We've been together for nearly 40 years and have spent our lives in St. Louis. We want to grow older here by each other's side. We should not be prevented from accessing the housing and care we need.""

The National Center for Lesbian Rights as well as the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri are representing the couple.

What is happening now?

According to a report by St. Louis Public Radio, U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton dismissed the case on Wednesday.

The report noted that Friendship Village cited its ""Cohabitation Policy"" as the reason for denying Walsh and Nance, and as a result, Hamilton dismissed the case.

The policy defines marriage in its biblical terms — between one man and one woman, as ""marriage is understood in the Bible.""

In a memo, Hamilton wrote, ""the Court finds the claims boil down to those of discrimination based on sexual orientation rather than sex alone.""

In a statement to the outlet, Walsh said, ""We are disappointed by the court's decision. Bev and I are considering our next steps, and will discuss this with our attorneys.""

Arlene Zarembka, a lawyer for Walsh and Nance, said, ""Friendship Village's denial of housing to Mary and Bev because they are two women — not a man and a woman — is discrimination 'because of sex' in the most literal sense. That Mary and Bev are lesbians doesn't change this analysis.""

Neither the Fair Housing Act or the Missouri Human Rights Act prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation — only on the basis of sex.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/retirement-village-rejects-lesbian-couples,2019-01-17
Puerto Rico's governor stumbles through disastrous Fox News interview as hundreds of thousands protest,"Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello did not appear prepared for the very difficult questions that he faced in a disastrous Fox News interview as hundreds of thousands are demanding his resignation.

Shepard Smith grilled the governor over the growing scandal from leaked texts that showed him making insulting and sexist jokes while the citizens of Puerto Rico suffered and died from the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

""I've heard numerous Puerto Ricans say that you've disrespected them, that you have not led them properly, that you've made fun of them, that you've made light of them, that they can't trust in your leadership,"" said Smith.

""For example, you had 660,000 votes to be governor of Puerto Rico, by all estimates there are more than that on the streets of Puerto Rico today, demanding that you step down,"" he added.

Rosello responded that he was not making light of the protests, but instead issued a list of proposals he was making to address the issues being raised about corruption.

""Mistakes are things that you do that you didn't mean to do, or that you did by accident or in error, and then you go back and you correct them,"" Smith said.

""900 pages of attacks on people of your own island are arguably not mistakes, they're a pattern,"" continued Smith. ""And when you look at that pattern, if that were some other politician other than you, what would you say about that person? Would you want that person leading you after all that you said to those other officials that you have now dismissed summarily?""

Rossello answered that he would want his record, actions, and efforts to speak for themselves. He also said that he made large inroads to increasing LGBT awareness on Puerto Rico.

Smith asked Rossello if he wanted to apologize during the interview, but the governor instead stumbled through a list of people to to which he already apologized.

The segment was the first one-on-one interview since the beginning of the massive protests against his governorship. Rossello once again gave no indication that he was considering resigning despite the increasing pressure on his administration.

DeSantis trounces potential challengers in poll,"A Saint Leo University Polling Institute survey of Florida residents found that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis enjoys a sizable lead over several potential gubernatorial election rivals.

When the poll pitted DeSantis against Democrat Nikki Fried, the state's Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services, DeSantis scored 50.6% support compared to Fried's 27%, while 22.4% of respondents were unsure.

In a matchup against U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fl.), who previously served as Florida governor from early 2007 until early 2011, 49.2% indicated they would support DeSantis, while just 32.8% opted for Crist, and 18% were unsure. Crist was a Republican when he was elected to serve as governor, but later lost a 2010 U.S. Senate bid while running as an independent — he is now a Democrat.

And between DeSantis and Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo (D), 48.6% picked DeSantis, while just 29.6% chose Taddeo, and 21.8% were unsure.

Respondents were given names, but were not supplied with descriptions or party affiliations, according to the Saint Leo University Polling Institute. The online poll occurred between Feb. 28 and March 12, and has a 4.5% margin of error.

""Being close to 50 percent in all three of the races means that he is in relatively powerful position moving forward, but we should expect tightening once the Dems pick their nominee,"" said Saint Leo University Polling Institute director Frank Orlando.

The poll also found that DeSantis has a 58.8% job approval rating — while 37.4% strongly approve, 21.4% somewhat approve, 11.4% somewhat disapprove, and 25.4% strongly disapprove.



The poll results indicate that DeSantis, who is running for re-election this year, is poised to trounce his competition during the upcoming gubernatorial contest.



""While he gets lots of national attention for provoking the ire of liberals on things like masking, it doesn’t seem to hurt him in Florida, and in fact continues to raise his national profile,"" Orlando said.



On Monday, DeSantis signed the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, which includes a provision that prohibits teaching children about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.



""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,"" the text states.

Critics have been decrying the legislation.

Chasten Buttigieg, the husband of U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, claimed that DeSantis had signed legislation making it unlawful to recognize the ""existence"" of LGBT people.

Disney issued a statement vowing to push for the legislation to either be repealed by the state legislature or overturned in the courts.

""This state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of Florida. It is not based on the demands of California corporate executives. They do not run this state. They do not control this state,"" DeSantis declared on Tuesday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ron-desantis-leads-potential-dem-rivals-in-poll,2022-03-30
'Harry Potter' author J.K. Rowling doubles down on her transgender heresy and woke Twitter is melting down,"Author J.K. Rowling, the creator of the celebrated 'Harry Potter' book series, doubled down on her disagreement with the transgender agenda and the social justice warrior corner of Twitter melted down in response.

Rowling wrote an essay and posted it with the tweet message, ""TERF wars."" TERF is an acronym used as an epithet by transgender activists to denigrate women who disagree with their agenda. It stands for ""Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminists.""

In the lengthy essay, Rowling described how she became a targeted enemy of the transgender lobby while investigating the issue of transgender rights. She also says that she has gotten an avalanche support from those concerned about the ramifications of the transgender political effort.

""Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they're most likely to be killed by sexual partners,"" she wrote.

""So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman – and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside,"" she explained.

""That is the simple truth,"" she concluded.

'The worst kind of transphobe'

Allies of the transgender political movement were incensed that Rowling persisted in her denial of their agenda, and they reacted very negatively on social media.

""...J.K. Rowling is the worst kind of transphobe, because she somehow has convinced herself that she has love & compassion for trans people while simultaneously denying our humanity & relentlessly attacking us,"" replied trans activist Serena Daniari.

""She should just admit she hates trans people,"" Daniari added.



Vox Media critic Emily VanDerWerff called the essay ""dangerous hogwash"" that will hurt transgender people.

""Do NOT read #JKRowling 's transphobia manifesto. I already did it for you. Every line is misinformation, fear mongering, misgendering, othering, ignorance, far right language/dog whistles, and pure hate. It's not just ugly,"" responded artist Tess Fowler.

""This is HATE. Don't ingest this BS. I beg you,"" she added.



Rowling had previously been a hero in LGBT circles for declaring that Albus Dumbledore, one of the central characters of the Harry Potter series, was gay.

Rutgers professor tells student not to cite the Bible in essays because of the ‘separation of church and state’,"A Rutgers University-New Brunswick professor told a student that he should not quote Bible verses in essays because of the ""separation of church and state,"" Campus Reform reported.

The professor also added that the Bible ""may not be for everyone"" and its use in academic papers may be offensive to some, including ""a Muslim or Jewish person.""

What are the details?

The student, Peter Cordi, cited a Bible verse while writing about a friend who struggles with his homosexual identity in an autobiographical paper assigned to him in his ""Intro to Gender, Race, and Sexuality"" class last semester.

In the paper, Cordi discussed his friend's relationship with his mother, who allegedly uses her Christian beliefs to justify a certain opinion about those in the LGBT community.

Cordi, himself a Christian, but one who disagrees with his friend's mother's views, quoted the popular Bible verse John 3:16 to support his position. The verse says, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.""

When Cordi received his graded paper, he noticed the professor, Kathe Sandler, had included a comment on his Bible citation.

""Avoid quoting scripture in academic papers unless you are commenting on scripture,"" Sandler wrote.

Confused by the comment, Cordi decided to reach out to Sandler over email requesting further explanation. Sandler agreed to meet in person.

Campus Reform reported that, according to a recording of the conversation, at the meeting, Sandler is heard ""elaborating on her written remarks by reminding Cordi of 'separation of church and state' and that the Bible 'may not be for everyone.'""

The outlet noted that Cordi asked the professor if she was offended by the use of scripture. She replied, ""I think for instance this wouldn't work for a Muslim or Jewish person.""

Anything else?

Other students at Rutgers University were also uncomfortable with professor Sandler's remarks.

""Students at any institution should be encouraged to research and utilize any sources that they deem relevant to the topic at hand. Many universities within the United States have accepted a dangerous and narrow-minded rhetoric, such as prohibiting Bible scripture, which often leads to a biased and one-sided culture,"" one student told Campus Reform.

""A person should be able to quote whatever he pleases, either for or against his argument. [The] Bible would be an excellent source of quotes as many people are well versed with the scripture, and feel deeply connected to the words of the Bible,"" another added, himself an atheist.

Cordi said that his right to free speech and religion has been violated. He also agued that the separation of church and state has nothing to do with quoting the Bible in an academic paper, saying it ""is supposed to protect the church from the state.""

However, during the meeting, Sandler allegedly insisted that quoting the Bible was not necessary, asking, ""Do you need the scriptures? Do you really need the scripture?""

Sandler did at least admit her view was a ""personal opinion,"" though her lack of understanding of the separation of church and state is not what most people expect from a university professor.

In a 2018 op-ed for Time, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, offered a helpful explainer on the separation of church and state.

In the op-ed, they note that Thomas Jefferson's famous phrase came in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut and was meant to reassure them that the state could not infringe upon their right to free exercise of religion.

""'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…' ""This, [Jefferson] said, built a 'wall of separation of church and state,'"" the op-ed said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rutgers-professor-separation-of-church-and-state,2020-01-03
"Creator of 'Dahmer' series unloads on Netflix for caving to outrage, removing 'LGBTQ' tag: 'I didn't like it'","Ryan Murphy, the Hollywood director who co-created the recent series on serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, recently condemned Netflix for bowing to woke critics.

What is the background?

In late September, Netflix removed its ""LGBTQ"" tag from ""Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,"" the dramatized biographical film of the infamous serial killer.

The streaming platform presumably attached the ""LGBTQ"" tag to the show because Dahmer was a gay man who primarily preyed upon other gay men, as well as racial minorities and underage boys.

What did Murphy say?

Speaking in an extensive interview with the New York Times, Murphy criticized Netflix for removing the LGBTQ tag from his show.

In fact, Murphy claimed that Netflix officials told him specifically that they removed the tag because of the backlash they had received for attaching it in the first place.

""The rule of my career has been: The more specific you are, the more universal you can become,"" he told the Times.

""I also don’t think that all gay stories have to be happy stories,"" he explained. ""There was a moment on Netflix where they removed the LGBTQ tag from ‘Dahmer,’ and I didn’t like it and I asked why they did that, and they said because people were upset because it was an upsetting story. I was, like, ‘Well, yeah.’

""But it was a story of a gay man and, more importantly, his gay victims,"" Murphy said.

Moreover, Murphy said he believes the way that he told Dahmer's story highlighted how white privilege allowed Dahmer to get away with victimizing gay people and racial minorities.

From the Times:

Mr. Murphy said he did the story to shed light on the racism and homophobia that pervaded the case, at the victims’ expense, and because “it was the biggest thing I’ve ever seen that really sort of examines how easy it is to get away with things with the white privilege aspects.”

California-based Salesforce pledges to help employees relocate out of Texas over abortion law; Gov. Newsom responds,"Salesforce, the San Francisco-based software company, is offering to relocate employees out of Texas over the Lone Star State's controversial abortion law.

The Supreme Court recently declined to block the law, which bans abortions of unborn babies with a fetal heartbeat.

What did Salesforce do?

In a company-wide message sent last Friday, Salesforce told its employees the company would assist any employee who wants to relocate from Texas because of the law.

The message, which was obtained by CNBC, said:

These are incredibly personal issues that directly impact many of us — especially women. We recognize and respect that we all have deeply held and different perspectives. As a company, we stand with all of our women at Salesforce and everywhere.



With that being said, if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family.

After news of Salesforce's offer broke, company CEO Marc Benioff tweeted, ""Ohana if you want to move we'll help you exit TX. Your choice."" Ohana, a word Benioff frequently uses, is a Hawaiian term that means ""family.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) responded to Benioff, ""Welcome to California.""

Benioff and Salesforce have made it clear before where they stand politically. In 2015, the company essentially launched a boycott of the state of Indiana over then-Gov. Mike Pence signing into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics said would lead to LGBT discrimination.

""Today we are canceling all programs that require our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face discrimination,"" Benioff said in March 2015.

Anything else?

Other San Francisco-based companies, like Uber and Lyft, have said they will pay the legal fees of any Texas drivers who incur fines related to the law. Under the law, ride-sharing drivers could face fines of up to $10,000 if they drive a woman to an abortion clinic.

""This law is incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,"" the founders of Lyft and the company's general counsel said.

Salvation Army offers no-nonsense response to news that Chick-fil-A is divorcing 'anti-LGBTQ' charities,"The Salvation Army isn't going to allow their good name to be tarnished in the wake of Chick-fil-A's announcement that it would be no longer supporting ""anti-LGBTQ"" charities such as Christian organization the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

On Monday, the fast-food company made the announcement revealing that it would not longer make donations to charities with traditional views on human sexuality. The move came after the company endured ""years of bad press and protests from the LGBT community.""

You can read more on the stunning move here.

What did the Salvation Army say?

In a statement to CNN, the organization warned against knee-jerk assumptions about the longtime charity.

""We're saddened to learn that a corporate partner has felt it necessary to divert funding to other hunger, education and homelessness organizations — areas in which the Salvation Army, as the largest social services provider in the world, is already fully committed,"" the organization's statement read.

""When misinformation is perpetuated without fact, our ability to serve those in need, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or any other factor, is at risk,"" the statement continued. ""We urge the public to seek the truth before rushing to ill-informed judgment and greatly appreciate those partners and donors who ensure that anyone who needs our help feels safe and comfortable to come through our doors.""

What else?



This is the second time in as many weeks that the Christian organization has had to defend itself and its good deeds.

Last week, United Kingdom performer Ellie Goulding threatened to pull out of the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day halftime performance in Arlington, Texas, unless the Salvation Army — which has been promoted by the Cowboys' annual game since 1997 — made a donation or a pledge to the LGBTQ community.

The Cowboys will face off against the Buffalo Bills, and the game will feature the Red Kettle Kickoff halftime show, which raises money for the Salvation Army.

""We'd like to thank Ellie Goulding and her fans for shedding light on misconceptions and encouraging others to learn the truth about The Salvation Army's mission to serve all, without discrimination,"" Commissioner David Hudson, national commander of the Salvation Army, said in a statement.

""We applaud her for taking the time to learn about the services we provide to the LGBTQ community,"" Hudson added. ""Regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity, we're committed to serving anyone in need. Every day, we provide services such as shelter for the transgender community and resources for homeless youth — 40 percent of whom identify as gay or transgender.""

""Ellie's performance in the 23rd annual Salvation Army Red Kettle Kickoff during the Dallas Cowboys game Thanksgiving Day on CBS will kick off a season of giving that helps support these and many other programs and services throughout the country,"" his statement concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/salvation-army-responds-to-chick-fil-a,2019-11-18
San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus takes down 'we'll convert your children' music video after group says it received 'threats of harm',"The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus set a music video to private after the group said it received ""threats of harm"" over the song that repeats the lines ""we'll convert your children"" and ""we're coming for your children"" numerous times.

Chorus director Chris Verdugo told Yahoo Life the tune — ""A Message from the Gay Community"" — is ""satirical.""

What's the background?

The SFGMC posted the video on its YouTube page July 1. It begins with one singer introducing the tune by saying, ""As we celebrate Pride and progress we've made over these past years, there's still work to be done. So to those of you out there who are still working against equal rights, we have a message for you.""

Then the singing begins:

You think we're sinful

You fight against our rights

You say we all lead lives you can't respect

But you're just frightened

You think that we'll corrupt your kids

If our agenda goes unchecked

Funny, just this once, you're correct



We'll convert your children

Happens bit by bit

Quietly and subtly

And you will barely notice it

You can keep them from disco

Warn about San Francisco

Make 'em wear pleated pants

We don't care

We'll convert your children

We'll make them tolerant and fair

The full chorus also sings:

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

We're coming for them

We're coming for them

We're coming for your children

For your children

While the original clip is not viewable, it has been posted elsewhere:

""A Message From the Gay Community Performed by the San Francisco Gay Mens Chorus"" www.youtube.com

'Threats of harm'

Yahoo Life wrote that ""not everyone got the joke"" and said that after the video ""went viral"" it ""was then lambasted by conservative media for its child-focused theme, even prompting death threats against the vocalists ..."" The ""conservative media"" link is for TheBlaze's Wednesday story; the ""lambasted"" link is for Rod Dreher's piece in the American Conservative.

Verdugo told Yahoo Life that it was a ""difficult decision"" to set the video to private ""because we are an organization whose mission really is both artistic but also activist. We are the first gay men's chorus on the planet. … We are a social justice organization … so it's very difficult for us to decide to take down that video. But the soloists — who are not in the chorus but, in their own right, rising Broadway stars, have received death threats.""

Yahoo Life also reported that ""critics have used various Twitter accounts to take screenshots of the chorus, numbered the individuals and created spreadsheets, harassing them, even at their places of work.""

""All over a satirical piece of music,"" Verdugo said, according to the outlet.

The SFGMC on Thursday issued a statement on the issue that reads, in part:

The far-right conservative media found our ""Message..."" video and have taken it as their cause. This has all happened in the last 24 hours and it continues to pick up steam. They have taken the lyrics out of context to support a narrative that suits their intolerant and hateful needs. It is obvious the tongue-in-cheek humor is lost on many. As a result, we have seen the user comments on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram become increasingly alarming. Emails to individuals and the chorus office are vitriolic – including threats of harm.



We feel the first action we must take to keep everyone involved with the chorus and the making of this video safe is to turn the video to private. We are communicating with law-enforcement both locally and nationally. We will not be threatened and we follow legal steps to act on those threats. We will always accept others who may hold different values, but when violence is their choice of expression, since 1969 we have not backed down. After decades of children being indoctrinated and taught intolerance for anyone who is ""other,"" from using the Bible as a weapon to reparative therapy, it's our turn. We have dedicated ourselves to being role models, teaching, and spreading the message of love, tolerance and celebration through our music.



Our second action is to work to control the narrative. The video is being illegally copied and placed on YouTube, Instagram and other websites. Others have the right to follow Fair Use laws, but that is not what is happening here. Therefore, our social media and marketing staff are working around the clock to alert moderators at YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and to file DMCA's (take down of websites featuring stolen content). So far, this has been very successful.

Interesting conclusion

Verdugo told Yahoo Life he didn't think the song would elicit the degree of negative reaction it did.

""It's a lightning rod,"" he acknowledged to the outlet, in regard to what Yahoo Life said were ""the risks of referencing anything gay and child-related in the same breath.""

However, Verdugo also told the outlet that the song ""came from a very innocent place. We weren't trying to antagonize anyone … we never thought it would — and perhaps that's on us.""

At least one child drag queen likes the song

Remember child drag queen Desmond Is Amazing? The kid made many headlines over the past few years in relation to his drag pursuits.

Well, Desmond happens to love the SFGMC's song and said so on Facebook:

Pushback



Despite the SFGMC's vehement defense of the song, not everyone is buying it.

Becket Adams, a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner, took issue with the response of gay men's chorus and let them have it:

Dreher in his piece noted that ""what these smart-asses in San Francisco did was make a satirical song and video that would win them plaudits in their own circles by making fun of normies ... the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus said the quiet part out loud. Sure, they say in the video that they're talking about converting them into being 'tolerant and fair,' but that is not at all how it will be received. ...""

He added, ""The contempt these men show towards parents who don't think like them is at the heart of this. The taunting that says, whatever your religious beliefs, we are going to steal the hearts and minds of your children, and there is nothing you hicks can do to stop us. It gives the game away. It gives the game away for them, and for all their corporate allies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-francisco-gay-mens-chorus-pulls-video-threats,2021-07-09
California airport to open a Chick-fil-A — but city council isn’t happy: Make it the ‘gayest Chick-fil-A in the country’,"Council members in San Jose, California, aren't happy that a Chick-fil-A is set to open at the Mineta San Jose International Airport in May.

The franchise's airport site approval went through in 2018 for a period of six years, but city council members are regretting the move.

Now the council is saying that they will not approve any extensions for the franchise, and the business will remain open only under a six-year operations deal.

What are the details?

The planned opening of the restaurant has drawn protests and sparked outrage among city council members.

Taking their ire even further, the city council placed LGBTQ flags all around the airport in hopes of making it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country,"" according to one member, to rail against the company's supposed ""anti-LGBT stance.""

Ken Yeager, an openly gay former county supervisor, told the San Jose Spotlight that he was heartsick over the opening of the restaurant.

""My heart just sank when I saw the construction wall [at the airport],"" he said. ""I've been doing LGBTQ rights activities for 35 years. I remember when this city was not welcoming, and we've come a long way. I feel like this is a throwback to those times.""

Council member Pam Foley said that her brother died of AIDS more than two decades ago, and Chick-fil-A's presence personally affects her.

""When I hear of an injustice specifically to the LGBTQ community, I take it to heart,"" she explained. ""Going forward, I hope that we are very sensitive as it relates to all of our diverse populations.""

According to KTVU-TV, Yeager added, ""This is going to be people's first impression of San Jose and what are they going to see is a store that is known for its anti-gay attitudes.""

Council members also said that they rejected the business' extension bid because it would not open on Sundays, which is reportedly one of the airport's busiest travel days.

City Attorney Rick Doyle reportedly suggested that the council members not reject the company's bid on religious or political grounds — as it would possibly violate First Amendment rights — so the council reportedly rejected the extension bid based on the fact that the company is not open on Sundays.

What else?

In March, San Antonio International Airport in Texas announced that Chick-fil-A would not be permitted to operate at the airport, nixing plans for a potential site.

The airport blamed the decision on the company's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ"" behaviors.""

That same month, an airport in Buffalo, New York, made a similar announcement, blaming the decision on allegations that the business doesn't adhere to anti-discrimination policies.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-jose-airport-chick-fil-a,2019-04-10
'Save Chick-fil-A' bill heads to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's desk,"The ""Save Chick-fil-A"" bill passed both houses of the Texas Legislature Monday. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign it when it reaches his desk.

What's the background?

On March 21, the San Antonio City Council blocked Chick-fil-A from opening a franchise location in the city's airport.

""San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior,"" Councilman Robert Treviño told KTSA-FM.

One of the criticisms brought up against Chick-fil-A by the city council was that its foundation had donated in the past to groups, including the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, that had policies in place that professed traditional views on marriage.

In 2012, the restaurant chain came under fire for saying that CEO Dan Cathy personally opposed same-sex marriage, prompting boycotts of the company by pro-LGBT groups.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced March 28 that he would be investigating the city council's decision. He tweeted that he thought the move was ""discriminatory"" along with a picture of Chick-fil-A waffle fries and the slogan ""COME AND TAKE IT"" on a flag. That particular slogan and flag refers to the Battle of Gonzales during the Texas Revolution, when Texans refused to turn over a cannon to the Mexican army.

What happened with this bill?



On Monday, the bill passed the state Senate by a vote of 79 to 62, with two senators abstaining. Although it has come to be known by the monicker ""Save Chick-Fil-A,"" Senate Bill 1978 was filed a few weeks before the San Antonio City Council announced its decision regarding the restaurant.

Texas state Rep. Matt Krause (R), who sponsored the bill in the state House, said that it will prevent the government from treating companies like Chick-fil-A unfairly.

""What we want to make sure is if you donate to the Salvation Army, you won't be labeled as a bigoted,"" he told the Dallas Morning News.

But Rep. Julie Johnson (D) said the bill sends a message that ""poisons this state,"" adding, ""It sends a message that Texas is not open and welcoming to all. It puts Texas on the wrong side of history.""

What happens now?

The last step before the bill heads to Abbott's desk will be a Senate vote on an amendment to the bill from the Texas state House. Once it reaches him, Abbott, a staunch conservative, is expected to sign the bill into law.

On March 28, Abbott tweeted that he thought San Antonio's ban ""has the stench of religious discrimination against Chick-fil-A.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/save-chick-fil-a-bill-in-texas,2019-05-20
MSNBC host quickly walks back praise for pro-life Tony Dungy after being informed of controversial tweet,"MSNBC host Joe Scarborough walked back a defense of Tony Dungy on Monday after being told about a controversial tweet the former NFL coach posted last week.

What is the background?

Last week, Dungy responded to a proposal from Minnesota state Rep. Sandra Feist (D) that female menstrual items be placed in boys' bathrooms in schools by claiming that some schools have installed litter boxes in bathrooms.

""That's nothing,"" Dungy wrote in a now-deleted tweet. ""Some school districts are putting litter boxes in the school bathrooms for students who identify as cats. Very important to address every student's needs.""

The claim about litter boxes has been debunked. Dungy, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, later apologized for his tweet, which critics condemned as being anti-LGBT.

What happened on MSNBC?

On ""Morning Joe,"" Scarborough defended Dungy from criticism for speaking at the annual March For Life rally in Washington last week and praised him for standing on his principles.

He said:

Tony Dungy, great former coach and great analyst— he decided to go to the pro-life march in Washington. There were columns written about him, comparing everybody at the pro-life march to Q-Anon, to truthers, to Jan. 6th types.



No. Tony Dungy has talked about his beliefs, he’s talked about his faith, and he’s pro-life. Forty percent of Americans, according to the latest Gallup poll, are pro-life. Do we push him to that side of the conversation? Or do we figure out a way to let a guy have his own beliefs, that 40% of Americans have as well, and still be on TV without catching a lot of crap because he decides he wants to go to a pro-life march?

A forceful defense, no doubt — that Scarborough quickly walked back after being informed about Dungy's controversial ""litter box"" tweet.

""A couple of follow-ups: First of all, you said we have to admit when we make mistakes. Well — let's just say when I talked about Tony Dungy, it was incomplete,” Scarborough said.

""I had read tweets about how he had been attacked for going to the pro-life march, but also, Alex just sent me this: ‘Tony Dungy apologizes after spreading debunked anti-transgender conspiracy theories,'"" he continued. ""So, there’s two sides to that story, or actually, multiple stories this weekend about Tony Dungy, so let me put that out there.""

School district under federal investigation for removal of LGBT+ library books,"The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation earlier this month into a Texas school district regarding its removal of LGBT-themed library books, the Texas Tribune reported.



Granbury Independent School District is under federal investigation for allegedly violating Title IX, which safeguards students from discrimination based on sex, gender, and sexual orientation.

What's the background?

In January, a leaked audio recording captured Superintendent Jeremy Glenn informing the district's librarians that there would be a thorough review of specific titles on the library shelves. He noted that a review committee of parents and educators would be formed to remove books that included content inappropriate for children.

""I don't want a kid picking up a book, whether it's about homosexuality or heterosexuality, and reading about how to hook up sexually in our libraries,"" Glenn said. ""If they want to get more information about how to become transgender, or sex, go to the public library. There's no place for it in our libraries.""

Glenn stated that the district would focus on reviewing books containing sexual themes and gender ideology content. According to the superintendent, the school board and concerned parents requested the book review.

""Granbury is in a very, very conservative community. And our board is very, very conservative,"" Glenn added. ""If it is not what you believe, you better hide it. Because it ain't changing in Granbury. And here, in this community, we're going to be conservative.""

According to the district, the review process resulted in eight books being removed from school libraries.

""Two of the eight books did have LGBTQ+ themes, however all of the books that were removed had sexually explicit and/or pervasively vulgar content,"" the district stated.

In July, the ACLU launched a complaint against the district and accused Glenn's comments of creating a ""pervasively hostile"" environment for LGBT+ students.

""In this case it was made very clear, because the superintendent kind of said the quiet part out loud,"" Chloe Kempf, an ACLU attorney, told the Texas Tribune. ""It's pretty clear that that kind of motivation is animating a lot of these policies nationwide.""

""These comments, combined with the book removals, really send a message to LGBTQ students in the districts that: 'You don't belong here. Your existence is shameful. It should be censored,'"" Kempf added.

If the federal investigation finds that Granbury ISD violated Title IX, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights can force the district to make policy changes.

Neither Glenn nor the Granbury Independent School District replied to a request for comment, the Texas Tribune reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-district-under-federal-investigation-for-removal-of-lgbt-library-books,2022-12-21
School suspends Christian student who posted Bible verses in response to LGBTQ pride flags — and her video goes viral,"An Ohio high school student says that her school suspended her for posting Bible verses at school in response to a bevy of flying LGBTQ pride flags.

The student, Gabby Helsinger, believes that the school's decision to suspend her was unreasonable and unfair.

What are the details?

In a video shared on Facebook, Gabby said that she felt the need to write down and post Bible verses around the school after it had been inundated with rainbow pride flags.

Gabby shared a video on Facebook that detailed her experience, which reportedly took place last week.

""So, on Thursday when I got to school, I see that there were pride flags, posters around my school,"" she said in the video, explaining that the school's Gay-Straight Alliance had put up the flags. ""And I felt the need to write down some Bible verses so I could put them around my school. And I wrote them down and I put them around the lockers, the walls.""

Gabby said that she went on with the rest of her day, but noticed that some of the teachers had begun the process of taking down her Bible verse-themed notes.

""The next day,"" she continued, ""I got called to the office and there is a letter that says that I have an ISS, which is an in-school suspension, and the reason why I have it is because 'abuse of others, disrespect, rudeness' because I put Bible verses up 'targeting [the school's Gay-Straight Alliance] organization.'

""I did not know what the GSA organization was or meant,"" she added, but noted that she believed her suspension was because the school places higher importance on inclusivity rather than students' religious beliefs.

""Seeing that there [were] people in my school that needed help,"" she added, ""they don't need to be living in the confusion of wondering if they should be gay, bi, lesbian, trans — anything like that. And I know that God is the only way that they can be healed by that, and that's why I did it.""

Gabby insisted that she was not, in any way, ""targeting any kind of organization.""

When she was in the principal's office over the incident, Gabby said the principal asked why she'd post Bible verses in the school.

""I said, 'Because I wanted to spread the word of God,'"" Gabby explained. ""And then [the principal] goes, 'Well, did you have permission?' And I said, 'No.' I didn't know you had to have permission because people do it a lot — putting Post-It notes on people's lockers, so I just did it.""

The video featuring Gabby and her story has been viewed over 40,000 times at the time of this writing.

What else?

Gabby's mother, Tina, said that she believes her daughter is being unfairly targeted for her Christian beliefs.

In a Facebook post, Tina wrote, ""Lebanon [High School] celebrates evil and punishes righteousness!!

""I appealed the punishment stating 'Posting a Bible verse is not abuse of others, disrespect/insolence/rudeness and in no way was it targeting GSA,"" she added. ""But the school principal, Scott Butler, says 'Gabby was targeting the GSA organization.""

Faithwire spoke with Lebanon City School Superintendent Todd Yohey. Yohey would not release information about specific disciplinary actions against specific students, but did, however, confirm that the school's code of conduct does not prohibit ""the sharing or posting of religious text or imagery on school grounds,"" according to the outlet.

Scooby-Doo reboot Velma gets atrocious reviews,"The new Scooby-Doo reboot ""Velma"" is being slammed for being overtly woke and for straying far from the innocent and beloved cartoon about a talking dog that helps solve mysteries.

""Velma"" is the prequel to the Hanna-Barbera animated series for children that debuted in 1969. The new HBO Max show has a rating of TV-MA for sex, nudity, violence, gore, profanity, and intense scenes, according to IMDb. The main characters are high school students who are about 15 years old.

The reboot features actress Mindy Kaling as the voice for Velma Dinkley.

The Chicago Sun-Times detailed the ""diverse"" cast, ""Velma is South Asian and gay, Daphne is an adopted Asian girl with lesbian cop parents, and Norville is black.""

""Fred, the entitled heir to an accessories fortune who turns out to be more than just a vanilla villain when Velma slips him a copy of 'The Feminine Mystique' and inspires his great awakening and new obsession with the gender pay gap,"" The Guardian said.

Don't expect to see a talking Great Dane – there actually is no Scooby-Doo the dog in the TV show.

The Wrap described the first episode, ""Things kick off not just with a murdered high school girl, but with her brain cut out of her oozing corpse by a next-level serial killer.""

According to Polygon, ""The premiere starts with two cockroaches boning and then immediately segues to a nude girls’ locker room shower fight between characters having a metatextual argument about premiere episodes using nudity to cynically gain viewers’ attention.""

Velma and Daphne kiss in the animated series, according to Collider.

Daphne is a drug dealer.

The Chicago Sun-Times revealed a conversation about dealing drugs between Velma and Daphne:

Daphne: “According to TV, it’s morally OK to deal drugs if your life is just kind of crappy. Like, your kid’s sick, you’re a widow with a mortgage, you have to live on a lake in Missouri.”

Velma: “Those are all white people, Daphne. Minorities on TV can only deal drugs to escape poverty.”

The Guardian said of the woke reboot, ""Against the retro-drippy backdrop, though, Kaling weaves in jokes about the paradoxes that go hand-in-hand with femininity, patriarchy, and power.""

According to the Hollywood Reporter, ""'I speak truth without a filter, like every comedian before #MeToo,' declares Velma, never mind that the line doesn’t make a ton of sense coming from a proud feminist teenager in 2023.""

""Velma' debuted this week and has already been obliterated by negative reviews.

The show has an abysmal 1.8 rating out of 10 on IMDb. On Rotten Tomatoes, ""Velma"" has a 53% score from critics and an atrocious 7% rating from the audience.

SCOTUS allows Yeshiva University to bar LGBTQ club — for now,"Yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor permitted Yeshiva University to refuse to recognize an LGBT student club that the Orthodox Jewish school said violates its religious values.

The stay — a court ruling that stops a legal action — issued by Sotomayor temporarily blocks a judge's ruling ordering the New York City-based school to allow the group. Yeshiva’s request for the order went to Sotomayor because she handles emergency appeals from a geographic region that includes New York.

The dispute began last year, according to SCOTUSblog, “When a group of students and former students filed a lawsuit alleging that Yeshiva’s refusal to recognize an LGBTQ advocacy and support club violated New York City’s human rights law.”

The law prohibits places that are open to the public – known as “public accommodations” — from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The trial court agreed with the students and ordered the university to recognize the Y.U. Pride Alliance club. The court rejected Yeshiva’s argument that the law did not apply because the university is a religious institution, rather than a public accommodation.

Higher courts in New York refused to stay the trial court’s ruling, so Yeshiva brought the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court. The university argued that its decision should be protected under the religious freedom clause of the First Amendment.

""We are grateful that Justice Sotomayor stepped in to protect Yeshiva’s religious liberty in this case,"" Eric Baxter, a lawyer for Yeshiva at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty legal group, said in a statement.

Katherine Rosenfeld, a lawyer for the club, said the club remains committed to creating a safe space for LGBT students on the university's campus ""to build community and support one another without being discriminated against.""

According to The New York Times, Yeshiva president Rabbi Ari Berman said the school wants students of all sexual orientations and gender identities to feel comfortable on its campus, but also wants to uphold its identity as an institution grounded in Modern Orthodox Judaism.

Sotomayor’s ruling suggests that the Supreme Court may take up the university’s case to issue a final determination. In recent years, petitioners bringing claims under the First Amendment’s religious freedom clause have had a high success rate at the Supreme Court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-allows-yeshiva-university-to-bar-lgbtq-club-for-now,2022-09-10
"SCOTUS throws out $135,000 fine against Christian Oregon bakers... for now","The Supreme Court refused to take up a high-profile religious liberty case involving a family of Christian bakers on Monday and instead sent it back to the lower courts for re-examination.

The case of Aaron and Melissa Klein — whose Oregon-based bakery became a major focal point of the national debate about religious liberty and the LGBT movement — has been remanded to the Oregon Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court also tossed out the Court of Appeals' previous decision to uphold a $135,000 fine against the couple because of their refusal to participate in a same-sex wedding ceremony in 2013 by making a cake for it.

Those standing behind the Kleins are chalking up Monday's Supreme Court order (which can be found on the Supreme Court's website) as a big win.



""This is a victory for Aaron and Melissa Klein and for religious liberty for all Americans,"" said First Liberty president, CEO and Chief Counsel Kelly Shackelford, whose organization is representing the Kleins along with Boyden Gray & Associates. ""The Constitution protects speech, popular or not, from condemnation by the government. The message from the Court is clear, government hostility toward religious Americans will not be tolerated.""

The case is to be re-evaluated in light of the Supreme Court's June 2018 narrow decision in the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which reversed a decision by the Colorado Court of appeals in a similar religious liberty case.

However, since and despite the 2018 ruling, Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips has been sued multiple times for alleged discrimination. Earlier this year, the state of Colorado dropped a lawsuit it brought against Phillips for refusing to bake a cake for a gender transition just weeks after last year's ruling. Last week, the same transgender individual behind the previous lawsuit sued Phillips for allegedly refusing to sell a birthday cake; an attorney representing Phillips dismissed the claim as ""yet another desperate attempt to harass"" the baker.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-sends-christian-bakers-case-back-to-oregon-courts-after-throwing-out-old-ruling,2019-06-17
Supreme Court unanimously sides with Christian group blocked from raising flag outside Boston City Hall: 'How did the city get it so wrong?',"The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously ruled in favor of a Christian civic organization that had its application to fly a flag outside of Boston City Hall rejected by city officials on religious grounds.

What are the details?

In a rare 9-0 decision, the court determined that the City of Boston violated Camp Constitution's constitutional rights to free speech by preventing it from flying a flag in the city plaza based solely on the fact that it was a ""Christian flag.""

At issue in the case, according to the court, was whether or not Boston's flag policy amounted to ""government speech."" If so, then the city may well be within its rights to prohibit the flying of the flag. However, if not, then its rejection of Camp Constitution's application was wrong.

The court ultimately assessed the latter to be the case.

""We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of government speech,"" wrote Justice Stephen Breyer in the court's opinion.

""Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of government speech. That means, in turn, that Boston’s refusal to let Shurtleff and Camp Constitution raise their flag based on its religious viewpoint 'abridg[ed]' their 'freedom of speech,'"" he added.

Additionally, the Court wrote, ""Here, Boston concedes that it denied [Harold] Shurtleff’s request solely because the Christian flag he asked to raise 'promot[ed] a specific religion' ... Under our precedents, and in view of our government-speech holding here, that refusal discriminated based on religious viewpoint and violated the Free Speech Clause.""

With the ruling, the nation's top court reversed a lower court's decision and remanded the issue back to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

What's the background?

The rejected application that spurred the case, Shurtleff v. City of Boston, occurred in 2017 when the group's founder Harold Shurtleff sought permission to raise the flag in commemoration of Constitution Day.

The Christian Post previously reported that Boston City Hall Plaza features three massive flagpoles, two of which always fly the American flag and the Massachusetts state flag. The third pole typically flies the city's flag, however, residents are permitted to petition City Hall to raise other flags temporarily and often do.

In fact, between 2005 and 2017, almost 300 different flags were permitted to be flown — including the Turkish flag, the Vatican flag, the Communist Chinese flag, the transgender flag, LGBT flags, and more. Yet Camp Constitution's ""Christian flag"" was the only one the city ever rejected.

In its denial, the city argued that flying the flag would improperly serve as promotion for a particular religion. Shurtleff and his group sued.

But in February 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper ruled against Shurtleff's group, claiming that the city's flagpoles constitute ""government speech."" When Shurtleff appealed, a three-judge panel on the First Circuit sided with the city, again claiming that it was well within its rights to reject Shurtleff's request.

Anything else?

In addition to Breyer's, three other justices — Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito — filed concurring opinion's on the case.

In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh wrote, ""Under the Constitution, a government may not treat religious persons, religious organizations, or religious speech as second-class.""

Gorsuch asked, ""How did the city get it so wrong?"" before tracing the matter back to a preceding case, Lemon v. Kurtzman, which devised what is known as the ""Lemon Test,"" or a one-size-fits-all assessment for resolving Establishment Clause disputes.

""It’s time to let Lemon lie in its grave,"" asserted Gorsuch.

Alito remarked that while he agrees with the court's ultimate opinion, he rejected the way in which the court analyzed the case regarding ""government speech,"" which he characterized as an often vague and illusory category.

""I cannot go along with the Court’s decision to analyze this case in terms of the triad of factors—history, the public’s perception of who is speaking, and the extent to which the government has exercised control over speech,"" he said, later adding that ""courts must be very careful when a government claims that speech by one or more private speakers is actually government speech. When that occurs, it can be difficult to tell whether the government is using the doctrine 'as a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint.""

""The ultimate question is whether the government is actually expressing its own views or the real speaker is a private party and the government is surreptitiously engaged in the 'regulation of private speech,"" he continued.

Mat Staver, the Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel, the religious liberty law firm that represented Shurtleff, said in a statement, ""This case is so much more significant than a flag. Boston openly discriminated against viewpoints it disfavored when it opened the flagpoles to all applicants and then excluded Christian viewpoints. Government cannot censor religious viewpoints under the guise of government speech.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-unanimously-sides-with-christian-flag-group-against-boston,2022-05-02
Report: Seattle schools and businesses encouraged to take a post-election 'flex day' to deal with stress,"Some students and workers in the Seattle area have been encouraged by their employers and school administrators to take Wednesday off as a ""flex day"" to process the Election day results, the Post Millennial reports.

A Google employee reportedly told the Post Millennial that team leaders at the Big Tech corporation suggested employees take Wednesday off ""if they needed to cope with the results."" Also, another employee of a smaller tech company reportedly said that his entire company will take the day off to ""process"" the results.



Over the weekend, KTTH-AM host Jason Rantz posted a message from The Northwest School, a Seattle private boarding school, announcing that Wednesday will be a ""flexible day for processing, reflection, and reactions"" to the election.



""We anticipate a full range of emotions among students as well as adults,"" the message stated. ""Some will need time on their own; some will want to connect, discuss, and process within a safe environment; some will want a sense of normalcy.""

The message went on to note that the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court ""and the fear and threat that essential rights for the LGBT community — marriage equality and civil rights — may be at stake is devastating.""

The Northwest School did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Blaze.



Additionally, several college and university campuses around the nation have events planned for students dealing with post-election mental health issues.

The University of Michigan is offering resources to students through Counseling and Psychological Services, Wolverine Support Network and Michigan Medicine, providing access to support groups for students and faculty dealing with election-related anxieties.

Similar resources are available at the University of Colorado Boulder, which said in a Facebook post it will create ""virtual space"" for ""students to process whatever they need, in community with the aid of trained staff counselors and facilitators.""



The ""virtual space"" will have ""themed break out rooms"" including, ""Self-care through art, meditation and movement,"" ""general processing,"" and ""taking action/Next steps.""

The University of Central Florida has planned Election Day and post-Election Day gatherings and is offering mental health services and counseling for students ""needing to speak with someone."" Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) on Tuesday will host a ""racial healing group"" for ""students of color to express, process and heal from negative race-based experiences."" The day after the election, the campus CAPS will create a ""Post-Election Support Space"" for students to ""discuss your feelings and thoughts about the outcome of the election in a safe and respectful place.""

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand wants the federal government to recognize a third gender,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told a group of LBGTQ activists that she would support federal recognition of a third-gender option.

Here's what we know

According to CBS News, Gillibrand was asked about this topic while she was speaking at an LGBTQ meet and greet in New Hampshire. Gillibrand has formally launched an exploratory committee into the possibility of running for president in 2020. New Hampshire is a crucial state for presidential hopefuls, since it's the site of the first primary election.

She reportedly gave a simple, but emphatic, ""yes"" in response, indicating that she would support such an initiative.

The third-gender option would cater to people who identified as nonbinary rather than as male or female. Proponents of the move argue that recognition only on a state level could lead to confusion with states that do not recognize that option, or which designate it in different ways. It is not clear whether Gillibrand intends to personally introduce legislation that includes this, or if she's merely indicating that she would vote for such legislation if it was brought to the Senate.

A New Hampshire state representative has introduced legislation that would recognize a third option on a state level. Maine, Oregon, California, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., have already approved third gender options. New York City also has similar laws in place, although they are not recognized on a state level.

What else?

Gillibrand has been outspoken in her support of the LGBTQ cause, and recently referred to President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people in the U.S. military as ""discrimination"" and an ""insult to the brave and patriotic transgender Americans who choose to serve in our military.""

"Sex shop owner in Washington state, who serves on school board, to host classes on 'pleasure' for kids as young as 9","A Washington state school board director who owns a sex shop says she will host events for children as young as 9 at her adult store which will discuss topics like ""sexual anatomy for pleasure"" and ""safer sex practices for all kinds of sexual activities.""

Jenn Mason is the school board director for Bellingham Public Schools. She is also a sex educator and the owner of WinkWink, an adult store that advertises itself as ""a woman-owned sex shop delighting in expertly curated sex and body products, lingerie, and books.""

In August, Mason will hold several sex education workshops aimed at children in her store. The classes are called ""Uncringe Academy,"" and their purpose is to ""[help] young people to feel comfortable around these topics so that they can advocate for their own bodies, health, and well-being.”

Mason is offering two classes, one for kids aged 9-12 and another for teenagers 13-17. The workshops ""will vary for developmental appropriateness,"" according to a description of the event.



The list of class topics includes:

Healthy relationships and relationship models

The science of puberty

Consent and communication

Gender and sexual identities

Sexual anatomy for pleasure and reproduction

What IS sex? Kinds of solo and partnered sexual activities

Safer sex practices for all kinds of sexual activities

The ethics and realities of sexualized media and pornography

“The class for 9 to 12 year olds is an introduction to topics related to relationships, puberty, bodies, and sexuality. We focus on what makes healthy vs. unhealthy friendships and romantic relationships, the science of how puberty works, consent and personal boundaries, defining ‘sex’, and discussing why people may or may not choose to engage in sexual activities,” Mason told KTTH radio host Jason Rantz in an email Monday.

“This course includes understanding the basics of sexual anatomy, including the names and function of body parts related to reproduction and pleasure. We also cover the basics of biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation,"" she added.

Mason also described sex in vague terms, arguing that sexual intercourse is open to interpretation.

“While some people think of sex as only being when a penis goes in a vagina, ‘sex’ can really be any activity that a person does with themselves or others to become aroused,” she told Rantz. “There’s no such thing as ‘real’ sex and it’s okay if your definition of sex is different from someone else’s.”

The classes Mason is offering will be held in her personal capacity as a business owner, and not as the director for the Bellingham School District, Rantz reported. They are not associated with the school district.

Mason stirred controversy last month with another youth event at her sex shop directed at kids who identify as LGBTQ+. The event was called ""Queer Youth Open Mic Night"" and it was held to celebrate ""young queer voices,"" according to the National Desk. Children were encouraged ""to share poetry, music or a story"" at WinkWink.

WinkWink's website states ""there is no law or store policy that sets an age-limit for our customers,"" and that ""all people"" are allowed in the shop at any time.

Social media pillories Jussie Smollett over conviction while Hollywood liberals remain silent: He 'can rest knowing that his attacker has been convicted',"Much of social media erupted in glee after ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett was found guilty on five of six counts of felony disorderly conduct in relation to a hate crime hoax he orchestrated — while prominent liberals remained silent.



A Chicago jury pronounced Smollett guilty Thursday evening.

He awaits sentencing for the convictions, which carry a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.

Microcapsule history

In 2019, Smollett reported that two Donald Trump supporters attacked him while screaming racial and homophobic slurs and placed a noose around his neck.

The two suspects, Nigerian-born brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo — with whom Smollett worked on the set of ""Empire"" — ultimately told police that he paid them to stage the attack in efforts to boost his floundering career.

Detectives said that surveillance footage and other pieces of evidence corroborated the Osundairo brothers' claims. The Nigerian-born brothers ultimately testified against Smollett and insisted that the ""Empire"" actor walked them through how to carry out the ""attack.""

Smollett said that he was not guilty, that there was no hoax, and that the two brothers attacked him and attempted to extort money from him.

What are the details?

Following the verdict, Daily Wire editor emeritus Ben Shapiro led the chorus and tweeted, “Tonight, Jussie Smollett can rest knowing that his attacker has been convicted.""

The Babylon Bee's Twitter account joked, ""Cruel: Jussie Smollett Will Be Forced To Share A Jail Cell With His Attacker.""

Blaze Media's Jason Whitlock added, ""The conviction of Jussie Smollett's attacker is further proof the American criminal justice system isn't racist.""

Joe Concha, media columnist at The Hill, added, “Jussie Smollett guilty on first five counts. Sixth count not guilty. Justice obviously served. Don’t expect any apologies from those who brought this ridiculous take from Day 1, starting with the VP and ABC’s Robin Roberts.""



Broadcaster Megyn Kelly tweeted, ""Jussie Smollett guilty on 5 felony counts. He perpetrated a hate crime hoax & made the road that much tougher for real victims. As for the press & politicos who gleefully bought his obvious nonsense & used it as an excuse to bash America, shame on you too.""

Broadcaster Buck Sexton wrote, ""Jussie Smollett's obvious hoax was an intelligence test that millions of liberals failed from day one[.] Including Biden and Kamala.""

Daily Wire co-founder and co-CEO Jeremy Boreing added, ""Never forget the left went all-in on the Jussie Smollett hoax. They wanted it to be true; they didn't care that it wasn't. And not just the media. The Obama political machine all but obstructed justice to protect this race-hustling fraud. They wanted riots. Unforgivable.""

Author and columnist Tim Young added, ""My favorite part of Jussie Smollett's hoax was that he left the rope around his neck... LIKE A REAL VICTIM WOULD... So when the cops showed up, he probably pointed to it and said 'See?!?! They tried to get me with this rope JUST LIKE THIS!' So f***ing dumb.""

Silence from the peanut gallery

Liberals — both in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. — have largely remained mum on the verdict.

President Joe Biden in 2019 tweeted, “What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”

Around the same time, Vice President Kamala Harris added, ""@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know. I’m praying for his quick recovery. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.”

Entertainer Ariana Grande at the time wrote, ""[W]hat happened to jussie makes me really f***ing sick to my stomach. i can’t believe s*** like this is really still happening everyday. what kind of world ? sending all of the healing energy / love i possibly can and hoping for change. what can we do ? tell me & i’m there.""

Actor Elliot Page — then known as Ellen Page — went on a lengthy diatribe during a late-night TV appearance, claiming that former President Donald Trump was somehow connected to the attack.

""Connect the dots, this is what happens,"" Page spat at the time. ""If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you wanna cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble, you spend your career trying to cause suffering, what do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to f***ing stop.""

Actress Lena Waithe added, “Being queer and black is like having a target on your back every time you walk out the door. I don’t really believe police, I tend to believe black people first.""

Smollett's fellow ""Empire"" co-star, Taraji P. Henson, wrote, ""I know him and I know his track record. I'm not going to jump on clickbait just because someone says something derogatory about a person I know and love. I'm not easily swayed like that. Those little clickbait [reports] weren't enough to deter me from his immaculate track record. I know the type of activism this young man does in his community, I know that he's a giver – he's not an attention-seeker.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-pillories-jussie-smollett-over-conviction-hollywood-liberals-remain-silent,2021-12-10
Sony wants to introduce a bisexual Spider-Man with a boyfriend in an upcoming movie,"Sony wants to break ground by introducing a bisexual Spider-Man in an upcoming movie, sources reportedly told We Got This Covered.

Tom Holland, who currently plays Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has lobbied for a gay Spider-Man in the past, and now it appears that his wishes are that much closer to becoming a reality.

The entertainment blog reported that sources have informed them that Sony ""is developing a live-action 'Spider-Verse' movie"" that would ""unite Holland with his predecessors, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.""

The report said that the studio ""is particularly keen on getting Garfield back, as they want to portray his version of the hero as bisexual and give him a boyfriend in the film.""

Garfield played the lead in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" in 2012 and 2014, respectively, before Holland signed on to play the hero in a series reboot.

Garfield had floated the idea of a gay Spider-Man back in 2013 during an interview with Entertainment Weekly, so it seems the actor would be more than willing to play the part should Sony move forward with the project.

The news comes just months after Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed that Marvel would be debuting an openly transgender superhero in short order.

When asked during a Q&A session at the New York Film Academy in October if Marvel had plans to introduce more LGBTQ characters into the universe, ""specifically the T — trans characters,"" Feige replied in the affirmative.

""Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Very soon. In a movie we're shooting right now,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sony-wants-to-introduce-bisexual-spiderman,2020-02-14
Soros-backed attorney who got rapist released thrown off case of victim's father,"On September 2, Republican Circuit Court Judge James Plowman kicked a George Soros-backed prosecutor off the case of a man convicted of disorderly conduct. Plowman reckoned Loudoun County commonwealth’s attorney Buta Biberaj's impartiality was dubious as it pertained to 48-year-old Scott Smith, the father arrested for expressing outrage in a school board meeting over the permissive LGBT policies that enabled a rapist to attack his daughter in a girls' washroom.

Biberaj, who fought for jail time and anger management for Smith, oversaw the case of the very rapist who attacked Smith's daughter. Her office recommended that the rapist, charged with forcible sodomy, be released with an ankle monitor and enrolled in a different school. Upon his release, the suspect is said to have sexually assaulted another child in a classroom.

The 48-year-old Smith, who seeks to appeal his conviction, will now have his case prosecuted by Stafford County commonwealth’s attorney Eric Olsen.



According to Smith's lawyer Bill Stanley, Biberaj was biased against his client, which would compromise the integrity of the trial. He and Smith filed a motion for Biberaj's recusal on October 22, 2021.



In his decision to appoint a special prosecutor in Smith's appeal, Plowman cited the need to protect the ""integrity of the Defendant's due process rights.""



Smith took comfort in Plowman's decision. He told Fox News Digital, ""From the beginning, Ms. Biberaj has sought to make an example of me for simply standing up to defend my daughter.""

""Biberaj has demonstrated a bias against me throughout the court proceedings,"" said Smith, ""and she has continued to fan the flames of those who would label parents like me who stand in protection of their kids against dangerous school policies as being 'domestic terrorists.'""

Stanley similarly lauded the decision, writing, ""The Court's Order today has corrected at least in some measure the injustice created by Ms. Biberaj's bias against [Smith], and has restored his hope for a fair trial on the remaining charge against him in his quest to protect his beloved daughter.""

Biberaj told WTOP, ""I'm surprised by the court's decision, since I was never given the opportunity to come back and have conversations about the disorderly conduct.""

Biberaj removed and disqualified

This is not the first time Biberaj has been kicked off a case by Plowman.

In June, when seeking a plea deal for serial burglary suspect Kevin Enrique Valle, Biberaj downplayed and omitted relevant details about Valle's criminal past, including recent charges against him in other jurisdictions. Biberaj allegedly attempted to gloss over the fact that Valle was accused of ""a possible 12 burglary crime spree spanning four counties over ten days.""

Plowman characterized Biberaj's assessment not only as ""entirely inaccurate"" but ""an overt misrepresentation by omission.""

The judge noted further that ""the Commonwealth is deliberately misleading the Court, and the public,"" writing ultimately, ""Biberaj ... is hereby REMOVED AND DISQUALIFIED from further prosecution as counsel of record in this matter.""

Extra to potentially misleading the public, there is some indication that Biberaj's progressive approach may be endangering the public. According to WTTG, since Biberaj's election in 2020, criminal indictments in the county have fallen dramatically by 67%, despite an increase in arrests.

In one instance, Biberaj's office released a man charged with brutally assaulting, strangling, and abducting his wife, Regina Redman Lollobrigido. After his release, he allegedly went on to savage and kill Regina with a hammer.

In addition to working to get criminals off, Biberaj also has worked with them. Last year, her office hired a registered sex offender, convicted of a child pornography charge, as a paralegal.

Scott's quest to protect his daughter

On May 28, 2021, Scott Smith's ninth-grade daughter was raped in a bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in Loudoun County, Virginia. The offender was a 15-year-old male wearing a dress, who had taken advantage of the school's transsexual policies. The school failed to report the assault in its rape statistics.

Although that aggressor was arrested, found guilty on all charges, and ultimately placed on a sex offender registry, he was soon released by Biberaj's office and placed in another school, Broad Run, where he allegedly committed sexual battery against another child.

A month after the rape at Stone Bridge, the Loudoun County school board held a meeting in which board members suggested that the school's so-called ""gender-fluid"" bathrooms were not to blame. The board also indicated that it had not received reports of assaults in the girls' bathrooms.

Smith, outraged like many in the community, went to one such school board meeting on June 22 seeking answers. Instead, he received handcuffs.

At the meeting where parents called for Superintendent for Loudoun County Public Schools Dr. Scott Ziegler to be fired as well as for board members to resign, LGBT activists jeered and mocked a distraught Smith.

Smith raised his voice when an activist in rainbow-colored garb allegedly was denying that Smith's daughter had been attacked and began threatening to ruin his family. Police subsequently tackled him to the ground and then detained him.

South Dakota lawmakers want to make it illegal to put kids through sex changes,"A group of state legislators in South Dakota want to make it a crime to perform sex change surgeries on children.

The bill — which was introduced in the state legislature on Tuesday – would make it a Class 4 felony to perform a list of procedures on minors ""for the purpose of attempting to change or affirm the minor's perception of the minor's sex, if that perception is inconsistent with the minor's sex."" Those procedures include surgeries like castration, vasectomy, hysterectomy, and mastectomy as well as the administration of puberty blocking drugs or the removal of ""any otherwise healthy or nondiseased body part or tissue.""

However, the restrictions do not apply ""to the good faith medical decision of a parent or guardian of a minor born with a medically-verifiable genetic disorder of sex development.""

Republican state Rep. Fred Deutsch is the sponsor of the bill, and he said that he put it forward in an effort to protect children from undergoing dangerous procedures.

""Every child in South Dakota should be protected from dangerous drugs and procedures,"" Deutsch told National Review in an emailed statement.

""The solution for children's identification with the opposite sex isn't to poison their bodies with mega-doses of the wrong hormones, to chemically or surgically castrate and sterilize them, or to remove healthy breasts and reproductive organs,"" he added. ""The solution is compassionate care, and that doesn't include catastrophically and irreversibly altering their bodies.""

Deutsch's bill currently boasts over 40 cosponsors from both chambers of the state legislature.

However, as the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reports, the effort has already drawn resistance from Democratic lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union.

""Every year, South Dakota lawmakers zero in on transgender youth and every year the transgender community is hurt while meaningful problems go unaddressed,"" South Dakota policy director Libby Skarin said in the newspaper's story. ""The more we legislate solutions in search of problems, the more our communities suffer.""

Democratic House Minority Leader Jamie Smith said that the bill is ""frustrating"" and ""not necessary"" in the Argus Leader's story.

The heated custody battle involving 7-year-old James Younger's potential gender transition in Texas last year brought the question of children undergoing sex change procedures into the national spotlight. In that case, the child's mother said he identified as a girl and wanted him to transition against his father's wishes. Since then, legislators in multiple other states such as South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas, have gotten behind efforts to prevent gender transition procedures from being conducted on minors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/south-dakota-lawmaker-wants-to-make-it-illegal-to-put-kids-through-sex-changes,2020-01-16
Spanish MP suspended from Twitter after declaring 'a man cannot get pregnant': 'Fascist biology',"Twitter suspended a member of Spain's Parliament last week after the politician wrote on the social media platform that ""a man cannot get pregnant.""

What are the details?

Francisco José Contreras, a member of Spain's right-wing Vox Party, was locked out of his Twitter account for 12 hours after publishing the politically incorrect statement.

Contreras was reportedly responding to a news article in which a transgender man claimed they were now a father after giving birth to a child.

""Es una mentira. Un hombre no puede quedar embarazado. Un hombre no tiene útero ni óvulos,"" Contreras wrote in Spanish, which translates in English to, ""This is a lie. A man cannot get pregnant. A man neither has a uterus nor ovaries.""

Twitter claimed Contreras had violated its platform rules against ""hate speech."" Twitter specifically cited rules against ""threatening, harassing, or encouraging violence"" against people on the basis of ""sexual orientation,"" ""gender,"" and ""gender identity.""

How did Contreras respond?

The politician, who has been a member of Spain's lower chamber of Congress since 2019, mocked Twitter in a post on Facebook revealing his Twitter suspension.

""You can that see this is already fascist biology. Next time I'll try 2 + 2 = 4,"" he wrote.

In a statement provided to LifeSiteNews, Contreras vowed to not ""yield"" to Twitter's ""twisted worldview.""

""We will not yield to Twitter imposing a twisted (and anthropologically wrong) worldview,"" Contreras said. ""We will continue to speak the truth about human nature. Biological truth should not be regarded as 'hate speech'. It's biology, not bigotry.""

Anything else?

According to Counting Stars, a Spanish news publication, this is not the first time Spain's Vox Party has been targeted for suspension by Twitter.

From Counting Stars:

The treatment that Twitter is giving this conservative party is especially scandalous. Last February, at the gates of regional elections in Catalonia, Twitter censored the Vox account in a new interference by the American company in an electoral process in another country. Twitter's excuse in that case was that stating statistics showing the high percentage of criminal complaints against Maghrebis was also ""incitement to hatred."" Apparently, Twitter believes that statistics, like biology, should be censored if at any time they contradict the ideological dogmas of progressivism.

In fact, Twitter allegedly has been inconsistent in enforcing its policies.

Twitter allegedly permitted left-wing activists to threaten Vox Party president Santiago Abascal and other members of the Vox Party, Counting Stars reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/spanish-mp-suspended-from-twitter-after-declaring-a-man-cannot-get-pregnant-fascist-biology,2021-05-17
"Stanford university releases list of 'harmful language' it plans to eliminate or replace, including 'American,' 'he,' and 'brave'","Stanford University has identified a list of words and phrases that it will soon be removing from its websites. ""American,"" ""he,"" ""straight,"" and ""gentlemen"" are among the forbidden words listed in the school's index of so-called ""harmful language.""

What are the details?

Stanford claims on its website that ""freedom of speech is core to the mission of academic life of our university.""

Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the university's president, previously alleged that besides threats of harm, disruptive speech, and unlawful harassment, ""we do not otherwise restrict speech in our community, including speech that some may find objectionable.""



It is now apparent that where official communications are concerned at the university, common words and idioms that conflict conceptually with LGBT and identitarian activists' agendas are not to be used freely.

The Wall Street Journal noted that administrators have embraced the recommendations of the so-called ""Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative"" and published a master list of forbidden words.

According to the university, the EHLI ""is one of the actions prioritized in the Statement of Solidarity and Commitment to Action, which was published by the Stanford CIO Council and People of Color in Technology (POC-IT) affinity group in December 2020.""

The terms listed in the censors' index are reportedly ""in alignment"" with those used by similarly censorious peer institutions, including Brandeis University and the National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment project.

The forbidden words

Although the university, facing scrutiny, password-protected the EHLI's list and hid it from public view, the Journal obtained a copy.

The forbidden terms on the EHLI list are grouped into the following categories: ""Ableist, Ageism, Culturally Appropriative, Gender-based, Imprecise Language, Institutionalized Racism, Person-First, and Violent.""

Terms deemed unfit for use that do not fall into the above categories are classed under ""Additional Considerations.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Ableist"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""addict,"" to be replaced with ""person with a substance use disorder"";

""addicted,"" to be replaced with ""devoted"";

""blind study,"" to be replaced with ""masked study""; and

""walk-in,"" to be replaced with ""open office.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Culturally Appropriative"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""Brave,"" not to be replaced but to be dropped from use altogether;

""chief,"" to be replaced with ""the person's name""; and

""tribe,"" to be replaced with ""friends, network, family, support system.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Gender-Based"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""'preferred' pronouns,"" to be replaced by pronouns — since ""the word 'preferred' suggests that non-binary gender identity is a choice and a preference"";

""ballsy,"" to be replaced with ""bold"";

""gentlemen,"" to be replaced with ""everyone"";

""he,"" to be replaced with ""person's name of 'they'"";

""seminal,"" to be replaced by ""leading, groundbreaking,"" and

""tranny,"" to be replaced by ""non-gendering conforming folk.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Imprecise Language"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""American,"" to be replaced with ""US Citizen"" — since this term insinuates ""that the US is the most important country in the Americas""; and

""straight,"" to be replaced with ""heterosexual.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Institutionalized Racism"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""black hat,"" to be replaced with ""unethical hacker"";

""blackballed,"" to be replaced with ""banned, denied"";

""gangbusters,"" to be replaced with ""very successful"";

""master (v),"" to be replaced with ""become adept in"";

""master list,"" to be replaced with ""list of record""; and

""white paper,"" to be replaced with ""position paper.""

In addition to eliminating language that references biological realities and universal concepts that upset activists, Stanford also seeks to swap out idioms it regards as violent, such as ""beating a dead horse"" and ""killing two birds with one stone.""

While the EHLI's stated goal is to eliminate harmful and biased language, there is nevertheless an apparent bias in its suggested replacements.

For instance, the EHLI presumes that the U.S. is not the most important country in the Americas, despite the nation being the most powerful and prosperous as well as serving as a benefactor to most others countries in the Western Hemisphere.

In another instance, by presuming ""tribe"" is culturally appropriative, the EHLI censors abrogate alternative meanings, glossing over both the Latin root ""tribus,"" referencing ""one of the three political/ethnic divisions of the original Roman state,"" as well as its biblical usage.

Without providing a ""trigger warning,"" the Stanford Review ridiculed the EHLI list, making sure to use as many of the proscribed terms on the master list as possible.

The campus paper called on ""all students to be brave and liberally use all words POC-IT considers harmful, so at least their guide will have another use besides a laughing-stock.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stanford-university-releases-list-of-harmful-language-it-plans-to-eliminate-or-replace,2022-12-20
Starbucks UK partners with LGBTQ charity that helps trans kids find hormone treatments,"Starbucks U.K. is launching a partnership with a charity that advises transgender children on gender dysphoria, including, but not limited to, locating access to hormone treatments.

The charity also connects children and their parents with resources to help determine what resources they may need should they decide to transition.

What are the details?

Starbucks will sell ""mermaid tail cookies"" that will benefit the charity. Proceeds from the sales of the cookies will go to expanding the charity's outreach, reports say.

According to BBC LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte, who revealed the news on Twitter Friday, the charity is called Mermaids, an organization that aims to act as an advocate for trans kids and their parents.

On Twitter, Hunte wrote, ""Breaking @StarbucksUK is launching a £100,00+ partnership with trans equality charity @Mermaids_Gender. Starbucks will sell a 'mermaid tail cookie' and launch a national ad campaign promoting trans rights.""

""The money,"" he continued, ""will extend the Mermaids helpline.""

According to Mermaids' website, the grassroots organization has ""evolved into one of the UK's leading LGBTQ+ charities, empowering thousands of people with its secure online communities, local community groups, helpline services, web resources, events and residential weekends.""

The site also advises parents on how to handle your child's gender dysphoria, placing utmost importance on support.

""Supporting your child doesn't mean they'll take a particular direction or follow a particular medical pathway, like hormone therapy or gender affirming surgeries,"" the site says. ""Still, if they do, then medical transition in young people usually consists of taking hormone blockers after the initial stages of puberty.""

""Hormone blockers stop the young person's body changing in ways they don't want it to at that time, in the hope it will alleviate any distress those changes may be causing them,"" the site adds. ""Blockers simply give time for them to reflect; they can stop at any point and a puberty typically associated with the gender they were assigned at birth will resume.""

What else?

A video advertisement for the campaign aired on Sunday, according to The Independent.



The outlet reports that the video features a transgender navigating the difficulty of being referred to by his previous female name.

""James,"" who was formerly known as ""Jemma,"" can be seen in various stages of discomfort in hearing people call him ""Jemma"" though he's clearly male-presenting.

Later in the clip, James visits his local Starbucks, where the baristas refer to him as James and nothing else. It concludes with a smiling James, and hashtag #WhatsYourName.

Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids, says, ""The funds raised through #whatsyourname will allow us to make a meaningful change to our helpline that supports young trans people and their families who are so desperately in need of access to information and reassurance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/starbucks-partners-charity-that-helps-trans-kids-find-hormone-treatments,2020-02-04
"State Farm denies asking agents to donate LGBTQ books to schools, says it ended partnership with advocacy group","State Farm denied reports that it asked agents to donate pro-LGBTQ books to schools and said it had ended a partnership with an advocacy group involved in the program.

The nationwide insurance company released statements to the Daily Caller after facing online backlash over emails sent in January that appeared to call on agents to donate controversial books to local schools and public libraries.

“State Farm is partnering with The GenderCool Project to help diversify classroom, community center and library bookshelves with a collection of books to help bring clarity and understanding to the national conversation about Being Transgender, Inclusive and Non-Binary,” read the email.

“The project’s goal is to increase representation of LGBTQ+ books and support our communities in having challenging, important and empowering conversations with children Age 5+,"" it continued.

Some on social media responded by calling for a boycott against State Farm.

On Monday, the company denied the claims in one statement and then issued a second statement saying it had ended its partnership with the advocacy group.

“Our participation in this program evolved quickly, and the decision was made several months ago for participants not to share resources with schools,” said a State Farms spokesperson who added that the program was strictly voluntary.

The Daily Caller documented an incident that appeared to contradict the statement from the company.

State Farm offered further clarification in a second statement.

“Conversations about gender and identity should happen at home with parents. We don’t support required curriculum in schools on this topic. We support organizations providing resources for parents to have these conversations,"" read the statement in part.

“We no longer support the program allowing for distribution of books in schools,"" they concluded. ""We will continue to explore how we can support organizations that provide tools and resources that align with our commitment to diversity and inclusion.""

'Sinister' plan circulating in left-wing circles: Strip accreditation from religious schools that don't comply with progressive policies,"On Tuesday, in an op-ed published by the Daily Signal, Texas Republican Rep. Brian Babin raised awareness about a dangerous plan being hatched by progressives to shape future generations of Americans.

What are the details?

The plan — outlined in a recent Human Rights Campaign manifesto titled, ""Blueprint for Positive Change"" — urges the incoming Biden administration to mandate compliance with their political agenda by stripping accreditation from religious colleges and universities that don't meet ""nondiscrimination policies and science-based curricula standards"" regarding sexual orientation and gender identity.

The objective, which is one of 85 policy recommendations submitted by the LGBTQ advocacy group, demands that the Department of Education amend language found in the Higher Education Opportunity Act that presently requires accrediting agencies to respect a school's ""stated mission.""

The department, HRC argues, ""should issue a regulation clarifying that this provision ... does not require the accreditation of religious institutions that do not meet neutral accreditation standards including nondiscrimination policies and scientific curriculum requirements.""

Should the plan be carried out, it would effectively dissolve religious higher education institutions in America as many employers do not hire applicants without a degree from an accredited school.

Babin responded to the plan, saying, ""Here, couched in language designed to suggest moral superiority and scientific legitimacy, is a blatant, full-frontal assault on our religious liberties.

""The Human Rights Campaign is not simply suggesting that Christian institutions comply with the left's view of 'nondiscrimination,' but rather it is forcing institutions to either abandon the tenants of their religious beliefs or face severe consequences. Haven't we seen this play out in history before, such as the Soviet Revolution and Mao's Cultural Revolution?"" he added.

Babin warned that if the HRC is successful in lobbying Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, Christian schools would ""cease to exist"" or be ""bullied to bow down to the LGBT orthodoxy.""

What else?

Last month, shortly after the blueprint was released, Al Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, called the recommendation ""sinister.""

""I've not seen any document like this before — the Human Rights Campaign is effectively calling for religious colleges and schools to be coerced into the sexual revolution or stripped of accreditation,"" he said in a column. ""In terms of accreditation, that is an atomic bomb.""

""This is an outright attempt to eliminate religious freedom for Christian schools — or for any religious school that refuses to bow to the moral revolutionaries at the Human Rights Campaign,"" he continued. ""This is an undisguised attempt to shut down any semblance of a Christian college or university that would possess the audacity to operate from a Christian worldview.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/strip-accreditation-religious-schools,2020-12-23
Students walk out of classes to protest Catholic high school allegedly forcing two gay teachers to resign,"A gay proposal at Disneyland has led to teacher resignations and angry student protests at a Catholic high school near Seattle, Washington.

English teacher Paul Danforth and his partner Sean Nyberg got engaged at Disneyland in November, and Danforth resigned soon after from Kennedy Catholic High School in Burien, Washington.

Soccer coach Michelle Beattie also got engaged to her same-sex partner and resigned.

The school says that they both voluntarily resigned, but Nyberg claims otherwise.

Nyberg said that Danforth was ""no longer employed specifically because he and I got engaged,"" according to a statement he gave to CBS News.

""This is not only personally painful, it also harms former students who looked up to them,"" he added.



Students who are supportive of the gay teachers staged a sit-in and walked out in protest on Tuesday.

Another protest was planned against the Archdiocese of Seattle, which had not yet commented on the matter.

Family Policy Institute of Washington executive director Mark Miloscia defended the school.

""Especially what we believe is a constitutional right to hire the teachers and employees to go teach their children the beliefs and practices that are dear to their faith,"" Miloscia said.

Both of the gay teachers have hired an attorney, but CBS News noted that it was unclear what legal action they could take against the school or the archdiocese.

Second LGBT student joins suit against Fuller Theological Seminary after getting expelled for entering into same-sex marriages,"Last November, a student at Fuller Theological Seminary — the nation's largest interdenominational seminary — sued the school for discrimination after she was expelled for marrying another woman. Now, another former student is joining the lawsuit.

In the amended complaint filed Tuesday, Nathan Brittsan, an American Baptist Churches USA pastor, joined Joanna Maxon in requesting the school award them more than $1 million each to compensate for damages, Christianity Today reported.

What are the details?

According to the report, Brittsan received his letter of dismissal two days before beginning his first classes when school administrators discovered his same-sex marriage following his request to change his last name.

Maxon filed the original lawsuit in November after she was expelled only weeks aways from completing her master of arts degree in theology. Having taken mostly online classes, Maxon's marital status had flown under the radar for years until the school noticed her wife listed on her 2016 tax returns, which it accessed to assess financial aid.

""I was approaching the end and looking forward to graduation and all that stuff,"" Maxon, 53, told NBC News. ""To have that taken away unexpectedly — I was a really good student — I was devastated by it.""

However, it is difficult to imagine how the two students could have been caught by surprise, as at least Maxon alleges she was, since the school requires that students agree to comply with the statement of faith and community standards during the application process.

Fuller, like many Christian schools in the U.S., upholds the traditional definition of marriage as a ""covenant union between one man and one woman"" in its Sexual Standards policy, and believes ""homosexual forms of explicit sexual conduct to be inconsistent with the teaching of Scripture.""

What are the attorneys arguing?

Paul Southwick, the attorney representing Maxon and Brittsan, is arguing that Fuller is required to comply with Title IX, which bars federally funded educational programs from discriminating based on sex. However, religiously affiliated schools are often granted exceptions from Title IX regulations in order to accommodate for religious freedom.

""It's a very important case at this time in our nation's history,"" Southwick said, according to Christianity Today. ""This case could set an important legal precedent that if an educational institution receives federal funding, even if it's religiously-affiliated, even if it's a seminary, that it's required to comply with Title IX prohibitions on sex discrimination as applied to LGBT individuals.""

Representing Fuller is the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which specializes religious liberty defense cases such as the Supreme Court cases Burwell v. Hobby Lobby in 2014 and Holt v. Hobbs in 2015.

Becket Fund attorney Daniel Blomberg warned that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in this case could have widespread negative effects on religious liberty for faith-based institutions.

""The claims here are dangerous for faith-based institutions,"" Blomberg said. ""If the court was to accept them, then they would be harmful to religious groups of all backgrounds and particularly minority religious groups that have beliefs that the majority and the surrounding communities might find unpopular ... we think that's unlikely that courts would accept these kinds of arguments because they're weak claims. But they're dangerous.""

According to Christianity Today, Fuller's attorneys have two weeks to respond to the lawsuit and are expected to ask that the court dismiss the case.

New study says tanning salons could be targeting gay men and giving them cancer,"A new study says that tanning salons, which are apparently more concentrated in neighborhoods with high numbers of male gay couples, could be targeting their gay male demographic and giving them cancer.

What are the details?

Researchers at Stanford University's School of Medicine found that tanning salons were twice as likely to be located within one mile of neighborhoods with higher gay population concentrations.

Scientists examined such populations in Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Previous research determined that gay men are more likely to utilize tanning beds and to suffer from skin cancer as a result.

Dr. Eleni Linos, co-author of the study, said that the findings are alarming.

""This is a big deal, because LGBT communities already experience health disparities related to stigma and discrimination,"" she said. ""In addition, gay men have disproportionately higher rates of skin cancer. Our study is the first to show that indoor tanning — a known carcinogen — is more readily available in neighborhoods with more gay men.""

Linos also admitted that she fears the tanning industry could be targeting such communities.

""It's definitely something I am very worried about,"" she said. ""The tobacco industry has been shown to market to high risk communities, including LGBT communities. Having more tanning beds — more availability of this carcinogen — in these neighborhoods may exacerbate health disparities, and the LGBT community needs to know about it.""

She noted that it is important to determine whether the tanning industry is targeting what she calls ""high-risk communities.""

""Our concern is whether the tanning industry is targeting high-risk communities, similar to how the tobacco industry has done in the past, marketing to vulnerable groups,"" Linos wrote in the report.

""Indoor tanning is a Class 1 carcinogen,"" she added. ""I don't think we can be naïve and think of this as just another business. There's no benefit to indoor tanning. Because we are already seeing very high rates of skin cancer in this community, we need to be particularly vigilant about industry influence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/study-tanning-salons-targeting-gay-men-giving-them-cancer,2019-10-07
Comic book artist quits DC comics over changes to Superman: 'I’m tired of them ruining these characters',"A comic book colorist says he is fed up with the left turn at DC Comics and he is quitting over the latest left-wing change to the Superman character.

Gabe Eltaeb made the comments during a guest appearance on a YouTube show hosted by Cyberfrog creator Ethan Van Sciver.

""What really pissed me off was saying truth, justice, and a better world. F*** that it was Truth, Justice, and the American way,"" said Eltaeb.

He was referring to the announcement from the publisher of Superman comics that they would be dropping ""the American way"" from the character's motto for the much far less nationalistic, ""a better world.""

Eltaeb said that he was leaving DC Comics when his contract was up because he was upset with how the company is ruining the legacy of their characters.

""I'm finishing out my contract with DC. I'm tired of this s***, I'm tired of them ruining these characters; they don't have a right to do this,"" he continued.

""My Grandpa almost died in World War II. We don't have a right to destroy s*** that people died for to give us,"" Eltaeb said. ""It's a bunch of f***ing nonsense.""

Eltaeb was the colorist on ""Superman: The Son of Kal-El,"" which wrote Superman's son to be bisexual social justice warrior battling global warming.

He went on to object to the way conservatives are shunned in the industry.

""They call us bigots and racist and s***, I would ask them, find me in the f***ing mainstream, not on the fringes, one f***ing book, one f***ing t-shirt, one movie that says that leftism is bad, and conservatism is good, find it for me, they f***ing won't they're not letting people have a voice, they're the f***ing bigots,"" he said.

""Sorry,"" Eltaeb added, ""that's been bottled up for five years.""

"The new Superman is LGBT, DC Comics announces","Even Superman — the world's strongest superhero — is unable to withstand the woke mob's efforts to rebrand every facet of society with progressive values.

DC Comics announced Monday that Clark Kent's son and super-heroic heir, Jon Kent, will soon ""take a bold new direction"" by coming out as bisexual after falling in love with a male friend.

""The same-sex relationship is just one of the ways"" he is ""proving to be a different Superman than his famous father,"" the New York Times added in a glowing write-up about the comic series, ""Superman: Son of Kal-El.""

The Times noted that since the series launched in July, its main protagonist ""has combated wildfires caused by climate change, thwarted a high school shooting, and protested the deportation of refugees in Metropolis.""

But there is one notable way in which the famous father and son are similar: they both have taken a romantic interest in a reporter.

""After initially striking up a friendship with reporter Jay Nakamura, he and Jon become romantically involved,"" the comic book company wrote in a news release. ""Following a scene where Superman mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can, Jay is there to care for the Man of Steel.""

The development will reportedly be unveiled on the pages of the series' Nov. 9 release.

""I've always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and I'm very grateful DC and Warner Bros. share this idea,"" writer Tom Taylor said in the release. ""Superman's symbol has always stood for hope, for truth, and for justice. Today, that symbol represents something more. Today, more people can see themselves in the most powerful superhero in comics.""

In conversation with the Times, he added, ""The idea of replacing Clark Kent with another straight white savior felt like a missed opportunity.""

The ""new Superman had to have new fights — real world problems — that he could stand up to as one of the most powerful people in the world,"" he explained.

While Superman is not the first comic book character to receive the woke LGBT treatment, he is certainly the most famous.

NPR reported that just two months ago, DC Comics announced that the character of Tim Drake, who is one of numerous Robins in the multiverse, would begin a romantic relationship with another man.

""Yes, it's real. Big-time, marquee superheroes are officially queer,"" NPR wrote. ""Names even your most dithering, out-of-touch great-uncle would recognize: Robin, the Boy Wonder! Superman, the original superhero!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/superman-is-lgbt-dc-comics,2021-10-11
"Nearly 70 percent of Americans favor LGBT protections, but support has slipped since 2015","Nearly 70 percent of Americans favor ""broad nondiscrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,"" but overall support has slipped since 2015, according to the Public Religion Research Institute's new survey released Tuesday.

Republican support dipped by 5 points between 2015 and 2018, from 61 percent to 56 percent, according to the report.

Widespread support fell slightly from 71 percent to 69 percent, the survey showed.

""Notably, among Republicans, this drop in support has been concentrated among those who showed the highest support for LGBT protections just a few years ago,"" the American Values Atlas report said.

Only 48 percent of Republicans, 65 and older, support LGBT protections, and 42 percent are opposed, according to the report.

Younger Americans were more likely to favor nondiscrimination.

""There are fewer liberal Republicans today than there were in 2015 and fewer younger Republicans today than in 2015,"" PRRI CEO Robert Jones told NBC News. ""They've moved into the independent category.""

PRRI is a nonpartisan organization. The telephone poll's margin of error is 0.5 percent.

What about religious groups?

All major religious groups in the U.S. showed support for LGBT protection laws.

Unitarian Universalists showed the highest support at 90 percent, 4 points above New Age religions at 86 percent, the report said.

Jews and Hindus support LGBT protections at 80 percent and 79 percent, respectively, according to the report.

Of those surveyed, 59 percent of Orthodox Christians and 54 percent of white evangelical Christians said they favor such laws, the report said, but they also had the highest opposition at 33 percent and 38 percent, respectively.

At 53 percent, Jehovah's Witnesses were least likely to support protections, the survey said.

""Support among different religious traditions has remained relatively stable, with a few exceptions,"" the report said. ""Support for laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination has declined from 2015 levels among Buddhists (84%), Orthodox Christians (75%), Muslims (68%), and Hispanic Protestants (67%).""

What about political affiliations?

Women from all political affiliations were more likely than men to support laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the survey.

Among Republicans, 60 percent of women favored those protections compared to 52 percent of men.

Among Democrats, 80 percent of women and 75 percent of men supported laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination, the survey said.

Among independents, 74 percent of women supported nondiscrimination laws compared to 67 percent of men.

What else?

Jones told NBC News that he believes the survey's results are significant.



""I still think that certainly in today's polarized climate, it's quite remarkable on any issue to be able to say there's bipartisan, cross-religious support on an issue, and much less one like an issue like LGBT rights, one that's historically controversial,"" Jones said.

Supreme Court hears free speech case involving Christian web designer seeking to refuse to design same-sex wedding sites,"On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the high-profile free speech case involving Lorie Smith, a Christian graphic designer from Colorado, seeking to refuse to create same-sex wedding websites, Fox News Digital reported.



Smith, owner of 303 Creative, filed the lawsuit in 2016 against Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits a business from discriminating based on sexual orientation. According to Smith, being forced to create same-sex wedding websites would violate her sincerely held religious beliefs.

The high court's decision will determine whether all service providers will be forced to suppress their free speech rights in workplace environments. The justices presented multiple hypotheticals to determine whether ruling in Smith's favor would promote the First Amendment.

Smith was joined by her attorney, Kristen Waggoner of Alliance Defending Freedom, in an interview on Fox News' ""The Story"" Monday. Smith explained that Colorado is ""compelling and controlling"" her speech by ""forcing"" her to create custom artwork that goes against her Christian faith.

""I want to create unique one-of-a-kind expression and artwork, and I want to design websites – wedding websites, specifically – that are consistent with my faith,"" Smith stated.

""But the state of Colorado is compelling and controlling my speech, chilling it and forcing me to communicate a message through my custom, unique artwork,"" she continued. ""That violates the core of who I am, and at the core of this case is the right for all to speak freely, and that protects not only myself. [It] protects the LGBT web designer who should not be forced to create custom artwork that opposes same-sex marriage. The right to speak freely is guaranteed to each and every one of us, and a win for me is a win for everybody.""

Smith added that she does not believe anyone ""should be punished for communicating and speaking and creating custom artwork that goes along the lines of what they believe.""

""I serve people from all different walks of life, and I do have clients who identify as LGBT. I cannot create every message requested of me,"" Smith said. ""There are some messages I can't create no matter who requests them.""

Waggoner further clarified Smith's point and explained that she is not refusing service to anyone based on sexual orientation.

""What is important here is that Colorado even agrees that Ms. Smith serves all people,"" stated Waggoner. ""She does serve everyone. She has clients who identify as LGBT, and she serves them. And as the court many times today mentioned, her decisions turn on what the message is and not who the person is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-free-speech-case-christian-web-designer,2022-12-06
Supreme Court rejects appeal from Christian florist who refused to serve same-sex wedding,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday declined to take up the case of a Christian florist who refused to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding, letting lower court rulings against the florist stand.

The court rejected an appeal from Barronelle Stutzman, a great-grandmother and owner of Arlene's Flowers & Gifts who was sued by the state of Washington in 2013 for violating state law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. By refusing to hear the case, the court once again sidestepped the issue of whether a business can claim a First Amendment right to refuse service for same-sex weddings.

It's a decision comes three years after the court narrowly ruled in favor of Colorado cake baker Jack Phillips, who had refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. In that ruling, the court said the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted hostilely toward Phillips' religious views by compelling him to make the cake, but did not go further than the specific facts of that case, leaving the general conscience rights of businesses in question.



That question now remains unresolved. Stutzman, a Southern Baptist, had argued that she was exercising her First Amendment rights by refusing to provide floral arrangements for a homosexual couple's wedding ceremony. She contended that her floral arrangements were works of art and that being forced to provide them for a same-sex wedding would violate her ""relationship with Jesus Christ"" and her freedom of expression.

""Religious people should be free to live out their beliefs about marriage,"" Stutzman's lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom argued in court filings, according to NBC News.

State courts had ruled that Stutzman violated Washington law prohibiting businesses from discriminating against several protected classes of customers, including homosexuals. The Washington Supreme Court said that providing flowers for a wedding ""does not inherently express a message about that wedding.""

Ria Tabacco Mar, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represented the gay couple Stutzman refused to serve, praised the Supreme Court's decision.

""No one should walk into a store and have to wonder whether they will be turned away because of who they are. Preventing that kind of humiliation and hurt is exactly why we have nondiscrimination laws. Yet 60 percent of states still don't have express protections for LGBTQ people like the kind in Washington state. Our work isn't over,"" she said.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch said they would have heard the case.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-christian-florist-appeal,2021-07-02
"In case with far-reaching implications, Supreme Court will rule on whether LGBT status is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act","The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on whether or not the Civil Rights Act needs further clarification to include LGBT people specifically as a protected class.

What's the background?

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ""prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin."" The question before the Supreme Court now is whether or not this protection for employers against sex-based discrimination already extends to sexual orientation, making it a protected class.

One of the plaintiffs in the cases being brought before the court involves a New York skydiving instructor named Donald Zarda. According to the lawsuit, Zarda told a female skydiving client that he was gay to ease her mind about being strapped to him while skydiving. He claimed he was fired in 2010 for divulging this information after the woman's boyfriend complained to his employer.

Zarda would later die in a BASE-jumping accident in 2014, four years before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had been wrongfully terminated under Title VII.

Along with Zarda's case, the court will hear the case of a Georgia child welfare services coordinator and a transgender funeral home worker from Michigan, who both attest that they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Lower courts have disagreed about whether or not Title VII protections apply in these cases, with the 6th Circuit Court ruling they do, and the 11th Circuit Court ruling that they do not. The Trump administration has also argued that Title VII only applies to discrimination based on birth gender and not orientation or transgender identity.

What else?

In addition to answering more general questions about discrimination, this ruling could also determine whether or not religious organizations or business owners have a right to refuse to employ or do business with gay or transgender people on the basis of their personal convictions.

The Supreme Court had refused to hear a similar case in 2017.

Supreme Court rules that Trump's ban on transgender troops can go into effect; CNN calls the ruling 'extreme',"The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration's ban on transgender troops in the military can go into effect until lower courts issue a ruling on whether or not the ban is constitutional. CNN described this ruling as ""extreme.""

Though the high court lifted a temporary injunction on the ban, it did not issue a ruling on the case itself.



Here's what we know

In March, the White House issued a statement announcing that transgender people would be banned from military service on the basis that they presented a ""considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality."" That policy reversed an Obama-era policy that had allowed openly transgendered people to serve in the military.

In April, a federal judge ruled against the ban and upheld a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump's order from taking effect. The injunction had been issued in December 2017, a few months after Trump had announced on Twitter that he would be banning anyone who identified as transgender from being able to ""serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.""

Chief Justice John Roberts voted Tuesday with conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh in favor of lifting the injunction and allowing the policy to go into effect, while liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan voted against lifting the injunction.

However, the court did not take up the case itself. Lower courts will still decide the long-term future of the ban. The only thing the Supreme Court decided on Tuesday was that the ban could go into effect until such a time, if ever, that the lower courts ruled against it.

What did CNN say about it?

During its coverage of the decision, CNN correspondent Jessica Schneider said that the Supreme Court was ""taking a pretty extreme step here"" since the decision could stand for months or even potentially years while lower courts debated the case. ""And yes, it will have consequences within the military,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-trump-military-transgender-ban,2019-01-22
"Major airline to sever ties with chocolate supplier over the owner's pro-life, Christian views","Swiss Air Lines is said to have nixed its relationship chocolate manufacturer Läderach over its owner's affiliation with pro-life, Christian causes, LifeSiteNews' Martin Bürger reported.

The airline had a business relationship with chocolatier Läderach that spanned over a decade, providing passengers with small boxes of its world-famous chocolates as a way of saying thanks for flying with the airlines.

Now, after months of protests from activists, Swiss Air has decided to sever ties with the chocolate-maker and will stop distributing its truffles and other sweets in the first half of 2020.

Why are they attacking a chocolate-maker?

The owner of Läderach, Jürg Läderach, is also the president of Christianity For Today, an evangelical organization based in Switzerland. The company's CEO, Johannes Läderach, is also on the board of CFT. The organization is a sponsor of various March for Life rallies in the European nation.

On its website, CFT also promotes traditional marriage between a man and a woman, reinforced by a Christian foundation, as the backbone of civilization. The organization also calls for parents to instill Christian values in their children and the protection of human life—from conception in the womb to natural death.

Attacks on stores

In October, far left activists attacked one of the chocolate-manufacturer's boutiques in Basel, Switzerland, with butyric acid, which is said to have a strong odor similar to human vomit. LifeSiteNews noted that after the attack, Läderach had to close its shop in Basel for two days. Additionally, a German newspaper reported acts of vandalism in seven individual stores.

Shortly before Swiss Air Line decided to end its business ties with Läderach, a German LGBT group called for boycotts of the chocolatier. ""One way of protesting would be, for example, if hotels or restaurants decided to eliminate Läderach's products from their range of goods and clearly mark the reason.""



Läderach CEO Johannes Läderach commented on the controversy in an interview: ""The business in Switzerland will still grow in 2019, but we have customers who will no longer buy from us. However, new customers came into the store, who were sorry to see a conflict being played out on the back of the employees.""

Läderach denied that either she or her company have any issues with LGBT communities and emphasized the chocolatier has zero tolerance for discrimination.

""We have homosexuals working for us, too. We don't ask them. I attended a gay network event because I wanted to hear what the LGBTQ movement has against Läderach. There, I explained that I may have a different opinion on same-sex marriage [sic] or on the question of when life begins. But this does not mean that I have anything against homosexuals. Läderach has a zero tolerance for discrimination,"" Läderach said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/swiss_air_partnership_pro_life_chocolate,2020-02-02
Taiwan becomes the first Asian country to legalize gay marriage,"Taiwan's Legislature on Friday approved a measure to legalize gay marriage. The move makes Taiwan the first Asian country to allow same-sex unions.

""Taiwan is moving in line with the world's trend as it echoes the universal call for rights equality,"" Jennifer Lu, chief coordinator of gay rights group Marriage Equality Coalition Taiwan, told the South Morning China Post.

About 40,000 supporters stood outside the Legislature in pouring rain to celebrate the passing of the landmark decision, which goes into effect May 24.

The bill's supporters said gay couples had faced discrimination for too long.

""They don't need to worry about that anymore,"" Hsiao Bi-Khim, Democratic Progressive Party legislator, told the Morning Post. ""After today, there is no need for them to face discriminatory treatments from others.""

The decision follows a constitutional ruling in 2017 that declared that the nation's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional.

What are the details?

Starting next Friday, same-sex couples can begin registering their marriages with government agencies, the Morning Post reported.

""I believe the disputes over same-sex marriage will soon come to an end,"" Lu said. ""People will find the day is still bright and the Earth still moves after same-sex people start registering for marriage.""

Marriages between a Taiwanese citizen and a foreign national would be recognized by authorities if the foreigner's country has allowed legalized gay marriage.

Under the new law, same-sex couples can file joint income tax declarations and serve as the medical power of attorney for their partners.

Spouses would also be allowed to adopt their partner's biological children.

What did opponents say?

Some opponents held protests, some which turned violent, while others threatened to pull support from lawmakers who supported the bill.

What else?

Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen said the bill showed that ""kindness and conscience"" were still held as strong values on the island.

""I congratulate our gay friends for being able to win society's blessing, and I also want to say thanks to those who have different beliefs but still offered support for this law,"" Tsai wrote on social media, according to the report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taiwan-legalizes-gay-marriage,2019-05-17
Female skateboarder speaks out about losing to transgender competitor,"Female skateboarder Taylor Silverman is speaking out about losing to a biological male — in an Instagram post, Silverman said that she placed second in a Red Bull competition and lost out on prize money because of a transgender competitor.

Silverman placed second in the Red Bull Cornerstone competition last year.

""My name is Taylor Silverman. I am a female athlete. I have been skateboarding for eleven years and competing for several years. I have been in three different contests with trans women, two of which I placed second. At the last contest series I did for Redbull, I placed second. The trans competitor who won took $1000 dollars in qualifiers, $3000 in finals, and $1000 in best trick. This totaled to $5000 of the prize money meant for the female athletes. I took $1000 in qualifiers and $1750 for second place, so $2750 in total. The girl who took third received $750. The girl who deserved $1000 for best trick took nothing along with whoever would have placed third. I deserved to place first, be acknowledged for my win, and get paid. I reached out to Redbull and was ignored. I am sick of being bullied into silence,"" Silverman wrote.

Silverman posted an email that she said she sent to Red Bull, but she noted that she has not received a reply.

""I am reaching out in hopes of being directed to the right person to express my concerns about what occurred at the Redbull Cornerstone contest with the transgender competitor in the women's division,"" she wrote. ""A biological man with a clear advantage won the women's division, best trick, and also won multiple qualifiers. This took away the opportunity that was meant for women to place and earn money. What happened was unfair and at the time I was too uncomfortable to speak up. I understand that in todays society even some women think this is acceptable, but I believe in doing the right thing even if it's not the popular thing. I now realize it's really important for me to speak up and I'd like to schedule a time to talk.""

While some on Instagram agreed with Silverman's sentiments, others promoted radical leftist gender ideology and decried Silverman for her comments.



""Good for you for speaking up Taylor! I support you. Please try to keep in mind that the internet is not an accurate snapshot of reality so the abuse you're getting here is not the voice of those around you. The VAST majority of people even in the most liberal areas agree with what you're saying here. I am sorry you're getting abuse for saying so,"" one commenter wrote.

Taylor Swift uses VMAs to take shot at Trump's White House over LGBT rights,"Music superstar Taylor Swift called out the White House over an LGBTQ rights petition at the Video Music Awards Monday night.

After accepting the fan-voted award for video of the year for her song ""You Need to Calm Down"" — which advocates LGBTQ rights both through song lyrics and video artistry — Swift turned her attention to the White House and advancing the LGBTQ agenda.

""I first want to say thank you to the fans because in this video, several points were made, so you voting for this video means that you want a world where we're all treated equally under the law, regardless of who we are, regardless of how we identify,"" Swift said.

""At the end of this video there was a petition — and there still is a petition — for the Equality Act, which basically just says we all deserve equal rights under the law,"" the pop star continued.



""I want to thank everyone who signed that petition because it now has half-a-million signatures, which is five times the amount that it would need to warrant a response from the White House,"" she said.

As Swift discussed the petition and the non-response from the White House, she looked down at her wrist to reference a watch — she was not wearing one — and looked up with a face of disgust. The reaction won Swift an enormous applause from the audience.

President Donald Trump and the White House have not responded to Swift.

Teacher asks whether there is a non-binary form of 'ma'am',"Libs of TikTok shared a video in which an individual, who apparently teaches somewhere in Texas and identifies as non-binary, asked whether there is a non-binary equivalent for the term ""ma'am.""

The individual's TikTok account includes a description that says, ""Your local non-binary Math Teacher."" The account also includes the pronouns ""They/Them.""



""I've come out to my students,"" the teacher noted in the video. The person went on to say that a student had inquired about what language should be used, noting that referring to the teacher by saying ""yes ma'am"" or ""yes"" both seemed disrespectful.

The teacher, who noted in the video that the terms ""ma'am"" and ""sir"" are used to show respect, asked in the TikTok video whether there is a non-binary version.

""Open discussion welcome in the comments #teacher #nonbinary #enby,"" the TikTok post states.

When sharing the video, the Libs of TikTok account declared, ""These are the people teaching your kids.""

In response to the tweet, one person commented, ""My genuine question is, 'Why are you discussing your sexuality with students?'""



""Marxist Queer Theory: the abolition of normal,"" Adam Baldwin tweeted in response to the Libs of TikTok post.

""Get your kids out of government schools,"" the Libertarian Party tweeted.

In a TikTok post last month, the teacher discussed having hung up a pride flag in the classroom. ""I don't know if I'm allowed to hang it up this year, um, but I did,"" the person said.

Many parents would likely be disturbed to find out that their child's teacher is openly identifying as non-binary to students and taking actions such as displaying an LGBT flag in the classroom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-non-binary-maam-tiktok,2022-09-06

What are the details?

Chris Sutherland — the brother of the unnamed teacher at Marysville Middle School, which is about 40 minutes north of Seattle — is a former officer who served with the Marysville Police Department and also was a school resource officer during a deadly high school shooting in the city, Rantz wrote.

Sutherland's sister initially placed a Thin Blue Line sticker on her laptop to honor her brother and other law enforcement officers, KTTH noted — but an assistant principal objected to the sticker.

Rantz — citing a human resources document on the incident — reported that the assistant principal had ""concerns about how students, families, and community members might interpret what the image is intending to communicate, and that this interpretation may cause a disruption to the learning environment.""

But the objections were soon dropped, KTTH reported.

The HR document added that the the teacher also displayed a Thin Blue Line flag on her classroom's bulletin board surrounded by photos of her brother, Rantz wrote.

Well, that prompted a second assistant principal to order the teacher to take down the flag, KTTH said.

""They told her that it's controversial to have that flag up,"" Sutherland told Rantz on his KTTH program. ""That it makes kids and staff feel unsafe, which to me, that does not make sense at all.""

Rantz added that an HR representative from Marysville School District 25 sent the teacher a letter of clarification about the issue indicating officials were ""highly concerned about the impact of this political symbol on students, staff, and families of Marysville Middle School"" and that there were ""concerns from other staff members about how this political symbol might negatively impact the overall professional work environment.""

Remove the flag!

The letter ordered the teacher to remove the flag and told her her to ""refrain from using the 'Thin Blue Line Flag' symbol"" in the classroom, KTTH said, adding that failure to do so ""may result in further disciplinary action.""

The district confirmed to the station that the situation is a personnel matter and wouldn't comment. Rantz added that while the letter of clarification said the district supports police, a district spokesperson wouldn't explain why a Thin Blue Line flag is banned for being political while Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ messages and symbols are allowed.

BLM, LGBTQ messages apparently are no problem

Sutherland told Rantz that his sister has seen BLM messages in classrooms and ""hanging on walls, which she was told is OK. Just for whatever reason, just the Thin Blue Line flag cannot be hung up there."" Rantz added that the teacher also displayed an LGBTQ pride flag to support a gay family member.

Yet, KTTH said, symbols of BLM and LGBTQ — which have political undertones — haven't been targeted by the district for removal.

Teacher takes down Thin Blue Line flag

Rantz said the teacher took down her Thin Blue Line flag display but told the district that the ordeal ""has been the most traumatic and hostile"" experience for her at the school to date.

She added that the order to remove the flag came from ""an agenda rather than really wanting to gain any understanding of me, who I am, or my story,"" she added in respond to the HR rep, KTTH reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-ordered-remove-thin-blue-line-flag,2021-09-27
6th grade choir teacher separates kids into 'privileged' and 'targeted' groups in lesson on 'oppression',"A middle school choir teacher in Minnesota recently taught a class full of sixth-graders about various ""types of oppression"" by separating students into ""privileged"" and ""targeted"" categories, during what the school called a ""social-emotional lesson.""

The revelation is just the latest example of educators and administrators force-feeding critical race theory and progressive political ideology to young, impressionable students — often while the social engineering campaign goes completely unnoticed by parents.

What are the details?

Far from receiving musical instruction, students at Sunrise Park Middle School near St. Paul, Minnesota, recently received a heavy dose of intersectional brainwashing from their choir teacher, Odelis Anderson, according to lesson plan documents obtained by TheBlaze.

In an introductory note, Anderson told students, ""Last week, we talked about how hard it is to talk about race, and the level of difficulty is different for different people. For people who are privileged, it's much easier to talk about race and other issues. For people who are not privileged, it's much harder. Today, we will look at different types of oppression, and whether each of us is in the privileged group or the targeted group.""

Then, according to the lesson plan, which the school confirmed as real in an email to TheBlaze, students were asked to view a chart describing different types of oppression as well as ""privileged groups"" and ""targeted groups"" and assess which category they belonged in.



The chart listed five types of oppression for the students' consideration: Racism, sexism, religious oppression, heterosexism, and xenophobia.

The ""privileged groups"" outlined in the chart consisted of individuals who are white, male, Christian, heterosexual, and were born in the United States. The ""targeted groups"" described individuals who are any ethnicity besides white, who are female, who are Muslim or have any religious affiliation besides Christianity, identify as LGBT, and were not born in the United States.

Anderson, whose LinkedIn profile touts her commitment to offering ""socially diverse and just education to ALL learners,"" presented the lesson to students over video conference last month. The school's overarching district, White Bear Lake Area Schools, offers distance learning options amid the coronavirus pandemic.

TheBlaze reached out to Anderson with a request for comment about the lesson plan, but she has yet to respond.



What else?



In an email exchange with TheBlaze, White Bear Lake Area Schools director of communications Marisa Vette confirmed the details of the lesson plan in full.

In the email, Vette explained that the purpose of the lesson was ""to help students understand that everyone is different and everyone experiences the world differently,"" adding, ""We wanted our students to listen to each other's perspectives and put themselves in others' shoes.""

She also noted the activity is a part of a series of ""social-emotional lesson[s]"" conducted by the school during the homeroom hour ""a couple times a week,"" in which students are instructed about a number of topics, ""including self awareness, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making.""

With the homeroom hour being dropped amid the school's distance learning program, teachers have conducted the lesson during their first-period classes, she explained. Thus the reason for choir class featuring the ""social-emotional"" content.

""It is our responsibility to ensure that each of our students' needs are being met,"" added Superintendent Wayne Kazmierczak in a statement. ""We know from listening to our students that our continued and sustained commitment to educational equity is a critical part of how we achieve our stated district mission and close gaps that currently exist in our student outcome measures.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-separates-students-priveleged-targeted-groups,2021-03-03
'Endless propaganda' — Ted Cruz slams Sesame Street for virtue-signaling tweet,"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas summed up the feeling of many when he criticized a tweet from the official account of the children's show ""Sesame Street"" as propaganda.

""Endless propaganda. This is a taxpayer-funded show targeted at Pre-K children,"" Cruz tweeted.

""It doesn't need to be talking about sex or sexuality at all,"" he added.



The tweet in question showed various hands of the characters in the show reaching toward a multi-colored heart with the message, ""Love always wins. #PrideMonth.""

Puppets do not have a sexual orientation

This is not the first time the popular kids' show has been politicized. In 2018, a writer for the show revealed that he wrote Bert and Ernie as gay characters.

An official statement from the show denied that the characters were in a gay relationship and said that puppets do not have a sexual orientation.

""They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very different from themselves,"" the statement read.

""Even though they are identified as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics (as most Sesame Street Muppets do), they remain puppets, and do not have a sexual orientation,"" it concluded.

The tweet with that statement has since been deleted.

Lieu stands silently after announcing that he will recite Jesus's words on homosexuality,"During remarks Wednesday on the House floor, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California announced that he was going to recite Jesus' words regarding homosexuality, and he then proceeded to stand in silence for about 20 seconds.

Lieu noted that in March 2022 the Washington Post issued an article bearing the title, ""GOP lawmakers push historic wave of bills targeting rights of LGBTQ teens, children and their families,"" and that in April the outlet published an article called ""Some Republicans fear party overreach on LGBT measures.""



""I just thought I would now recite for you what Jesus Christ said about homosexuality,"" Lieu declared, before standing there silently.

While Lieu's stunt seemed to be an attempt to mock Christians for standing against the LGBT movement by pointing out that Jesus never spoke about the issue, Christians recognize that Jesus is God, the entire Bible is the word of God, and scripture reveals God's plan for marriage and his opposition to homosexuality.



Leftists around the U.S. have been seeking to promote the LGBT agenda throughout society, while Christians and others have been striving to push back against the radical movement. Chief among the areas of debate are topics such as whether children should be exposed to radical leftist gender ideology in school, and whether biological males should be permitted to compete in women's sports.

President Biden issued a proclamation recognizing so-called ""Pride Month"" again this year.

In the proclamation, Biden claimed that ""the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans are under relentless attack,"" and he declared ""June 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Pride Month.""

""I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the achievements of the LGBTQI+ community, to celebrate the great diversity of the American people, and to wave their flags of pride high,"" the proclamation says.

Various government entities have also been hoisting pride flags and issuing tweets in recognition of the cause du jour.

Canadian doctors tell father they will inject his 14-year-old daughter with male hormones for transition without his permission,"The father of a 14-year-old girl apparently doesn't have much to say in the way of approving — or disapproving — his daughter's request to receive hormone therapy to assist in a gender transition.

What are the details?

Maxine (not the child's real name) was attending a British Columbia school when her dad discovered that school officials were treating her as a male — at her request.

According to a Tuesday article in The Federalist, his daughter started going by a male name — Quinn — without his knowledge or permission.

The outlet pointed to British Columbia's Ministry of Education's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Policy, which stipulates that administrators in the education system are not required to disclose students' sexual orientation or gender identification to parents.

Needless to say, the child's father was disturbed by the news.

The Federalist reported that the young girl had a troubled recent history and had suffered from depression since her parents' divorce, which took place in 2013. The young girl's father noted that his daughter had previously gone through a phase of lesbianism, as well.

The school referred the girl to a LGBT activist psychologist, Dr. Wallance Wong, who insisted that the child be permitted to undergo gender reassignment therapy, and suggested that she begin receiving hormone injections.

Naturally, the young girl's father would not consent.

It didn't matter.

The hospital decided to forge ahead with the treatment without the consent of the teen's dad anyway.

A letter to the girl's father and obtained by The Federalist stated, ""Quinn's healthcare team has concluded that he possesses sufficient maturity and intelligence to be capable of consenting to his own medical care, notwithstanding the fact that he is only 14 years old.""

The letter continued:

Furthermore, the team agrees that the proposed course of treatment is in his best interests. We appreciate that these conclusions differ from your own. ... We always strive to get parents to agree to support a proposed course of treatment, however, under these circumstances we are of the view that it is ultimately up to Quinn to give or withhold consent to his own medical care; neither you nor his mother can make this decision for him.

The hormone injections were to commence within two weeks of her father receiving the letter.

What did the girl's dad do next?

In response to the letter, Maxine's dad filed a court motion to prevent the facility from filling up his daughter with hormones to assist in a gender reassignment for which he did not approve. The British Columbia Supreme Court agreed to temporarily prevent the girl from receiving injections until further notice.

Last week, according to The Federalist, ""the British Columbia Supreme Court considered a motion to prevent the hospital from injecting Maxine with testosterone for another 45 days in order to allow a full adjudication of the case.""

""I have no problem with [Maxine] exploring the role of being male,"" the young girl's father said during a recent interview about the case. ""It's not, to me, a transgender issue.""

Her father noted that he has more of an issue with the way the school and the hospital circumvented his parental rights and responsibilities than anything else.

""It just happens to be that it involves transgenderism,"" he added.

Tennessee Republican lawmakers file bills giving adoption agencies right to refuse services to gay couples,"Tennessee lawmakers have filed multiple bills this week which would allow adoption agencies to deny services to gay couples.

In one bill, proposed on Thursday by Republicans Joey Hensley and John Ragan, agencies would not be forced to go against their ""sincerely held religious beliefs,"" USA Today reported.

""We were concerned that adoption agencies, such as religious adoption agencies, would be required to allow adoption when they had religious beliefs that contradicted certain lifestyles,"" Hensley told USA Today. ""That they would be forced to allow adoptions to people they felt were not appropriate parents, so we didn't want those agencies to not be able to provide adoptions.""

Same-sex couples would still have the option to adopt children through secular agencies.

""I don't think a gay couple is the best environment for children,"" Hensley said. ""Certainly, legally, they can adopt children and they can have children, but I think every child needs a mother and a father. The best environment is a mother and a father.""

Similar legislation filed Wednesday by Republican Tim Rudd would prevent lawsuits against adoption agencies who refuse service.

""There's a lot of other adoption agencies that are not religious-based,"" Hensley said. ""There's certainly other options for people who want to adopt.""

Catholic Charities in New York recently decided to discontinue its foster care and adoption services based on state laws which prevent adoption agencies from turning down gay couples, Hensley noted.

What do opposers say?

Tennessee Equality Project's Executive Director Chris Sanders argued that the legislation was motivated by a ""desire to discriminate"" against gay couples.

""If there were some issue, all the people who are involved in same-sex relationships who are parents through other means, not adoption, would not be fit, but the studies don't show that,"" Sanders told the newspaper.

But the bill would also apply to single parent adoptions and unmarried couple adoptions, Hensley explained.

What else?

Lawmakers passed similar measures in Kansas and Oklahoma last year, according to the report.



""We're very concerned about the possible movement of this bill,"" Sanders said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tennessee-republican-adoption-gay-couples,2019-02-08
Tennis legend and LGBT activist Martina Navratilova says allowing trans female athletes to compete as women is 'insane and cheating',"Tennis legend Martina Navratilova was criticized last year after calling for standards to be set as an increasing number of transgender biologically-male athletes are competing in women's sports.

After promising to research the topic further, she penned an op-ed on Sunday reaffirming her views and calling it ""insane and cheating"" to allow a man to switch genders in order to ""win everything in sight.""

What are the details?

In December, Navratilova tweeted, ""You can't just proclaim yourself female and be able to compete against women. There must be some standards, and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.""

Online outrage ensued. The nine-time Wimbledon champion — who in 1981 became one of the first prominent worldwide athletes to come out as bisexual (and then subsequently as lesbian), and who has long campaigned for LGBT rights — was labeled ""transphobic"" in a series of responses by transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon. McKinnon was born male and won an event at the UCI Masters Track World Championship in the women's division last year.

In response, Navratilova deleted her original message, and promised to educate herself on the matter before writing, ""Rachel, you might be an expert on all things trans but you are one nasty human being,"" adding she wouldn't be ""bullied"" into silence.

But McKinnon persisted in her tirade against the tennis star, telling Navratilova, ""You are not 'pro-trans people' if you say that trans women with a penis must not compete in women's sport. That's transphobic. Genitals do not play sports. What part of a penis is related to tennis? How does that 'level' any playing field?""

On Sunday, Navratilova penned an op-ed in The London Times, where she reaffirmed her position that ""the rules on trans athletes reward cheats and punish the innocent."" Navratilova said that after further researching the issue, her views on the topic were even more strengthened.

""To put the argument at its most basic: a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organization is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires,"" Navratilova wrote. ""It's insane and it's cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair.""

She further argued, ""Simply reducing hormone levels — the prescription most sports have adopted — does not solve the problem. A man builds up muscle and bone density, as well as a greater number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, from childhood.""

Anything else?

Navratilova's piece attracted both praise and ridicule, with critics and supporters alike pointing to the fact that Navratilova played and beat trans female tennis player Renee Richards in 1977. Navratilova — a lesbian and avowed feminist — eventually hired Richards as a coach.

Richards was born male and began competing in women's tennis at age 40. Reflecting back on her decision, a 77-year-old Richards told Slate in 2012, ""Having lived for the past 30 years, I know if I'd had surgery at the age of 22, and then at 24 went on the tour, no genetic woman in the world would have been able to come close to me. And so I've reconsidered my opinion.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tennis-legend-navratilova-says-allowing-trans-female-athletes-to-compete-as-women-is-insane-and-cheating,2019-02-18
"Texas AG blasts possible LGBTQ 'indoctrination' at school district's Pride Week. 'Queer Eye' showings, 'nail painting' parties allegedly offered at HS.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton blasted ""Pride Week"" activities at the Austin Independent School District in a letter posted to Twitter, saying they constitute ""human sexuality instruction"" allowable only with parents' consent. He also accused the district of participating in LGBTQ ""indoctrination.""

Allegedly among the ""Pride Week"" activities are ""Queer Eye"" showings and ""nail painting"" parties at a district high school.

What are the details?

""Liberal school districts are aggressively pushing LGBTQ+ views on Texas kids! All behind parents’ backs! This is immoral and illegal,"" Paxton added in a follow-up tweet. ""I will work with and for parents to hold deceptive sexual propagandists and predators accountable.""

Paxton's Tuesday letter noted that the district's activities happening this week are ""at best"" an ""instructional effort in human sexuality without parental consent"" or ""worse"" the district is ""cynically pushing ... indoctrination of your students that ... subtly cuts parents out of the loop. Either way you're breaking the law.""

The attorney general added that he heard reports about ""community circles"" in which ""sensitive topics"" are discussed and that ""students are encouraged to keep [them] confidential, presumably from parents.""

But Austin school officials pushed back, saying in a statement to the Austin American-Statesman that community circles are ""confidential"" in the sense that they make ""students feel trusted and respected for their privacy when sharing in the conversations — it does not mean don't tell your parents.""

Interestingly, a Libs of Tik Tok tweet said Doss Elementary's instructions — after ""parent and social media backlash"" — were updated to reflect that teachers are to inform students they can tell parents about Pride Week activities:

Indeed, the American-Statesman reported that backlash to this year's Pride Week resulted in death threats against Doss Elementary teachers and ""prompted the school to move Wednesday's pride parade indoors, with police present."" District spokesman Jason Stanford added to the paper that ""we were actually worried that this political controversy could possibly threaten the safety of these kids.""

Libs of TikTok also posted video to Twitter showing what it said was an indoor Pride Parade at Doss Elementary:

In addition, it was claimed that activities such as ""Queer Eye"" showings and ""nail painting"" parties were scheduled at James Bowie High School:

The Austin ISD — in response to TheBlaze's request for comment Thursday regarding claims that Doss Elementary's Pride Week instructions were amended to make sure students are told they can talk to their parents, and that ""Queer Eye"" showings and ""nail painting"" parties were scheduled at James Bowie High School — said ""these are all ways we are celebrating inclusion this week."" The district also repeated statements to TheBlaze that it made to the Austin American-Statesman in defense of Pride Week.

'Political attacks'

In response to Paxton's letter, Austin ISD Superintendent Stephanie S. Elizalde tweeted the following: ""I want all our LGBTQIA+ students to know that we are proud of them and that we will protect them against political attacks.""

In addition, the American-Statesman reported that Stanford said Paxton is wrong, legally and factually, to equate Pride Week with sex education.

""Pride is about celebrating who people are, particularly members of the LGBT community who are bullied much more than the community at large, who experience suicide at much higher rates, who skip school at twice the rate of straight kids because of worries about their safety,"" Stanford told the paper.

""In Austin, it's really important to us to let all these kids know that we love them and they're welcome and they're safe,"" he added to the American-Statesman. ""It might surprise the attorney general to find out that this is a pretty normal idea here in Austin, that we love everybody.""

And while Paxton's letter advised the Austin ISD to ""rectify this situation"" and warned that parents could take action against the school district, the paper said Stanford brushed aside the attorney general's cautions.

""This is nothing our lawyers are taking seriously at all because he's so wrong about the law,"" Stanford told the American-Statesman. ""We thank the attorney general for his interest, but we will continue to celebrate Pride.""

Texas church saves library's drag queen story hour,"A progressive church in Leander, Texas, has stepped in to hold a previously canceled drag queen story hour at the local public library, after the event was previously canceled by city officials.

What are the details?

The Leander Public Library, located 30 miles north of Austin, originally slated the event for last month before calling it off at the behest of the mayor and others who, according to the Washington Post, ""castigated the library's staff for choosing 'to wade into social issues water without approval from City Staff.'""

The library was flooded with calls from advocates both for and against holding the event, which includes men dressed in provocative women's clothing reading books to school-age children.

When nearby LGBT-friendly Open Cathedral Church learned of the hubbub, they offered to host the event as a private group, and the story hour has been rescheduled for this coming weekend.

While requests for booking spots at the event have been overwhelming, the library expects protestors to show up, too. The drag queen story hour will be held in a private conference room, and the rest of the building will be closed for security reasons. The Hill reported that the library will, however, have designated areas to ""allow for peaceful assembly outdoors.""

Similar kids' events have sprouted up in libraries across the county in recent years, purportedly aimed at expanding inclusivity while educating youth. But they haven't all gone off without a hitch. Earlier this year, a library in Houston, Texas, was forced to cancel their program after it was discovered one of the ""performers"" had previously been charged with sexual assault of a minor.

Anything else?

Open Cathedral Church touts its unconventional teaching of the gospel on its website, where it also declares, ""we cherish our differences and celebrate our unity. We are gay, straight, black, and white. We are all loved by God.""

The congregation meets at the Christian Camacho Elementary School in order to, as one parishioner explains in a promotional video, ""to intentionally remove barriers from those who have been hurt by weaponized religion in the past.""

Texas college student leaders want Chick-fil-A thrown off campus — and their vote is unanimous,"The senate of Trinity University's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution recommending the removal of Chick-fil-A from the San Antonio campus, the Trinitonian reported.

""Trinity's values of diversity and inclusion and Chick-fil-a's values regarding the LGBT+ community are mutually exclusive,"" last week's resolution said, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

In March, the city of San Antonio banned Chick-fil-A from its airport over the restaurant's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ"" behavior.

'Looks really bad'

""Obviously [the presence of Chick-fil-A] has the potential to make a lot of people feel uncomfortable on campus, and also it looks really bad for Trinity in the context of recruiting potential students who may be a part of the LGBTQ community,"" senator Claire Carlson told the Trinitonian.

Chick-fil-A doesn't have a permanent presence at the private college but is one of several chains at the Commons Food Court that come to campus on a rotating basis, typically once every two weeks, the Express-News said.

The May 1 resolution cited Chick-fil-A's donations to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Paul Anderson Youth Home, as well as its score of zero on the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign's 2015 Corporate Equality Index ""for failing to protect their LGBT+ employees from discrimination in the workplace,"" the Express-News added.

""Underrepresented students from the LGBT+ community have expressed the drastic assault on their identities and beings as a result of Chick-fil-a's ideals and actions, and SGA stands to represent all students regardless of the size of the community,"" the resolution added, the paper said. ""Trinity is a university that emphasizes its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Having Chick-fil-a in the rotation at Revolve conflicts with those values.""

Ty Tinker, student government president, told the Express-News the SGA decided to go after Chick-fil-A when ""a lot of proactive folks, including PRIDE [Trinity's student LGBT group], came to student government and university administrators.""

Small minority



But student Christopher Ault told the Express-News that only a small minority of students have pushed to oust Chick-fil-A: ""I like the values that it stands for,"" he told the paper in reference to the restaurant's Christian values.

Isaiah Mitchell, president of Trinity's Young Conservatives of Texas, told the Express-News that Chick-fil-A's donations do not harm LGBTQ people.

""The Salvation Army, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, these other organizations that Chick-fil-A supports, do not actually cause harm to the LGBT community,"" he told the paper, noting that standing ""against the political goals of the LGBTQ left"" does not rise to the level of ""actually harming.""

The Trinity student government's resolution in and of itself doesn't affect Chick-fil-A's on-campus presence, but it can be sent to administrators for their consideration.

Anything else?

The vice chair of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's academic senate likened Chick-fil-A to ""pornography"" as the faculty body earlier this week voted overwhelmingly to kick the restaurant off campus after 25 years.

"Texas dad's update on nightmare custody fight with ex-wife who makes their son, 6, live as transgender girl","Jeffrey Younger, a Texas father of two boys, has received some crucial attention in the last few months due to his nightmare custody battle with his ex-wife who claims that one of their sons, James, is a transgender girl.

And in a podcast episode earlier this week that updated listeners on his situation, Younger explained his gut-wrenching quandary: ""The only way you survive this and get your son through this alive is to calmly allow your son to be tortured right before your eyes and outlast the opposition.""

What's the background?

Younger said issues with the way his wife was treating James commenced over three years ago when he complained she would lock him in his room and say things like ""the monsters only eat boys.""

Since their divorce, Younger said his ex-wife socially transitioned James and gave him a new name — Luna — which his teachers use. James, now 6, also dresses as a girl and uses the girls' restroom at school — and soon may be headed to hormone transitioning.

Thing is, Younger said James told him he isn't a girl and ""violently refuses to dress as girl at my house."" But regardless, Younger said his ex-wife not only is on the path toward forcing Dad to accept James' transition to female — and pay for things like a transgender-affirming therapist and hormone treatments and other procedures — but also to remove custody rights such as overnight visitation. And all with the blessing of the courts.

""She filed a motion last year to modify [custody]"" and ""claimed I was refusing to recognize and affirm his female identity,"" he said during an hourlong interview with Luke Macias, a Texas-based conservative Christian political consultant. Younger added that he now has to ""pass transgender education"" and only use female pronouns for his son.

""I can never present James as a boy to outside world,"" Younger added.

Here are a few stirring moments from Younger's podcast interview:

""I want you to imagine having electronic communication with you son on FaceTime, and imagine that your ex-wife has dressed him as a drag queen to talk to you. He has false eyelashes and makeup. His hair has got glitter in it. He's wearing a dress. Now imagine how you would feel seeing what I believe is actual sexual abuse — I believe this is not just emotional abuse but is the very, most fundamental form of sexual abuse, tampering with the sexual identity of a vulnerable boy. Every. Single. Day. You have to see your son sexually abused, and you have to maintain your calm ... because the courts are not going to be fair to you. And the only way you can survive this and get your son through this alive is to calmly allow your son to be tortured right before your eyes and outlast the opposition. That's what it's like.""

What else?

At this point, Younger said he and his ex-wife are in a custody evaluation period, and the legal proceedings have become ""very expensive.""

Fortunately, donation sites have been established that have raised about $70,000 for Younger's legal expenses. You can visit them here and here. There are a pair of petitions folks can sign — one at change.org and another for the White House to check out if enough signatures are gathered.

The podcast hosts also noted that about half of the emails that have come in reacting to the online sites have been from those in the LGBT community who support Younger.



Younger remained calm throughout his interview, but a gnawing question continues to eat at him.

""They're asking me to affirm a delusion,"" he said, adding that ""we don't ask it in any other instances. Why on this one issue parents don't have the right ... to educate their children?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-dads-update-on-nightmare-custody-battle-with-ex-wife-who-insists-their-son-6-is-transgender-girl,2019-01-30
Texas House passes bill that would largely bar students from playing school sports meant for members of the opposite biological sex,"The Texas House of Representatives on Thursday passed legislation that would largely prohibit allowing students to compete in public school sports that are designated for members of the opposite biological sex.

The legislation, which the House chamber approved by a 76-54 vote, comes as ongoing cultural debate rages nationwide over whether or not students should be permitted to play on sports teams and utilize restroom facilities based on their gender identity when that identity is different than their biological sex.

While the bill would largely block students from sports meant for members of the opposite sex, it would allow girls to compete in competitions designated for biological boys if there is not a female version available.

The legislation states that ""an interscholastic athletic team sponsored or authorized by a school district or open-enrollment charter school may not allow a student to compete in an interscholastic athletic competition sponsored or authorized by the district or school that is designated for the biological sex opposite to the student's biological sex as correctly stated on"" that person's official birth certificate. If the birth certificate is not available, a different government record may be used.

According to the bill, the sex listed on the birth certificate would be viewed as having accurately stated the student's biological sex only if it was recorded at or around the time of the individual's birth or if it was modified to fix any sort of scrivener or clerical error regarding the person's biological sex.

The University Interscholastic League, which governs schools sports in the Lone Star State according to the Texas Tribune, already stipulates that gender should be identified based on an individual's birth certificate or similar government documents if a birth certificate is not available. The Tribune said that the UIL recognizes any legally altered birth certificate.

""This is all about girls and protecting them in our UIL sports,"" state Republican Rep. Valoree Swanson declared Thursday on the House floor, according to the outlet.



""The Texas House just voted to discriminate against trans kids and exclude them from playing sports as their authentic selves,"" the ACLU of Texas tweeted on Thursday. ""For months, trans kids and advocates have been fighting against bills like HB 25. That fight doesn't end tonight.""

Texas school district approves 'aggressive' sex ed curriculum for grades 3 through 8 amid protests,"The Austin Independent School District in Texas approved revisions to its sexual education curriculum for third- through eighth-grade students during a meeting that started Monday night and ended Tuesday morning due to the number of concerned parents who wanted to give input on the curriculum, according to the Austin American-Statesman.

Although the curriculum was unanimously approved by the board, 126 parents signed up to give their feedback on the changes. The parents were reportedly roughly split between parents speaking against the curriculum, and those who were in favor of it.

Those against the new education plan raised concerns that it gives children too much information at a young age, that it normalizes sexual behavior in children, and that it teaches information about gender identity and expression that runs counter to the beliefs and values of some in the community.

""I get the sensitivities around the LGBT issues,"" said Matt Pennies, a parent who has daughters in the school district but who has pulled his son out. ""I tried to say this, but I was drowned out by the chaos — even in a strictly heterosexual context, this content is just so aggressive. It's just so much, so soon.""

There were competing protests surrounding the school board meeting, and one arrest was made.

What's in the lessons?



Much of the curriculum focuses on teaching students about human anatomy and reproductive function. Other sections focus on helping students establish boundaries and learn that their bodies are their own. Students are helped to identify trusted adults with whom they can discuss these topics, whether that includes parents or others.

Students are also taught about puberty and the development of their bodies, and about sexually transmitted diseases.

Beginning in fifth grade, students begin to learn about gender. They're taught the difference between biological sex, gender identity (what gender a person believes themselves to be internally), gender expression (what gender a person expresses himself or herself outwardly), and attraction (what gender/sex a person is attracted to), and the ways those different things may all align or be different.

You can read an overview of the curriculum for each grade from third through eighth here, and a see a detailed lesson plan for third through fifth grades here.

The College Fix reported that later lessons include graphic and/or realistic role-playing exercises aiming to teach children about ""coerced oral sex, promiscuity, and drunk sex.""

""The bigger picture is to normalize these behaviors and to teach them to children so that they can feel OK with engaging in these behaviors, but they are not,"" Caryl Ayala, director of Concerned Parents of Texas, said, according to KVUE-TV. ""No child should be engaged in any kind of sexual activity.""

Parents do have the choice to opt-out of having their students participate in the sex ed curriculum, or they can attend the classes to monitor what is being taught and how.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-school-district-approves-aggressive-sex-ed-curriculum-for-grades-3-8-amid-protests,2019-10-31
American Family Association urges Chick-fil-A to resume donations to Christian orgs — with a petition that's going viral,"The American Family Association is urging Chick-fil-A to reconsider its stance against donating to organizations with traditional views on human sexuality.

On Monday, Chick-fil-A announced a massive restructuring of its charitable donations beginning in 2020, with the company cutting donations to organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

The company has insisted that it has not bowed to LGBTQ activism, however.

What's this petition all about?

The petition, created by the American Family Association, encourages the popular chicken franchise to return its support to Christian ministries that heavily rely on donations.

The petition states, ""As you probably know, Chick-fil-A has been hounded by LGBTQ activists since 2012 when then CEO Dan Cathy, son of Truett Cathy, made a public statement in support of the biblical definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. Since that time, these LGBTQ stormtroopers and their cohorts in the media have been after Chick-fil-A.""

""For the last couple of years, they have been pounding Chick-fil-A over the company's donations to The Salvation Army, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Paul Anderson Youth Home in Georgia,"" the petition continues. ""Because these ministries believe what the Bible teaches about human sexuality and marriage, these ministries have been labeled 'hate' groups. Therefore, according to LGBTQ groups, Chick-fil-A donates to hate groups.""

At the time of this writing, the petition has received more than 94,000 signatures. You can read the full petition here.

What else?

Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, told Breitbart News that the restaurant chain ""caved"" to an agenda.

""Chick-Fil-A has evidently decided to move away from supporting Christian ministries and side instead with the those who believe biblical teaching on human sexuality are indeed hate groups,"" Wildmon said. ""Make no mistake, this is compilation or in plain English — Chick-fil-A caved to the LGBT stormtroopers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-american-family-association-urges-chick-fil-a-to-resume-donations-to-christian-organizations,2019-11-22
The CDC warns that teen mental health is in 'steep' decline,"This past week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that American teenagers are experiencing a steep decline in mental health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and covid lockdown protocols.

“These data echo a cry for help,” Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC’s acting principal deputy director, said in a statement. “The COVID-19 pandemic has created traumatic stressors that have the potential to further erode students’ mental wellbeing.”

The Washington Post reported that the CDC’s new findings draw on a survey of a nationally representative sample of 7,700 teens conducted in the first six months of 2021.

The survey emphasized collecting data during students’ “first full pandemic school year.”

Students were questioned on a range of topics that included questions on their mental health, drug use, whether they encountered violence at home or school, and if they encountered racism.

The study suggested that whereas young people were sparred “the brunt of the virus” since they were statistically far less likely to fall ill, experience serious symptoms, or die than their older counterparts, they might still “pay a steep price for the pandemic.”

Children are displaying negative side effects of coming of age while “weathering isolation, uncertainty, economic turmoil, and for many, grief,” the Washington Post reported.

Implying there is a biological difference between men and women, Kathleen A. Ethier, head of the CDC’s division of adolescent and school health, said the recently concluded survey’s results showed male and female students having vastly different results.

Reportedly, Ethier said, “Female students are far worse off than their male peers.”

The Washington Post reported that the survey “underscored the vulnerability of certain students, including LGBTQ youth and students who are being treated unfairly because of their race.”

Ethier said, “All students were impacted by the pandemic, but not all students were impacted equally.”

This survey’s findings are not the first-time medical officials noted their concerns about a growing mental health crisis among America’s teenagers.

This past October, the American Academy of Pediatrics declared a “national emergency in child and adolescent mental health,” and said that its members were “caring for young people with soaring rates of depression, anxiety, trauma, loneliness, and suicidality that will have lasting impacts on them, their families, and their communities.”

In December, Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said, “The pandemic era’s unfathomable number of deaths, pervasive sense of fear, economic instability, and forced physical distancing from loved ones, friends, and communities have exacerbated the unprecedented stresses young people already faced.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-cdc-warns-that-teen-mental-health-is-in-steep-decline,2022-04-03
The first openly trans judge has been appointed to the bench in the state of California,"The first openly transgender person has just been appointed to the bench in the state of California.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Andi Murdyk will serve as a judge on the Sacramento County Superior Court after being appointed by Gavin Newsom to fill a vacancy left on the bench by a retiring judge.

Murdyk said, “I’m humbled, honored and I’m thrilled. I’m grateful to Gov. Newsom for creating a vision of California for all.”

Murdyk — a biological male — has lived in Sacramento since 2009.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Murdyk “pledged to use her experiences to ensure that everyone who appears before her is welcome in the court system.”

Murdyk said that his experiences as a transgender woman (a man who identifies as a woman), a person with a significant disability, the parent of an adult black man, and the descendant of Jewish Holocaust survivors “spurred a legal career spent advocating for the civil rights of all people.”

The transgender judge was born with osteogenesis, commonly known as “brittle bone disease,’ which has caused him more 100 fractures throughout his life.

Murdyk, who transitioned in the last four years, said that he is proud of his gender identity and that he has been accepted and promoted as part of the Newsom administration.

Murdyk has considerable experience in private practice having worked over a decade with Disability Rights California, where he worked as the group's managing attorney, director of litigation, and deputy director.

In 2018, Murdyk joined the California Department of Rehabilitation, becoming its chief counsel until 2020.

Murdyk earned his law degree from George Washington University Law School in 1989.

The transgender attorney’s appointment to the bench earned praise from legal and leftwing activist communities.

Leah Wilson, the executive director of the State Bar of California, said, “The values of diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to the State Bar's mission, and I thank our Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation for their important work, and I applaud Gov. Newsom on his commitment to a diverse judiciary.”

Wilson continued, “Superior Court Judge Andi Mudryk's appointment is a touchstone moment in California history that will lead to more opportunities for transgender people throughout the legal profession.”

Equity California, the country’s largest statewide LGBTQ civil rights organization celebrated Murdyk as the second openly transgender judge in California.

Tony Hoang, the group's director, said, “A seasoned civil rights advocate, Mudryk brings almost 20 years of experience in disability rights and rehabilitation to the court. As governors and state legislatures across the country attack the trans community, we applaud Gov. Newsom's continued commitment to increasing trans representation across appointments and on the bench.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-first-openly-trans-judge-has-been-appointed-to-the-bench-in-the-state-of-california,2022-03-27
'View' co-hosts say Republican Party isn't 'in line with American values',"Co-hosts on ""The View"" say that the Republican Party is not ""in line with American values.""

What are the details?

Co-hosts of the hit daytime TV show blasted members of the Republican Party over support for bills like Florida's Parental Rights in Education law.

""The LGBT community has been making strides fighting for their rights in America for years, but the GOP has introduced a slew of ‘don’t say gay’ style bills that target the community,"" co-host Joy Behar complained. ""They’re even accusing the left of grooming children to become gay, as if you can do that.""

Behar said that Republicans simply have no policies, and claimed that Americans as a whole have become ""much more accepting of the gay community.""

""So the country is evolving,"" she insisted. ""Apparently the GOP is not.""

Co-host Sunny Hostin chimed in, and pointed out that she believed the problem is within the heart of the GOP.

""I think this is because the Republican Party doesn’t really have a platform that is in line with American values,"" she mused. ""When you don’t have a platform, you do have to resort to fear, and this is just cyclical and it’s out of their playbook.""

Hostin then went on to quote former President Lyndon B. Johnson.

""He said, ‘If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on and he’ll empty his pockets for you,'"" she said.

Co-host Ana Navarro also stated that she believed Republicans were only making ground by using fear tactics.

""Today’s fear is not about gay marriage anymore because we’re past that one,"" she quipped. ""Today’s fear is about your children, and your children are getting groomed, and your children are being sexualized, and your children are being indoctrinated.""

Guest co-host and actress Jane Lynch — who is gay — added that there is simply ""no way"" you can be indoctrinated into being straight or gay.

""Absolutely not. You can’t,"" she insisted. ""There’s no way to do it.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-view-republicans-sunny-hostin,2022-04-29
'Thin Blue Line' flags removed from town's firetrucks after complaint claims they symbolize 'white supremacy',"The Hingham Fire Department in Massachusetts flew ""Thin Blue Line"" flags from its firetrucks this month to honor the memory of a fallen police officer from a nearby town who was murdered in the line of duty two years ago.

A resident wrote the leaders of the town of Hingham complaining that the flags honoring law enforcement now symbolize ""white supremacy"" and arguing that they should be taken down. Following resistance, the ""Thin Blue Line"" flags were removed from the trucks — but the rank and file members of the fire department refused to be the ones to do it.

What are the details?

Weymouth Police Sgt. Michael Chesna — a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars — was investigating a car accident in July 2018 when a suspect attacked him with a rock before killing him with his own service weapon. In remembrance of the second anniversary of Chesna's death, the Hingham Fire Department affixed the ""Thin Blue Line"" flags on their trucks.

The Patriot Ledger reported that an unnamed Hingham resident reacted by emailing the town's board of selectmen calling for the flags to be removed, arguing that the flags ""have become a symbol of white supremacy"" in light of the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

According to The Ledger, ""Fire Chief Steve Murphy and Police Chief Glenn Olsson told personnel they'd need to remove the flags, which are a black-and-white version of the American flag with a single blue line in the center, because they're against a town policy that forbids political messaging on town property.""

Town leaders emphasized their support for law enforcement, but also acknowledged that under their rule against political displays, they had recently refused to fly LGBT pride flags on city property.

What happened next?

Fox News reported that the firefighters' union ""says it resisted removing the 'Thin Blue Line' flags"" for days ""because no member 'was able to sacrifice his or her moral fortitude.'""

Union President Lt. Chris Melanson said of the flag earlier this week, ""It has always, and will always, represent the men and women of law enforcement that hold the line between peace and chaos. Especially those who bravely made the ultimate sacrifice during the performance of these heroic duties.""

With no firefighters being willing to personally take down the flags, they solicited officers from the Weymouth Police Department who stepped in Thursday morning to assist with the flag removals from the fleet. The union issued a statement afterward saying, ""We did not want to risk the chance of having these flags removed from the trucks in a disrespectful manner.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thin-blue-line-flags-removed-from-towns-firetrucks-after-complaint-claims-they-symbolize-white-supremacy,2020-07-31

Tom Cotton drops mic on woke Kroger CEO for running to Republicans to save merger from Democrats: 'Best of luck',"If Kroger and Albertsons thought Republicans would rescue their plan to merge, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) made it clear last Tuesday that support for the merger among Republicans is anything but certain.

What is the background?

Kroger announced in October plans to acquire Albertsons for $24.6 billion.

The plan was not exactly celebrated. Instead, it triggered immediate antitrust concerns, especially among Democrats who are suspicious of massive corporations. After all, Kroger is the nation's second-largest grocery store chain and Albertsons is the fourth-largest.

If the acquisition were approved, Kroger could potentially rival Walmart.

What happened with Cotton?

At a hearing before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights last Tuesday, Cotton blasted Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen for running to Republicans for support while at the same time enacting woke corporate policies.

Specifically, Cotton grilled McMullen over a religious discrimination lawsuit the federal government brought against his company for forcing two Arkansas employees to wear a uniform adorned with a rainbow heart. The employees were eventually fired because they refused to wear a uniform with an LGBT symbol on it. In October, Kroger settled a religious discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of the fired employees.

Shockingly, McMullen told Cotton that he was not aware of the case.

Going even further, Cotton zeroed in on Kroger's ""allyship"" guide, in which employees are told not to use words like ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" because they are not ""inclusive.""

At every point, McMullen defended Kroger. That decision — to force woke policies onto employees — will not earn Kroger any sympathy from Republicans, Cotton said.

""This situation reminds me a little bit of the situation Big Tech companies have found themselves in. ... They come to Washington because they fear regulation from our Democratic friends or action by the Biden administration, and they expect Republicans, who are traditionally more supportive of free enterprise, to come to their defense,"" Cotton said.

""I've cautioned them for years that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters ... if they discriminated against them in their company, they probably shouldn't come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers,"" he continued.

After explaining that he knows Democrats will highly scrutinize Kroger's acquisition, Cotton then dropped the mic.

""I'll say this: I'm sorry that's happening to you. Best of luck,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-cotton-kroger-woke-policies,2022-12-07
"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf vetoes bill to bar biological males from female school sports, thanks President Biden 'for prioritizing the health and safety of women and birthing people'","Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has vetoed a bill to block biological males from participating in female athletics.

Wolf rejected House Bill 972, which would have required that the sports teams of public education institutions be designated for the male sex, the female sex, or for both sexes — the measure would have prohibited allowing males to play on teams designated for females. In addition to applying to public education institutions, the requirements would also have applied to any institutions that have teams that compete against public education institutions.

""I have been crystal clear during my time in office that hate has no place in Pennsylvania, especially discrimination against already marginalized youth representing less than half of 1 percent of Pennsylvania’s population,"" Wolf said, according to a press release. ""The fact that this bill passed through Pennsylvania’s Republican-led General Assembly solely to bully and oppress vulnerable children is atrocious. These members should be ashamed of themselves for proposing and voting on policies that are discriminatory, unnecessary, and incredibly harmful.""

The issue of whether to allow biological males to who identify as women to compete in sports designated for females remains an area of raging debate around the country.

But while many Americans reject radical leftist gender ideology, Wolf is appears to be completely on board with the reality-defying movement.

In addition to torpedoing the common-sense legislation to protect girls' and women's school sports on Friday, Wolf also thanked President Joe Biden ""for prioritizing the health and safety of women and birthing people.""

Biden signed an executive order on Friday in which he called for the Health and Human Services secretary to deliver a report about possible ways to increase access to abortions and ""the full range of reproductive healthcare services.""

The preposterous concept of ""birthing people"" has been adopted by the left as an inclusive way of referring to pregnant women who do not identify as women. But as the left relentlessly wages a revolution to redefine gender, the fact remains that the only people who can become pregnant and bear children are biological females.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-wolf-vetores-sports-bill,2022-07-09
Lesbian transgender couple declares their plan to transition their 5-year-old son into a girl,"A transgender couple in the United Kingdom has announced that their 5-year-old will be transitioning from male to female, the Daily Mail reported.

What's the story?

Greg Rogers and his partner Jody Rogers were both born female. However, since Greg medically transitioned to male at 16 years old, the couple identifies as being straight. They share custody of Jody's 5-year-old, Jayden.

Jayden was born a boy, but has worn dresses for the past year. Now Greg and Jody say that they plan to schedule medical procedures to transition Jayden to female.

Sex-change hormones given to children have permanent consequences, and critics question the ability of a young child to make such a dramatic and life-altering decision.

In 2016, the American College of Pediatrics released a statement warning that puberty blockers put children at a higher risk for ""cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer,"" in addition to making them unable ""to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology.""

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Greg insisted that Jayden was choosing to transition on his own, and had not been influenced by them.

""We haven't encouraged Jayden to do this, despite what people think, and we are hurt at the suggestion,"" Greg said.

""She has no idea that I'm transgender,"" Greg added. ""Having been through this myself, I have conflicting emotions about her deciding she doesn't want to be a boy any more. It's not an easy life. People will always judge you and I don't think there is a single transgender person on the planet who would push that on a child.""

Jody said that before Jayden began demanding to wear girl's clothes, she had not even been aware that ""a child could be transgender.""

""[I]t isn't until now, after speaking to other parents in our situation, that we realise it is more common than everyone thinks,"" Jody said, the Daily Mail reported.

What else?

Social workers from North Lanarkshire in Scotland where the Rogerses live have reportedly checked in on the family after an anonymous complaint from a neighbor, but determined that there were no signs of abuse.

While still too young to begin hormone treatment right away, Greg told the Daily Mail that Jayden will receive counseling for the next few years ""to explore who she is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trangender-couple-transition-5-year-old-son-to-girl,2019-01-22
Trans activist stokes controversy by saying that gender reassignment surgery does not help many with gender dysphoria,"British trans activist Charlie Evans made big news last week when she announced that she is detransitioning, and that many trans people have approached her saying that gender assignment reassignment surgery does not help gender dysphoria.

According to Sky News, Evans was born female, but decided to live as a male before she detransitioned in 2018. Evans, who is a trans rights activist, announced that she would no longer be taking her hormone therapy or identify as male, and she says she received a huge response.

""I'm in communication with 19 and 20-year-olds who have had full gender reassignment surgery who wish they hadn't, and their dysphoria hasn't been relieved, they don't feel better for it.""

According to Evans, she has been approached by ""hundreds"" of people — mostly females in their mid-20s who are same-sex attracted — who have asked her either to speak out, or to help them find support for their own efforts to detransition.

Evans says that she was motivated to take her struggle public when, after giving a talk, she was approached by a young woman who had also detransitioned. ""She said she felt shunned by the LGBT community for being a traitor. So I felt I had to do something,"" Evans said.

Evans has started a nonprofit organization in Newcastle, England, that seeks to provide support for trans people who want to transition back to the gender of their birth.

According to the Sky News article, one of the people Evans has helped detransition complained that many of the centers in the UK that offer support for people who want to transition do not do a good job of appropriately counseling subjects about alternatives.

The woman, who asked to be identified by Ruby, said, ""When I was at my gender clinic to get referred for hormones, we had a session where I went over my mental health issues and I told them about my eating disorder and they didn't suggest that that could maybe connected with my gender dysphoria. For everyone who has gender dysphoria, whether they are trans or not, I want there to be more options for us because I think there is a system of saying, 'okay here's your hormones, here's your surgery, off you go'. I don't think that's helpful for anyone.""

As previously reported at TheBlaze, NHS centers in the UK have begun offering gender transition support to children as young as 3 or 4, and have seen skyrocketing rates of participation in gender transition services. One such facility, the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust, disputed Evans' characterization, saying, ""Decisions about physical interventions made in our care are arrived at after a thorough exploration process. While some of our patients may decide not to pursue physical treatment or drop out of treatment, the experience of regret described here is rarely seen.""

Trans activists fume ahead of BBC film promising to tell both sides of trans athlete debate,"Trans activists fighting to end the debate over transgender athletes competing in women's sports are up in arms after the BBC promised it would fully explore both sides of the issue in an upcoming documentary.

What are the details?

Last month, BBC One announced its film titled ""Trans Athletes: A Fair Playing Field?"" aimed at presenting an unbiased presentation of the controversial topic. The piece will be hosted by tennis great and longtime LGBT activist Martina Navratilova.

The former Wimbledon champion issued a statement saying, ""I hope that this documentary enables everybody to be more knowledgeable about the overall transgender and sport debate and hopefully brings us closer to a solution that makes as many people as possible happy.""

The Daily Caller reported Monday that transgender activists are furious over the project, citing bloggers and journalists not only unhappy over the prospect that there are even two sides to the debate, but skeptical of Navritalova being a worthy reporter on the topic.

Navratilova made headlines earlier this year after she penned an op-ed arguing ""a man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organization is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires.""

She went on to refer to such scenarios as ""insane"" and ""cheating.""

After receiving a barrage of attacks for her stance, Navratilova promised to research the issue further and present her findings. In the BBC documentary, she has lined up an array of interviews including scientists, physicians, sporting officials, and transgender athletes and the biologically female athletes they compete with.

Unacceptable, say critics. The Caller pointed to a post from a recent LGBT sports blog that declared that despite Navratilova's decades-long record as a champion for the LGBT community, her outspokenness and skepticism over transgender athletes is a disqualifier.

In the article, which asks if Navratilova has ""missed her chance to redeem herself for opposing trans inclusion in sports,"" Ken Schultz wrote:

Framing the documentary as a look at ""all sides of the debate"" implies that believing ""male athletes transition to female just to win a trophy"" is a valid point worthy of consideration, instead of being a pitch for a terrible Adam Sander movie. To be blunt: This is simply not an issue with two valid arguments.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-activists-fume-over-bbc-documentary,2019-06-11
"Trans designer launches world's first transgender lingerie line: 'Strong, yet comfortable enough to hold everything in place'","Transgender United Kingdom entrepreneur and model Carmen Liu has launched a lingerie line specifically tailored for transgender women.

What are the details?

In an interview with Forbes, Liu, 27, explains that she used to visit lingerie departments only to come away empty-handed and frustrated at the lack of selection for a trans woman.

According to the outlet, ""Liu was appalled that, in 2019, there was not one mainstream store that stocked lingerie suitable for trans women.""

Liu decided to remedy that, launching her GI Collection in 2019. The collection sold out in mere days, Forbes reported.

“I had this business idea circulating in my mind for two years, thinking of how I would design the lingerie if I had the opportunity,"" she said. “I wouldn't say there was lightbulb moment as such. The idea hit me due to pure frustration of not being able to buy lingerie. Once I got the green light I began working 16 hours most days to cover every detail and possible option that would benefit and bring positive change to our community.""

Liu said that while many brands will pander to the transgender community, few of them are willing to put their money where their mouths are and create a niche specifically for those people like her who have not opted to have a gender reassignment surgery.

“There are many brands out there that will use trans individuals as a selfish marketing ploy, yet they do not cater for us,"" she explained. “We do have specific design needs and we need to be heard and catered for. We should be allowed the experience of lingerie shopping on the high street, just like everyone else.""

Liu said that prior to launching her own line, she was forced to wear a makeshift jockstrap called a ""gaff"" to tuck in her genitals for a more streamlined look.

She kept this in mind while designing the GI Collection — which stands for ""Get it.""

""It needed to be strong, yet comfortable enough to hold everything in place,"" she said, pointing out that she didn't want to sacrifice sexiness for functionality.

“The key design goal for me was to have lingerie that appears like cis women's lingerie yet enables us to tuck comfortably,"" Liu said. “But I also use beautiful, high-end Italian satins. It was important for me to have a wide size range too.""

The outlet reports that the GI Collection features five different matching bra and panty sets as well as individual pieces.

“It's incredible to think there are woman all over the world wearing my lingerie,"" she said. “I know how much it means to them.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-designer-launches-worlds-first-transgender-lingerie-line,2019-11-19

As highlighted by Disrn, Fox has received criticism for delivering ""life-altering blows"" to female opponents in the ring.

""During a fight against Tamikka Brents in 2014, Fox gave Brents a concussion and broke seven orbital bones,"" Disrn reported. The fight lasted a whole three minutes.

At the time, Brents said, ""I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night.""

Brents said that she was not aware at the time that Fox had transitioned from male to female.

""I can't answer whether it's because she was born a man or not because I'm not a doctor,"" Brents said. ""I can only say, I've never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right. ... I still disagree with Fox fighting. Any other job or career I say have a go at it, but when it comes to a combat sport I think it just isn't fair.""

The Post Millennial recently reported that athlete Erika Newsome fought what ended up being her final pro fight against a ruthless Fox.

""Fox, a male to female transgender athlete, destroyed Erika Newsome in a Coral Gables, FL, MMA fight during which she 'secured a grip on Newsome's head ... With her hands gripping the back of Newsome's skull, she delivered a massive knee, bringing her leg up while pulling her opponent's head down.""

""The blow landed on Newsome's chin and dropped her, unconscious, face-first on the mat,"" the outlet reported.

That fight, which took place in 2012, was Newsome's last professional fight.

Zeigler wrote, ""One of the lasting moments from Fox's career is a fight that has been twisted by anti-trans forces to paint her as a criminal assailant. During her fight against Tamikka Brents, Brents suffered a broken orbital and a concussion. Broken bones and concussions are not uncommon in MMA.""

""The people looking to ban trans women from women's sports quickly twisted that into the misleading headline: Transgender MMA Fighter Breaks Skull of Her Female Opponent,"" Zeigler continues. ""The crux of their campaign is to build an aura of rarity around the fight and point to Fox being trans as the reason for the outcome.""

Fox told Zeigler that such a thing ""happens all the time.""

""I'm not the first female MMA fighter who's broken another fighter's bones or caused a large amount of stitches or a concussion or any combination of those,"" Fox said. ""And people will of course, because I'm trans, hold it up as this devastating thing that couldn't possibly happen if I weren't trans. But there are many different examples of similar things happening.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-female-mma-fighter-bravest-athlete,2021-02-16
Trans golfer takes stand against biological males competing in women's sports: 'There has to be a division',"Golfer Mianne Bagger made history in 2004 when she competed in the Women’s Australian Open, the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a professional golf tournament.

Now, Bagger is speaking out about the dangers of allowing biological males to compete in female athletics.

What is Bagger saying?

Amid renewed scrutiny over the fairness of allowing biological men to compete against biological women in athletics, Bagger revealed this week that she supports an Australian lawmaker's bill meant to protect female sports from biological male competitors.

In an interview with Australian TV’s ""Insight,"" Bagger condemned the trajectory of the transgender movement.

""These days, [the dynamic] has crept into what’s called self ID or self identification: male-bodied people presenting as women, who live as women, with varying degrees of medical intervention and in some degrees, no medical intervention, which is just — it’s crossed the line, in my view, it really has,"" Bagger said. ""It’s a slap in the face to women.""



Bagger was born a man, but underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1995. However, she does not care if she is labeled a ""hypocrite"" for supporting legislation that would have banned her from participating in sports.

In fact, Bagger said it is ""really important"" to concretely state ""the difference between general society and sport, particularly really high-level sport"" because of the biological differences between men and women.

""In every day society, of course we want an inclusive, egalitarian [society]. We want equality, lack of discrimination, and of course every single person should have equal access to life and services and work in society. Of course we all want that, and so do I,"" Bagger said.

""In sport? It’s different. Sport is about physical ability. It’s not just about discrimination, it’s not just about equality and equal access. It is a physical ability,"" Bagger explained. ""Now, if you’ve got one group — males — that are on average stronger, taller, faster, as opposed to women, there has to be a divide. There has to be a division.""

Anything else?

As progressives in America continue to push the participation of transgender athletes in sports despite unfair physical advantages, our neighbors across the pond are reconsidering such policies.

In fact, a British transgender cyclist, a biological male, made headlines this month after being banned from competing in an event. British Cycling, the sanctioning body for cycling in Britain, then suspended its policy allowing transgender and non-binary cyclists to compete in events.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also boldly said that biological men should not compete in female sports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-golfer-takes-stand-against-biological-males-competing-in-womens-sports-there-has-to-be-a-division,2022-04-21
Transgender activist says all children should be put on puberty blockers until they can decide their gender,"A popular transgender activist recently called for all children to be put on puberty blockers until they are able to decide which gender they want to be.

What are the details?

Lauren McNamara, known by followers as ""Zinnia Jones,"" argued earlier this month that children should be legally able to consent to the administration of puberty blockers since they already de facto consent to the ""permanent and irreversible changes"" that come naturally through puberty.

""If children can't consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?"" she wrote on Twitter.

The YouTuber went on to argue that ""an inability to offer informed consent or understand the long-term consequences is actually an argument for putting every single cis and trans person on puberty blockers until they acquire that ability.""

Her comments followed a court case in the U.K. involving Keira Bell, a 23-year-old biological female who sued the British National Health Service's gender-identity youth clinic for prescribing her puberty blockers when she was 16 years old. Bell, who since regrets becoming a male, argued that the clinic did not do enough to ""challenge"" her decision to transition.

Judges ruled in the lawsuit that ""it is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers"" and ""it is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers.""

But, ""in respect of young persons aged 16 and over, the legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment,"" read the ruling.

McNamara argued in her tweet thread that puberty became ""optional"" when technology was developed to ""enable deliberate choice between natal puberty and puberty induced by cross-sex hormones.

What else?

According to her YouTube fan page, McNamara is an atheist American commentator who has ""posted numerous videos critical of religion, especially in regards to its attitudes towards LGBT people. Zinnia is openly transgender and has been on hormone replacement therapy since September 2012.""

""Zinnia was assigned male at birth and given name Zachary Antolak in 1989 in Chicago,"" but she ""became aware of her sexuality as a gay male at an early age,"" her profile states.

""After years identifying as a gay male, Zinnia finally came to the conclusion that she was actually a trans woman in 2011 and started a romantic relationship with her close friend and lesbian Heather McNamara, becoming an adoptive mother towards Heather's two children. Zinnia is currently in a polyamorous relationship with Heather and another trans woman named Penny,"" it continues.

Transgender activist indicted on charges of theft — from anti-Trump 'Women's March',"A transgender social justice activist was indicted on charges that she stole money from the anti-Trump ""Women's March"" organization in Portland, Oregon.

Rebekah Katherine Brewis was one of the founders of a Women's March protest against President Donald Trump after his inauguration in 2017.

Brewis leads an organization named PDX Trans Pride that had a fiscal relationship with the Women's March so that they could receive tax-free donations. Later, she was accused of stealing money from T-shirt sales and other donations.

However, an investigation from the Oregonian concluded that PDX Trans Pride was not registered as a charity to accept tax-free donations.

A jury indicted her on three charges of first-degree aggravated theft and two charges of felony computer crime.

Brewis has denied the allegations, saying simply, ""The allegations are absolutely unfounded.""

The PDX Trans Pride official Twitter account has been made private.

She had previously been convicted of robbery in 2000 and sentenced to 70 months in prison, according to the Oregonian. She was known as Jorey Brewis at that time.

DOJ withdraws from federal lawsuit claiming unfair competition from transgender athletes in high school track racing,"The Department of Justice withdrew their support of a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn a state policy in Connecticut that allows transgender athletes to race in women's track & field competitions.

The lawsuit by several female runners claimed that they had been deprived of wins, state titles, and athletic opportunities because they were unfairly competing against transgender runners who were biologically male.

The Department of Justice under the previous administration had filed a statement of interest in the lawsuit in March in support of the lawsuit to change the policies of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference. William Barr, the attorney general at the time, argued that the unfair competition violated Title X, which defends equal opportunities for females.

On Tuesday, that statement was withdrawn.

Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham and other officials said in a statement that the ""government has reconsidered the matter.""

The CIAC has argued that it is following guidance from state law that says students should be accommodated according to their preferred gender identity.

The Alliance Defending Freedom, who filed the federal complaint, argued that the CIAC is violating the equal rights of the female athletes.

""Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field. Forcing female athletes to compete against boys is grossly unfair and destroys their athletic opportunities,"" said ADF legal counsel Christiana Holcomb.

""Now when we line up in front of our blocks, and the starter calls us to get into position, we all know how the race will end. We can't win,"" said Selena Soule, one of the female athletes charging discrimination.

Robin McHealen, the executive director of LGBT rights group True Colors, criticized the lawsuit.

""What they are proposing is legally sanctioned discrimination under this lawsuit,"" said McHealen.

"A transgender doll featuring male genitalia under women's clothing appears in Russian toy store, sparking outrage","What some are calling ""the world's first transgender doll"" has gone on sale in a Russian toy store, the Daily Star reported.

The doll, which was seen at the Planeta Igrushek (Planet Of Toys) shop in Novosibirsk, Siberia, is dressed in women's clothes but features male genitalia, according to pictures posted online.

The images purportedly show a doll with long blonde hair and female facial features wearing a red and yellow polka dot dress — underneath the dress, however, the doll showcases male genitalia.

The Daily Mail reports that pictures of the doll shared online in Russia have sparked considerable outrage in the country.



One user allegedly asked: 'Is it ok to produce toys like that for children?'



Another said: 'All they have to do is buy a medical tool kit and the kid can learn how to amputate.'



A third said: 'I think it is really terrible what is going on in this child's parent's head. Have you considered that it could simply be a manufacturing defect? Or they accidentally put a female head on a male body?'



While a fourth commented: 'All you have to do is cut the doll's hair and change it into a pair of pants.

The doll drew particular ire given its place of solicitation, as Russia is not known for openness to the LGBT movement.

Companies have toyed with the idea of transgender dolls before

In September 2019, famous toymaker, Mattel, launched its first line of gender-inclusive Barbie dolls, designed to blur the lines between male and female genders.

The dolls featured a wide variety of skin tones and all had androgynous faces and bodies. In addition, the doll line offered a variety of hair styles, clothing options, and accessories to choose from, making it so that the dolls could be mixed and matched.

At the time, Kim Culmone, senior vice president of design, said the doll line, ""Creatable World,"" intended to encourage children who play with them to ""express themselves freely.""

""Through research, we heard that kids don't want their toys dictated by gender norms,"" Culmone continued. ""This line allows all kids to express themselves freely which is why it resonates so strongly with them.""

The ""Creatable World"" line, however, did not feature male or female genitalia, a fact that disgruntled at least one transgender writer who penned an op-ed for Slate Magazine.

In the op-ed, the writer argued that the new Barbie dolls are too ""playful"" and do not go far enough in ""deconstructing the gender binary.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-doll-featuring-male-genitalia,2020-01-16
Eli Erlick admitted to involvement in scheme to distribute prescription hormones,"Libs of TikTok shared a screenshot of a post in which Eli Erlick spoke about engaging in an effort to distribute prescription hormone medications to people.

Erlick, who identifies as ""Extremely queer & incredibly trans,"" discussed the scheme in an Instagram post, a screenshot of which was shared on social media by Libs of TikTok.

""There are over 20 states trying to criminalize hormone therapy, particularly for trans youth. So, my friends and I had an idea: sending out our extra prescriptions around the country. If you need hormones, I'm working with a distribution network to get you access. Everything is free, no questions asked. We have hundreds of doses of testosterone, estradiol, and spironolactone available right now. All are prescribed by doctors and unused. Each package comes with information on dosage, obtaining bloodwork, etc,"" Erlick wrote.



""I realize this is only a band-aid solution: we need full access to affirmative medical care from professionals immediately. However, missing a single dose of hormones can be devastating (especially for trans teens and those new to hormones)! These laws are outrageous and I can't wait for them to be overturned. In the meantime, DM me if you need HRT or if you have overprescribed hormones you'd like to send out,"" Erlick's post read.

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh of the Daily Wire noted that Erlick's Instagram post has been deleted.

""Wow @EliErlick is sending drugs to children across the country without prescriptions, parental consent, or any legal authority whatsoever. This is a crime on several different levels,"" Walsh remarked when retweeting the Libs of TikTok post.

Erlick tagged Walsh and Libs of TikTok in an Instagram story that featured a screenshot of Walsh's tweet: ""Thanks for the free advertising,"" Erlick declared.

Libs of TikTok also highlighted a comment in which Erlick had written, ""Realistically, I can ship anywhere in North America.""

Libs of TikTok and Walsh both said that they reported the scheme to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

""Submitting a tip to the DEA right now to report Eli Erlick’s confessed conspiracy to ship prescription hormone pills to minors nationwide and internationally,"" Walsh tweeted.

""I submitted a tip to the DEA regarding this international drug operation,"" Libs of TikTok tweeted.

"Transgender female dominates at Masters Track Cycling World Championships, complains how unfair it would be if she were excluded","Transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon won a gold medal and set a women's world record in qualifying at the 2019 Masters Track Cycling World Championships on Saturday in Manchester, England.

What are the details?

McKinnon, a professor of philosophy at the College of Charleston, won the gold medal in the women's 35-39 sprint category. The BBC reported that McKinnon, a biological male, also set a women's world record during the qualifying round. She represented Canada in the event.

In an interview about her win, McKinnon told Sky News that even though she has an apparent advantage over some of the other female competitors, it would be unfair to exclude her from competing.

""So, if we want to say, that I believe you're a woman for all of society, except for this massive central part that is sport, then that's not fair,"" McKinnon insisted.

She also pointed out that despite her advantage, she does lose at times.

""I've thought about giving up about half a dozen times a year at least,"" she admitted. ""It's so stressful to even show up for me given the sort of attention I get.""

McKinnon continued, ""Every athlete has physical advantages and we're all trying to exploit them. So to single out a trans woman, when I lose most of my races, is a little unfair.""

This isn't the first time she complained about the possibility of exclusion.

In March, McKinnon said the exclusion of transgender women from women's sports was comparable to excluding black women from women's sports.

In addition to the gold medal, McKinnon took the silver she won in the earlier 500m time trial.

What else?

Victoria Hood, a former British Masters champion, told the BBC that some of her fellow riders ""sacrificed"" the opportunity to participate in the World Championships because they didn't want to compete against McKinnon.

""The science is there,"" Hood said. ""The science is clear — it tells us that trans women have an advantage. ... The world record has just been beaten today by somebody born male, who now identifies as female, and the gap between them and the next born female competitor was quite a lot.

""It is a human right to participate in sport. I don't think it's a human right to identify into whichever category you choose,"" she concluded.

McKinnon fired back at Hood's proclamation in a lengthy statement, which she shared across social media.

A portion of her scathing response read, ""Ms. Hood has expressed an irrational fear of trans women. An irrational fear of trans women is the dictionary definition of transphobia.

"SCOTUS: Gorsuch, Roberts join liberals to rule that civil rights law protects gay and transgender employees, too","In a historic decision Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends protection to gay and transgender workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The court handed down a surprising 6-3 decision in the case, Bostock v. Clayton County, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the liberal side of the court in the majority decision.

What are the details?

Gorsuch, who wrote the majority opinion, argued that ""in Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee's sex when deciding to fire that employee. We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.""

Gorsuch added that while the drafters of the landmark civil rights law likely did not anticipate the law's many consequences over the years, ""the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands.""

In the dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote: ""Many will applaud today's decision because they agree on policy grounds with the Court's updating of Title VII. But the question in these cases is not whether discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity should be outlawed. The question is whether Congress did that in 1964. It indisputably did not.""

The major dispute: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits employment discrimination on grounds of ""race, color, religion, sex, [and] national origin."" The key question was whether that law, as written, pertains to sexual orientation or gender identity.

Both Alito and Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that the law, as written, does not include those terms and cited the fact that Congress has repeatedly introduced legislation since the law's passage to add the terms to the list.

Kavanaugh specifically made note in his dissent that Congress has yet to successfully pass legislation prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and that it is not right for the Court to circumvent the legislative process.

""In the face of the unsuccessful legislative efforts (so far) to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, judges may not rewrite the law simply because of their own policy views,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Judges may not update the law merely because they think that Congress does not have the votes or the fortitude. Judges may not predictively amend the law just because they believe that Congress is likely to do it soon anyway.""

""If judges could rewrite laws based on their own policy views,"" Kavanaugh argues, ""the Constitution's separation of powers would collapse,"" threatening the very nature of the rule of law and of individual liberty.

Why does it matter?

The court's decision had been highly anticipated since the case marked the first time the Court had taken up gay rights since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018. Kennedy had been the key swing vote on social issues and wrote the majority opinions in all four of the court's major rulings on gay rights.

Undoubtedly, many eyes were fixed on how President Trump's two nominees, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, would rule. They were appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Alito also warned in his dissent that the court's ruling could lead to unintended consequences such as the use of bathrooms based on one's gender identity, perhaps leading to ""serious psychological harm"" to women who have survived sexual assault.

Three cases, argued in October 2019, were included under the primary caption, Bostock v. Clayton County. The cases involved a former Georgia child welfare services coordinator named Gerald Bostock who said he was fired for being gay, a funeral home director named Aimee Stephens who said she was fired after telling her employer she was transgender, and a skydiving instructor named Donald Zarda who was fired after coming out as gay.

Stephens and Zarda both passed away before the court's decision.

Transgender military officer expected to attend State of the Union address,"The first openly transgender officer to be promoted in the U.S. military is expected to attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, the New York Daily News reported.

Navy Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann plans to be at the event as a guest of U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who hopes it sends a message to the president regarding the administration's ban on transgender people in the military.

""Lt. Cmdr. Dremann is a proud member of the U.S. Navy, he is a loyal patriot who has devoted his career to serving and protecting our country, and he is also one of the thousands of transgender service members serving in our military with honor and distinction,"" Gillibrand said in a statement. ""Transgender service members like Lt. Cmdr. Dremann make extraordinary sacrifices every day to defend our freedom and our most sacred values, and President Trump's decision to ban them from military service is cruel and undermines our military readiness.""

Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also has plans to introduce new legislation to ""protect current and future transgender service members,"" according to NBC News.

""Any transgender American who meets the standards should be able to sign up to join our armed forces,"" she said. ""I am proud to lead this fight and I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.""

What did Dremann say?

Dremann, who was promoted to lieutenant commander in 2016, the Daily News reported, he hopes to put a human face on transgender military members.

""My intention is to simply bring a personal face to being transgender in the military,"" Dremann said. ""We are serving with honor, courage, and commitment to a cause greater than ourselves. And we will continue to do so.""

What is the policy for transgender people in the military?

In March, the White House issued a statement announcing that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military on the basis that they presented a ""considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality."" The policy reversed an Obama-era policy that allowed transgender people to serve openly.

In April, a federal judge ruled against the ban and upheld a preliminary injunction from December 2017 that prevented Trump's policy from taking effect.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban would go into effect until lower courts issue a decision on whether or not the ban is constitutional.

The current policy allows transgender service members to continue serving but it bars new ones from signing up. Current members are also banned from starting gender transition while serving.

"Transgender-rights 'misogynists' screamed, banged on windows of UK feminists' event while 'police did absolutely nothing,' journalist says","Transgender-rights activists intimidated women attending a U.K. feminists' event while police stood by and did nothing, a journalist said.

Activist group Queer AF Brighton descended upon the Woman's Place UK event Monday, claiming the meeting was spreading transphobia, the Daily Mail reported.

Journalist Julie Bindel tweeted video of flag-waving protestors outside the feminists' event:

Bindel noted the ""load of trans-activist misogynists screaming, shouting and banging on the window while the police did absolutely nothing.""

'Like we were under siege'

Ali Ceesay, who helped run the feminists' meeting, told the Daily Mail that ""100-plus protestors ... were shouting, chanting and blocking people's entrance. One young woman had a full blown panic attack inside the building. It was terrifying. They were banging on panes of glass; it was hideous, and the police didn't stop them. The policing was a joke. We also had some of our attendees have liquid thrown in their face. It felt very much like we were under siege.""

Here's what it sounded like inside the event space:

What did Queer AF have to say?

Queen AF called Women's Place UK a ""hate group"" in a Facebook post Tuesday and defended the protest, saying members ""marched to the venue to make noise outside of the building"" and that ""WPUK members were rude and aggressive to the small group of protesters that stood handing out counter fliers.""

The post added that ""protesters successfully held noisy space either side of the building for about three hours until the last members departed, sad and frustrated that their meeting was disrupted throughout. This disruption included chants such as: WPUK, are a hate group! You stop the hate group, we'll stop the protest! Hey, hey, ho, ho, transphobia has got to go!""

What did police have to say?

A police spokesperson said in a statement that officers ""ensured that those wishing to attend"" the meeting ""were able to gain access"" and that ""protest liaison officers spoke with those gathered outside to facilitate this and to reduce the impact that their protest was having on the meeting and the local community,"" the Daily Mail said.

""We accept that the initial protest was very noisy and officers did engage to seek a reduction in scale and to put a stop to those who were banging on windows in an attempt to disrupt the meeting,"" police added, according to the outlet, and that ""there have been no reports of crimes, no damage to the building, no arrests, and the participants left the meeting without further incident.""

Anything else?

Queer AF told the Brighton Argus the women's group running the meeting appropriates feminism and spreads a transphobic message.

But Ceesay — of Women's Place UK — told the Daily Mail that ""in law ... we have several protected characteristics. One of those is sex. It's that piece of law that gives women sex-based rights that protects us. There's a push within some of the more extreme LGBT communities to replace sex for a looser definition of gender identity. What this means is we lose our rights under this nefarious and undefinable concept of gender identity — and therefore we lose our women-only services.""

Two transgender sprinters dominate girls’ state championship — again. Now one of them claims biological girls may have advantages.,"Andraya Yearwood — a 17-year-old biological male who identifies as female — took second-place earlier this month at Connecticut's indoor track girls' 55-meter sprint. Yearwood's time was 7.01 seconds; the third-place sprinter — who is not transgender — hit the tape at a distant 7.23 seconds.

Terry Miller of Bloomfield High — who, like Yearwood, is transgender — won the event with a state record time of 6.95 seconds, the Associated Press reported.

Yearwood can be seen in the far left in the following photo:

TheBlaze in 2017 first covered Yearwood — then a freshman at Cromwell High School — after winning the girls' 100-meter and 200-meter dashes at the Connecticut high school Class M state championships. In 2018, Miller crushed the competition in the girls' 100-meter and 200-meter dashes at the state meet with Yearwood coming in second in the 100.



But despite the controversy surrounding Miller and Yearwood's overwhelming success, Yearwood — who acknowledged a strength advantage over many competitors, the AP reported — said biological females may have other advantages.

'Perfect form' and 'so much money' for training

""One high jumper could be taller and have longer legs than another, but the other could have perfect form, and then do better,"" Yearwood told the AP. ""One sprinter could have parents who spend so much money on personal training for their child, which in turn, would cause that child to run faster.""

Miller declined an interview for the outlet's story, but the AP noted that Miller ""has said that if she felt a competitor had an unfair advantage, it would simply push her to try to improve.""

Selina Soule is a biological female who finished eighth in the 55-meter sprint — and missed qualifying for the New England regionals by two spots, the outlet said.

The Glastonbury High School junior told the AP had Miller and Yearwood not run, she would be in the regional race and showing her abilities to more college coaches.

""We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it's demoralizing,"" Soule told the outlet. ""I fully support and am happy for these athletes for being true to themselves. They should have the right to express themselves in school, but athletics have always had extra rules to keep the competition fair.""

Jon Forrest's daughter is a teammate of Soule and told the AP the ""disparity"" is all too visible.

""The facts show Glastonbury would be the state champion based on cisgender girls competing against cisgender girls,"" he told the outlet. ""You don't realize it until you see it in person, the disparity in the ability to perform.""



What do state officials say?

The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference told the AP its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by the gender with which they identify.

""This is about someone's right to compete,"" executive director Glenn Lungarini told the outlet. ""I don't think this is that different from other classes of people, who, in the not too distant past, were not allowed to compete. I think it's going to take education and understanding to get to that point on this issue.""

What does another transgender athlete have to say?

Joanna Harper is a medical physicist and transgender runner from Portland, Oregon, and told the AP that biological males have advantages over biological females until hormone therapies begin to work — and how they work in each athlete is different.

""The gender identity doesn't matter, it's the testosterone levels,"" Harper, who studies transgender athletes, told the outlet. ""Trans girls should have the right to compete in sports. But cisgender girls should have the right to compete and succeed, too. How do you balance that? That's the question.""

For Yearwood, any opposition is incentive to compete harder.



""I have learned a lot about myself and about other people through this transition. I always try to focus most on all of the positive encouragement that I have received from family, friends and supporters,"" Yearwood told the AP. ""I use the negativity to fuel myself to run faster.""

Transgender teen sues school district for banning him from boys' locker room,"A transgender boy has sued a Minnesota school district for allegedly banning him from using the boys' locker room at his high school, Pioneer Press reported.

""We are suing the school board and the school district for discriminating against N.H. because he is transgender. That violates the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the rights of equal rights and due process under the Minnesota state constitution,"" said David McKinney, an American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota lawyer.

The boy, who is identified as N.H. in the documents filed Monday, participated on the boys swim team in 2015-16. The teen claimed that he was required to use the ""enhanced privacy"" restroom and locker room at Coons Rapids High School.

""I didn't choose this battle. The school board chose us,"" the boy's mother, J.H., said Monday, according to Pioneer Press. ""They have robbed him of a normal high school experience.""

The amount of damages being sought is not immediately clear.

What's the background?

In 2015, N.H. reportedly joined the swim team as a freshman.

The documents claim that initially, he was allowed to use the same facilities as the other boys on the team.

Later, the school district banned him from the boys' facilities.

""He was told there would be consequences if he used the locker room with the rest of his classmates,"" Christy Hall, senior staff attorney for Gender Justice, told Pioneer Press.

N.H. was hospitalized days later for mental health issues, according to the complaint.

""They went out of their way and created a problem where there wasn't a problem; they conspired against my son,"" his mother, J.H., said.

The student's swim coach and teammates had been supportive of him, the documents showed.

Eventually, the teen transferred to a different school district to ""escape discriminatory treatment.""

What did the school district say?

The school district uses a case-by-case model to determine which facilities should be utilized by transgender students, it said in a statement about the lawsuit.

Anoka-Hennepin Schools is committed to providing a safe and respectful learning environment and to providing an education that supports all students and families, including transgender and gender nonconforming students.



The use of restrooms and locker rooms are determined on a case-by-case basis. The goal is to ensure that all students feel safe and comfortable. Plans for accommodation for restroom and locker room use are made in consultation with school building administrators, the Title IX coordinator, and superintendent in compliance with state and federal law. This approach is consistent with guidance from the National School Boards Association and the Minnesota School Boards Association. Providing privacy for all students is an important consideration.



Information regarding individual students is considered private student data and the district is not allowed to comment on such information.



Anoka-Hennepin is confident our actions conform with state and federal law.

What does the Minnesota Department of Education say?

In 2017, the education department issued a tool kit with guidelines regarding transgender students.

Title IX and the Minnesota Human Rights Act declare that it is an unfair discriminatory to deny any student the full and equal enjoyment of any educational institution such as a public school. Schools ensure full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations for students where they are not stigmatized or segregated from the rest of the general student population when in exercising their right to the public accommodation.



""A policy that requires an individual to use a bathroom that does not conform to his or her gender identity punishes that individual for his or her gender nonconformance, which in turn violates Title IX."" Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District, (7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, May 30, 2017).



Within the school setting, school officials and leaders need to ensure that all students have access to restrooms, have access to locker rooms to fully participate in classes, sports and activities and have access to hotel accommodations when travelling with school groups for athletic, educational and/or cultural purposes.

Schools should work with transgender and gender nonconforming students to ensure that they are able to access needed facilities in a manner that is safe, consistent with their gender identity and does not stigmatize them.



Privacy objections raised by a student in interacting with a transgender or gender nonconforming student may be addressed by segregating the student raising the objection provided that the action of the school officials does not result in stigmatizing the transgender and gender nonconforming student.



Restrooms



Transgender and gender nonconforming students should be afforded the opportunity to use the restroom of their choice. Some students may feel uncomfortable with using a restroom with a transgender or gender nonconforming student. Any student who wishes not to share a restroom with a transgender or gender nonconforming student can be provided a private space such as a single-user restroom. Many schools have chosen to make single-stall restrooms available to all students. For example, some schools have re-purposed a staff restroom into a single user restroom for all students to use.



Locker Rooms



Students use locker rooms during their school day for physical education classes, sports and other activities. Some transgender and gender nonconforming students may prefer a private space while others may wish to use the locker room consistent with their gender identity. Coaches should consider how they can utilize privacy curtains, restrooms and separate changing schedules to provide for privacy for all students.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-teen-sue-to-use-boys-locker-room,2019-02-26
Twitch apologizes for using 'womxn' after online outrage from transgender activists and allies,"Popular streaming platform Twitch apologized after a wave of online outrage from transgender activists and their allies over their use of the term ""womxn.""

""While we originally wanted to use a word that acknowledges the shortcoming of gender-binary language, after hearing directly from you, including members of the LGBTQIA+ community on Twitch, we will be using the spelling 'women' moving forward,"" Twitch tweeted from their official account.

Transgender activists excoriated Twitch because the term is seen as transphobic because it excludes the possibility of biological men who identify as women.



""We want to assure you that we have, and will continue to, work with the LGBTQIA+ community. We're still learning. Our good intentions don't always equate to positive impact, but we're committed to growing from these experiences, doing better, and ensuring we're inclusive to all,"" Twitch added in a second tweet.

The account tweeted their original tweet that was offensive to the transgender community, but screenshots were circulated by those angry at the message.

""March is Womxn's History Month,"" the deleted tweet read. ""Join us in celebrating and supporting all the Womxn creating their own worlds, building their communities, and leading the way on Twitch.""

Transgender allies said the term was used by ""TERFs,"" their acronym for ""Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists,"" to exclude transgender women.

""This needs to be said: 'Womxn' is a term made by terfs. Trans women are women. Folks is already gender neutral. Not everyone likes 'folx'. Respect peoples wishes. Latine (sic) people have stated many times they don't like the term 'Latinx'. Don't be performative,"" said one account.

""I'm trans and 'womxn' is only used by people who try to tell me I'm not a 'real woman.' If you truly want to be inclusive of me and not purposely trying to other me, then you'll stop doing this,"" said another critic.

""If you want to do a Women's History Month and wish for trans women to be included, please, just call us women. If your true intentions are to validate us, then don't other us,"" they added in a second tweet.

""Twitch, we won't forget that you used a harmful term created by transphobes in a tweet you made. Trans women are women, not womxn,"" responded another critic.

Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard out of women's Olympic competition early after failing at all three lift attempts,"Laurel Hubbard — a biological male who identifies as female and was cleared to compete against women weightlifters at the Tokyo Olympics — exited early from competition at the Games.

What are the details?

Hubbard of New Zealand failed on all three lifts in the snatch portion of the women's +87kg competition Monday and recorded a ""did not finish,"" ESPN reported.

Yahoo Sports said Hubbard was the only finalist to not complete at least one lift; ESPN added that among Hubbard's group, Hubbard was the only competitor to not advance to the Clean & Jerk portion of the evening.

Hubbard, 43, was the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympic Games.

What did Hubbard say afterward?

""Thank you so very much for your interest in my humble sporting performance tonight,"" Hubbard said to the media, according to Yahoo Sports. ""I know from a sporting perspective I did not live up to the standards I put upon myself.""

Hubbard added, ""I know my participation in these games has not been entirely without controversy,"" before praising the International Olympic Committee, the outlet noted.

""[The IOC has] been extraordinarily supportive, and I think that they have reaffirmed the principles of the Olympics that sport is something that all people around the world can do, that it is inclusive and successful,"" Hubbard added, according to Yahoo Sports.

The outlet noted that Hubbard took no questions from reporters.

But according to the PA Media organization, journalists attending the Tokyo International Forum for the event ""were handed a 20-page guidebook prepared by three LGBT activist groups with the approval of the International Weightlifting Federation.""

PA Media said the guidelines urged reporters to ignore ""misinformation"" that transgender athletes have an ""unfair advantage"" and told journalists to ""familiarize yourselves with ... anti-LGBTQ groups and their campaigns targeting transgender access to sports.""

Anything else?

Hubbard has been competing against women for several years — and that has angered women's rights groups that say Hubbard's presence represents unfair competition. Yahoo Sports reported that the IOC said it will unveil a new framework on the issue soon and that its present policy allowing the likes of Hubbard to compete is ""outdated.""

""What's really important to remember is that trans women are women,"" Richard Budgett, director of the IOC's medical and scientific department, told Yahoo Sports. ""And so, in the spirit of inclusion in sport, if at all possible, they should be included in sport. It's only where there's evidence of real concern — that that would lead to a disproportionate performance advantage for those individuals — should any rules and regulations come in to change that eligibility. The IOC is determined to increase inclusion in sport as one of the fundamentals, but at the same time our highest, highest priority is fairness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-weightlifter-laurel-hubbard-out-of-women-s-olympic-competition-early-after-failing-at-all-three-lift-attempts,2021-08-02
Transgender woman who was attacked in viral video last month found shot and killed,"A Texas transgender woman, who was assaulted last month, was found shot and killed over the weekend.

Dallas police officers found Muhlaysia Booker, 23, ""lying face down in a public street"" at about 6:40 a.m. Saturday, according to authorities.

""Dallas Fire-Rescue responded and pronounced the victim deceased from homicidal violence,"" Dallas Police Maj. Vincent Weddington told reporters Sunday during a news conference.

Police said they have no leads or suspects in the case.

What are the details?

Dallas police responded to a shooting call Saturday morning in East Dallas.

Upon arrival to the scene, they found an unidentified woman lying dead in the street, Weddington told reporters.

The medical examiner later identified the body to belong to Booker, the same transgender woman who was assaulted by several men last month.

What happened to Booker in April?



In April, a viral Facebook video showed a group of people kicking and punching Booker in a parking lot following a car accident. The woman reportedly suffered a broken wrist and concussion in the attack.

Two days later, Edward Thomas, 29, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He is accused of repeatedly punching Booker and using homophobic slurs during the attack. Thomas was later released from jail after posting bond.

Police said the assault case is still under investigation and officials are trying to determine whether or not the assault met the criteria of a hate crime.

At this time, police said they have no information connecting Thomas to Booker's death.

What else?

Police have asked for the public's help in the case surrounding Booker's death.

Transgender woman complains bank disallows phone transactions because 'I sound like a man',"A UK transgender woman is complaining that a bank has been disallowing phone transactions because ""I sound like a man.""

""I opened the account in October last year,"" Ellen Westerleigh told the Nottingham Post regarding HSBC bank. ""I had to order a new card, and they sent a card that said Mr. rather than Miss. They said it was an error. Every time I ring up to speak about my account they say I 'don't sound like a woman.' I have to prove who I am, and I shouldn't be having to do that.""

Image source: Twitter

'I know I sound like a man, but that's not the point'



Westerleigh added to the paper, ""I know I sound like a man, but that is not the point. I do feel uncomfortable ringing up my bank. It has happened three or four times, and it is ridiculous. It has got to a point where I have to go into my branch and show my ID, and I do not live near my branch. The nearest is the City Centre.""

The 22-year-old lives in Strelley, the Post said — which is about five miles or an 18-minute drive from Nottingham City Centre.

The latest incident was when HSBC refused to transfer money from Westerleigh's account because the bank didn't believe the person on the phone was Westerleigh despite security questions having been answered, the paper reported.

""I have told them several times 'I am transgender.' It is in my file. I should not have to keep saying it,"" Westerleigh added to the paper. ""They do not take the trans community seriously. They just think we are not that gender.""



What is Westerleigh's background?



Westerleigh — who used to be known as Kurtis — became Ellen last September after being uncomfortable as a male for a long time, the Post said.

""I grew up with two sisters, and it was obvious,"" Westerleigh told the paper. ""I always wanted to put on dresses or play with their toys. In September, I thought it was time to be true to myself.""

Westerleigh — who said ""Ellen"" was chosen due to inspiration from TV host Ellen DeGeneres — is now waiting for hormone therapy and a sex change, the Post reported.

What is HSBC saying?

HSBC told the paper that its customer care team is reviewing Westerleigh's complaint and has recently made changes to its systems and training to support transgender customers.

""We are very sorry for the disappointing level of service experienced by Miss Westerleigh, and are committed to learning from this to help ensure it doesn't happen again,"" a HSBC spokesman told the Post. ""We are a proud and active supporter of customers and colleagues across the broad spectrum of diversity of sexuality and gender identity. We want everyone to be able to access simple and smart banking solutions that work for them, and we will continue working with our LGBT+ colleagues and customers to ensure we're getting it right.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-woman-complains-bank-disallows-phone-transactions-because-i-sound-like-a-man,2019-08-02
"Transsexual who butchered his parents no longer serving his 40-year sentence in men's prison, now listed as a 'female' in medium-security prison","On account of legislation sponsored and approved by Democrat politicians, the 24-year-old transsexual who butchered his parents and family dog on Halloween in 2016 — claiming they provoked him by refusing to indulge his fantasy of being a woman — has received a ""female"" designation and is no longer in a men's-only prison.

What are the details?

Andrew Balcer, now 24, was held at the Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland, Maine, prior to his conviction in 2018 for the murder of his parents. A program manager at the secure juvenile facility testified in court that Balcer demanded to be called ""Andrea"" while in custody and further requested that people use female pronouns when describing him, reported the Kennebec Journal.

After receiving his sentence, Balcer was sent to the Maine State Prison, a maximum-security facility for men. However, it appears that the double murderer has since had his accommodations upgraded.

The feminist publication Reduxx reported that Balcer now resides in the Maine Correctional Center in Windham, a mixed-sex medium-security facility where he is likely kept with real women.

According to the MCC website, the facility is Maine’s primary adult reception facility for both male and female residents and is where ""residents sentenced to less than five years are directly admitted.""

The Maine Department of Corrections lists Andrew Balcer, a biological male looming at over six feet tall and weighing in at over 245 pounds, as a ""female"" with the alias ""Andrea Balcer.""

Andrew Balcer Maine Department of Corrections, inmate profile

Reduxx noted that the so-called ""Act to Protect the Rights of Certain Incarcerated Individuals,"" sponsored by Democrat state Rep. Charlotte Warren and approved by Democrat Gov. Janet Mills in 2021, enables men to be housed with women in the event that the men identify as women.

The act ""provides to a person residing in a correctional or detention facility the right to have that person's consistently held gender identity respected and acknowledged and to have staff and representatives of the correctional or detention facility use the pronouns, titles and names identified by the person.""

Extra to affirming the inmate's supposed gender dysphoria, housing and search procedures must be consistent with the inmate's gender identity.

In addition to potentially residing with real women, Balcer is also permitted dysphoria-affirming apparel.

Fox News Digital noted that MDOC Commissioner Randell Liberty rolled out a policy in 2020 requiring state-run prisons to provide clothing that aligns with an inmate's so-called gender identity, meaning that men can be given bras and women can receive chest binders. Balcer would be eligible to receive such gear.

The murders



WGME reported that on Oct. 31, 2016, Balcer murdered his parents, Alice and Tony Balcer, and then slaughtered the family's chihuahua because it kept barking.

In a 911 call played in court, Balcer confessed to the murders, saying, ""I snapped. I took my little Ka-Bar [U.S. Marine Corps combat knife] there and I drove it straight into my mother’s back.""

Balcer later told Maine State Police detectives that he had stabbed his mother when she came over to give him a comforting hug.

The murderer noted at the time of the 911 call — which was punctuated by his apparent laughter — that his mother's corpse was lying on the floor, ""messy.""

""My father came up because he heard her screams and I stabbed the f*** out of him,"" said Balcer. ""I stabbed the dog too. She was barking.""



Alice Balcer was reportedly stabbed nine times and Tony Balcer was stabbed 13 times.

The murderer reportedly asked his brother Christopher Balcer if he wanted to die, but ultimately permitted him to escape unmolested.

Judge Eric Walker said, ""The only possible motive for the murders appears to be Andrew’s perception that his parents were unwilling or unable to deal with his transgender issues. We will never know if Antonio or Alice Balcer would have been accepting, because they were ambushed and murdered by Andrew.""

Contrary to the murderer's claims, Alice Balcer's brother Carl Pierce said, ""There was no hatred. There was no malice. There was no ill will. There was resignation to be sure but ultimately there was acceptance.""

The murderer's brother Christopher Balcer similarly suggested that the victims had been accepting of their killer's identity, reported the Sun Journal.



Christopher Balcer also suggested that the murderer's claims of abuse at the hands of his parents were similarly lies, calling the allegations ""the most absurd I've ever heard in my life.""

Christopher shared a letter he sent to his brother in jail with the Kennebec Journal, in which he wrote, ""I still hear our dearest mother’s screams, every night as I fall asleep. Every morning as I awaken, they echo in my head. Her screams as she was stabbed by the son she doted on so much, the son she only wanted the world for, and would accept nothing less.""

""I remember the foul things you accused her of, and the looks of horror upon the family’s faces as they heard about them. You are an inhuman creature and the fact that you continue to pretend otherwise sickens me,"" added Christopher.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transsexual-who-butchered-his-parents-no-longer-serving-his-40-year-sentence-in-mens-prison,2022-12-29
President Trump triggers liberal meltdown by rolling back Obama-era LGBT protection,"The Trump administration announced Friday that it was finalizing the elimination of an Obama-era regulation prohibiting health care discrimination against certain LGBT individuals.

In 2016, the Obama administration extended protections under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which ""prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in certain health programs and activities."" The updated rule redefined sex discrimination to include gender identity — defining that as ""one's internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female"" — and pregnancy termination, or abortion.

In a statement on Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services said the Obama administration's change ""exceeded the scope of the authority delegated by Congress in Section 1557.""

""HHS will enforce Section 1557 by returning to the government's interpretation of sex discrimination according to the plain meaning of the word 'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology,"" the HHS said.

The move will also save consumers billions of dollars.

From the HHS:

The final rule will also relieve the American people of approximately $2.9 billion in unnecessary regulatory burdens over five years from eliminating the mandate for regulated entities to send patients and customers excessive ""notice and taglines"" inserts in 15 or more foreign languages in almost every health care mailing, costs that get passed down to patients and consumers.



These expensive notices have not generally proven effective at accomplishing their purpose of providing meaningful language access to healthcare.

In response, top Democratic leaders attacked President Donald Trump, noting the finalization of the regulation change came during Pride Month, the month-long celebration of LGBT people.

Joe Biden

""On the fourth anniversary of Pulse. In the middle of Pride month. During a global pandemic. Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November,"" Biden said.

Trump administration denies US embassy requests to fly LGBT pride flag on official flagpoles,"The Trump administration has reportedly shot down U.S. embassy requests to raise rainbow flags on their official flag poles during LGBT Pride Month.

What are the details?

According to NBC News, three unnamed U.S. diplomats confirmed that the State Department denied the requests made by a number of U.S. embassies, including in Israel, Germany, Brazil, and Latvia. Officials acknowledged, however, that the pride flag is still allowed to be displayed elsewhere on the properties.

The denials are a change from the Obama administration, which granted permission for all U.S. embassies to fly the flag during pride month in June.

President Donald Trump has been accused of discriminating against the LGBT community in the past, most notably over his administration's decision to prohibit transgender individuals from enlisting in the armed forces. The president has defended that decision, citing the costs involved with gender transition surgeries and medications.

The president did, however, recently tweet out his acknowledgement of pride month for the first time since he's been in office, The Hill reported. In his message, President Trump noted the contributions of the LGBT community, while pushing his initiative to decriminalize homosexuality in countries worldwide where it is still punishable.



NBC reported that the decision to bar the embassy in Berlin from displaying a pride flag ""is particularly jarring"" because it impacts openly gay ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who leads the decriminalization efforts.

In a statement, Grenell told the outlet, ""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag.""

Report: Trump administration launches global initiative to end criminalization of homosexuality,"The Trump administration is launching a worldwide initiative to end the criminalization of homosexuality, NBC News reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

Openly gay U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is spearheading the effort, ""flying in LGBT activists from across Europe"" to discuss the strategy in Berlin Tuesday evening, unnamed officials told NBC News.

""It is concerning that, in the 21st century, some 70 countries continue to have laws that criminalize LGBTI status or conduct,"" one source told the outlet.

The move comes just weeks after Grenell penned an op-ed in the German publication Bild, condemning Iran's execution of a 31-year-old gay man by public hanging, saying that ""politicians, the U.N., democratic governments, diplomats, and good people everywhere should speak up — and loudly.""

Grenell called for world leaders to ""work harder to demand that U.N. members decriminalize homosexuality.""

According to the Daily Mail, the Iranian man Grenell referred to was charged with homosexual relations, which is punishable by death under the country's Shariah law. The Mail reported that an Iranian news source claimed the accused had kidnapped two 15-year-old boys.

Grenell wrote, ""This is not the first time the Iranian regime has put a gay man to death with the usual outrageous claims of prostitution, kidnapping, or even pedophilia. And it sadly won't be the last time they do it either. Barbaric public executions are all too common in a country where consensual homosexual relationships are criminalized and punishable by flogging and death.""

Anything else?

According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's State-Sponsored Homophobia report from 2017, there are 72 countries that criminalize consenting homosexual intercourse between men, and the laws apply to women in 45 of those nations.

The study cited evidence that homosexuality is punishable by death in eight nations: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria (in territories held by ISIS), Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-initiative-end-criminalization-homosexuality,2019-02-19
Trump calls McConnell 'a stupid person' for refusing to end the filibuster,"Former President Donald Trump blasted Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as mentally incompetent for preserving the filibuster while he was president and Republicans held control of Congress.

Trump told Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker that McConnell has ""no personality"" and lacks a killer political instinct in an interview published by Vanity Fair, an excerpt from their forthcoming book, ""I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year.""

""He's a stupid person,"" Trump said of McConnell. ""I don't think he's smart enough.""

He criticized McConnell for refusing to abolish the Senate filibuster — the 60-vote requirement to break minority obstruction and advance legislation toward a simple majority vote. He also faulted McConnell for failing to persuade Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a moderate Democrat, to switch parties.

""I tried to convince Mitch McConnell to get rid of the filibuster, to terminate it, so that we would get everything, and he was a knucklehead and he didn't do it,"" said Trump.

The former president also complained about former House Speaker Paul Ryan, calling him a ""super-RINO"" — Republican-in-name-only — and said he wished he had partners in Congress like Meade Esposito, a corrupt Democratic Party boss in Brooklyn from the 1960s through the 1980s.

Esposito ran a citywide patronage system that rewarded loyalists with jobs, gifts, and favors. Though he commanded respect, he had a reputation for intimidation and bullying and was connected to organized crime. In 1987 he was convicted on charges related to a bribery scandal.

""Nobody would ever talk back to Meade Esposito. Meade Esposito didn't have a RINO like a Mitt Romney, you know, or as I said, Ben Sasse, who's a lightweight,"" said Trump, naming two Republican senators who are some of his most outspoken Republican critics in Congress.

""Mitch McConnell compared to Meade Esposito, it's like a baby compared to a grown-up football player with brains on top of everything else,"" he added.

Democrats currently control the United States Senate with a bare minimum 50-50 majority. Vice President Kamala Harris must cast her tie-breaking vote to allow the Democratic majority to pass partisan legislation or approve President Joe Biden's nominees, and that only occurs when Republicans do not use the filibuster.

Since Biden became president, Republicans have used the threat of a filibuster to block the For the People Act, an overhaul of U.S. elections that would undo several Republican-backed election security reforms at the state level. GOP senators also blocked a bipartisan bill to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Countless pieces of Biden's agenda on taxes, LGBT issues, election reforms, the Green New Deal, and more are dead on arrival as long as Republicans are able to wield the filibuster as a weapon to strike down radical progressive bills.

Recognizing this, Democrats are now calling on the moderates in their party to support abolishing the filibuster, despite just a few years ago protesting Trump's efforts to have McConnell end it.

In March, McConnell warned that eliminating the filibuster would result in a ""scorched-earth Senate"" where Republicans would use every tool at their disposal to make life miserable for Democratic senators and then pass whatever they wanted when they took back control of the Senate at some point in the future.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-calls-mcconnell-a-stupid-person-for-refusing-to-end-the-filibuster,2021-07-19
Democratic 2020 hopeful Tulsi Gabbard apologizes for past anti-gay beliefs,"Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) issued a lengthy apology Thursday for her past comments and activism that the LGBT community had criticized.

Gabbard, who recently announced she was seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, shared her shift on gay rights in a video on social media.

""Aloha. In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community and their loved ones. I'm deeply sorry for having said and believed them,"" Gabbard wrote on Twitter.

The 37-year-old Gabbard previously worked for an anti-LGBT organization run by her ""very outspoken"" father whom she had defended in the past.

What did she say?

Gabbard described her previous stance as ""hurtful"" and ""wrong,"" and pointed to her conservative upbringing to explain her past beliefs.

""I grew up knowing that every person is a child of God, and equally loved by God,"" she said. ""I have always believed in the fundamental rights and equality of all people.

""But I also grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman,"" she continued. ""For a period of my life, I didn't see the contradiction in those beliefs.

""While many Americans may relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken,"" Gabbard said. ""He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii, and at that time, I forcefully defended him.""

The congresswoman went on to say that over time her opinions have changed.

""But over the years, I formed my own opinions based on my life experience that changed my views at a personal level in having aloha, love, for all people, and ensuring that every American, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, is treated equally under the law,"" Gabbard continued.

Aloha. In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community and their loved ones. I'm deeply sorry for having said and believed them. https://t.co/BWlOBk9ZnN

What's the response from LGBTQ groups?

Some groups have been critical of Gabbard for her past actions despite her newfound beliefs.

Zeke Stokes, the vice president of programs at GLAAD, told Fox News that she was ""was someone who worked so actively against our community when the stakes were so high.""

""One thing is to say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, but another is to actively work to stymie the progress of a community that is marginalized, and to oppose an effort to keep kids safe,"" Stokes said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-apologizes-for-past-beliefs,2019-01-17
Tulsi Gabbard bashes President Biden for 'essentially' calling millions of Americans 'terrorists' with his incendiary insults against 'MAGA crowd',"President Joe Biden lashed out at the ""MAGA crowd"" and supporters of former President Donald Trump on Wednesday. The harsh and derogatory disparagement against tens of millions of Americans prodded former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to condemn President Biden.

On Wednesday, Biden suggested that the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade was a slippery slope.

Biden proposed a hypothetical situation, ""What happens if you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children?""

President Biden told reporters at the White House, ""Is that legit under the way the decision is written? What are the next things that are going to be attacked?""

""Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history,"" Biden said, making a reference to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.

Some are comparing Biden's insults against millions of Americans to Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" remark that she made leading up to the 2016 presidential election.

""You know, just to be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said at an LGBT-centered fundraiser. ""The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.""

CNN host Michael Smerconish warned that Biden risks suffering backlash to attack Americans in the same way that Clinton did.

""I think that that backfired on her,"" Smerconish said of Clinton's comments. ""I think that she regretted it. I think it became a rallying cry. You remember there was merchandise, there was merch at the time. People were wearing T-shirts proudly proclaiming that they were part of the deplorables.""

Smerconish noted that ""it’s a fine line"" to besmirch fellow Americans who may not vote the way you want them to.

Gabbard was incensed by Biden's incendiary remarks and slammed the president during an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

""When you look at the President of the United States of America calling millions of Americans, essentially terrorists, people who politically opposed him or voted against him, he's calling them terrorists in an attempt to intimidate them into silence. And we know this because we've heard this before from both him and his attorney general.""

Gabbard pointed to the Justice Department's newly-formed ""Domestic Terrorism Unit"" that will target the ""elevated threat from domestic violent extremists.""

""You remember when his attorney general said, you know, anyone who holds extremist or anti-authority views will be targeted for investigation and potential prosecution by their domestic terrorist unit,"" Gabbard said. ""So he's essentially saying that this, quote-unquote 'MAGA' crowd are worse than terrorists. This is outrageous.""

""And so for every American who's watching, every American who's seen this, no matter how you feel about the MAGA crowd, this is an authoritarian assault on our freedom,"" the former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii proclaimed. ""And we need to stand together very strongly against this attempt to intimidate and silence anyone who holds political views that are different from or opposed to what this president and his administration are furthering. This is an assault on our democracy.""

Tulsi Gabbard rips Biden's comments on the MAGA crowd: 'Outrageous' www.youtube.com

In January, Gabbard trashed Biden for ""pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness.""

""Biden promised to unite our country,"" Gabbard wrote on Twitter. ""Instead he betrayed us, pouring fuel on the fire of divisiveness, tearing our country apart. Biden compares those who disagree with him to racists, traitors & enemies, & has his AG target Americans as domestic terrorists. Unfit to lead.""

One of Biden's most consistent messages during the 2020 presidential campaign was ""unity.""

""Unity"" took center stage during Biden's inaugural speech.

""History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity,"" Biden said. ""We can see each other, not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.""

""No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward,"" Biden declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-joe-biden-maga-terrorists,2022-05-05
Twitter targets GOP rep who called transgender official Rachel Levine 'a man' — but lawmaker refuses to back down,"Twitter removed a tweet from the official account of Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) on Saturday, accusing the lawmaker of violating the platforms rules against ""hateful content.""

What are the details?

Banks was reportedly ""censored,"" locked out of his official Twitter account until he deleted a tweet that called Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary for health, ""a man."" Levine was born a biological man, but is transgender and now identifies as a woman.

Banks critically tweeted about Levine on Tuesday after news broke that Levine would receive the honor of being the ""first-ever female four-star admiral"" of the U.S. Public Health Services Commissioned Corps.

""The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man,"" Banks said in the now-removed tweet.

By Saturday, Twitter had taken down the message, accusing Banks of violating the platform's rules prohibiting ""hateful content.""

""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules,"" the message from Twitter read. ""You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.""

Twitter rules further explain that ""misgendering"" someone is a violation of platform policies.

""We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that intends to dehumanize, degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals,"" Twitter rules state.



How did Banks respond?

The Indiana congressman refused to back down from his remark about Levine.

""My tweet was a statement of fact,"" Banks said in a statement. ""Big Tech doesn't have to agree with me, but they shouldn't be able to cancel me. If they silence me, they will silence you. We can't allow Big Tech to prevent us from telling the truth. When Republicans take back the House next year, we must restore honesty to our public forums and hold Big Tech accountable.""

Twitter, however, did not censor Banks for another tweet critical of Levine.

""Calling someone that was born and lived as a man for 54 years the first 'female' four-star officer is an insult to every little girl who dreams of breaking glass ceilings one day,"" that tweet said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-jim-banks-rachel-levine-tweet,2021-10-23
Twitter 'moment' misrepresents Ben Shapiro criticism of Beto O'Rourke's policy against religious freedom,"The news aggregator for the social media platform Twitter falsely misrepresented comments by Ben Shapiro in a manner that made him sound more extreme than his full statement.

The report was posted to the social media platform under the headline, ""Ben Shapiro says he'd 'pick up a gun' or leave the country over Beto O'Rourke's stance on gay marriage.""

Image Source: Twitter moment screenshot

O'Rourke said during a CNN LGBT town hall that he would take away the tax exempt status from any organization that didn't affirm gay marriage, including churches and colleges.



Contrary to the headline's simplified version of his comments, Shapiro made a much more complex and nuanced statement against O'Rourke's policy.

""If you come to tell me that you're going to indoctrinate my kids into a particular policy and that I can't pull my kid out of a school and send my kid to the school that I want to send them to, that I can't go to the church or synagogue that I want to go to, and if you make that national policy, not just California policy where I can move, but national policy — people are not going to stand for that,"" said Shapiro on his popular podcast Wednesday.

""And if you send a truant officer to remove my child, I have two choices at that point, right? If I have no place to move because you have now made this national, federal policy, I now have two choices: One is to leave the country utterly. Two is to pick up a gun. Those are the only choices you have left me,"" he explained.

""It is my right to raise my child with the moral precepts that I find to be beneficial for my child,"" Shapiro continued later on in the commentary. ""Beto O'Rourke does not to get to raise my child — and if he tries, I will meet him at the door with my gun. That is insane.""

Critics of Shapiro ignored those on the left who agreed with his assessment of O'Rourke's policy, including fellow presidential candidate South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

""I'm not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying,"" Buttigieg responded on CNN's State of the Union show.

""That would mean going to war not only with churches, but with mosques and a lot of orgs that may not have the same view of various religious principles that I do,"" he concluded.

UK boarding school turns over its chaplain to anti-terrorism authorities — after he preached against school's LGBTQ policies,"A boarding school in the United Kingdom secretly turned over its chaplain to an anti-terrorism program after preaching a sermon in which he defended students' rights to question the school's new LGBTQ policies, the Daily Mail reported.

What are the details?

The Rev. Dr. Bernard Randall told students at independent Trent College near Nottingham that it was OK for them to disagree with the policies, especially if they go against Church of England principles, the outlet said.

One of the school's new policies was to ""develop a whole school LGBT+ inclusive curriculum,"" the Daily Mail said.

But when the powers that be at the boarding school deemed Randall's sermon ""harmful"" to LGBTQ students, the school turned him in to Prevent, which the outlet said normally identifies individuals at risk of radicalization.

However, after police investigated the tip, they told Trent College that the 48-year-old chaplain posed ""no counter terrorism risk, or risk of radicalization,"" the Daily Mail said, adding that Derbyshire Police confirmed the case ""did not meet the threshold for a Prevent referral.""

But it wasn't over

But the outlet added that Randall — a former Cambridge University chaplain and Oxford graduate — revealed that Trent College later informed him that his future sermons would be censored in advance and that his chapel services would be monitored ""to ensure that ... requirements are met.""

And then Randall was fired, the Daily Mail said.

While the outlet said he's suing for discrimination, harassment, victimization, and unfair dismissal, he shared that ""my career and life are in tatters.""

What did he say in his sermon?

Randall said his June 2019 sermon in the school chapel was prompted by concerns from students about an organization called Educate & Celebrate, which was invited to ""embed gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the fabric"" of the school, the Daily Mail said.



""You should no more be told you have to accept LGBT ideology than you should be told you must be in favor of Brexit or must be Muslim,"" Randall preached, according to the outlet.

However, he also encouraged students to ""treat each other with respect,"" the Daily Mail said.

And then a few days later, Randall said he was called to a meeting and told the sermon was inflammatory, divisive, and ""harmful to LGBT pupils,"" the outlet noted.

The Daily Mail said Randall only discovered the anti-terrorism referral because it was mentioned in documents given to him ahead of a disciplinary hearing: ""I had visions of being investigated by MI5, of men knocking down the front door.""

The school finally made Randall ""redundant"" on Dec. 31, 2020, according to Staffordshire Live, which cited the Christian Legal Centre, the organization supporting Randall.

Toby Young of the Free Speech Union told the outlet that Randall's sermon was ""fantastic"" and that it insists ""no one has a monopoly on moral truth. For Bernard Randall to lose his job as a result of this sermon is scandalous. What's so depressing about his treatment is the message it sends to the pupils. The central theme of his sermon is that children shouldn't be afraid to think for themselves. But the message the school has sent is the opposite. Schools should be teaching children how to think, not what to think.""

Andrea Williams — chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre — asked, ""Who are the extremists in this story? The partisan agency who teach young children that they can be born in the wrong body, or the school chaplain moderately presenting what the Christian church has taught about marriage, sex, and gender for the past 2,000 years?"" the Daily Mail said.

Randall's case is scheduled for a hearing in June, the outlet said, adding that Trent College declined to comment.

UK bus driver suspended after allegedly refusing to operate bus supporting Pride events,"A bus driver in the United Kingdom was suspended after allegedly refusing to operate a bus supporting Pride events, BBC News reported.

""This bus promotes homosexuality, and I refuse to drive it,"" he reportedly told passengers in Norwich, England, the outlet said, adding that the bus displayed rainbow-colored numbers in recognition of the city's Pride events in July.

A passenger shared on Twitter that the bus was delayed while another driver was found — and then she complained to staff at Norwich Park and Ride, BBC News reported.

What did the bus driver's bosses have to say?



Go East Anglia, which runs Konectbus, told the outlet the driver was suspended and an investigation had commenced. The company also noted on Twitter that it ""prides itself on values that support diversity and inclusion and has been a champion of Norwich Pride since 2017,"" BBC News said.

""We particularly want all customers of whatever background or sexual orientation to feel comfortable on our services.,"" Go East Anglia added, according to the outlet. ""As a company we do not condone any behavior from our drivers that does not support this view.""

What did an LGBTQ leader have to say?



""Our reaction is this type of prejudiced view is exactly why we started Norwich Pride in 2009, to ensure homophobia is visibly challenged and the city is safe and inclusive for all,"" Julie Bremner, trustee of Norwich Pride, told BBC News. ""We are pleased to see the bus company take action following this complaint. When the buses started showing a rainbow number in 2017, people in our LGBT+ community were delighted as this was another visible symbol to say Norwich welcomes all and is a city of diversity.""

But the driver is getting support, too

UK college falls over itself in apologies after students complain speaker linked to gay conversion therapy was part of Christian conference held at school,"One might argue — in these days of perpetual outrage — that the squeaky wheel indeed gets the grease.

Well, as long as it's the right kind of wheel.

What happened?

Seems a speaker linked to gay conversion therapy was part of a Christian conference held at Worcester College in the United Kingdom earlier this month, the Oxford Tab reported.

And when some students learned the Wilberforce Academy's conference included Mike Davidson — who advocates for ""professional assistance"" to help individuals ""leave behind unwanted homosexual practices"" — the perturbed students complained to Worcester College for hosting the conference, the Tab noted.

The students asserted that Davidson's stances are ""hateful and invalidating,"" the outlet added.

Who is Davidson?

Davidson is CEO of Core Issues Trust and X-Out Loud, the Tab reported, adding that he has said he ""takes people seriously who say they want to move away from homosexual practices and feelings"". Davidson spoke at a conference event titled, ""LGBT and Change,"" the outlet said.

Davidson's group also is concerned about the ""encroaching politico-religious identity of Islam"" and tries to ""understand how to respond to these doctrines,"" the outlet also noted. But some students deemed such language inflammatory and were disturbed by a conference session titled, ""The nature of Islam,"" the Tab reported.

What did the upset students do?

The angry students emailed Worcester's Junior Common Room president, LGBTQ+ representative, and Ethnic and Religious Minorities representative, the outlet said.

""Many of us come to uni hoping to be allowed to be ourselves and know we can trust our new community and home,"" the students' email read, according to the Tab. ""But how are we expected to place our trust in somewhere that, if it weren't for a leaflet being left behind at breakfast, would have left us unaware that they had hosted a group that has consistently aimed to persecute and strip us of our rights for our sexuality, gender, and or religion?""

Deluge of apologies

Check out the massive mea culpa from a Worcester spokesperson, according to the Tab:

""We deeply regret the distress caused to students, staff, and other members of the college community by the presence of the Wilberforce Academy conference. The college was not aware of the speaker list or program content in advance. The booking was taken in good faith, but it is clear that our procedures did not work as they should. We have begun an urgent review to ensure that this does not happen again. We have agreed with the JCR Committee that the profit from the conference will be set aside to fund dedicated equality, diversity, and inclusivity initiatives. We are working with students and other members of the college community to identify the most appropriate projects. We acknowledge that this was a serious failure that has caused significant distress, and we apologize unreservedly to all those who have been affected.""

The outlet also noted a reply from the co-chair of the SU LGBTQ+ Campaign:

""We stand in full solidarity with you and will do our best to take the necessary action to prevent this from being an issue again in the future. We were totally unaware this was happening and are extremely upset to hear that Worcester has hosted individuals propagating such a harmful rhetoric, and as you say, seemingly tried to do so without drawing attention to the fact it was happening. We agree that it is alarming that an organization with such a poor history across the university should continue to be given a platform, and are keen to prevent this from being the case in the future.""

Oh, and here's what the JCR Committee had to say, according to the Tab:

""We appreciate how promptly the college took action, to resolve their oversight in hosting the Wilberforce Academy. We were equally shocked and disappointed to hear about the conference, and we would like to thank the freshers who brought it to our attention and voiced their worries. We would like to encourage all students not to hesitate to contact us if something in college concerns them.""

How did Wilberforce Academy respond?

As you might imagine, Wilberforce Academy was not happy that the college apologized for hosting its conference — and called it an example of ""cancel culture.""

Andrea Minichiello Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern — which runs Wilberforce Academy — told the Tab the following:

""It seems that cancel culture has once again demonstrated the power of its grip in one of our top universities, fueled by a small group of activists who won't tolerate any view that departs from their own narrow ideology and who will resort to tactics of misrepresentation and sweeping allegations to get their way, seemingly frightening nearly everyone into submission. That a college now led by someone who has so often claimed to be a defender of freedom of expression in higher education is rumored to have capitulated to this aggressive movement is even more concerning. We very much enjoyed our week at the college, were very warmly welcomed, including by the Provost, received many compliments from the staff and were not aware of any complaints or concerns being raised with us at the time. Yet now we hear it alleged that the college has 'apologized' for hosting us! We will be seeking urgent clarification. Whatever happens, we will continue to speak of Jesus Christ who was himself an 'outsider' and by his words and actions demonstrated his commitment to reaching the marginalized, excluded, and vulnerable so that they could discover true hope and everlasting love through him, even sacrificing his own life to do so.""

UK school official suspended after questioning why parents weren't consulted about LGBTQ books,"A U.K. school official was suspended after questioning why parents weren't consulted about LGBTQ books becoming part of the school library's reading list, Christian Concern said.

Maureen Griffith, 74, has been a governor at Alperton Community School in Brent, North London, since the early 1990s, Christianity Today reported. She helped shape the school's curriculum, pioneered the school's health and safety policies, and introduced better disabled access, Christian Concern said.

What happened?

According to Christian Concern, Griffith received a booklet from the school's library noting its staff planned to introduce reading lists for LGBTQ+ Pride Month.

Then at the governors' meeting on May 1 of this year, Griffith told the outlet she ""said that parents had not been consulted [about the books] and that there would be parents with children from religious backgrounds who would object and not want their children to have this form of sex education. I urged them to consider those families and added that as a parent myself, I would not have wanted my sons to be reading LGBT books or to be involved in an LGBT Pride month.""

She told Christian Concern that immediately ""a member of staff stood up and left the room, and the clerk of the school began to rage at me saying: 'Look what you've gone and done, you've upset him.' She then told me that I should be accepting of what was happening as it is law.""

On May 21, the outlet said Griffith got a suspension letter from school clerk Jo Sattaur saying she ""breached the Governors Code of Conduct and made homophobic comments at a public meeting that were offensive to members of staff"" and that an investigation would commence.

But the former nurse told Christian Concern she's heard nothing since.

“My mother always taught me that things have to be done properly,"" Griffith noted to Christian Concern. “Therefore, whether as a nurse where I am responsible for patient safety or as a governor where I am responsible for a child's education and shaping the school environment, it is my job to notice things that others do not. In meetings where someone may want to push something through, I scrutinize, and this leads to discussion, debate, and finding consensus on the right way to move forward.""

She added to the outlet that “when they told me I had been 'homophobic' for scrutinizing the introduction of LGBT Pride month, I had to go home and look up what it meant. I couldn't believe it. It never occurred to me that I could be 'homophobic' or scared of something. These things don't come into my head. But now with this LGBT agenda — not just in schools, but across society — there is no debate, no questioning, and there is only a one-way democracy.""

Griffith also told Christian Concern that she's “at peace over the whole situation. I am not annoyed; I am only saddened that this is happening in this country. My faith in Jesus is very important to me in good and bad times — it is my be all and end all. I can do nothing without his help, and he makes my burden lighter. This is how my mum brought me up.""

What did the school have to say?

According to Christianity Today, Alperton Community School issued a statement saying it's ""unable to comment on specific details relating to members of the school community for confidentiality and data protection reasons. However, we confirm that the school adopts the National Governance Association Governors Code of Conduct and that where complaints are raised in respect of governors, the school would always consider whether an impartial and independent investigation is necessary. We further confirm that the school's policies and resources are regularly reviewed and are wholly appropriate for the school community.""

United Airlines now offers 'non-binary gender' booking — and even the title 'Mx.' Reactions are a tad sarcastic.,"United Airlines on Friday announced it's become ""the first U.S. airline to offer non-binary gender options throughout all booking channels"" as well as the option to choose the title ""Mx.""

Now customers can ""identify themselves as M(male), F(female), U(undisclosed) or X(unspecified), corresponding with what is indicated on their passports or identification,"" the airline said in a news release.

""United is determined to lead the industry in LGBT inclusivity, and we are so proud to be the first U.S. airline to offer these inclusive booking options for our customers,"" United Chief Customer Officer Toby Enqvist said in the release. ""United is excited to share with our customers, whether they identify along the binary of male or female or not, that we are taking the steps to exhibit our care for them while also providing additional employee training to make us even more welcoming for all customers and employees.""

More from the release:

As part of implementing these new changes, United has worked with the Human Rights Campaign and The Trevor Project on employee training initiatives. These initiatives include teaching employees about preferred pronouns and the persistence of gender norms, LGBT competency in the workplace and other steps to make United an inclusive space for both customers and employees.

""At the Human Rights Campaign, we believe being acknowledged as the gender you identify with is part of treating everyone with dignity and respect,"" Beck Bailey, acting director of the Workplace Equality Program, noted in the release. ""By providing non-binary gender selection for ticketing and the gender-inclusive honorific 'Mx' in user profiles, United Airlines is taking an important step forward for non-binary inclusion.""

What was the reaction?

While some reacted positively to United's announcement, a number of Twitter users questioned the necessity of bringing gender into flight booking in the first place: ""Why include gender at all in the process?"" one user wondered. ""We're all just packing into a tiny sky tube together for a few hours; why do you need to know what's in my pants first?""

Others unleashed sarcasm in response to the airline's non-binary gender options:

""It's so bizarre. 'Fly with us, we will participate in your delusion.' Strange times.""

""Step 1: Look in your pants. Step 2: Identify if its more inny or outy. Step 3: If unsure consult your government issued birth certificate. Step 4: Check one of ONLY two REAL scientifically sound options 'Male/Female'. If still confused see Genesis 5:2 and a biology 101 book ASAP.""

""I identify as a shape-shifting reptile, and I demand a window seat.""

""As a self-identified Apache helicopter I am outraged at this discrimination against my gender.""

""I identify as an emotional support pet & I would like to fly for free with my owner!""

""Just ask the TSA what I am; they probably spent the last 30 minutes feeling me up.""

""I identify as a customer of an other airline.""

Major Christian denomination splits over 'divisive and destructive debates' on LGBT issues,"The United Methodist Church, one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S., will officially undergo a schism in the coming months, ending a years-long internal disagreement over LGBTQ+ issues.

What are the details?

On Thursday, organizers of the Global Methodist Church — a more conservative Methodist denomination that favors a traditional view of marriage and opposes the ordination of LGBT clergy — announced a formal launch date of May 1, 2022.

The announcement came amid yet another General Conference postponement over COVID-19 pandemic fears and travel obstacles. With the next meeting pushed back until 2024, conservative United Methodists decided they could not wait for the next meeting before launching the new denomination.

""Many United Methodists have grown impatient with a denomination clearly struggling to function effectively at the general church level,"" said Rev. Keith Boyette, chairman of the Transitional Leadership Council that has been guiding the creation of the new denomination over the past year.

""Theologically conservative local churches and annual conferences want to be free of divisive and destructive debates and to have the freedom to move forward together. We are confident many existing congregations will join the new Global Methodist Church in waves over the next few years, and new church plants will sprout up as faithful members exit the UM Church and coalesce into new congregations,"" he added.

Delegates were supposed to vote on an agreed-upon separation plan at the General Conference, called the ""Protocol of Reconciliation and Grace through Separation.""

The plan, often referred to as simply the Protocol, stipulates that the UMC would pay the new denomination $25 million over the next four years to cover start-up costs and that disaffiliating congregations would be allowed to join the GMC ""with all of their property and assets intact.""

With the conference delayed and the Protocol not yet adopted, those provisions have not been approved.

What's the background?

According to Boyette and his leadership council, the hastened split was necessary in order to provide a place to land for those Methodist congregations or individuals who have already decided to leave the UMC or were planning to in the coming months.

Earlier this week, Frazer United Methodist Church, a Methodist megachurch in Alabama, announced it had voted to leave the UMC.

The mainline denomination's long-anticipated schism was first sparked in 2019 after delegates to the General Conference voted 438-384 to approve the so-called Traditional Plan, which strengthened the church’s bans on the ordination and marriage of LGBTQ United Methodists.

Most U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan in favor of LGBTQ-friendly options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives aligned with delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines, the Associated Press reported.

UPenn swimmers write open letter calling for Ivy League to embrace USA Swimming's new transgender policy,"Athletes on the University of Pennsylvania women's swimming and diving team have put out an open letter to UPenn and the Ivy League asking them to follow the new transgender guidelines issued by USA Swimming and to refrain from taking legal action against the NCAA.

Sixteen athletes, led by three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar, published the open letter Thursday morning asking the school and the Ivy League ""to support us as biological women."" According to Swimming World, the letter was written in response to a statement by several members of UPenn's swim team in support of Lia Thomas, a male who identifies as female.

Hogshead-Makar, a civil rights lawyer and CEO of Champion Women, is an advocate for women's rights and has fought for equal opportunity for women in sports. She has criticized policies pushing for the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports, noting that biological men have unfair advantages when competing against women.

The letter praised new ""Athlete Inclusion Procedures"" released by USA Swimming on Tuesday, guidelines for including transgender athletes in women's sports that acknowledge the ""competitive difference in the male and female categories and the disadvantages this presents in elite head-to-head competition.""

“Tuesday, USA Swimming released new ‘Athlete Inclusion Procedures’ shortly after the NCAA acknowledged that each sport should determine how fairness and inclusion were to be accomplished,” the letter states. “In particular, we appreciate USAS Guideline’s guiding purpose, to ensure that transgender women competing in the Female competition category 'do not have an unfair advantage over their cisgender Female competitors in Elite Events.'""

“We fully support Lia Thomas in her decision to affirm her gender identity and to transition from a man to a woman. Lia has every right to live her life authentically,"" the letter continues.

“However, we also recognize that when it comes to sports competition, the biology of sex is a separate issue from someone’s gender identity.”

The swim team members write that as a biological male, Thomas has an ""unfair advantage"" over female competitors and that some women have missed opportunities as a result.

“The Penn Women’s Swimming Team has over 40 women, but only 18 of us are chosen to compete in the end-of-year culmination of our work: the Ivy Championships,” they write.

“Most important to us is that Lia’s inclusion with unfair biological advantages means that we have lost competitive opportunities. Some of us have lost records. But even those that swim different events than Lia or were not in contention to make the Ivy Championships, we stand by our teammates who have lost out.

“It has often felt like Penn, our school, our league, and the NCAA did not support us.”

The letter says these athletes have been threatened with losing job offers or getting kicked off the team for speaking out.

""When media have tried to reach out to us, these journalists have been told that the coaches and athletes were prohibited from talking to them,"" the letter states. ""We support Lia’s mental health, and we ask Penn and the Ivy League to support ours as well.""

The women emphasized that Thomas is welcome to train with them and that they want to find a place for transgender athletes to compete against others fairly.

""However, sport is competitive by definition, and Lia’s wins, records, and honors should not come at our expense, the women who have worked their entire lives to earn a spot on the Penn Women’s Swimming Team,"" they write.

The debate over how to include transgender athletes in sports at both the high school and collegiate levels has ignited national controversy. Some states have taken action to prohibit gender dysphoric males from competing against women with ""Fairness in Women's Sports"" bills. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) has been credited with proposing the strongest version of this legislation, which would prohibit any student at a state school from joining a sports team that does not match his or her biological sex.

Advocates for LGBT Americans say it is unfair and discriminatory to prohibit student athletes from expressing themselves by competing on the teams with which they identify.

But female athletes have pushed back, arguing that men have natural advantages that make them stronger and faster than women, advantages that do not go away with hormone therapy or because a male identifies as female.

For example, Ainsley Erzen, a high school athlete who won the girls' 800-meter high school national championship in track, wrote in a recent op-ed that her record-breaking accomplishments for women would be a poor performance for a male athlete. Ainsley Erzen is the daughter of BlazeTV editor Todd Erzen of the ""Steve Deace Show.""

""My time of 2:06.52, the time that made me the fastest Iowa high school female 800 runner of all time, the time that earned me the title of national champion, was easily beat by 85 high school boys at the 2021 Iowa high school state track meet alone. Eighty-five. Just in our small state of Iowa.,"" Erzen wrote for the Des Moines Register.

""The results of the 2021 Drake Relays proved to be no different, as the last male runner came through the line in a time of 2:03. That same year, a time of 2:13 was enough to make me the 800-meter Drake champion. The slowest boy was easily 10 seconds faster than the first-place girl.""

Erzen goes on to argue that the different standards set for male and female competitions are all the evidence needed to show that biological differences matter and that women need to be protected from unfair competition.

For the members of the UPenn swim team who wrote the letter, the proof is in Lia Thomas' dominant performance against female competitors.



The new USA Swimming transgender policy requires athletes to provide evidence ""that the prior physical development of the athlete as a male, as mitigated by any medical intervention, does not give the athlete a competitive advantage over the athlete’s cisgender female competitors.""

Transgender competitors must also show evidence ""that the concentration of testosterone in the athlete’s serum has been less than 5 nmol/L (as measured by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) continuously for a period of at least thirty-six (36) months before the date of application.""

The policy is only applicable to athlete members of USA Swimming.

It was implemented after the NCAA announced last month that the governing bodies of each sport would be given the authority to determine athlete eligibility, including polices on the inclusion of transgender athletes.

USA Today includes transgender woman among 'Women of the Year',"Admiral Rachel Levine has been named among USA Today's ""Women of the Year,"" a distinction that flies in the face of biological reality because Levine is actually a man.

""Rachel Levine is one of USA TODAY’s Women of the Year, a recognition of women across the country who have made a significant impact,"" the noted.

Levine serves as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health and as the head of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

A press release last year heralded Levine as the ""first openly transgender four-star officer across any of the eight uniformed services of the United States"" and the ""first-ever female four-star admiral"" of the USPHS.

Levine was one of the individuals included during a panel last week billed as ""A Conversation With HHS Women Leaders to Celebrate Women's History Month.""

Transgenderism continues to represent a topic of intense cultural contention, particularly on the issue of whether biological men who identify as women should be allowed to play women's sports.

Transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas has stoked controversy by racking up wins while competing against female swimmers.

""The very simple answer is that I’m not a man,"" Thomas said, according to Sports Illustrated. ""I'm a woman, so I belong on the women’s team. Trans people deserve that same respect every other athlete gets.""

Valentina Sampaio is Sports Illustrated's first transgender model,"Valentina Sampaio has become the first transgender model to be featured in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue.

Sampaio, who was born in a ""humble fishing village in northern Brazil,"" is one of eight Sports Illustrated Rookies in this year's swimsuit edition. Sampaio's photoshoot was done on Scrub Island in the British Virgin Islands.

""I was so surprised,"" Sampaio told ""Good Morning America."" ""It means a lot, not just for myself but for all the LGBTQ+ community.""

""What unites us as humans is that we all share the common desire to be accepted and loved for who we are,"" the 23-year-old Sampaio said. ""Thank you SI for seeing and respecting me as I truly am. For understanding that more than anything, I am human. Thank you for supporting me in continuing to spread a message of love, compassion and unity for ALL.""

""To come from a space of fear and marginalization, to now being included in one of the most iconic magazines that truly embraces and celebrates diversity — it is life changing,"" Sampaio toldPeople magazine. ""I honor the challenges of those who have paved the way for me directly or indirectly. They have made where I am today possible. I am committed to keep growing and push boundaries, so that I can in some way, pave the path for others. We are here, we always have been here and we always will be.""



""We are deeply moved that Valentina was willing to put her trust in us and we didn't think twice about wanting to amplify her voice, her message and give her a platform to advocate from on behalf of her personal aspirations and the trans community,"" MJ Day, editor of the SI Swim Issue, said.



""Valentina has been on our radar for some time now and when we finally met face to face it became apparent that besides her obvious beauty, she is an impassioned activist, a true pioneer for the LGBT+ community and just simply embodies the well-rounded woman we are proud to have represent SI Swimsuit across our platforms,"" Day added.

In 2017, Sampaio became the first transgender model to appear on the cover of a Vogue edition in 2017. Sampaio was also Victoria's Secret's first transgender model in 2019.

Last year, model Halima Aden became the first woman to appear in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue wearing a burkini and traditional hijab.

‘Veggie Tales’ creator says it's ‘inevitable’ that Christian kids’ shows will be forced to address LGBTQ themes,"Phil Vischer, co-creator of hit series, ""Veggie Tales,"" says that it's only a matter of time before Christian content creators will have to begin addressing LGBTQ issues from a biblical perspective on their shows.

What are the details?

In an interview with the Christian Post, Vischer said that because children are being inundated with LGBTQ-friendly programming in films and on television, it is important to feature both sides of the topic.

""Parents are definitely going to have to deal with a growing LGBT presence in children's media,"" he said. ""It's going to show up more and more as the world has decided that LGBT issues are in the same categories as race and civil rights issues. So to say you shouldn't have a same-sex couple on 'Sesame Street' is the equivalent of saying you shouldn't have a black couple on 'Sesame Street.'""

Addressing a recent episode of PBS kids' show ""Arthur,"" in which a main character in the cartoon marries his same-sex partner, Vischer explained that the episode was a ""shot heard through the Christian parenting world.""

""The most striking thing about that episode of 'Arthur' wasn't that they thought it was time to introduce kids to a gay marriage,"" he explained. ""It was the reaction of all the kids on the show. None of them asked questions about why two men were getting married. Their reaction was 'Oh, OK! Great!'""

Vischer said the most problematic component was not that it was featured, but that it wasn't even explained as a notion to question.

""It's such a strong message of, 'Well, kids, of course you're fine with gay marriage, because there's nothing to question about it,'"" he said. ""That's a little more concerning.""

Vischer added that it will be just a ""matter of time"" before Christian creators will have to address the issue, which is virtually uncharted territory in Christian kids' programming.

""[R]ight now, I think it would be difficult for a couple of reasons,"" he said. ""First: the nuance of how to treat LGBT issues isn't agreed upon within the Church. Secondly, some parents may want to have that talk with their kids. It's tricky because it's so divisive. It would be hard to do it in a way that works and matches everyone's expectations.""

What will Vischer do?

As for Vischer, he's in no rush to produce such content, for fear of doing it ""poorly.""

""It's still so controversial,"" he admitted. ""I'm not sure what I would add that would be helpful enough in the conversation that it's worth the number of people I could offend.""

Vischer, however, refuses to cave to media pressure despite rapid changes to mainstream programming.

""If I get pressure from Hollywood to show two men getting married because we've all decided it's right and correct, my pushback is 'No, I won't.' Because that's not what I believe is best for kids. It's more about what we show as normal rather than explicitly showing something and saying, 'That's wrong.' I'm portraying the positive rather than the negative,"" he insisted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/veggie-tales-creator-christian-kids-shows-lgbtq-themes,2019-08-19
"VIDEO: Chris Rock, Steve Martin jab Democratic Party, LA homeless problem at Oscars","Although the Academy Awards went on without a host for the second year in a row, comedians Chris Rock and Steve Martin opened the awards show by taking jabs at the Democratic Party and the homeless problem in Los Angeles.

Mocking the Iowa caucus disaster, Martin quipped, ""Now, a couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidentally read out the wrong name — and it was nobody's fault — but it's guaranteed that won't happen this year because the Academy has switched to the new Iowa Caucus App. But what a night!""

The comedians then immediately highlighted the homeless problem plaguing Los Angeles — and how Hollywood ignores it.

""I don't know, Steve. I'm a little conflicted, you know? I was driving here tonight, seeing the terrible homeless problem in L.A.—"" Rock said.

""Thank you, Chris! So many stars!"" Martin interjected.

Rock and Martin even made light of the reason why the Oscars went without a host, calling their opening monologue an ""incredible demotion.""

""They don't really have hosts anymore, why is that?"" Martin asked.

Rock responded, ""Twitter! Everybody's got an embarrassing tweet somewhere. I know I do!""

Of course, the comedians were referring to the incident that forced Kevin Hart to step down from hosting last year's award ceremony.

"Shocking video shows 2 young children being paraded around at Miami drag show while the crowd cheers, throws money at them​","A disturbing video recently surfaced on social media appearing to show two young children being paraded around onstage at a drag club in Miami.

What are the details?

In the video, posted to Instagram last week, controversial political personality Angela Stanton-King looks on in horror as the two preteen kids walk alongside a man dressed as a woman as he directs them to pose for the audience and collect money.

""Why in the hell do these people got these f***ing little bitty-ass kids at this f***ing drag show, y'all?"" Stanton-King asked at the start of the video.

""It is 11:40 at night, these people have children in a f***ing drag show,"" she went on to say, mistakenly claiming the location to be Los Angeles. She corrected herself in the post's caption — as well as in a lengthier follow-up video — saying the scene was filmed at Palace, a popular LGBT nightclub in Miami.

The camera then pans to the stage where the two young blonde-haired children wearing dresses are seen strutting onstage as the drag queen says, ""Get your money, girls.""

(Warning: The following video contains vulgar language and graphic content some viewers may find disturbing)

""Telling her 'get her f***ing money,'"" the woman adds. ""Look at this f***ing bulls**t, look at this at this bulls**t now. Look! Look! They're giving them f***ing money now, little girls, now.""



""[They're] throwing money at these little girls,"" she reports in shock and displeasure.

What else?

At one point, the drag queen took one of the children by the hand and directed them to stand on his left side. He then showed both of the children how to pose correctly before they all continued down the walkway and turned to face the crowd.

He then told the children to stoop down and pick up the cash as the crowd continued to throw money at their feet.

""Hold on, that's a twenty, give me that,"" the drag queen said to one of the children as he grabbed the money and stuffed it into his shirt. Moments later, he would return it to the child, saying, ""Your first twenty as a drag queen means you've made it.""

""Got them picking f***ing money off the floor like they're f***ing strippers or some s**t, now,"" Stanton-King added.

TheBlaze reached out to the Palace to confirm certain details about the event, but was unable to obtain a response before publication.

Anything else?

Stanton-King, an author and former congressional candidate in Georgia, reportedly angered progressives this year when she vowed not to bow to the societal pressure pushing her to let her son undergo a gender transition.

The former member of President Donald Trump's coalition of black supporters also delivered a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year, during which she reportedly called for investigation into some claims made by QAnon conspiracists.

The video is reminiscent of another shocking video posted on TikTok last year that showed a drag queen suggestively dancing in front of a young girl while adults in the room clapped and cheered him on.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-drag-show-kids-miami,2021-04-19
Creator of popular 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video games announces retirement after woke mob goes after him for donating to Republicans,"The creator of a popular video game series announced his retirement this week after a woke cancel culture mob attacked him for several political donations he made to public officials viewed as hostile toward LGBT people.

Scott Cawthon, who made the hit indie horror game ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and its sequels, announced on his website that he will be retiring from the series, handing it over to a different video game developer while he spends more time with his family.

""I've had a blessed, fulfilling, and rich career,"" Cawthon wrote. ""I've been shown great kindness and I've tried to show great kindness in return. I've tried to make some good games (let the debate ensue), and I've witnessed the creation of possibly the most creative and talented fanbase on the planet.""

""But here on the seventh anniversary of the first game's trailer, as I realize that I was in my mid-30s when I created the series and now I'm approaching my mid-40s, I realize that I miss a lot of things that I got to focus on before FNAF became such a success,"" he continued. ""I miss making games for my kids, I miss doing it just for fun, and I missing making rpgs even though I stink at it. All of this is to say that I am retiring. I have been shown tremendous love and support over this last week, a lot of which has come from the LGBTQ community. The kindness shown to me has been surreal.""

While Cawthon's statement doesn't mention the controversy over his political donations, last weekend he was harshly criticized on Reddit and Twitter for making several financial contributions to various politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), former President Donald Trump, and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. All together, Cawthon made over $42,000 in campaign contributions to mostly Republican candidatesm and as a result he was accused of being racist and anti-LGBT.

On Saturday, before announcing his retirement, he directly addressed his critics in a Reddit post and refused to apologize for being a Christian, a Republican, and someone who has always treated all people fairly and equally no matter who they are.

To say that the last few days have been surreal would be an understatement. I've debated greatly how best to address this, including not addressing it at all, but with so many people from the LGBT community in the fanbase that I love, that's not an option. I'd like to think that the last seven years would have given me the benefit of the doubt in regards to how I try to treat people, but there I was, trending on twitter for being a homophobe, getting doxed, with people threatening to come to my house. My wife is six weeks pregnant and she spent last night in fear because of what was being said online. She has already been struggling with her pregnancy so seeing her so afraid really scared me. All this because I exercised my right, and my duty, as an American citizen, to vote for and support the candidates who I felt could best run the country, for everyone, and that's something that I won't apologize for.



For those who took the time to look, you saw that the candidates I supported included men, women, white people, black people, republicans, and democrats. I supported Kimberly Klacik in Baltimore because I believed that she really cared for the African American community there and wanted to pull them out of poverty. I believed she could have really make a difference in a time when so many black communities were struggling. She lost, unfortunately. I supported Tulsi Gabbard, a democrat, even though I disagreed with her on several issues, because I felt she would have been a good and fair president. And yes, I supported President Trump, because I felt he was the best man to fuel a strong economy and stand up to America's enemies abroad, of which there are many. Even if there were candidates who had better things to say to the LGBT community directly, and bigger promises to make, I believed that their stances on other issues would have ended up doing much greater harm to those communities than good. All of this explanation, I fear, is wasted, as people don't want to discuss with one another anymore; they want endless apologies and submission. People who are expecting those from me will get neither.

Cawthon said that if he gets canceled for his views, he would be at peace with it. ""I don't do this for the money anymore; I do it because I enjoy it,"" he wrote.

""If people think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get cancelled and retire. I would accept that. I've had a fulfilling career. Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value to begin with.""

In the post confirming his retirement, Cawthon explained that the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" series would be handed off to ""someone of my choosing, and someone that I trust.""

""I have SIX kids now (although one of them is currently the size of a blueberry.) I love them dearly; they are my whole world and my whole universe,"" he said. ""I want to focus my attention on them, focus on protecting them, and spend my time making things for them. I only ask that my fanbase respect my decision.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-game-creator-retirement-donations-to-republicans,2021-06-18
"VIDEO: Lesbian delivers scathing takedown of 'ridiculously woke left,' announces she's 'officially leaving' the 'hive-mind cult'","Arielle Scarcella — a lesbian activist and popular, longtime YouTuber — has had it with the ""insane, progressive left"" and announced on a video Friday that she's saying goodbye to it for good.

""Hi, I'm Arielle, I'm a lesbian, and I don't think gender is a social construct. I don't think cis-straight white men are evil. I don't believe that genital preferences are transphobic or that there are 97 genders,"" she says in a rat-a-tat pace as the eye-opening clip commences.

""I don't think that male sex offenders belong in women's prisons. I don't think it's normal for people to be praised for walking around with shirts that say, 'Kill TERFs,'"" Scarcella adds, referencing the acronym for ""trans-exclusionary radical feminist"" — a verbal kill shot for feminists who don't buy into the transgender agenda. ""I don't think like these people, and I no longer want to be associated with them. I've reached peak LGBT; this is my coming out video.""

What's immediately striking is how, um, conservative she sounds pretty much all the way through — which is not lost on Scarcella in the least.

""Some of you have noticed this change coming onto my channel within the past few years as I've gotten what some people would say more conservative,"" she later offers. ""And yeah, I have, haven't I?""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The takedown



""Never in my life have I been more canceled, tortured, tormented, harassed than by members of my own community,"" Scarcella explains. ""Never have I witnessed literal mentally ill individuals who are latching themselves on to the LGBTQ community without actually being LGBT for the sake of oppression points, external validation, and sympathy. Never have I seen such disrespect from younger LGBT people to the older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender advocates who have been paving the way for us for longer than we've all been alive. Never have I seen people that use the word 'bigot' so frequently and not see the hypocrisy and irony in themselves saying it.""

She then confesses, ""I'm coming out. I am officially leaving the left.""

The rant intensifies

Scarcella then offers examples of why she's decided to take this momentous step:

""When it's gotten to the point where I can no longer even list 'LGBT' or 'women empowerment' in my Instagram and Twitter bios without people thinking I'm part of this ridiculously woke cult; when we have rules and a pecking order of who's able to speak and how long, even about their own bodies and experiences; when we have children drag queens and think it's OK for them to perform sexually for adults ..."" she says, referencing pre-pubescent drag queen Desmond is Amazing.

Scarcella also noted a story about a transgender man who gave birth after a sperm donation from transgender woman, saying it makes ""absolutely no sense"" and does ""nothing for our movement or for people understanding us.""

She also ripped a Huffington Post story about a bearded transgender woman and mocked that the subject was ""deemed a speaker for lesbians"" before noting her exasperation when ""people say that 'straight black men are the white men of black people,' and I know what they mean, I no longer wish to be a part of this.""

'Ridiculously intolerant while preaching love'

In conclusion, Scarcella blasted the woke left as ""ridiculously intolerant while preaching love"" and noted its bald-faced pattern showing that ""anyone who goes against the grain and thinks for themselves is immediately outcast — that's not a community, that's a hive mind cult ... I no longer want to be associated with the ridiculously woke left.""

VIDEO: Middle school teacher berates 'straight jerk' student apparently over his LBGTQ objection. Teacher pays big price for her tirade.,"A Missouri middle school teacher is no longer employed by Springfield Public Schools after a video surfaced showing her berating a male student as a ""straight jerk,"" ""butthead,"" and ""weasel,"" apparently over his LBGTQ objection, the Springfield News-Leader reported.

What are the details?

Cellphone video of the May 27 incident begins with the unnamed teacher angrily addressing the student, apparently after he interpreted the unicorn cupcakes she brought to the Pershing Middle School classroom for the last day of class as pro-LBGTQ, the paper said.

Indeed, the LGBTQ community has adopted the mythical animal as a symbol of sorts in recent years.

The clip begins with the teacher saying, ""Just 'cause I support another thing doesn't mean I don't support straight people, too. Just 'cause I'm Mexican doesn't mean I don't also support black people or Irish people or ignorant people.""

As the teacher utters ""ignorant people,"" she gestures toward the male student in question, who responds that he believed he was being ""ignored"" by the teacher.

""Would you like a special unicorn cupcake for being straight, jerk?"" the teacher yells at the student, who yells back, ""Yes!""

Have a 'straight jerk cupcake'!

With that, the teacher walks toward the back of the class and presents the student with what she called a ""straight jerk cupcake"" and called him a ""pill.""

""I'm just trying to be annoying,"" the student tells the teacher, who yells back, ""You are annoying! You are very successful, congratulations!""

On her walk back to the front of the classroom, the teacher exclaims, ""What a dip!""

The student is heard asking the teacher what she said, and she replies, ""A dip! Like a dipstick, a butthead, a weasel, a pain in my butt!""

By the end of the clip, the teacher says she wanted to give students something before they leave for the summer and says, ""Everybody is welcome to a unicorn cupcake.""

“Straight Jerk!"" – Teacher Berates Straight Kids for demanding Unicorn Cupcakes. youtu.be

The paper said the video apparently was recorded by a student sitting in the middle of the classroom, and the teacher did not appear to know she was being recorded.

What did the school district have to say?

Stephen Hall, the district's chief communications officer, told the News-Leader a Pershing parent informed the district about the incident and provided the video within 24 hours of the incident taking place — and that an investigation began ""immediately.""

""The video includes comments that do not meet the professional standards for educators,"" Hall told the paper. ""They are inappropriate and inexcusable. As a result of the district's internal investigation, SPS has taken appropriate disciplinary actions. While details of personnel matters must remain confidential, our response has followed the guidelines outlined by our board policy and reflects the district's zero-tolerance for this type of conduct.""

Hall added to the News-Leader after gaining permission from the teacher that ""the employee will not be returning to SPS.""

He also told the paper that the issue was dealt with prior to the video being shared on social media in recent days.

State senator speaks out

Republican state Sen. Eric Burlison told the News-Leader Friday that the teacher on the video ""quit being the teacher she was hired to be and became an advocate for her own personal views. As she promoted her personal beliefs in the classroom, she lost her objectivity in a conversation with one of her students, who pushed back on these ideas. Crossing the line even further, she is said to have then called the young man many demeaning and derogatory names.""

The paper added that Springfield residents and those outside the area who have accused the school district of training employees on critical race theory as part of equity and diversity efforts have shared the video.

Burlison also told the News-Leader that the incident along with ""reports of critical race theory being taught and other extreme views that don't belong in the classroom give me pause to consider if the education bureaucracy in our state has lost its focus on its true purpose.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-teacher-berates-straight-jerk-student,2021-06-14
Video: Transgender woman completely loses it on store clerk after clerk says ‘sir’ instead of ‘ma’am’,"A transgender woman became visibly enraged after a store worker and a customer reportedly said ""sir"" instead of ""ma'am"" when addressing her, according to video obtained by the Daily Mail.

What are the details?

The incident reportedly took place at a GameStop in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The transgender woman had apparently purchased an item at the store's front counter when the male cashier reportedly called the transgender woman ""sir"" instead of her apparent preferred term, ""ma'am.""

The unidentified woman then went on to demand her money back in a profane rant.

""I don't want credit, you're going to give me my f***ing money back,"" she swore.

Another customer, clearly bothered by the woman's language, interjected and asked that she refrain from using such language — also calling the transgender woman ""sir,"" further enraging her.

The customer can be heard saying, ""Excuse me sir, there is a young man in here you need to watch your mouth. I can call the police if you would like me to. You need to settle down.""

The transgender woman shot back, shouting, ""Excuse me — it is ma'am! It is ma'am!"" and telling the customer to mind her own business.

At one point in the video, the transgender woman suggests that she'll take the male clerk — who is much smaller than she is — outside to ""show him a sir.""

""Motherf***er, take it outside if you want to call me sir again,"" the transgender woman swore. ""I will show you a f***ing sir.""

The transgender woman — still swearing — can be seen stomping toward the front exit of the store, kicking over a rack of merchandise and grunting loudly on her way.

What happened next?

Then the transgender woman turns on her heels and approaches the counter again, obviously not finished with her business.

Demanding the store's corporate telephone number to file a complaint, the transgender woman continued to shout about being repeatedly misgendered in the store by both the employee and the customer.

'Stop calling me a man, because, quite clearly, I am not!' she shouts.

The employee, who appeared to be flabbergasted by the entire incident, apologized profusely — but the transgender woman was having none of the clerk's apology.

"Village People say President Trump has been 'respectful' of their songs, has every right to play them at rallies — and leftists go nuclear","The Village People's iconic disco-era tune ""Macho Man"" blasted through the speakers at a stadium as President Donald Trump made his entrance during a visit to India earlier this week — and many among the 100,000-plus in attendance cheered, danced, and appeared quite ecstatic:

But left-wing fans of the Village People? They're not happy in the least.

What's going on?

Seems the Village People have been getting an earful from folks who are hoppin' mad that the group's music is played at Trump rallies.

So the Village People on their Facebook page sent a message to their fans addressing the issue:

""We have received numerous requests demanding that we prevent or ban President Donald Trump's use of our songs, particularly 'Y.M.C.A.' and 'Macho Man,'"" the group's post began. ""With the latest use of 'Macho Man' in India, we are being inundated and can no longer remain silent.""

The Village People went on to say that since their music ""is not being used for a specific endorsement, the president's use is 'perfect[ly]' legal"" and that Trump ""has remained respectful in his use of our songs and has not crossed the line.""

The group added that ""if he or any other candidate were to use any of our songs in a manner that would suggest our endorsement, or in a promotional advertisement, that would cross the line.""

""Like millions of Village People fans worldwide, the president and his supporters have shown a genuine like for our music,"" the Village People concluded. ""Our music is all-inclusive and certainly everyone is entitled to do the YMCA dance, regardless of their political affiliation. Having said that, we certainly don't endorse his use as we'd prefer our music be kept out of politics.""

Let the backlash begin

As you might expect, leftists flipped out at the Village People over their position on the issue:

""How is Trump, who is ENDORSED by the GOP, not an endorsement of your music being used by a specific party? Really disappointed in the band for taking this stance.""

""You've lost the f***ing plot. Where is your sense of self-respect?""

""This should be a no-brainer: simply by having your material as accompaniment to Trump's events, whether it's playing under his entrance onstage or used to get the crowds going, it is by definition promotional. You're being disingenuous when you deny the obvious: the audience is going to associate what they hear with what they see, and pretending it's all a non-partisan use of your songs is willful blindness. This is an administration directly and proudly dedicated to defeating inclusiveness in this country, so it's shameful that your music, which has always promoted tolerance and acceptance, should be used as a rallying cry to bludgeon those who believe in the sanctity of 'all men created equal.' But perhaps it's my bad: I keep forgetting that artistry doesn't necessarily come equipped with integrity.""

""You can choose to distance yourself from the perception that you are endorsing Trump by requesting that he no longer use it, as other artists have already done. Considering the administration's actions toward the LGBT community, I would think you would want to make a bolder statement than this. Enjoy those royalties.""

""Cop out.""

""Seriously? What the actual f*** guys. You're better than this.""

""Disappointing...wonder how much you got paid and how much you needed the money...let's face it, that's what it boiled down to...Trump is the biggest disgrace this country has ever seen, and you fed right into it.""

""Whatever helps you sleep at night. Gross.""

""Ugh. No.""

But a cursory look at the comments the group received showed that the majority were positive, thanking the Village People for taking the high road in an entertainment universe full of political venom. Here's one of the more humorous takes:

Virginia kindergarten students celebrate transgender kids on Read Across America Day,"Kindergarten students at a Virginia elementary school recognized transgender kids last week during the annual Read Across America Day, the Washington Post reported.

Children at Ashlawn Elementary School in Arlington listened as transgender advocate Sarah McBride of the Human Rights Campaign read ""I Am Jazz,"" a book about a transgender girl.

""I have a girl brain but a boy body. This is called transgender. I was born this way,"" McBride read to dozens of students on Thursday.

Read Across America Day, sponsored by the National Education Association, is meant to help motivate children to read. This was the first year that the group has partnered with LGBT advocacy group HRC.

What does the district say about discussing LGBT issues with kids?

Arlington County Public Schools don't have a specific curriculum for teaching sexual orientation or gender identity, according to Ashlawn kindergarten teacher Jaim Foster.

Foster, who is gay, told the Post that he talks to his students about his experiences with his spouse and stocks his classroom with books, including, ""Heather Has Two Mommies"" and ""My Princess Boy.""

""We talk about it all the time, in one way or another, of accepting families and differences,"" Foster said.

He also reflected on how things have changed across the nation in recent years.

Foster said he was an LGBT advocate in college, but he was discouraged from being an openly gay teacher when he started teaching nearly 20 years ago.

""I was told I had to stop being that advocate, and I had to go back into the closet because it wasn't really safe,"" he told the Post. ""You could be fired.""

What else did McBride say to the children?

After reading the book, McBride told the kids that she was like the transgender girl in the story.

""I'm like Jazz,"" she reportedly said. "" When I was born, the doctors and my parents, they all thought that I was a boy.""

""Why?"" one girl asked.

""Because society, people around them told them that was the case,"" McBride said. ""It took me getting a little bit older to be able to say that in my heart and in my mind, I knew I was really a girl.""

The kids started talking about hair length.

""Can some girls have short hair?"" McBride asked. ""And can some boys have long hair?""

The kids agreed that boys and girls can have long or short hair.

""Anyone can be anything,"" another girl said.

What else?

McBride said she wanted to send a message of tolerance on Read Across America Day.

""For young people, being kind and being respectful is quite simple,"" she said. ""LGBTQ young people are their classmates, their friends. They may be LGBTQ themselves. And so, this just makes sense. No one's ever too young to learn to be nice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-kindergarten-students-transgender-reading,2019-03-04
"Walmart's woke Walton family funneling millions into LGBT activist causes, drag shows for kids, and DEI programs","Inheritors of Walmart founder Sam Walton's fortune have poured millions of dollars into LGBT activist organizations in Arkansas, helping to bankroll a number of propaganda events ranging from drag shows and story hours for kids to so-called ""education"" programs for sexually-confused youths.

The Waltons stocking kids' transition closets

In a recent report, Heritage Foundation research associate Gillian Richards scrutinized some of the causes that second- and third-generation beneficiaries of the Walmart patriarch's wealth have patronized.

In June 2021, the Alice W. Walton Foundation and Olivia and Tom Walton, through the Walton Family Foundation, launched the Arkansas LGBTQ+ Advancement Fund.

Heather Larkin, president of the Arkansas Community Foundation, stated that this $1 million fund, which in turn confers grants of up to $150,000 to ""LGBTQ-serving"" nonprofits throughout the state, helps ensure that activist groups can ""expand their impact on communities and help Arkansans pull together to build a more welcoming and supportive environment for us all.""



Richards noted that the Equality Crew is one beneficiary of the Waltons' advancement fund.

This particular group established Arkansas' confidential ""Affirming Teacher and School Staff Database"" ahead of the 2021-22 school year so that confused children could connect with teachers who would ""affirm"" their amorphous adolescent and teen sexual identities.

According to Richards, the Equality Crew hosted an event at the Walton Arts Center, which had a segment titled ""Kids Zone,"" featuring a ""drag story time for younger children."" In another segment, titled ""Teen Zone,"" grade school students were treated to a ""DJ, local band, and TWO drag shows.""

In another Equality Crew event that was set to take place at a public library, youth were invited to get ""clothing from The Transition Closet"" and to take part in a ""teens-only dance party.""

The Transition Closet happens to be another Walton-funded nonprofit that provides ""gender-affirming clothing and accessories for transgender and non-binary Arkansans.""

According to the organizers, the Equality Crew event was ultimately cancelled due to an ""increasing number of violent and disruptive attacks on parents, children, and organizers seeking to serve members of the LGBTQ+ community.""

Richards reported that the Walton Family Foundation and the Walmart Foundation are both also leading sponsors of Northwest Arkansas Equality, an activist nonprofit based in Fayetteville.



According to the group's website, ""Northwest Arkansas Equality's mission is to provide programs, education, and advocacy to serve, connect, and empower the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.""

The NAE puts on various drag events.

The NAE proudly claims to have targeted kids with a number of its events, including drag brunches and ""children's storytimes."" Some of the group's events featured so-called celebrities like drag queens Brian Michael Firkus (""Trixie Mattel""), Darius Jeremy Pierce (""Shangela""), and Ryan Taylor (""Trinity Taylor"").

The Walmart Foundation has been giving the NAE money since at least 2007 and has been filling the group's coffers with the help of the Waltons as recently as 2020.

In addition to bankrolling LGBT groups, the Waltons have involved themselves directly in political battles regarding the advancement of the transgender agenda in Arkansas.

In 2021, Alice Walton, Tom Walton, and the Walton Family Foundation fought Arkansas' ""Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act"" and failed. The proposed legislation passed despite a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

The act, now law, bans doctors from medically mutilating children and teens for the purposes of so-called ""gender transition.""

Woke capital

The Capital Research Center, an American conservative nonprofit focused on charity and philanthropy, previously detailed Walmart's long slide into woke philanthropy.

Sam Walton wrote ""that Wal-Mart really is not, and should not be, in the charity business,"" not the least because it would amount to the company being charitable with other people's money, particularly ""shareholders or our customers.""

Nevertheless, the Walmart Foundation, created by Walton in 1982, reportedly tripled its expenditures on philanthropic donations between 1999 and 2005.

While the foundation largely gave to right-leaning think tanks in the early 2000s, facing criticism over being too capitalistic, it ramped up its funding of progressive and liberal causes in the 2010s.

The CPC indicated that the foundation soon was giving millions to leftist and leftist-adjacent organizations such as the New Venture Fund, FSG Inc., the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the Meridian Institute, and others.

Soon, it was funneling cash into open-borders organizations like the National Immigration Forum and leftist identity groups like the Institute for Latino Progress.

Advocate, a gay activist publication, reported in 2016 that ""Walmart has made an imperfect but nonetheless remarkable turnaround on LGBT advocacy,"" trending from 14 out of a possible 100 on the Human Rights Campaign's so-called Corporate Equality Index to 90.

Now, just six years later, Walmart sits at first place on the index with a 100 CEI score, ahead of Amazon, ExxonMobil, and Apple.

In addition to donating to groups pushing open borders, amnesty for criminal noncitizens, bigger government, and drag shows for children, Walmart also jumped on the BLM bandwagon.

In June 2020, amidst the George Floyd riots, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced that the Walmart Foundation and Walmart were committing $100 million to create a new center on racial equity.

While financially backing and systematizing identity politics, Walmart also embraced critical race theory. City Journal reported in October 2021 that Walmart employees were told that the U.S. was a ""white supremacy system.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/walmarts-woke-walton-family-funneling-millions-into-lgbt-activist-causes,2022-11-30
Washington Supreme Court opens door to forcing religious organizations to hire LGBT individuals,"The Washington state Supreme Court reversed a lower court's decision this week regarding legal exemptions for religious employers, in a move that could open the door to forcing religious organizations to hire LGBT employees.

In the original ruling passed down more than two years ago, King County Superior Court Judge Karen Donohue dismissed a bisexual attorney's complaint against Seattle's Union Gospel Mission after the attorney, Matt Woods, sued the mission for discrimination when it refused to hire him upon learning of his sexuality.

The mission, Donohue ruled at the time, was acting within its rights because as a religious nonprofit it was exempt from the state's anti-discrimination law regarding one's sexual orientation. But now the state Supreme Court has reversed that ruling and ordered that the case return to the lower court, the Seattle Times reported.

Seattle Times reporter Sydney Brownstone was careful to note that while the court's ruling doesn't altogether strike down the religious employer exemption it ""questions whether that exemption applies to a staff attorney at a legal aid clinic."" The decision, she noted, ""could potentially open the door to more LGBTQ staffers working in social services at religious nonprofits.""

And because many of the state's social service programs are run by religious organizations, the ruling could have serious ripple effects far beyond just homeless shelters.

In response to the new development, Woods said he was relieved.

""To get the affirmation from the court that religious organizations don't have a right to blanket discriminate against LGBTQ people for who they are no matter what the job is a big relief,"" he said. ""Especially for members of my community that are so much more likely to experience discrimination in the workplace because of their race or gender identity.""

The mission, one of Seattle's largest homeless shelter and service organizations, declined to comment when contacted by the Times.



The Times report adds that ""local religious organizations have been undergoing a reckoning in recent years, as same-sex marriage has gained acceptance from the general public.""

Though not directly related to the case in Washington state, the ruling certainly represents the kind of legal challenges that could arise for religious organizations should the Equality Act pass both chambers of Congress and be signed into law.

The legislation, which passed in the House last month, may soon threaten punishment against individuals and organizations who still hold to traditional beliefs about marriage, gender identity, and sexual orientation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-supreme-court-lgbt-discrimination,2021-03-05
Washington state Supreme Court rules — again — that Christian florist broke anti-discrimination laws by not arranging flowers for gay wedding,"The Washington state Supreme Court has ruled that a florist violated anti-discrimination laws when she refused to create flower arrangements for a homosexual couple. This is the second time that the state Supreme Court has ruled against this woman in this case.

What is this case?

In 2013, Barronelle Stutzman, a great-grandmother and the owner of Arlene's Flowers in Richland refused to create flower arrangements for the same-sex wedding of a longtime customer. Stutzman argued that her actions were protected under the First Amendment. She said that making the arrangements, or even having her staff make them, would violate her Christian religious beliefs.

The Washington state attorney general and the American Civil Liberties Union sued Stutzman for discrimination in the Benton County Superior Court, and the state Supreme Court sided with the plaintiffs against Stutzman.

Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court sent this case back to the state Supreme Court in Washington.

The reason was because just a few weeks earlier the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled 7-2 in favor of Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado, who had refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. The high court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had shown ""clear and impermissible hostility"" toward the ""sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection."" However, the court specified that their ruling was narrow and focused only on Phillips' situation.



The U.S. Supreme Court justices said that because they had ruled in favor of Phillips, the Washington court should reconsider the Stutzman case.



On Thursday, the Washington Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Masterpiece case was not enough to change its mind.



In its decision, the court said that it had ""painstakingly reviewed the record for any sign of intolerance"" by either itself or the Benton County Superior Court. It also said that creating flower arrangements for a gay wedding did not ""violate [Stutzman's] right to free exercise under either the First Amendment or Article I section 11 because it is a neutral generally applicable law that serves our state government's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination in public accommodations.""

Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who led the case against Stutzman, called the ruling ""a complete and total victory for civil rights here in Washington state.""

What else?

"Barack Obama is a 'conservative' compared to today's 'radical' Democrats, says Washington Post","In an opinion column, Washington Post editor David Swerdlick argues that former president Barack Obama was often misunderstood by both the right and the left. Swerdlick notes that Obama's progressive critics were often turned off by his calm demeanor and gradualist approach to public policy and that those on the right unfairly attacked him as a ""radical.""



What both of them get wrong, the editor says, is that Obama was, at his core, a conservative:

Given the political climate, it's no surprise to see the party's base clamoring for something dramatic. But the contrast between Obama's steady approach and the seeming radicalism of his Democratic heirs can't just be chalked up to changing times. It's because the former president, going back at least to his 2004 Senate race, hasn't really occupied the left side of the ideological spectrum. He wasn't a Republican, obviously: He never professed a desire to starve the federal government, and he opposed the Iraq War, which the GOP overwhelmingly supported. But to the dismay of many on the left, and to the continuing disbelief of many on the right, Obama never dramatically departed from the approach of presidents who came before him.



There's a simple reason: Barack Obama is a conservative.

Swerdlick notes that, unlike contemporary Democrats, such as Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Julian Castro, the ""former president was skeptical of sweeping change, bullish on markets, sanguine about the use of military force, high on individual responsibility and faithful to a set of old-school personal values.""

How was Obama a conservative?

Swerdlick essentially says that although many of Obama's policies were not ""right-of-center,"" the process through which he governed was conservative:

But his constant search for consensus, for ways to bring Blue America and Red America together, sometimes led him to policies that used Republican means to achieve more liberal ends. The underlying concept for his signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, with its individual mandate, was devised by the right-wing Heritage Foundation and first implemented at the state level by Mitt Romney, then the Republican governor of Massachusetts. Obama wanted to protect Americans from the effects of a prolonged recession, so he agreed, in one of his defining votes as a senator, to a bailout of banks — and as president, he prioritized recovery over punishing bankers for their role in the financial crisis. In his first inaugural address, he affirmed the power of the free market ""to generate wealth and expand freedom.""

The Post editor also claims that Obama's personal qualities bolster his conservative bonafides:

He embraced respectability politics as a way to signal how conventional it was to have a first family of color: the many Norman Rockwell-worthy photo-ops, such as the 2009 portrait by Annie Leibovitz, a study in wholesome family living; their annual vacations on Martha's Vineyard, summer haven of the black elite; dialing back his storied ""cool,"" as when he displayed his stiff dance moves during an appearance on ""Ellen,"" laying claim to the mantle of the everyman dad.

Albeit, as Swerdlick states, ""Obama was a believer in big government"" who used his presidency to advance liberal ends. Among them: naming liberal Supreme Court justices, imposing limits on carbon emissions, ordering anti-discrimination protections for LGBT employees, and not enforcing deportation laws—all of this mainly through executive fiat.

This argument has been made—and refuted—before

Variations of the ""Obama is a conservative"" argument were made in 2008 and early in his presidency. New York Times columnist David Brooks famously claimed in 2009 that ""Obama sees himself as a Burkean"" and compared him to Edmund Burke, the 18th century Anglo-Irish statesman considered by many as the progenitor of modern conservatism.

However, conservative thought leaders scoffed at Brooks' claims of Obama's conservatism, which are not dissimilar from Post's contention. Jonah Goldberg refuted that for ""every sentence fragment the guy [Obama] has offered that could be construed as Burkean... I can think of whole speeches and books that are not.""

Conservative intellectual Yuval Levin argued, ""I cannot imagine how anyone observing the Obama administration could think the president a Burkean.""

Adding, ""No one said he has to be a Burkean. But those who say he is one are, I think, well off the mark.""

This writer's perspective

As I've publicly noted before, when I was younger, I volunteered for President Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Since then, my political views have matured. Still, I think the former president has many respectable qualities, especially as a family man, that people on both sides of the aisle can agree are decent and good.

That said, our country has two noble political traditions—liberalism and conservatism—that have been with us since the founding and are different, in many respects, than their variations elsewhere. President Obama fits squarely within the former, which originated with Thomas Paine. He arguably possesses a lower-case 'c' conservative temperament (in other words, an equanimous demeanor) that many political conservatives find appealing, but his public policy record is that of an American liberal.

Yes, Obama is certainly less radical than many of today's leading Democrats, but this does not make him a conservative.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington_post_obama_conservative,2019-11-24
Webster's Dictionary updates word definition after Dems attack Barrett for saying 'sexual preference',"Webster's Dictionary updated the definition of ""preference"" on Tuesday to include what liberals now claim as a fact: that the word, when used in relation to sex, is ""offensive"" to LGBT individuals.

What's the background?

Democrats launched a new attack against Amy Coney Barrett during her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday because she uttered the phrase ""sexual preference"" in the context of gay marriage.

Although the term is used widely by Democrats, progressives, and LGBT individuals, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) scolded Barrett for using the phrase to suggest that Barrett, who is a devout Christian, would support reversing gay marriage rights.

""Let me make clear, 'sexual preference' is an offensive and outdated term,"" Hirono said. ""It is used by the anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity. ... So if it is your view that sexual orientation is merely a 'preference,' as you noted, then the LGBTQ community should be rightly concerned whether you will uphold their constitutional right to marry.""

What did Webster's Dictionary do?

After Democrats attacked Barrett for using the phrase, Webster's Dictionary literally updated the definition of ""preference"" to include what Democrats now claim: that it is ""offensive"" when used in the context of sex.

Prior to the supposed outrage, Webster's Dictionary listed the fifth definition under ""preference"" to link to the term ""sexual preference,"" the universally used phrase to refer to those with whom a person chooses to have sex.

Now, the definition has been updated to claim the word is ""offensive."" In fact, Webster's Dictionary claims the phrase is ""widely"" believed to be considered offensive, despite the fact that it was not listed as offensive until after Barrett used it.

""The term preference as used to refer to sexual orientation is widely considered offensive in its implied suggestion that a person can choose who they are sexually or romantically attracted to,"" Webster's Dictionary claims.

Hirono's statement — that ""sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity"" and, therefore, is not a choice — is not backed by science.



In fact, there is no scientific evidence proving that genetic code concretely determines the people with whom someone engages in sex.

Still, Barrett, being ever so polite, apologized for using the phrase.

""I certainly didn't mean and would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense to the LGBTQ community,"" Barrett told Hirono. ""So, if I did, I greatly apologize for that. I simply meant to be referring to Obergefell's ruling with respect to same-sex marriage.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/websters-updates-preference-definition-barrett-attack,2020-10-14
Teachers' union president suggests criticism against her incites violence: 'It will lead to violence',"Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, suggested on Tuesday that criticism against her is an incitement of violence.

What is the background?

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is testing the waters for a 2024 presidential campaign.

Over the weekend, he said one of the most important issues facing Americans is education, and a central tenant of his campaign will be ""making sure we don’t teach our kids crap in schools.""

He then laid into AFT President Weingarten, who leads the second-largest teachers' union in the U.S.

""I get asked, 'Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?' The most dangerous person in the world is [ATF president] Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call,"" Pompeo told Semafor.

""If you ask, 'Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?' It would be the teachers' unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing,"" he continued.

""If our kids don’t grow up understanding America is an exceptional nation, we’re done,"" Pompeo declared. ""If they think it’s an oppressor class and an oppressed class, if they think the 1619 Project, and we were founded on a racist idea — if those are the things people entered the seventh grade deeply embedded in their understanding of America, it’s difficult to understand how Xi Jinping’s claim that America is in decline won’t prove true.""

How did Weingarten respond?



Weingarten responded by accusing Pompeo of fomenting ""hate and division,"" rhetoric she claimed will ""lead to violence.""

The teachers' union president, in fact, said that Republican opposition to teachers indoctrinating young children with the progressive LGBT agenda, in general, is dangerous.

""He needs to fund his campaign,"" Weingarten told Semafor of Pompeo's comments. ""He doesn’t have a base so he is trying to get millions from the anti-union, anti-public-education billionaires like Betsy DeVos.""

""Pompeo is desperate to be labeled as the extremist in the Republican presidential primary,"" she added. ""He's using the same strategy, the extremists' strategy that didn't work for them in 2018, 2020, and ’22. And he's flooding the zone with disinformation. And what's dangerous about that is that it will lead to violence. He's decided to use his campaign to foment hate and division.""

White House issues statement regarding Taylor Swift's Equality Act petition,"The White House has responded after superstar singer Taylor Swift used part of her acceptance speech at the Video Music Awards to hit out at the Trump administration for not acknowledging her petition endorsing the House-passed Equality Act — an initiative branded as a measure to keep LGBTQ Americans from being oppressed.

What are the details?

Swift made a point during her time on stage Monday night to call out the White House for not yet responded to her Change.org plea for the Senate to take up the Equality Act and vote on it. On Tuesday, the singer's wish was granted.

A White House spokesperson issued a statement saying, ""The Trump administration absolutely opposes discrimination of any kind and supports the equal treatment of all; however, the House-passed bill in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights,"" Fox News reported.

The Los Angeles Times noted that Tuesday's messaging from the administration is familiar. Swift wrote in a letter to her own senator, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), earlier this year, ""I personally reject the President's stance that his administration, 'supports equal treatment of all,' but the Equality Act, 'in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.'""

Anything else?

The Washington Examiner's Brad Polumbo — himself a gay conservative — addressed the Equality Act's ""poison pills"" in an op-ed about what he called Swift's ""virtue signaling"" published Tuesday.

""Swift says the Equality Act 'basically just says we should all be equal under the law,'"" Polumbo wrote. ""This is a gross oversimplification and insults the many people, including gay conservatives such as myself, with serious and substantial objections to the bill.""

The columnist went on to argue, ""In cases of competing rights claims, the Equality Act mandates that sexual and gender minorities win by default, when current standards under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allow for a weighing of both sides. This doesn't make gay and transgender people equal — it elevates their rights over those of religious minorities.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-issues-statement-regarding-taylor-swifts-equality-act-petition,2019-08-27
"White House threatens states for protecting children from gender surgeries, puberty blockers","The White House is threatening to hold states ""accountable"" for passing laws that protect children from irreversible procedures used to transition genders.

What is the background?

On Thursday, Alabama lawmakers passed SB 184, which critics claim outlaws ""gender-affirming"" care for ""transgender kids."" In reality, the bill punishes physicians who prescribe puberty-blocking drugs or perform gender-transition surgery on children.

Lawmakers also approved HB 322, which would prohibit self-identifying trans students from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities. The bill also prohibits classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation or gender identity"" for students in grades K-5. The bill is being falsely tarnished as a ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, despite not preventing use of the word ""gay.""

What is the WH saying?

At the beginning of Thursday's press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki accused Republicans of ""engaging in a disturbing, cynical trend of attacking vulnerable transgender kids for purely partisan, political reasons.""

Psaki specifically targeted Alabama and Texas.

""Instead of focusing on critical kitchen-table issues like the economy, COVID, or addressing the country’s mental health crisis, Republican lawmakers are currently debating legislation that ... would target trans youth with tactics that threatens to put pediatricians in prison if they provide medically necessary, lifesaving healthcare for the kids they serve,"" Psaki said.

""Just like the extreme government overreach we’ve seen in Texas, where politicians have sent state officials into the homes of loving parents to investigate them for abuse — just to harass and intimidate the LGBTQI+ community — today’s vote in Alabama will only serve to harm kids,"" she added.

Psaki said the Justice Department has put lawmakers ""on notice"" for debating such ""discriminatory bills,"" which she claimed may ""violate the Constitution and federal law."" Psaki did not clarify which federal laws or constitutional provisions the laws allegedly violate.

To bolster the administration position, Psaki claimed ""every major medical association agrees that gender-affirming health care for transgender kids is a best practice and potentially lifesaving.""

According to Psaki, Biden will hold ""accountable"" states that pass laws protecting children.

""President Biden has committed in both words and actions to fight for all Americans and will not hesitate to hold these states accountable,"" she said.

Psaki, however, did not state what action the government will take against states protecting children.

William Shatner flattens 'virtue signaling' critics online who are accusing him of transphobia,"Iconic actor William Shatner flattened an online mob demanding that he apologize for his stance on the use of the word ""cisgender"" as an epithet.

The ""Star Trek"" celebrity addressed the controversy by explaining that some people were using ""cis"" as an insult to degrade those who disagreed with the transgender lobby.

""CIS can be used as a slur. Look at the use of it. I didn't attack anyone, I asked that the label not be used in tweets to me,"" he tweeted with screenshots of the word being used as an insult.

""Sorry if you think that you cannot live a normal life without demanding to use the label on someone who has asked it not be used. It's a petty argument,"" he added.



One screenshot showed a response that called him ""just another rich white cishet bully.""

""Cisgender"" is a term used by transgender advocates to describe people with traditional gender roles. They prefer this term because it removes any implication that transgender is non-normal, and that traditional genders are more normal.

'What a disgusting cis male'

Another screenshot showed a response saying, ""He is blinded by is [sic] white privilege. What a disgusting cis male he is.""

Shatner reiterated his stance that ""cis"" was being used by some as a slur.

""CIS & Trans are self described terms. Only an individual can use them on themselves. To use it on another individual is a form of 'outing' that bully groups used to do on people they thought were homosexual,"" responded Shatner.

""It's wrong & I don't like the label. You don't have a say in how I feel,"" he added.



Shatner joins author J.K. Rowling among the few celebrities who have stood up to the LGBT lobby online. Rowling was criticized and ""cancelled"" for disagreeing slightly with the transgender political agenda by claiming that ""natal girls"" need protections from predators using trans-approved bathroom policies.

For her heresy, she was called a ""TERF,"" another transgender lobby insult that stands for ""transgender exclusionary radical feminists.""

"Wisconsin school board prohibits pride and BLM flags in classrooms, personal pronouns in school emails","One Wisconsin school district has refused to go woke. Both the school board and the superintendent have voted to ban the display of political and religious propaganda in classrooms and the inclusion of preferred pronouns in school-related emails.

On Tuesday, the Kettle Moraine School Board in Wales, Wisconsin, about a half-hour west of Milwaukee, voted unanimously to uphold a policy which prevents employees from displaying partisan political materials — including pride and Black Lives Matter flags and t-shirts — and religious messages for monetary or non-monetary gain. Faculty and staff are also prohibited from including their preferred pronouns in school emails.

""We live in a world where politics are highlighted, and it puts people in uncomfortable positions,"" superintendent Stephen Plum said earlier this month. ""I feel the staff can fully support students. I feel that every staff member, custodian and teacher ought to know that it's really in the best interest of the students to look out for them and to have strong, healthy relationships that develop therefrom.""

The school board came to the same conclusion, despite boisterous opposition from the public at Tuesday's meeting.

""If you have a policy that says 'nothing political,' does that mean you can't have a sign up that says, 'Support our Troops,' or 'Believe Women' or 'Save the Planet?' By some people's definitions, all of those things are political,"" said Christine Donahoe, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin. It is not clear whether Donahoe attended the meeting.

""It really looks like targeted attacks at specific viewpoints, like LGBT communities, or welcome and safe spaces to students of color,"" she added.

An incoming freshman to the district who identifies as transgender likewise opposed the measure.

""I don't want to be misgendered and I want people to know, especially if I'm meeting new people, I want them to know they can feel safe around me,"" said Edith Cramer, who claims to use he/him pronouns.

However, school board president Gary Vose stood by the decision.

""This isn’t a case where we’re trying to discriminate against any group or groups for that matter,"" Vose said, ""but rather just to bring clarity to allow staff to know where the line is drawn on these various things.""

Another parent who attended the meeting likewise expressed support: ""The vast majority of us demand that our schools focus on teaching our kids and not bringing divisive, politically charged issues into the classroom.""

The AP reports that the school district in Waukesha passed a similar policy last fall.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wisconsin-school-board-prohibits-pride-and-blm-flags-in-classrooms-personal-pronouns-in-school-emails,2022-08-17
"Woke celebrities rediscover Louis Farrakhan, praise his recently resurfaced video about racism","A bevy of woke celebrities celebrated Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on social media this week, including comedienne Chelsea Handler.

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Nation of Islam as a hate group, writing that the group's ""theology of innate black superiority over whites and the deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders have earned the NOI a prominent position in the ranks of organized hate.""

What are the details?

Handler appeared to kick off the fawning, posting a clip of Farrakhan making an appearance on ""The Phil Donahue Show"" in the 1980s.

Handler captioned the video, in which Farrakhan talks about racism and white fear, ""I learned a lot from watching this powerful video.""

According to various reports, fellow celebrities Jennifer Aniston, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jennifer Garner liked the post. Actor Sean Hayes even commented, ""This should be played on a loop. Everywhere. Always.""



Actress Jessica Chastain also reportedly shared the clip to her Instagram page, and actress Jameela Jamil — who apparently didn't even know who Farrakhan was prior to seeing the video — captioned it, ""Someone please tell me the name of this extraordinary man who so perfectly sums up white fear in under a minute.""

The entertainers received quick blowback for the support of the highly controversial figure, and Jamil was just one who removed her posting.



Journalist Yashar Ali led the charge in criticism on social media, writing, ""Louis Farrakhan is an anti-semitic, homophobic monster who also happens to be a rape apologist. You don't have to hand it to him for anything ... ever.""

There must be something in Hollywood's water these days, because this isn't the first time Farrakhan has been lauded as an example of positivity in recent days.

Rapper and actor Ice Cube took to Twitter last week, sharing a photo of the Nation of Islam leader and writing, ""The Honorable Louis Farrakhan continues to warn America to this very second and he's labeled one of your 'evil names' and you turn your ears off. Why is the truth so offensive that you can't stand to hear it?""

Woke Disney removes 'boys and girls' from park greetings to be inclusive,"Disney amusement parks will no longer refer to boys and girls as ""boys and girls"" in park greetings in an effort to promote gender inclusivity, a company executive said in a video.

""We’ve provided training for all of our cast members in relationship to that. So now they know it's ‘Hello, everyone,’ or ‘Hello, friends,'"" Vivian Ware, Disney's diversity and inclusion manager, said in a video conference call posted by City Journal writer Christopher Rufo.

Ware said the company was in the process of changing all of its recorded messages to delete any all mentions of ""ladies,"" ""gentlemen,"" ""boys,"" and ""girls.""

""We want to create that magical moment with our cast members, with our guests,"" she said. ""And we don't want to just assume because someone might be, in our interpretation, may be presenting as female that they may not want to be 'princess.'""

Last year, Disney World in Florida replaced its longtime greeting, ""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,"" from the Magic Kingdom fireworks show with the phrase, ""Good evening, dreamers of all ages!"" A company spokesperson told the L.A. Times that the switch was ""part of a broader effort around diversity and inclusion.""

“We want our guests to see their own backgrounds and traditions reflected in the stories, experiences and products they encounter in their interactions with Disney,” wrote Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, in an April 13, 2021 blog post. “And we want our cast members — and future cast members — to feel a sense of belonging at work.”

In other leaked videos shared by Rufo, Disney executives have boasted about implementing a ""gay agenda"" by creating pro-LGBTQ+ content for children. Disney corporate president Karey Burke has stated a desire to increase the number of ""queer leads"" featured in Disney's content.

Another video featured a Disney production coordinator who said the company is ""exploring queer stories"" and creating stories with numerous ""gender nonconforming characters.""

The push for greater ""diversity and inclusivity"" at Disney is part of the company's ""Reimagine Tomorrow"" initiative, which the company says is ""our way of amplifying underrepresented voices and untold stories as well as championing the importance of accurate representation in media and entertainment.""

Disney has also taken aggressive political positions against laws progressives claim are anti-LGBT, including Florida's ""Parental Rights in Education Law"" — which bans discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in K-3 grade. About 70 Disney employees walked out of the job last week in protest of the Florida law, and progressive employees have demanded that Disney's leadership do more to oppose such legislation.

In the face of that political pressure, Disney released a statement Monday blasting the law after it was signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

""Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,"" the company said in a statement . ""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that. We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.""

While Disney claims to support diversity and makes statements about wanting every employee to feel ""belonging at work,"" the company's conservative employees have spoken out about harassment and bullying they've received at work because of their views.

In an open letter published last week, anonymous Disney employees detailed how the company has ""come to be an increasingly uncomfortable place to work for those of us whose political and religious views are not explicitly progressive.""

They warned that should Disney continue to take public political positions on controversial issues, it could alienate many of its customers and contribute to division.

Woke hypocrites at Disney are expanding the company's dealings in 10 countries with explicit anti-gay laws,"The Walt Disney Company is expanding its operations in at least ten explicitly anti-gay countries and regions.

This move comes despite the company’s insistence on laundering LGBT+ narratives into content for children in the United States and its commitment to repealing Florida’s recently passed — and widely supported — “Parental Rights in Education” law.

This past Tuesday, the transnational entertainment titan announced that it would be launching its eponymous streaming service, Disney+, in 42 new areas in Europe, Asia, and West Africa from May to June of 2022.

Nearly a dozen of the places where Disney+ will soon be offered have strict anti-gay laws.

These places include the countries Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudia Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen, and the region of Palestine.

It is not specified whether Disney is expanding its services to both territories considered to be “Palestine,” the Western Bank, and the Gaza Strip, as both are officially governed by the Palestine Liberation Organization.

In many of the entities to which Disney will soon be extending its services, homosexual acts are often punished with lengthy jail sentences, hard labor, and exuberant fines.

In countries like Saudi Arabia, where there is no formalized criminal code, homosexuals and transgender individuals are punished in far more draconian ways. These punishments include expensive fines, chemical castrations, and executions.

In Yemen, homosexuality is punishable by death.

Disney also recently announced that it would be creating a bevy of LGBTQ+-focused content for Disney+. This is move has come under increased scrutiny after the corporation proclaimed its indignation over Florida’s “Parental Rights in Education” law.

Disney explicitly stated that it is dedicated to getting the law “repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts” while mischaracterizing the law as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

In a statement made after Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed the bill into law, Disney said, “Florida’s HB 1557, also know as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that.”

Disney also sails its cruise ships to the Southern Caribbean island countries of Antigua, Dominica, and St. Maarten. All three of these destinations have legally banned gay marriage, and in Antigua and Dominica people can face several years in prison for engaging in homosexual activity.

The Walt Disney Company also continues to grow its business in China despite what the Guardian reported as the country banning depictions of gay people on television.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-hypocrites-at-disney-are-expanding-the-companies-dealings-in-10-countries-with-explicit-anti-gay-laws,2022-04-03
Woke Pennsylvania school board member who rejected qualified candidate because a 'cis white male ... sends the wrong message' resigns after backlash,"A Pennsylvania school board member declared last week that she would not vote for ""the only cis White male"" seeking to serve as president, despite admitting he would be ""excellent"" in the role.

Facing significant backlash for what appeared to be an instance of brazen discrimination, she will now be stepping down.

What are the details?

The Upper Moreland Township School District issued a statement on Monday indicating that board director Jennifer Solot, the woman who publicly indicated that race, sexual orientation, and gender were determining factors behind her board of school directors vote, has decided to resign, effective Jan. 2, 2023.

""She wishes to apologize for her poorly chosen words and does not want to be a distraction from the great things happening in our schools on a daily basis,"" said the statement, signed by board president April Stainback and superintendent Susan Elliott.

The UMSD statement also claimed that Solot's remarks were not necessarily reflective of the opinions shared by the board of directors or the district as a whole, and that the district values ""the full diversity of the community we serve and help all students and staff achieve success without discrimination on the basis of race, color, age, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, national origin, marital status, pregnancy, disability, or gender identity.""

Board director Greg D'Elia, a father of three who previously had the backing of local Democrats, gave a nod to the leftist sentiment Solot had expressed, underscoring that he ""supports diversity,"" but adding Solot's ""comments did not further diversity and reflected poorly on our community.""

Keeping it diverse, one exclusion at a time

UMSD exerts its influence in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The district serves over 3,200 K-12 students.

It held its board president election on Dec. 6. According to the Daily Mail, Solot, who served as treasurer on the board of directors, led the meeting.

Solot suggested that it would ""send the wrong message"" to elect D'Elia over the incumbent president April Stainback, ostensibly a straight white woman.

""I believe that Mr. D’Elia would make an excellent president. However, I feel that electing the only cis white male on this board president of this district sends the wrong message to our community,"" said Solot.

""Cis"" is short for ""cisgender,"" a neologism used by LGBT activists denoting a person who does not reject the reality of his or her biological sex.

According to the school board treasurer, the ""wrong message"" that would be sent by electing an individual with undesirable immutable characteristics ""is contrary to what we as a board have been trying to accomplish.""

In terms of accomplishments, the UMSD recently established a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging committee. This committee ""will serve to inform policies and practices across the district"" and ""engage staff in professional development to build understanding of best practices to support belongingness and equity.""

It is unclear if or to what extent the DEIB committee has impacted Solot's thinking.

""I think that it is important that we practice what we preach,"" added Solot, intimating that the UMSD preaches in favor of discriminatory, anti-meritocratic practices.

After Solot's speech, eight members voted for Stainback. D'Elia had only his own vote in his favor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-pennsylvania-school-board-member-resigns-amidst-backlash,2022-12-14
Rhode Island private school asks students not to give out valentines featuring 'only White human characters',"A private school in Providence, Rhode Island, recommended that students avoid giving their peers Valentine’s Day cards that portray “only white people,” according to the National Pulse.

In a letter to parents and students, Osvaldo Jose Marti, head of the Moses Brown Lower School, said, “As we approach the month of February, we are writing to share some guidelines for the selection and exchange of Valentines in the Lower School. If your child wishes to bring cards for classmates, please consider these recommendations, which we make in an effort to promote kindness and inclusivity within our community …”

“Please coach your child if purchasing commercially produced cards to select something that does not feel 'gender normative,'” the letter said, “Also, consider talking to your child about avoiding cards that portray only White human characters. Representation matters and our students of color also deserve to see themselves in some of the cards they receive, unless we can find cards without people pictured at all.”

This is not the first time that Moses Brown embraced woke insanity. Parents have complained that the school has an “obsession” with “transgender themes” and encourages students to proclaim “it is ok to be Gay.”

One mother told a regional radio show in New England that a teacher explained to her four-year-old daughter that someday the child “might want to marry another girl.” Children enrolled in Moses Brown’s pre-primary education program are taught to announce their pronouns to their class.

According to the school’s website, Moses Brown’s Lower School — which looks after children starting with nursery care through the 4th grade — emphasizes “the importance of being responsible citizens, and caring for others and the world beyond their doorstep” and helping students “develop their talents in a way that is uniquely theirs, while appreciating and celebrating the different abilities of those around them.”

Moses Brown’s high school provides students with several “service/awareness” organizations to participate in. These include the Gender Sexuality Alliance Club where students are encouraged to “explore issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression” and “Equal Voice,” which “focuses on issues of feminism and equality.”

Moses Brown is a Quaker school system. The school says that the “world needs ethical leadership” and its mission as a Quaker school “is to provide the rising generation with an ethical core, an unshakable foundation of integrity that fosters respect, non-violent resolution of conflict, and the desire to make a positive difference in the world.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-private-school-asks-students-not-to-give-out-valentines-featuring-only-white-human-characters,2022-02-08
Brave new world: 61-year-old grandmother gives birth to her own grandchild,"A 61-year-old grandmother in Omaha, Nebraska, gave birth to her grandchild earlier this week.

When Matthew Eledge, 32, and his husband Elliot Dougherty, 29, decided they wanted to start a family, Matthew's mother, Cecile Elledge volunteered to be their surrogate, BuzzFeed News reported.

""If you want me to be the gestational carrier,"" Cecile told Matthew, according to BuzzFeed. ""I'd do it in a heartbeat.""

And she did.

On Monday, Cecile gave birth to her granddaughter, who weighed in at 5 pounds, 13 ounces.

What are the details?

Cecile had been postmenopausal for 10 years when she underwent a series of tests to find out whether or not she would be a viable candidate to carry a baby for the gay couple. And she was.

""It's important for people to note that not every 60-year-old is in good enough health to be a surrogate,"" Dr. Carolyn Maud Doherty told BuzzFeed. ""There are probably only a handful of people across the country who can do this — only a handful of people who have done it.""

Soon after, Cecile began taking hormones to restart her cycle.

""It was certainly strange, but I kept remembering it was only temporary,"" Cecile said.

Matthew donated the sperm.

Elliot's sister, Lea Yribe, who was 25 at the time, donated the eggs.

A healthy embryo was implanted in Cecile's uterus using in vitro fertilization.

Cecile, a mother of three grown children, became pregnant on the first try.

""I had all the same symptoms, but probably more elevated,"" Cecile told BuzzFeed. ""I had the same morning sickness, but it lasted longer. I had shortness of breath. But I worked out, I walked, I was physically active — as of last Monday, I was still working out on the elliptical. And actually, it was almost easier. Because I'm older, my diet's been easier to control, and I didn't have the responsibility of other children. Just this pregnancy.""

Cecile delivered Uma Louise Dougherty-Eledge without complications or a C-section.

""I feel fabulous,"" she told the news outlet shortly after Uma's birth.

A friend of Matthew and Elliot stockpiled and froze breast milk for them to feed their baby.

""Talk about a support system! This is a friend we trust and love. We love women — we think women should rule the world. Elliot's sister donated her eggs, my mom carried her, and we have this dear beautiful friend giving her this nourishment. Our daughter, Uma, gets to be surrounded by all these smart, beautiful, compassionate women,"" Matthew said.

Who are the parents listed on the birth certificate?

Uma's birth certificate lists Matthew as the father and Cecile as the mother.

""It's kind of embarrassing,"" Matthew told BuzzFeed. ""My mom and I are legally Uma's parents. Nebraska requires the sperm donor to be the father and the person who delivers the baby to be the 'mother,' even if she's not biologically related to the child. This looks really creepy for us.

""Let's just say we will NOT be framing and hanging up Uma's birth certificate,"" he continued. ""I thought Elliot could at least put his name on the birth certificate, at least symbolically, but they didn't even offer that. He now needs to go through an adoption process to get any legal rights.""

Do they plan to have more children?

Matthew and Elliot are reportedly undecided about expanding their family, but they have two frozen embryos that could be used in the future.

What else?

A Greek woman who's believed to be the oldest known surrogate in the world gave birth to her daughter's baby in 2016. She was 67 years old at the time.

Wonder Woman has a lesbian lover in DC's new comic series,"DC Comics superhero Wonder Woman will lock lips with her new girlfriend in DC Comics' latest addition to the ""Dark Knight of Steel"" comic book series.

In the second issue of the ""Dark Knights of Steel,"" Princess Diana (Wonder Woman) has a newfound love interest in Zala-El from the House of El. Diana's new same-sex relationship departs from precedent set by the original comic storyline since her debut in 1941, in which she had very few relationships with homosexual characters. However, it has been ""strongly implied numerous times"" that Wonder Woman is bisexual, according to Screen Rant. Historically, Wonder Woman's predominant love interest has been Steve Trevor, the pilot who crash-landed on her home island of Themyscira.

In ""Dark Knights of Steel #2 "" by writers Tom Taylor, Yasmine Putri, Arif Prianto, and Wes Abbott, Wonder Woman makes her first appearance in the series. The story opens up with Lois Lane arriving on the island of Themyscira after traveling by ship to deliver some bad news.

The story then cuts to Lois finding Diana sparring on a battlefield with a woman who readers learn is Zala-El from the House of El. Lois tells Zala that her father, Jor-El, has been murdered. Wonder Woman immediately rushes to comfort the heartbroken Zala-El, telling her that ""she will be there for her no matter what,"" and the two women share a passionate kiss, Screen Rant said.

Zala-El is a brand-new character to the DC universe and will play an important role in the story development of the ""Dark Knight of Steel"" series. It is suspected that Wonder Woman will likely fight side-by-side with her new lover to defend Zala-El after the Princess House El kills one of the sons of Black Lightning in an act of revenge for the death of her father, according to Screen Rant.

Wonder Woman's new lesbian love affair is just one part of DC Comics' new host of coming LGBT characters.

On Oct. 11, DC announced that it will introduce many new LGBT characters, including Jon Kent (the son of Lois Lane and Clark Kent), The Flash, Batwoman, and Green Lantern. These are just a few of the comic heroes expected to have homosexual storylines within the year, according to Yahoo! News.

""I've always said everyone needs heroes, and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes, and I’m very grateful DC, and Warner Bros. share this idea,” DC Comics writer Tom Taylor said in a statement released by DC.

"Yale cancelling popular class because the subject is 'overwhelmingly white, straight' and European","Yale will stop offering a very popular art class because it covers artists who are ""overwhelmingly white, straight,"" and European.

The cancellation of Western Civilization was detailed in the Yale Daily News.

""Introduction to Art History: Renaissance to the Present"" was touted as a quintessential class with a storied decades-long history, but it will be no longer offered because it is simply not diverse enough.

Tim Barringer, the instructor of the course and the chair of the Art history department, said that he saw value in all the objects studied in the class, but added the the focus on white European art was ""problematic.""

The final iteration of the class will question the idea of Western art before it closes down.

""I want all Yale students (and all residents of New Haven who can enter our museums freely) to have access to and to feel confident analyzing and enjoying the core works of the western tradition,"" Barringer added. ""But I don't mistake a history of European painting for the history of all art in all places.""

Students responded to the news that the class was going to be cancelled by filling up the limited spots available quickly.

The Yale Daily News offered no evidence to its claim that students were objecting to the class, but they did supply a quote from a student disappointed that it was cancelled.

""My biggest critique of the decision is that it's a disservice to undergrads,"" said Mahlon Sorensen.

""If you get rid of that one, all-encompassing course,"" Sorensen explained, ""then to understand the Western canon of art, students are going to have to take multiple art history courses. Which is all well and good for the art history major, but it sucks for the rest of us, which, I would say, make up the vast majority of the people who are taking [the class].""

"Young girl tips drag queen at pride event sponsored by Nickelodeon: 'Nobody’s scaring anybody, and it’s a beautiful thing'","A drag queen in women's lingerie performed a dance at a recent so-called family pride event in California, and at some point during the suggestive dance, a young girl well below the age of majority handed the drag queen a tip.

Last Friday, Burbank Pride of Burbank, California, hosted its first-ever Family Pride in the Park night, an event which featured many high-profile guests and drag queen performers. During the evening, one such drag performer held a fan as he pranced about to Lady Gaga's ""A-Yo"" in a lacy red crop top, high-waisted underwear, and thigh-high red stiletto boots.

According to a video shared on Twitter, at some point during the performance, a young girl with a long braid who looks no older than 10 ran up and handed the performer money. The dancer accepted the money with a brief smile and then tossed the bill to the side as the girl scampered away.

It is unclear whether the dancer is one of the drag queens listed on many of the event advertisements: Ms. Knightley, Bohenne Arreaux, and Calla Faeria.

According to these same ads, the event also featured a ""KIDS ZONE,"" though it is unclear what type of entertainment the ""KIDS ZONE"" offered.

Perhaps even more alarming is that the event, and indeed Burbank Pride in general, has been sponsored by Nickelodeon Animation Studios, a company ostensibly dedicated to telling ""fun, playful, and sometimes quirky stories where kids can see themselves and laugh with [its] characters.""

Nickelodeon did not respond to a request for comment.

Other sponsors and supporters of the event include the Trevor Project, Macy’s, Elevate Burbank and Linda Bessin, the Burbank Community YMCA, Warner Bros., Costco, Unique Vintage, Belmont Village Senior Living, the Colony Theatre, Senator Anthony Portantino, Isabel Omero, the Little White Chapel, Burbank Temple Emanu El, and Mocean.

Well-known ""Big Bang Theory"" actress and current ""Jeopardy!"" co-host Mayim Bialik, who claimed that she has been a member of the Burbank community for nearly her ""entire life,"" also appeared at the event and addressed the audience.

""It’s a beautiful event, no matter how you identify or if you’re an ally,"" Bialik asserted. ""I brought my kid, and we’re having a great time.""

Omero, the chair of Burbank Pride Sponsorship, likewise argued that the event brought the Burbank community closer together.

""This was an opportunity to introduce the trans, LGBT community as a whole to Burbank as a whole,"" Omero said. “If you could get the two groups together – a lot of times people don’t know each other, they may not know their neighbor down the street – but now they can see who their neighbors are and that we can all be friends. Nobody’s scaring anybody, and it’s a beautiful thing.""

To kick off the festivities, Isabella Meneses sang the national anthem. It is unknown whether anyone in attendance knelt during the performance.

A local high school drama club also made an appearance at the event, though how club members participated is unclear.

""Burbank is such a diverse community with a vibrant LGBTQIA+ population, and this is really the first time we are able to fully celebrate as a city,"" said Tracy Tabb, president of Burbank Pride.

""We hope this event will be the first of many more to come.""

Youngkin refuses to buckle when CNN anchor claims pro-parental rights rules are 'excluding' LGBT kids and their affirming parents,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) refused to cave Sunday when CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged the fairness of a new regulations that protect the rights of parents.



What is the background?

Last month, Youngkin issued new rules mandating that students must use bathrooms and pronouns that correspond to their biological sex. They are also required to play on sports teams with members of their biological sex.

Importantly, the rules do not exclude transgender students — or anyone protected by federal law — from living out their identity. The emphasis of the rules, which overturn progressive regulations enacted by Democrats and former Gov. Ralph Northam (D), is the protection of parental rights. The previous rules, in fact, directed schools to decide on a ""case-by-case"" basis whether to share information with parents regarding this issue.

Under the new rules, transgender students can live out their gender identity at school only if their parents have formally requested it.

Importantly, the rules also emphasize protection of First Amendment rights:

The First Amendment forbids government actors to require individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs. Practices such as compelling others to use preferred pronouns is premised on the ideological belief that gender is a matter of personal choice or subjective experience, not sex. Many Virginians reject this belief. Additionally, the First Amendment guarantees religious freedom and prohibits compelling others to affirm ideas that may be contrary to their personal religious beliefs.

What happened with Tapper?

Questioning Youngkin on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Tapper advanced a fallacious argument: The new rules excludes people.

After noting that the ""American Academy of Pediatrics says these kinds of laws can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and even suicide among transgender youth,"" Tapper told Youngkin that ""it sounds like you're excluding parents that might be supportive of their child going to the bathroom or joining a sports team that is in alignment with their gender identity.""

But Youngkin swiftly shot down Tapper's claim.

""Certainly not. If parents actually want their child to be able to change a pronoun or their name or use a bathroom, if parents choose that, then, legally, that's what the schools will do,"" Youngkin explained.

Tapper presses GOP governor on policies for transgender students www.youtube.com

The entire point of the rule change, Youngkin earlier explained, was ""to fix a wrong,"" namely those progressive rules enacted by Virginia Democrats.

""Parents have a fundamental right to be engaged in their children's lives,"" he said.

""And oh, by the way, children have a right to have parents engaged in their life,"" Youngkin continued. ""We needed to fix a wrong. The previous administration had had a policy that excluded parents and, in fact, particularly didn't require the involvement of parents.

""Let's be clear: Parents have this right — and children don't belong to the state,"" the governor declared.

Anything else?

The rules will take effect after a 30-day public commenting period, which opened on Sept. 26.

"Report: YouTube CEO was personally involved in decision to yank Crowder income, but says she didn't bother reviewing all the relevant videos","YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki admitted that she was personally involved in the decision to demonetize conservative commentator Steven Crowder's video channel.

But she also admitted that she didn't review all the videos that caused a red flag for some people.

What are the details?

In a remarks at Recode's Code Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Monday, the YouTube CEO addressed the ongoing controversy around Crowder and his videos.

YouTube demonetized Crowder's channel last week after a Vox employee complained that Crowder had been using homophobic language.

A portion of the organization's statement read, ""In the past, we felt our responses to some of these situations were slow and didn't always address our broader community's concerns.""

""Our ultimate goal here is to streamline our response so we can make better, faster decisions and communicate them clearly,"" the statement added.

According to the Daily Mail, Wojcicki said that she hadn't reviewed all of the videos that ultimately resulted in Crowder's channel demonetization.

""She did watch some of them, however, and was involved in the decision to allow Mr. Crowder to continue using the platform, it's reported,"" the outlet added.

She also issued an apology to the LGBTQ community during her remarks in Arizona.

""I know the decision we made [not to shut down Crowder's channel] was very hurtful to the LGBT community,"" she said. ""That was not our intention at all. I thought that was important to be up front about that. We are really sorry about that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-ceo-admits-she-was-personally-involved-in-decision-to-yank-crowder-income-but-says-she-didnt-bother-reviewing-all-the-videos,2019-06-11
"YouTube 'looking into' Steven Crowder after Vox writer asks them to, and Crowder responds... via YouTube","YouTube is now investigating conservative comedian, BlazeTV host, and YouTube star Steven Crowder, after a Vox writer who frequently targets conservatives for de-platforming asked them to. And Crowder has a response.

It started - well the current scuffle started - when Vox's Carlos Maza took his case to his Twitter feed to complain that Crowder was harassing and bullying him. In his Tweet thread, he included a heavily edited montage of excerpts from Crowder's shows, where he made fun of Maza.



Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video ""debunking"" Strikethrough. Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity. Here's a sample: pic.twitter.com/UReCcQ2Elj

— Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019

In that thread, Maza not only targets Crowder for crowd-sourced flagging and reporting, he repeatedly places blame and responsibility on YouTube for allowing a ""monster"" for allowing ""bullying"" of its ""LGBT creators.""



Anyway, if you want to help, I guess you can go to this dude's videos and flag them? But @YouTube isn't going to do anything, because YouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators. It cares about ""engagement,"" and homophobic/racist harassment is VERY ""engaging.""

— Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019

YouTube responded to the Vox writer personally on Twitter.



Thanks so much for outlining all of this–we're looking into it further. Sending you a DM now.

— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) May 31, 2019

So personal attention for the liberal writer at a site backed by a major corporate entity.

And that is exactly what Steven Crowder talked about in this response. Watch:



""This is corporate censorship, and this is yet another giant company trying to lean on this channel, your channel, and the content that you've created,"" says Crowder. ""And this is a war ... we will fight to the absolute bitter end both legally and publicly.

He also made an interesting point about viewership. Without being featured, while being in general shunned by YouTube as a company, his channels subscribers and views dwarf those of places like Vox, who on the other hand get all sorts of love and attention from YouTube, he says.

Crowder characterizes this as a David vs. Goliath battle. It is also yet another example of how there is a fine line between corporate freedom to select their content, and coordinated censorship of one point of view by the culturally acceptable other side.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-investigating-steven-crowder-after-vox-writer-asks-them-to-and-crowder-responds-via-youtube,2019-06-02
"YouTube responds to Vox writer's campaign to 'punish' Steven Crowder, and he is not happy about it","The organized campaign to ban Steven Crowder from YouTube has failed after the social media platform tweeted Tuesday that the conservative comedian had not violated its community standards.

Vox writer Carlos Maza demanded that YouTube take action against the BlazeTV host, and asked his followers to flag his videos as abusive in order to get him banned. Crowder had targeted Maza and his videos for ridicule and mockery over their liberal bias.

On Monday, Crowder posted a humorous video where he offered an apology to a lengthy list of political and pop culture figures that he had insulted in the past. Maza did not find it as humorous.



On Tuesday, YouTube responded from its Twitter account.

""Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don't violate our policies. We've included more info below to explain this decision,"" the online video company tweeted.

""As an open platform, it's crucial for us to allow everyone–from creators to journalists to late-night TV hosts–to express their opinions w/in the scope of our policies. Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don't violate our policies, they'll remain on our site,"" the statement continued.

""Even if a video remains on our site, it doesn't mean we endorse/support that viewpoint,"" the statement concluded. ""There are other aspects of the channel that we're still evaluating– we'll be in touch with any further updates.""

Maza responded angrily at YouTube's decision.

""I don't know what to say,"" he tweeted. ""@YouTube has decided not to punish Crowder, after he spent two years harassing me for being gay and Latino. I don't know what to say.""

""That's an absolutely batsh*t policy that gives bigots free license,"" he added in another tweet.



Maza called out to LGBT creators to leave YouTube, and demanded that LGBT employees who worked for YouTube quit their jobs.

""They're trotting you out to convince advertisers that their platform hasn't become a breeding ground for hate speech and bigotry,"" Maza said. ""They're hoping you'll distract advertisers away from the monsters they're creating.""

He noted that it was Pride Month, and called for action against YouTube.

""It's a platform for monsters masquerading as an ally to the LGBT people they target,"" he tweeted.

""It's going to get so much worse now,"" Maza concluded. ""@YouTube has publicly stated that racist and homophobic abuse doesn't violate their anti-bullying policies. Crowder and his allies are going to be emboldened. I genuinely can't imagine what LGBT employees at YouTube are doing right now.""

Crowder had an uncharacteristically brief response:

You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



There's a silver lining to the climate alarmists' war on coal. It means there's a lot more for Santa to deliver to the members of the mainstream media who have obfuscated, lied, and been downright biased all year.

Yes, the media have been biased and full of fake news for decades, but as its Russian collusion hoax fell apart and it continued to willfully obfuscate Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, the media kicked it up a million notches.

As I shared Monday, the Intercept's Glenn Greenwald showed just how dishonest the media have been regarding the FISA abuse story. Instead of being aghast at the erosion of constitutional rights the investigation into President Donald Trump was littered with, the media reveled in it and, even after shown how bad it was by the inspector general, kept on cheering and attacking Trump.

Then there is the protection of the Democratic Party and its relationship with the government of Ukraine during the 2016 election. As people like journalist John Solomon and BlazeTV's Glenn Beck uncovered evidence of serious misdeeds by the Obama administration and Democrats, the media continued to obfuscate and call it an unfounded conspiracy theory.

Those are just some of the daily biases the propaganda wing of the left has proffered this year. You aren't imagining things: The media are getting more biased by the day.

Santa Claus knows all and sees all. So he knows just who's been naughty. And in 2019, nobody's been naughtier than the media. That black trail you'll see in the sky is just Santa, on his way to the homes of mainstream journalists, dropping off their sacks of coal for Christmas.

Groundhog Day 2: Impeachment Boogaloo; the media downplay their own reporting to own Trump,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Today is the day the media and leftists are going to really get President Donald Trump, version 1,027. In their best impersonation of Bill Murray, every day since the inauguration, they've gotten up, looked in the mirror, and said, ""This is the day we do it."" And every day they've failed to convince their fellow Americans that Trump deserves to be removed from office.



On Wednesday, with the start of public ""impeachment hearings,"" their version of ""Groundhog Day"" enters a new phase, ""Groundhog Day 2: Impeachment Boogaloo.""

One of the key pieces of information that the media have been trying to obfuscate is that, as BlazeTV host Glenn Beck has shown, Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.

For example, take this piece at Politico by Kyle Cheney and Natasha Bertrand about Alexandra Chalupa, the DNC operative at the heart of Ukrainian collusion allegations. The article is subtitled, ""Alexandra Chalupa is at the center of unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.""

About those ""unsubstantiated claims."" They stem from an article at — wait for it — Politico in January 2019. The article highlights the ""Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump"" in the 2016 campaign. They aren't ""unsubstantiated.""



But that didn't stop BuzzFeed News from downplaying the article and basically throwing its authors, Ken Vogel and David Stern, under the bus.

So what the media is saying is that its own reporting is suspect. Which is the same thing it did when ""LevinTV"" host Mark Levin put together, from mainstream reporting, that the FBI was collecting the communications of Trump campaign officials.

The media will do anything in their power to get rid of President Donald Trump — including eating their own.

WTF MSM!? Disney won’t stop filming in Georgia and Bob Iger knows it,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



Déjà vu …

Hollywood is gearing up for a fight in the wake of Georgia's new ""hearbeat"" pro-life legislation. Netflix was first out of the gate to say it would reconsider working in Georgia, and Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. The threats hinge on whether or not Georgia actually enforces the legislation. Will Disney follow through on its threat, or was it merely virtue-signaling? Based on the other places Disney happily films around the world, it's virtue-signaling.

I was on the Overtime segment for ""The Steve Deace Show"" on Thursday to discuss this. Deace explained how the noncommittal commitment from Iger was really about putting out a fire that nobody will remember months from now. We know this is true because Disney films in multiple locations around the world with more restrictive abortion laws than Georgia's new law. It also has theme parks in these countries.

For example, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was filmed in the Republic of Ireland, where abortion was illegal until a recent referendum, but remains against the law after 12 weeks. Disney has a theme park in France, where abortion remains illegal after the 12th week of pregnancy.

This is a play by Disney to intimidate Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) into not fully enacting this legislation. The company thinks it will work, because it has before. In 2016, the Georgia Legislature passed religious liberty legislation. Business groups, led by Disney among others, bullied then-Gov. Nathan Deal (R) into vetoing the legislation.

Disney already does business in places with much more restrictive policies on abortion and places that treat the gay community much harsher than any law in the United States. Iger answers to shareholders first. If Georgia continues to offer tax breaks to the filming industry, films will continue to be filmed there.

The filming trades union isn't buying the bluster either, saying it ""expects continuing job stability,"" despite the threat of boycotts.

As I said on ""The Steve Deace Show,"" Disney will stop filming in Georgia when all the celebrities who said they were moving to Canada if Trump were elected actually move to Canada. Vancouver is the Hollywood of the North already, so what's stopping them?

The law of supply and demand …

Former New Yorker fact-checker Talia Lavin, who smeared Ben Shapiro after the Notre Dame fire, is finding the marketplace of ideas to be uninterested in her wisdom. Lavin had been scheduled to teach a course called ""Reporting on the Far Right."" Virtually no one signed up for the class, so New York University canceled it.

Lavin resigned from the New Yorker after a false accusation of a Nazi tattoo against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Lavin is a serial fabulist who sees it as her duty to attack conservatives relentlessly. She's a poster child for the sort of activism that masquerades as journalism today.

It's somewhat heartening to see that her message doesn't have appeal, even at a liberal bastion like NYU.

You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Sticking together …



On Tuesday, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ludicrously compared ICE detention centers for illegal immigrants to ""concentration camps."" Her loaded remarks were meant to draw comparisons to the treatment of Jews by the Nazis. Ocasio-Cortez knew exactly what she was doing with her false equivalency, and so did the media types who rallied to her defense.

Before delving into the media's defense of Ocasio-Cortez, let's look back quickly at how detention centers got started. The law leading to modern immigration detention centers was signed by President Bill Clinton. President Barack Obama's administration made extensive use of detention centers. But now that Donald Trump is president, the left wants to call them ""concentration camps.""

The media scarcely reported on Obama's detention policies yet have rushed to paint Trump's similar policies as draconian and evil. This is the underlying reason they are supporting Ocasio-Cortez's comments.

The Washington Free Beacon's David Rutz has a roundup of the media personalities who have rushed to Ocasio-Cortez's defense. From Slate's Josh Keating to MSNBC's Chris Hayes, Rutz highlights how these media types are all about explaining that ""concentration camp"" does not equal Nazi death camp.

That doesn't fly. It's generally accepted that when you say ""concentration camp,"" you know exactly what that means.

In its coverage, the Washington Post leapt to use its tried-and-true ""Republicans pounce"" narrative. Its headline stated that there was ""Republican outcry.""

These media types actually believe that in continuing Obama administration policies, the Trump administration, and moreover Trump personally, is overseeing ""concentration camps"" that rival what the Nazis did.

This all goes to serve the No. 1 goal of the press: The removal of Donald Trump from the office of the presidency. No matter what the cost to their own fleeting credibility.

NY Times ignores Levin, again …

On Tuesday at TheBlaze, I wrote of how the folks at the NY Times Review of Books once again have snubbed LevinTV host Mark Levin. This time, the paper published a featured look at five conservative authors, including Ben Shapiro and NeverTrumper George Will. Despite being No. 1 on the nonfiction bestseller list at the Times for weeks, Levin wasn't featured.

As I noted, this isn't the first time the Times tried to snub Levin. Back in 2017, it did not show his book ""Rediscovering Americanism"" at the top of the charts even though it topped other such lists. At the time, a Times spokesman explained how its lists used subjective criteria in addition to objective metrics.

Perhaps this time the Times was afraid of highlighting Levin because of his devastating takedown of the paper's actions in trying to hide the Holocaust from the American people.

Mark Levin hosts LevinTV on BlazeTV, which like TheBlaze, is owned by Blaze Media.

Nick Cannon blasts liberal comedians for their blatant hypocrisy following Kevin Hart controversy,"Following the controversy surrounding comedian Kevin Hart, which resulted in him stepping down as host of the upcoming Oscar's awards show, actor Nick Cannon appeared to defend Hart on social media.

What happened?

After Hart stepped down as Oscar's host — following controversy stemming from seemingly anti-LGBT tweets that Hart published in 2010 and 2011 — Cannon took to Twitter to point out the hypocrisy among some of Hart's critics, namely liberal comedians Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer, and Chelsea Handler.

Cannon brought attention to tweets from each woman that he perceived as anti-LGBT or homophobic.

In response to Cannon's tweets, one fan urged him to ""audit"" his own Twitter feed. But Cannon made it clear he has no plans to do that.

""Nope!! You know I've been saying f***ed up s**t since twitter started! I don't play that politically correct bulls**t! F**k politics!! Only Truth!""

Commentary: President Trump's march to St. John's Church was a necessary show of strength,"Of course Donald Trump's march across the street to the boarded up and smoldering St. John's Church was performance art.

Of. Course. It. Was.

So?

It worked. Now we've got New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo going gangsta on fellow Democrat New York Mayor Bill de Blasio because ""the NYPD and the mayor did not do their job"" to control the raping and pillaging of the Big Apple.

Let's do the math. Trump said he would act swiftly and vigorously with God as his witness, and then polling came out that said 58% of Americans would approve of such a move. Thus, it looks like Gov. Cuomo can add one plus one equals ""defend innocent people and property or else,"" too.

It's as if Trump heard the ghost of Margaret Thatcher a few nights ago when she told George H.W. Bush that it was ""no time to go wobbly."" When you go on offense and show strength, it means it's far more likely that others will be the ones who have to choose whether to get out of the way or get run over.

Which also applies to the protesters who were ""moved"" by Secret Service agents in order for Trump to take his walk across the street to St. John's. Because if the president of the United States, whether it be the orange man or Barack Obama, wants to take a stroll to address the nation, then that means a mob that refuses to get out of his way might not best be labeled as ""peaceful."" Therefore, perhaps some smoke canisters and a rubber bullet or two could help persuade them to get the point.

Truly, my only regret in all this is that when he pulled out that Bible, he didn't say ""Now let us read from Romans 1."" As it was, the very image of Trump merely holding the good book had CNN's progressive faces melting off like the Ark of the Covenant had been opened in front of them Indiana Jones-style. I mean, I've seen vampires run from crucifixes less fast than Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper ran away from all reason and decency because of what was instantly talking-pointed as the ""photo op.""

Hey CNN, your entire operation is a lesson in propaganda-laden photo ops. Choke on it.

For not only was what Trump did more on target for dealing with the situation at hand than his mindless tweeting about polling numbers from the day before, but it is far less vexing in terms of pushing the boundaries of Washington, D.C., decorum than the FBI spamming out LGBT sweet nothings after a failed coup attempt.

With nearly every single public and private American institution in some version of existential crisis or hijacking right now, we need more Bible moments, not less. So here's my advice for all the virtue signalers on both the right and the left who are breathlessly calling Trump's theatrics inappropriate:

Fine. Get off your ass and do it yourself then.

For it is only because you have left the lion locked in its cage for so long that Trump could even hope to become president in the first place. Have you learned nothing?

So keep your foot on the gas, Mr. President. And maybe, just maybe, enough damned fools will wake up and stand a post for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness before there isn't a country left to save any longer.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-trump-show-of-strength,2020-06-03
Deace: A time for justice,"My hunger for the sternest forms of justice is nearly insatiable these days. Even to the point of co-authoring a book calling for a new Nuremberg trial. I want justice because it is a testimony to the truth: God’s truth, which is the ultimate truth. Thus, justice properly understood is not only good, but holy.

But there is more. So much more.

Because in God’s glorious, grace-fueled economy, mercy triumphs over judgment, if only we let it. There is no darkness so vast that mercy can’t wash it clean. So even though current events may, in fact, soon warrant the need for the sort of justice once inflicted on Nazis, they make the stories of mercy only more obvious and beautiful to behold.

For example, this is just within the last week:

Comedian JP Sears, who is well known for destroying the lies of Covidstan, testified to how the experience of the last few years has humbled him to accept a glorious reality far beyond his own proud rationalizations of the past. Please watch him give what is a vastly superior sermon compared to much of what is coming from American churches these days.

Former self-described “slut” and Playboy columnist Bridget Phetasy publicly acknowledged the lies she told not only herself, but countless others over the years in the name of feminism and so-called “empowerment.” The end result, though, is not condemnation but true freedom for both men and women alike, as Phetasy bottom-lines her arrival at the truth like this: “Every woman should feel this way: Sleeping w/ me is a privilege. And you have to be worthy.”

The group Gays Against Groomers has so upset the diabolical moral economy of the Twitter-sphere that it was banned by the platform for “reasons” before being later re-instated on the same day. Cults hate it when those who are supposed to drink the deepest from the Kool-Aid cup reject them. And you don’t have to applaud all that Gays Against Groomers represents to accept that when it comes to saving innocent children from the modern-day Mengeles in our midst, they know what time it is and refuse to bring a knife to a gunfight, as they make statements like this: “There needs to be a federal law banning all trans medicalization and surgical mutilation of minors. All of these doctors and surgeons should not only be stripped of their medical licenses, but never be allowed within 500 yards of a child ever again.”

And lastly, the sororities of the University of Alabama who unanimously told a boy in a dress to get the hell out. Nicely done, ladies.

These people, broken as each and every one of them are in their own way, nonetheless became vessels of light in the last week as they accepted, in no uncertain terms, certain truths of God’s creation. None of which is to say they have accepted all of the truth or even the most important parts of it yet. However, they are closer than they once were to the way, the truth, and the life – as are those who heard what they had to say and were similarly awakened by such unambiguous testimony.

Remember, we are all sinners put back together by God. None of us is without cracks, but those cracks aren’t just scars. Because it is when God’s light shines through the cracks that our true destiny unfolds. That’s when others no longer see our cracks, but his light.

With that said, pray for all those above and be grateful for their courage. For thus says the Lord in the Book of Ezekiel 36:23-28:

I will prove the holiness of my great name,

profaned among the nations,

in whose midst you have profaned it.

Thus the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD,

when in their sight I prove my holiness through you.

For I will take you away from among the nations,

gather you from all the foreign lands,

and bring you back to your own land.

I will sprinkle clean water upon you

to cleanse you from all your impurities,

and from all your idols I will cleanse you.

I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you,

taking from your bodies your stony hearts

and giving you natural hearts.

I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes,

careful to observe my decrees.

You shall live in the land I gave your ancestors;

you shall be my people, and I will be your God.

In this passage, God is obviously speaking specifically about his people, the Israelites. Nevertheless, we are all made in his image, Jew and Gentile alike. So, we can take heed that this reflects the overall heart of God – for mercy to triumph over judgment.

But also take heed of this: If we do not seek his mercy, we will face his judgment.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-a-time-for-justice,2022-08-19
Deace: It's time to slay the dragon,"I’m told that in the neighborhood of 75 speakers showed up earlier this week to the Linn Mar, Iowa, school district meeting, with hundreds of other attendees pouring into overflow space.

The issue at hand was the transgender cult. Which, among other things, wants to open up girls’ school bathrooms to mentally ill and/or depraved boys – as well as enforce privacy contracts between teachers and students that parents aren’t allowed to know about. The details can be read in full here.

By a margin of roughly three to one over the course of four hours, the speakers spoke out against the policy recommendations by school administrators, who clearly should be out of a job if not put in jail. Nonetheless, the school board voted 5-2 to roll out the welcome mat for this hellscape.

“There are a lot of upset parents, employees, and community members,” said board member Matt Rollinger, speaking as an individual and not on behalf of any other board member or district staff. “They are up in arms. But most of the employees are scared to even send an email or a text in fear of retaliation.”

Meanwhile, President Biden took time away from tanking the economy to say that he directed the Department of Homeland Security to operate a Disinformation Governance Board to “protect,” according to executive director Nina Jankowicz, “free speech, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties.” So she’s clearly insane. George Orwell called and said that’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works.

But this is where we live now. An utterly dystopian version of hypersexualized reality is being forced on the children of red state Iowa and elsewhere, while the federal government promises to make sure that version of reality can’t be questioned. The president himself flat-out taunted American parents as he provided aid and comfort to his horde of groomers by saying, “They are not somebody else’s children. They’re yours when they’re in the classroom.”

Um ... nope. It is high time we make somebody pay for this devilry – and pay dearly for it.

“I want these board members gone,” said Linn Mar parent Lindsay Sullivan. “I want the school district to stop listening to this national agenda.”

If that is going to happen, though, it is going to take a level of fight that goes well beyond what the school board and administration just got done ignoring. No more excuses about being too busy or not knowing what to say from anyone, and I mean anyone. Everyone call your legislative representative. Everyone call the legislative leadership. Everyone call the governor’s office. And everyone call some lawyers and get charges leveled against the child abusers, who have somehow been allowed to form a mob under the guise of LGBT clubs or gay/straight alliances.

“It’s almost as if they have been given special rights,” said parent Ralph Kendrick.

That’s because they have, which not surprisingly has caused them to become drunk with power and privilege. They are beyond communicating with on any reasonable level. They plan on conquering and punishing you for the crime of not being them. So that leaves little left to do but ask yourself how you plan to fight back against such tyranny. If not now, when? If not for your children, for whom?



Let Iowa be the place where this evil is crushed. Just as Gov. Ron DeSantis took on Disney in Florida, may Gov. Kim Reynolds use every measure at her disposal to thwart what is nothing short of an existential danger to these schoolchildren’s lives and the future of this country.

Horowitz: Courts are unilaterally redefining sexuality against legitimate rights,"The government can deny you entry into every public university in New York state for not injecting a private novel product into your body or covering your breathing holes all day with a dirty mask. And now, the government can force a private Jewish college to not only accept you but accept a union dedicated to promoting homosexuality and every other sexual behavior codified by the ever-evolving alphabet soup of Sodom and Gomorrah.



Last week, the Supreme Court rejected a request for stay of a New York court ruling which forced the nation’s oldest Jewish university to allow a “gay pride” group to operate within the campus. The court declined to rule on the merits of the request and legality of the issue, and instead punted based on the premise that the institution has other avenues to pursue appeals in the lower courts. It is very telling how it would hesitate for one minute to rule on an unambiguous and dangerous violation of the First Amendment.

“Does the First Amendment permit a State to force a Jewish school to instruct its students in accordance with an interpretation of Torah that the school, after careful study, has concluded is incorrect? The answer to that question is surely ‘no,’” wrote Justice Alito in his dissent, in which he was joined by Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Barrett. “The First Amendment guarantees the right to the free exercise of religion, and if that provision means anything, it prohibits a State from enforcing its own preferred interpretation of Holy Scripture. Yet that is exactly what New York has done in this case, and it is disappointing that a majority of this Court refuses to provide relief.”

Earlier this year, a New York trial court ordered the Manhattan-based college to recognize the LGBT student group’s right to promote anti-Jewish values and to “immediately” grant it “the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges afforded to all other student groups.” Thus far, the other appellate courts have failed to grant an expedited relief. In response, Yeshiva University has firmly put a halt to its sponsorship all student groups until the matter can be resolved.

The necessity of this action means that Justice Kavanaugh declining to involve the Supreme Court essentially green-lit one of the most egregious violations of First Amendment rights in American history. The four judges made it clear in the dissent that the university would win the case if it were judged on the merits.

Broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has allowed lower state and federal courts to trample on religious rights and create novel rights for their favorite sexual “identities” that demand states and religious institutions affirmatively accommodate their bizarre and often dangerous behavior — such as castration operations. It’s not like you could evacuate from blue states like New York and escape this insanity. The courts are pushing it on red states everywhere.









In May, a federal judge in Indiana denied a motion from the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville to allow separate bathrooms for those who are biologically male and female. At the time, the court ruled that keeping separate bathrooms violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution written in 1867. Similarly, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn a decision made by the Ninth Circuit, which forced Idaho to treat a male prisoners like females and fund castration surgery.

Last month, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that transgenderism is a right enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, thereby forcing states to house male prisoners who think they are women in female prisons, endangering the safety of the other inmates. The more conservative Eighth Circuit ruled that Arkansas must allow doctors to perform castration on minors.

Thus, it’s become self-evident that the federal courts are going to force every aspect of the transgender/transhumanist agenda upon the states, and the Supreme Court will not be there to defend history and tradition, as well as sanity and religious liberty. The left fears the coming era of a permanent conservative Supreme Court, and too many conservatives are anticipating with glee such an outcome. In reality, we will likely pay for the impending Dobbs ruling on abortion with the non-Thomas/Alito justices taking turns betraying us on other issues in order to “preserve the integrity of the court.” Nowhere is this more evident that with the transgender issue. Based on recent decisions, even the standard “deeply rooted in history and tradition” created by Dobbs to define an unenumerated right should easily contradict all of these rulings.

So, what is the answer? We must remember Abraham Lincoln’s admonition that “we the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.” If a court can redefine humanity and block a state from common sense recognition of gender (while green-lighting states to force masks and shots), then there is nothing a court cannot do, and we have ceased being a constitutional republic. At some point, states must begin saying “no thank you” to the courts, and Montana might be in the process of doing just that.

Last week, a Montana judge – in this case, a state judge – ruled that the Department of Public Health and Human Services must allow people to change their birth certificate to reflect their perceived gender, in contravention to SB280, a law that was recently signed which prohibits the department from making such changes. The department issued a regulation to change the word “gender” on the birth certificate to “sex,” which it noted is obviously “immutable.” It appears that for now, the executive branch is asserting its authority over issuing birth certificates, something not in the purview of the courts.

“The Department thoroughly evaluated the judge’s vague April 2022 decision and crafted our final rule to be consistent with the decision. It’s unfortunate that the judge’s ruling today does not square with his vague April decision. The 2022 final rule that the Department issued on September 9 remains in effect, and we are carefully considering next steps,” said Charlie Brereton, director of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.

We are going to need more of this throughout the red states. When Alexander Hamilton promised that the courts would wield “neither force nor will,” he certainly never imagined the will to redefine human sexuality, much less the ability to enforce such an absurdity.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-courts-are-unilaterally-redefining-sexuality-against-legitimate-rights,2022-09-19
Horowitz: Former Trump budget director proposes model balanced budget for GOP to run with,"One of the excuses given for passing an omnibus bill in the lame-duck session is that a new GOP-controlled House won’t have enough time to deal with rewriting the entire fiscal year 2023 budget right when it’s sworn in with so much on its plate. Well, Russ Vought of the Center for Renewing America, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, released a budget blueprint doing all the work for the legislators. It balances the budget in 10 years by focusing mainly on cutting woke and weaponized bureaucracies rather than popular programs, which makes it very hard for Democrats to demagogue. Now it’s time to stand behind this blueprint and begin messaging its key points headed into next year’s budget fight.



For many years, Republicans wrongly communicated the message that the only way to get our fiscal house in order is to focus mainly on cutting entitlements. Because they never really intended to touch that hot potato, they gave up on cutting spending altogether and actually went along with every Democrat spending increase of every harmful bureaucratic agency funded under the annual appropriations process as “discretionary spending.”

However, although the discretionary spending is smaller than the entitlement spending, it is still significant. Moreover, the cost of those agencies and policies is much greater than their appropriations price tag. They destroy the fabric of our country through woke policies and fascistic power grabs that harm life, liberty, and property. For example, the budget authority for the EPA is about $9 billion, sadly considered a paltry sum relative to our $6 trillion annual budget. However, its true cost is in the hundreds of billions it takes out of our economy in terms of lost energy production, defective and junky products, lost jobs, and massive energy-driven inflation. Ditto for so many of the agencies governing land use, minerals, energy, and manufacturing in the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Labor.

Can one place a price tag on the CDC and NIH and what they have unleashed upon our civilization? Or the FBI surveilling and arresting political opponents?

“Budgeting is too often an exercise in accounting and austerity, where every program takes a hit, rather than an opportunity to examine what in fact the country is spending money on,” wrote Vought in his introduction. “Nor is budgeting typically aimed at maintaining a political coalition necessary to vote for the plan. It should be. The Left has no interest in ever regaining fiscal rationality. Why should their spending priorities be protected? Particularly when such programs are damaging the very communities supporting the government with their taxes. Why should billions be spent on thousands of interwoven nonprofits, all with a vested interest in furthering multiculturalism through an open border strategy and engaging in lawfare against any effort to control the border?”

A perfect example Vought focuses on in his budget is cutting HUD’s Section 8 program. Overall, his proposal cuts HUD’s budget by 43% because the department’s policies “spread crime and dysfunction into safe neighborhoods as part of ‘affordable housing’ activism hostile towards single-family homes.”

Under each section of the budget, the blueprint targets specific legal policies that should be defunded or terminated. Individually, many of them represent only an infinitesimal portion of the national budget, but their impact on our lives, liberty, property, and character as a nation is priceless – not in a good way.

As for the military, unlike every other GOP budget, which indiscriminately throws money at the military, this budget would roughly maintain the status quo on top-line spending ($8.4 trillion as opposed to $8.9 trillion over 10 years). However, the funding would be focused on the hardware and capabilities needed to deter China, while entire woke and broke programs would be cut. Foreign aid would also be dramatically trimmed.

Yet these cuts, and the ensuing growth and unshackling of the economy they would induce (assuming a reasonable 2.7% average GDP growth rate), would result in $12.3 trillion in lower spending over 10 years. The result would be a balanced budget by 2032 rather than a $2.2 trillion deficit, as projected under the current baseline. And again, this is all done without cutting Medicare or Social Security.

Furthermore, by stripping the bureaucracies of the ability to destroy our economy from within, it would preclude things like COVID fascism from ever happening again. Remember, our government spent $5.5 trillion on COVID, not to mention an almost equal sum from Federal Reserve shenanigans. That is money that was never projected in previous budget plans, but it was unleashed upon us. Controlled demolitions, including energy lockdowns, will undoubtedly occur again unless the bureaucracies are cut, their policies banned, and their circuitous collaboration with “private” companies and NGOs neutered. That is where the battle not just for civilization but for fiscal sanity will be won or lost, not with Social Security and Medicare.

Aside from policy riders that would ban unconstitutional, illogical, or immoral government policies and programs, the budget targets some of the woke and weaponized agencies and programs for across-the-board cuts. Here is a snippet from the budget summary:

7% cut to the DOJ, including a 13% cut to the FBI intelligence and counterintelligence programs (while increasing resources for actual crime fighting by 18%).

$22 billion or 20% cut to HHS, including a 37% cut to the CDC to refocus its efforts toward fighting infectious diseases and away from sexually transmitted and chronic diseases, a 50% cut to NIAID (led by Anthony Fauci) because of its commitment to gain-of-function research, and eliminating woke bureaucracy.

$26 billion or 43% cut to HUD, including a three-year phase-out of Section 8 grants that are a magnet for crime and decreased property values and cuts to the fair housing bureaucracy committed to breaking up neighborhoods with single-family homes.

$26 billion or 45% cut to foreign aid, ensuring that State and USAID are no longer funding drag shows in Ecuador, the training of LGBT activists in Senegal, or gay pride parades in Prague.

$18 billion or 26% cut to the Department of Education’s bureaucracy funding CRT and ensuring that states avoid this bureaucracy with a large block grant.

Obviously, once we restore our civilization, we will be in a stronger position to deal with Social Security down the road. As for Medicare and Medicaid, we must first rebuild a parallel health care system built upon freedom, science, direct primary care, and decentralization, in order to transition people into something much better than these ailing socialist programs.

House Republicans must make it clear that the budget deadline should expire early next year and that something akin to this blueprint will be their messaging and red line. They should pass a budget along these lines and refuse to move off it. They should make it clear today that they have zero plans to pass a Democrat budget and will expose the harms of funding a woke and weaponized government every day through briefings, press conferences, and hearings, including through a government shutdown if necessary. Doing this will take Social Security and Medicare off the table as a distraction through which Democrats can obfuscate their harmful and unpopular policies.



Right now, we are drowning in tyranny and literally life-threatening biomedical security policies. We must focus on the life raft. Now we just need a speaker willing to take up the mantle.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-former-trump-budget-director-proposes-model-balanced-budget-for-gop-to-run-with,2022-12-08
Horowitz: What Republican Party? Senate GOP prepares to codify gay marriage,"At least we can now stop scratching our heads wondering why the Republicans failed to be a viable party. Conservatives were pining for the GOP to hold 53-54 Senate seats, but this week the Senate GOP Conference, led by Mitch McConnell, is demonstrating that Democrats really have a supermajority in the upper chamber anyway, at least as it relates to the most important civilization issues.



Take a hard look at this Gallup survey of Americans who identify as the sexual alphabet soup by generation. Anyone with a modicum of common sense will realize that one need not be a Bible thumper (Allah forbid) to understand the harm that the virulent promotion of the homosexual agenda has wreaked upon this nation. There is nothing natural going on here, as when people are born with brown eyes or green eyes. How on earth have we descended so quickly to a generation that now identifies with an ever-growing number of alphabet soup sexual identities that have led to the destruction of civilization, which is built upon marriage, family, and procreation?

Have we ever considered the consequences of grooming 20% of an entire generation – and rapidly increasing every year – to behave and identity in a way that will not lead to normal family structure or even human procreation?

Again, from a purely secular standpoint, even if one has no problem with these particular behaviors and even if one thinks society needs to protect and recognize them in some way, we have long since accommodated that. The pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that children being raised today are literally convinced that it’s like a 50-50 proposition. You can either marry a man or a woman – that’s just how it is. Given the fact that Obergefell already forces states, at least for the time being, to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples, why on earth would there be a need to codify it into law even further and place our thumbs on the scale?

Yet this is exactly what Republicans have agreed to do. Later this week, the Senate will vote on HR 8404, which will force red states to recognize any form of marriage adopted in any other state. “We look forward to this legislation coming to the floor and are confident that this amendment has helped earn the broad, bipartisan support needed to pass our commonsense legislation into law,” Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said in a statement.

Schumer has given the impression that they will get well over 10 Republican votes to avoid the filibuster, and there is no evidence that McConnell and other prominent GOP leaders are even speaking out against the bill, much less whipping against it. In fact, House GOP leaders already declined to whip against the even stronger bill in July, which downright forced red states to recognize gay marriage even among residents within the state. Even the amended bill with the supposed religious liberty protection only protects nonprofit organizations, essentially codifying “bake the cake” as the law.

Whatever the final vote is this week, it is quite evident that the entire GOP establishment sees no problem with what is going on here.

Is it their position that not enough people are identifying as something that will ensure there is no procreation? When will they be happy? When that number is at 40% of the population? A majority? According to Gallup, the number of people identifying as one of the glorified letters in the alphabet has doubled as a share of the population in just nine years. The number spiked 27% just in one year since last year’s survey!

Why would something that is so glorified by every aspect of culture, law, and policy suddenly need a reaffirmation from federal law? After all, under Obergefell, red states have to grant same-sex couples licenses anyway. Clearly, this is designed to further promote the broader grooming agenda. It’s no longer just the absence of Judeo-Christian ethos, but the adoption of a new rigid and stoic adherence to paganism, which is rooted in transhumanism and is rooting for depopulation.

Are Republicans absolutely blind to what is going on in society and how this is part of the broader transhumanist and depopulation agendas that seek to deracinate familiar ties, procreation, and traditional stable family structure and turn everyone into androgynous artificial intelligence bots controlled by global governments?

Again, this is no longer just a social or biblical values issue. Gone are the days when gay people were the underdog and it was just a matter of supposedly promoting acceptance for what was thought to be a tiny population and, by some, as a natural phenomenon. Nobody can look at society today and suggest that this trend is natural, nor can one suggest it is helpful to the healthy growth of any civilization, even a secular one.

This is no longer a proposition of “Hey, just give them a marriage license and it will be over.” With the growth of the sexual alphabet acronym every few years, it is shocking how Republicans refuse to recognize where this is coming from and where it is headed. The mantra of “this is not the hill to die on” rings hollow as an entire generation of children are being groomed into a dystopian transhumanist environment of never understanding the basic meaning of marriage, life, sexuality, and even humanity itself.



While conservatives lament the problem with mail-in ballots and possible ballot fraud, we have mail-in Republicans who commit the ultimate election fraud. Chuck Schumer was quite prescient when he said that gay marriage is “precisely the kind of bill that Democrats and Republicans can rally around together."" After all, amid all the WWE-style fighting in Washington, it’s on the issues that matter, in the way they matter, at the time they matter that both sides are as thick as thieves in their war on civilization.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-republican-party-senate-gop-prepares-to-codify-gay-marriage,2022-11-16
Political ideology won't help people when they die: Christians should focus on sharing the gospel,"While many of us spend time focusing on news, politics, and the never-ending culture war, the celebration of Christmas offers Christians the opportunity to zoom out and remember that ultimately, our mission should always be spreading the message of salvation, ""how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures..."" (1 Corinthians 15:3b-4)

Humans are sinful. Simply peruse some news headlines or look into your own heart, the evidence is everywhere. Inherent in the celebration of Christmas is the recognition of our own sinfulness and need of salvation.

""For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" (Romans 6:23)

When someone is sick, it is better to treat the cause rather than the symptoms. And by way of analogy, there are many problems in the nation today — from crime, to abortion, to the LGBT agenda, just to name a few — but the root of those problems is human sinfulness, and the gospel treats the disease, not the symptoms.

When someone trusts in Christ's payment for their sins, they are saved from God's wrath and given eternal life. When they make the Bible the foundation of their thinking, their worldview will change. And when more people in the U.S. have their worldview shaped by the Word of God, the country will change for the better.



While proselytizing about politics might get someone to change their mind about political issues, political ideology won't help them when they die. But telling someone about the the gift of salvation that God is offering freely by his grace could change their eternity.

""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast."" (Ephesians 2:8-9)

Ben Shapiro DISMANTLES Supreme Court's LGBTQ decision: 'Cramming down a one-size-fits-all rule' does NOT work,"The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro joined ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Tuesday to break down everything you need to know about the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling to extend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protections to gay, lesbian, and transgender people.

Shapiro argued that the decision was ""nonsensical on the merits"" — from its effect on business owners and its contradictory principles of discrimination to how it conflicts with Title IX and religious protections under the U.S. Constitution.

""The Supreme Court tries to, very often, settle questions that are still unsettled, and that really ought not be settled by the Supreme Court. And that is in this particular case. This is not within the Supreme Court's purview,"" Shapiro said.

""And so, there are a lot of people today who are celebrating, 'Oh, look, it's a new America. We're all unified now because there's a top-down rule.' Here's the thing: America is as politically divided as it has been, certainly in my lifetime and maybe in the lifetime of your listeners, including the '60s. The idea that you're going to have anybody at the top of the federal government cramming down a one-size-fits-all rule, it's really a problem,"" he continued. ""Are you going to keep the country together by cramming down one rule from the top? Whether you like the rule or you don't like the rule, that's a dangerous thing.""



""I think that's what the French Revolution was all about,"" Glenn added. ""The French Revolution really was about, 'We're going to enforce morality. We're going to enforce what we believe is right. And if you don't like it, guillotine.' It doesn't work.""

Ryan: Carol Swain wants the young Americans,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. —""The Dude""

The college students snap their fingers in unison. One of them yells at guest speaker Carol Swain and demands she wait until they finish! For months, the students have done everything in their power to get her disinvited from speaking here at Emmanuel College, a small Catholic university in Boston, down the street from Fenway Park. A palpable hostility radiates the air — or, rather, two hostilities: One from the students, and one from Swain, who seems to have enacted the Saul Alinsky principle of ridicule to infuriate her opponents — ""opponents"" is her word.

The students snap for a solid 20 seconds, with a Che Guevara scowl. It's clear that they see their snapping as warfare, but Swain just laughs, a grunting laugh that invokes her esophagus, as if she wants them to pick up on her nonchalance, her unflappability. The way she sees it, she can mock them and they can mock themselves but she cannot be mocked, and she will not be beaten.

Fox News hero and Prager U mainstay — heralded by the right as a black conservative who braved academia, whose life has been a series of miracles and disasters, who tried to kill herself several times when she was younger but now believes in God and plans to be the next mayor of Nashville, Tennessee. (She'd be the first black woman to do so.)

Her story, how she rose from the hellish lows of poverty to become an Ivy League professor and author and talk show host and political pundit, is about as American as Route 66 diners. Her resume is longer than this profile. Awards, grants, fellowships, honors, many of which include words like ""lifelong"" and ""permanent."" Yale. Duke. Princeton. Virginia Tech. North Carolina. Vanderbilt. Documentaries, keynote speakerships, panels, books, articles, appearances on CNN, Fox News, C-Span. She was name-dropped by the Supreme Court — twice. Her book, ""The New White Nationalism: Its Challenge to Integration,"" which eerily predicted the rise of the alt-right and its pseudo-intellectual racism and sneering identity politics, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

What percentage of controversy does someone need in order to be famous? It's not zero, and, with the exception of Donald Trump and Kanye West, no one can survive 100. Swain comes in at about 50 percent, just as famous as she is infamous. The Southern Poverty Law Center has repeatedly featured her on its ""Hatewatch,"" labeling her an enemy of the LGBT community and an apologist for white nationalism (she wrote about it in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal). Swain has a 4/5 rating on RateMyRacistProfessor.com, which is an actual website.

More than once during her academic career, students demanded she be fired. Petitions. Op-eds. Satirical cartoons. In 2015, while she was a professor at Vanderbilt, her article about Islam provoked campuswide protests, which the university meekly supported, denouncing Swain in the process despite her having tenure. She was flooded with hate mail, some of which contained death and rape threats, including a box labeled ""Fondle with care."" Inside, a phallic-shaped cutout with the words, ""You need to loosen up.""

So today's angry college students are nothing new for Swain.

A few weeks ago, she told you in an email that she'd reduced her rate to a fraction of what she normally charges ""because of one determined student who wouldn't give up,"" then she quoted Isaiah 40:31: ""But they that wait upon the Lord … shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.""

Every time another protester asks a question, some weird surge of adrenaline rushes through the other students. They groan, they cross their arms as they roll their eyes, they laugh in sarcastic disbelief, they ask unanswerable questions then get pissed when Swain doesn't answer right away.

""I've always been ahead of my time,"" Swain told you earlier, with an elusive smile. ""I always had a feeling that there was something I had to do. I always had a sense of urgency and I was always serious.""

She often talks about how she was predestined to be famous — not just by merit, but as an act of God, as a lottery-like selection from above. This strikes you as a crafty approach. A God-destined path defies any sort of dissent. If God himself has paved the way, you're just following orders.

She shuffles in her waxy-yellow high heels, sneaking glances at a legal pad, in the same pastel-yellow blazer and yellow zebra-print blouse she had on earlier, as she repeats the speech she gave you five hours ago at the restaurant.

""College is no longer about education,"" she says. ""It's about teaching people what to think and just have them regurgitate that back. It's really a misuse of money. And there are so many fields that people can major in and those fields are totally useless. Gender studies, women's studies, ethnic studies, all those things are egregious.""

She laughs. Nobody else laughs. ""Might as well call them the Egregious Studies Department.""

She laughs some more. ""And then people wonder why with a bachelor's degree they can't get a good job: Because they're not trained to do anything but protest.""



Her voice undulates with a Virginia accent. She talks slow, in a charming, half-refined way. The vowels blend together, combed through by sighs that fade into nothing. Occasionally, she snorts after finishing a sentence. And, anytime she sits down, she rubs her knees in what at first seems like a nervous or compulsive motion, but turns out to be something she just does.

You had expected an auditorium but this is just a normal room, with a lectern facing rows of chairs packed with students. A hundred or so, and another 80 standing. There are two distinct groups of students. The students in the front rows are clearly pro-Swain: well-dressed, attentive, mostly girls, with three boys in suit-and-tie. The rest of the students (the majority) scowl, with a variety of neck tattoos or half-shaven heads or horseshoe nose rings, and a few of the boys wear pink or yellow lipstick and layers of rouge on their cheeks. You chat with people from both groups, and every one of them is genuinely kind.

*

Five hours earlier. You and Swain wedge into a booth at Longwood Bar & Grille, the fancified second-floor restaurant of the Inn at Longwood at the Medical Center. Drab piano music putters along, just barely louder than the clank of whiskey glasses and the hum of different NFL games. Designed to look like a pub. Battered red carpet. This place smells awful; rank and bare and ugly like a small-town casino.

""They got me the cheapest place they could find,"" she says, then laughs, softly. ""You can tell they didn't want me to come, can't you?"" She tilts her head, ""It's all good, though. I'm just glad I got here.""

Then she tells you that she's running for mayor of Nashville. She says it like you didn't already know, but both of you know that you already knew.

""I never ever in my wildest dreams thought I'd be running for a political office,"" she says, and you're not sure you believe her.

She adds that the Nashville election is irregular because the last mayor, Megan Barry, the city's first woman mayor, resigned in disgrace. Embezzlement, felony theft, adultery. She'd been having an affair with her bodyguard, who she kept on salary at about $100,000. They took trips together. Places far from Nashville, like San Francisco and Athens, Greece.

Over Swain's right shoulder, a garage-park food court thrives, full of off-brand restaurants. Clearly, there's a hospital nearby, because a good two-thirds of the people wear scrubs and look exhausted and Carol Swain is running for mayor of Nashville, a fact that she'll repeat at least two dozen times by the end of the night.

After years in academia, Swain has sought a political career. (Courtesy of Carol Swain)

""Spiritually, even growing up, I never felt that I fit in,"" she says. ""I had a crippling form of shyness that would affect me for the rest of my life. And so part of my story is a struggle for a voice.""

Behind her, 1980s-arcade-game graphics plaster the booth's high walls, gaudy neon that gobs across drab vinyl.

""Since [the students] didn't want me to come, since they're liberal, I thought I would make them endure the story of my life,"" she told you.

Swain began at the bottom of things in the abject poverty of rural Virginia, the second of 12 children, all crowded into a shack without running water. Her mother refused to accept welfare of any kind, including school-provided lunches. Swain was a high school dropout, married in her late teens to ""an older neighbor,"" then a mother of three, two boys and a girl who died of sudden infant death syndrome.

After a few dark years, she went to community college, then earned an undergraduate degree, then a graduate degree, then a doctoral degree. She landed a series of professor jobs at elite universities. Suddenly, at a young age, she was a hot shot.



""I knew it, too,"" she tells you, ""I knew how I looked.""

Her makeup is smooth and fluid, and the only visible wrinkles — her deepest — originate from smiling, tiny crescents at the drape of her eyes, evidence of a deep optimism.

""I've always done the opposite of what people say,"" Swain tells you. ""I've always been different. I was born kinda different. But I was shy. Most of my life. Even when I was at Princeton.""

She says that all of the other professors at Princeton spoke in long bursts that eventually led into sardonic put-downs. It annoyed and intimidated her. The longer she stayed, the more silenced she became. Then, she says, the other black professors turned on her.

""They didn't see me coming,"" she says. ""All of a sudden there was this black professor at Princeton that they didn't know, that didn't go through their ranks.""

They called her a sell-out. Told her that people hated her. Said the only reason she had made it this far was affirmative action. That got to her. ""I would pull out my resumé and think, 'Well maybe I didn't do this stuff. Maybe they're right.'""





II.

You shuffle outside, immediately stung by the cold. The sun is out, but there's an ugly scatter behind it. Blue skies, with white clouds, curdling at the bottom, ready to spill down rain. In a matter of 30 minutes, a cold grey shrouds the city of Boston, and dark violet unpeels the sky, and after that the sun doesn't return for a week. It's mid-April, which is usually springtime in Boston. But this winter was by all accounts a brutal winter. Former first lady Barbara Bush died last night, and the Boston Celtics lead the Milwaukee Bucks 2-0 in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.



Emmanuel College is gated, fortified near the Charles River, and as soon as you see it you mumble the word ""Expensive."" Eventually you wander the Administration Building, into a hall overflowing with people as Swain is speaking.

""It just happened gradually, then it happened so fast,"" Swain says. ""I've been a professor almost 30 years, and I saw the changes begin — soon as [Barack] Obama got elected, is when it really got on steroids, but I think the groundwork was laid before that.""

At first, most people stay quiet. They listen. But they wiggle a little more with each minute. They're desperate to start the Q&A. Some of them clench notepads into balled-up fists and groan as they write down something Swain just said. An ambulance whistles past outside, sirens carried loudly through the room by a cold draft. After a moment, the room gets quiet again and Swain tries to ease the tension with a joke about how, if only she'd given a trigger warning she would have been welcomed by these snowflakes. The silence. All tension. The opposite of laughter. ""Oof,"" you say to the woman beside you.

Then Swain says that she wants to tell her story. Then she tells her story. And it reminds her of J.D. Vance:

""The guy that wrote ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" she says. ""This white guy that went to Yale, that came from dire poverty in Kentucky. He went to graduate school and he was like a fish out of water. He was nothing but white trash, his family was nothing but hillbilly, but he talked about that honor code. He also talks about how poor whites are like inner-city blacks, that they have a code that they just don't wanna work,"" that sentence provoked literal gasps, ""and there's an underclass, and he was able to escape all that, because his grandmother was really stern, but she was totally hillbilly. They were the kinda people that would pistol-whip somebody.""

At the back of the room, a slant of professors in sweaters lean into a poker table covered with store-bought cookies, bottles of water, and an assortment of processed meats. The professors are trying with a gymnastic intensity to seem relaxed, arms crossed past the armpits. Then Swain brings her story into present day and says that she's running for mayor of Nashville and God himself ordained it.

*

""Spiritually,"" she says, ""the person that pleaded with me on April 1st, Easter evening, had been trying to get me to run for mayor for a long time and I kept saying 'No no no'.""

""Just pull the paperwork,"" he told her. ""You don't have to turn it in.'""

That night, she prayed.

""The next morning I woke up with 12 issue positions that I thought were important for Nashville,"" she says. ""Those are the positions on my website."" She wrote them in a notebook where she also keeps her prayers.

Down the hall, people lean forward during evening Mass in the chapel between classrooms and offices. It arches up four stories, the innards of a basilica. More than a room, more like a Gothic cathedral. The air inside has a sacred intensity. Meanwhile, half-a-football-field down the hall, students doubt whether God exists at all.

*

By far, the most outwardly incensed student is the self-identified gender-nonbinary person in a Red Hawaiian shirt with a weed-leaf imprint. Crew cut gelled at the top, and floral tattoos, soft yet rocky, the length of their arms. Buddy Holly glasses and a snarl that contains both the bravado of young Elvis and the depravity of later Elvis. The person leans into the wall, occasionally scribbling into a reporter-style notepad and shouldering the concrete like it's a bad guy.

Swain fumbles her speech to an end, then starts the Q&A. A glow in her eyes: She is just as ready for blood as the protesters are. This feels like the main event, like the speech was just a formality.

Immediately, the gender nonbinary student says: ""How can you defile welfare and at the same time belittle the culture of underprivileged peoples of color and disenfranchisement being murdered by oppressive institutions that — ?""

Swain cuts off the protester, talks over them, raising her hand in the ""Shut up"" motion, then fires back with the story about her mother refusing welfare, mentions the deleterious effect that government assistance has had on her siblings. And when the student tries to respond, Swain slaps the air and says, ""You have probably never been told this but I've heard enough from you and it's time for you to be quiet. Next question.""

The student clenches fists and groans and tries to interrupt again. But Swain has moved on, so the protester stomps out of the room, mumbling to each person they pass and gripping their belt loop and suspenders.

*

""How can you call yourself a Christian and not like Marxist doctrine?"" a student asks Swain.

""I don't understand the question.""

""You mentioned that you worship power — .""

""I said I studied power,"" Swain replies, lifting her hand to stop the girl from interrupting. ""Because it's important to study the ideas of the world.""

""Whatever,"" the girl says, with an eye roll. ""So basically you hate Marxism but, like, love power. But power is power.""

She gawks around at her peers, as if devastated that they haven't praised her. She repeats herself, louder and more exasperated: ""Power is power, okay? Power is power!""

In unison, the students begin snapping, in unison and protest, then the questions resume. Swain derides each fallacy, and enjoys it, though, to be fair, not without committing a few of her own. She does it — all of it — combatively, with confrontation in mind. Fight them with their own dirty moves: Everything is relative and feelings are facts and disagreement is an act of violence. She has perfected the art of identity politics and microaggressions and has weaponized both for provocation.

When one of the white students, a man, starts telling her that she is delusional for believing in capitalism and ""other systems of hegemonic subjugation and oppression....""

""Are you really verbally assaulting a woman?"" Swain asks, with a scowl. ""A woman who could be your grandma? What gives you the right to verbally assault a black woman? Do you have a problem with black women in a position of power? Or is it just black people in general you dislike? And with my life. Living in poverty, no running water. Hah! Oppression!"" She grunts.

""Oppression is being so poor and hopeless that you can't make it through high school. If anyone in here can talk about oppression, it's me, and I'm proof that the 'system' you have in mind will only keep you on welfare and spending money on who knows — if you're lucky."" She points to herself. ""I am all the proof you need.""

The student's eyes bulge in terror as he collapses into his seat. It's no coincidence that the only people who get truly confrontational with Swain are young black women, all convened in a line, shoulder-to-shoulder down the row. At the perfect moment, they stand up in unison. Several of them had asked questions earlier, each time with the quivering voice of an angry, over-prepared 19-year-old, but now they would stand together.

Swain answers the first question, something about her stance on incarceration. ""I believe that whites and blacks have far more in common than most people believe and —""

But the women interrupt her and shout their questions one at a time, and when Swain tries to answer, they shout back that, ""No, no, you need to listen.""

The rest of the student protesters cheer as the young black women insult the black woman in ways that remain off-limits for all others, a troubling dynamic not unlike the battle royal in ""Invisible Man."" By now, most of the room is standing. When one of the women shouts ""Black Lives Matter,"" the room erupts in chants. But all the slogans are different. Without any organization, there's no overall message, just chaos and noise.

One of the suit-and-tie front-row guys leaps up, says, ""Dr. Swain only has time for one more question.""

This infuriates the protesters, who continue to shout all at once. Then they really lose it when Swain, for her last question, points to one of the neatly dressed women in the front row, who asks Swain a total softball question. Then the nicely dressed guy says, ""All right, that was the last one.""

The protesting students disagree. They want Swain to know that they will ask as many questions as they like, for as long as they please, and what right does she have to ignore them when they have plenty more to say?

III.

After teaching at Princeton, following a baptism and a shift in politics, Swain was hired at Vanderbilt, where she would take her fight against academia to the breaking point.

""I like to say they hired one person and another person showed up for the job,"" she told you.

Once there, she took any sign of hostility as a challenge — her rebellious spirit at work. In tense situations, when many academics might have quietly receded into the bushes, Swain goaded, poked, antagonized; all part of her strategy to become the conservative Saul Alinsky, whose ""Rules for Radicals"" has served as an instruction manual for the politically rambunctious.

""My favorite rule is 'Make your enemy live up to his rule book,' and 'Use ridicule,'"" she said. ""There is a place for the person that's gonna use ridicule and challenge the administrations of colleges to make them live up to their rule book. And that rule book is the college handbook, and the mission statements, and all those lofty things they claim they stand for.""

In response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, Swain penned an article for The Tennessean titled, ""Charlie Hebdo attacks prove critics were right about Islam."" (It reveals a lot about Swain that, in response to the horrific attacks, she didn't write about free speech or terrorism or even Western values.) The article is short, barely more than 500 words, but, for the Vanderbilt community, the message was strong enough to cause an uproar.

The campus erupted in protests, which is itself an interesting reaction given the overall context: Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine known for flamboyantly using free speech to deride every doctrine, orthodoxy, government, and religion, was attacked by Islamic State-affiliated extremists who were so enraged by the magazine's satirical artwork that they murdered 12 Charlie Hebdo staff members.

A week later, in a show of free speech, Swain criticized Islam in an op-ed, which disproportionately enraged Vanderbilt students, leading to above-mentioned death- and rape-threats. In other words, the students' outrage can be syllogistically linked to an anti-free-speech stance that lands them on the side of homicidal terrorists. Obviously, their reaction pales in comparison (by far!), but there is something unsettling about how the students were more outraged by Swain's ideologically-guided words than by the terrorists' ideologically-guided murder spree.

""Then the LGBT people decided that I was a threat to Muslims and LGBT people,"" Swain said. ""They invented that.""

A few months later, she criticized Black Lives Matter during a debate on CNN. ""I said, one of the reasons young black men get killed is they resist arrest. Then the black people on campus got mad.""

A friend contacted her, ""Congratulations, you've united the campus.""

After Swain authored a series of mocking and intentionally offensive posts on Facebook, Vanderbilt students took to change.org and demanded Swain be fired. Not to be outdone, Swain responded in an interview with a local ABC station, describing the students as ""sad and pathetic, in the sense that they're college students and they should be open to hearing more than one viewpoint.""

The students then demanded that ""Vanderbilt administrators confer with the American Civil Liberties Union to create and mandate a diversity training program for all Vanderbilt faculty – including Professor Carol Swain.""

Swain responded on Facebook: ""Only an idiot would think a 61-year-old black woman who has spent much of her life in academia would benefit from sensitivity training.""

IV.

About 9:30 p.m., Swain and the neatly dressed students from the front two rows all shuttle to a dimly-lit sports bar nearby. You walk, alone. Each draft has an ice-whip of Atlantic Ocean. Your teeth chatter and your bones grow wooden. You duck into Sal's Pizza. A high school team is playing at Fenway tonight. It's 1-1 in the 6th inning. The grounds crew, in matching red jackets and Red Sox beanies, have snuck out to get a pizza slice. They groan and say the game is so boring. ""He just slid into second, did you see that, he didn't even need to, he was just as bored as everyone else!""

You ask if it's normal for a high school team to be playing at Fenway Park on a Wednesday so soon after the start of the MLB season. ""Let's just say it is if your daddy is a certain someone, with a certain sized wallet and a certain influence on town, feel me?""

The Mafioso vagueness has you nodding in awkward confusion. ""Yeah, power is power,"" you say, then cringe. Then you trek back outside then move along. Maybe it's because, on Monday, an American won the Boston Marathon for the first time in decades, or maybe it's always like this, but everywhere you look, people are jogging. Always. At all times. In all places. Even when you round the corner into the restaurant, you have to dance through two joggers lit up in their spacesuits.The place is crowded. It takes you a moment to find Swain, but then you see her waving in her bright yellow blazer. The music is so loud that the bar's tinted glass wobbles decoratively. The students have filed in around Swain, around the oblong table, with Swain prim at the middle, like a Facebook rendition of ""The Last Supper.""

*

The students lean toward Swain, barely able to hear anything over the Taylor Swift track — which seems to jut from everywhere, a cavalcade of sound. Look, look what you made me do. Nothing in the place has as much authority as the music. Even the waitstaff lean in when they're talking, even they haven't gotten used to the volume. Platters rush through the air, saddled onto shoulders. The waiters are dressed all-black, so it's like the trays are floating, and the steam and the delightful stink of bleu cheese hover past like kites with free will. Blame it on the loud music, but Swain is only able to talk about the Nashville campaign. Does it always cul-de-sac back to her and her poll numbers? So you talk with the two young men and the one young woman near you.

""I am about to go to med school. I wrote a model detailing the accumulation of plaque in the brain resulting in dementia!""

""I am from Maine, a town with a population of 350 citizens, and Boston is exciting and I have worked hard to find the good in things, and there it was all along: Here in Boston!""

Each of them weaves through the concepts and theories and universe-brightening ideas that illuminate a college student. The two young men rejoice that restaurants in Boston stay open past 6:30 p.m. and show you their pocket knives. All of the students have an air of unhatched success. You shirk back, with a glimpse of how the world has changed. Growing up, politics were a flighty, off-hand thing. They weren't the premise of each conversation like they seem to be lately. And you could get along with someone who held differing opinions without the slightest concern — you might know a person for years before politics ever even came up.

*

A Bruce Springsteen song fades out, and it's quiet long enough for you to hear Swain's grandiloquent twang. She recites. She talks about certain things. While conversations around her change, she returns to herself and what her life means, in the grand scheme of thing. Of course, that's why she's here in Boston to begin with. But also maybe she's a closed circuit. Conversations always returns to her accomplishments (there are tons), to her life (it should be a Hallmark movie), and to her genius in attacking the very system (academia) that made her an authority on disdainful systems like academia.

The music is deafening. You nod at the waiter, ""Just bring me a big beer!""

""A big one?""

""Big beer,"" you holler. ""Real big! Very thirsty!""

You look at Swain, who despite the occasional bout of arrogance or venom is most of all charming and sweet. Maybe that's just who she is: A motherly type, with an unwell mother, and here she is with these sweet, attentive young folks — who themselves feel alienated, lost in a world of social upheaval. Each of them says it, in many ways: As right-leaning college students, they often feel voiceless and outnumbered, the target of intimidation, sometimes even by their professors. Each of them, in one way or another, details a history of responsibility, of hard work and conviction. Most people their age, in their situation, college-age in Boston, would use a Wednesday night mid-semester to plow through some watery beer or weave along backroads in a friend's red Miata with a joint.

But no. The group of cheery, polite, good-postured college students have the style and attitude of a Tuesday work meeting, as if they were born this way — so sturdy and austere — as if they skipped ahead to adulthood by choice and never thought about it again, all of which creeps you out a little: you feel the urge to take them to get tattoos or drink wine and eat mushrooms. They've got money and success in their postures, waiting. They are all so grown up. No doubt, they'll run companies and win awards and become surgeons and lawyers and maybe earn a seat in Congress — perhaps more. They are responsible, they are engaging, they are kind.

Hopefully, they can get away with it, can jet past the developmental weirdness of their 20s and tackle careers and achieve success without a wince of regret. Hopefully, they don't reach their 50s and succumb to a gurgling resentment of having never been wild. Or maybe it's you who are the problem.

Before you can parse the thought further, the waiter arrives with your beer. The students immediately giggle as the waiter lowers it, gripped with both hands: An outlandish, Dr. Seuss configuration of glass, a statuesque arrangement taller than the table.

After a series of What did you say's and Huh's, you learn that you inadvertently ordered the signature drink: A yard of beer. You look at the table and realize everybody else ordered water. Only a few of them are even 21. It's impossible to drink beer from a massive funnel cake of glass without feeling ridiculous.

One by one, the dishes arrive. Swain and the students sit politely, waiting for something.

One of the phrases Swain repeats, ""I get energy from young folks."" These young folks no doubt have an energy. A presence much different than that of the students from earlier with their Snapchat scowl and their weeknight parties — although, the protest crowd is not without its own charm, a charm, admittedly, more age-appropriate, uninterested in suits and formal dresses.

All at once, you feel the glow of attention and it takes a moment for you to realize that everyone else has clasped hands. The relief you feel, the calibrated warmth — that's their energy. It is definite and seemly. At a bar, near a college, next to Fenway Park, amid the chaos and the shouts of people gulping Jager shots, with the air-conditioned scent of chargrilled burgers, in a dark room, under a tide of music, as the rest of the place paces drunkenly, each of you leans forward into prayer.

As you grasp hands and pray with the group, Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"" blasts loudly. Somehow, it's more sacred than it is ironic and hilarious. Although, it is incredibly ironic and hilarious. ""Personal Jesus,"" which lyricist Martin Gore described as ""a song about being a Jesus for somebody else, someone to give you hope and care,"" is a perfect image of the situation, with these young folks, who feel silenced and adrift, clasping at one another's hands so defiantly, so unafraid of mockery — in the presence of a woman they've admired, a woman who has helped them feel less alone.

The young person who'd been praying says, ""Amen,"" and everyone unclasps hands then begins unfurling silverware. A month from now, Swain will lose her bid for mayor of Nashville. Second place. With 23 percent of the vote. Abruptly jobless, she'll take her mother to church every Sunday like she always has. You'll keep in touch with her. She'll even visit Dallas and appear on Glenn Beck's podcast. Occasionally, she'll ask about this profile, curious if it's ready. But for now, she's still electric with hope.

""Wait, wait,"" Swain says, still holding hands with the girls at each side, ""I'd also like to say grace.""

You look at Swain, her lambent smile and tranquil brown eyes and a soft light behind her, then turn to the young folks beside you, their hands open, hanging in the air. Nod. Smile. Bow your head. Close your eyes — reach out and touch faith.",https://www.theblaze.com/profile/carol-swain-wants-the-young-americans,2019-02-01
Ryan: Donald Trump and Fox News Troll the Media,"President Trump couldn't personally make it to Houston for the 3rd Democratic Debate, so he paid $7,500 for a single-engine Cessna to fly in circles over Texas Southern University campus while pulling a banner that said, ""Socialism will kill Houston's economy! Vote Trump 2020!""



For four hours, it chugged around up there. You could hear it everywhere. It was the soundtrack of the night.

You can just imagine Trump's face as he had the banner-plane idea. You can hear him putting in the order. You can see his list of demands. And at the very top, ""I WANT THE LOUDEST PLANE YOU CAN FIND!!!""

Was that Bret Baier in the aisle, adjusting his reading glasses and thumbing at the strap of his comically small backpack as he crossed the blue-carpeted gymnasium? He looked like the human version of Wisconsin. He was saying something but all you could hear was the plane overhead.

Bret Baier, the stoic host of ""Special Report with Bret Baier"" on Fox News and the network's chief political anchor. He's underrated, if you ask me. Legacy. Old-school. He just delivers the news, which is what most people want.

He talks the way anchors used to talk, with the American accent unique to news anchors even though he was born in New Jersey and raised in Georgia.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

I had spent the last year-and-a-half on a series of in-depth profiles on some of the major countercultural figures of our time. People like Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin, and Carol Swain. So my first impulse was to rush over to Baier and profile the guy. Nobody else would, after all. The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's. But they ought to. The man has a hell of a story.



He joined Fox News a year-and-a-half after it was founded, as the southeast correspondent in Atlanta. A few years later, on a Tuesday in September, nineteen terrorists hijacked four passenger airliners and crashed into America.

When the first plane hit, Fox producers told Baier to just get in his car and drive to New York City. They needed back-up reporters for the next day. When the second plane crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03 a.m., they said, ""Step on it, Baier.""

He and his producer were an hour outside Atlanta when American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the Pentagon. Still a good 8 hours away, but closer to D.C. than to New York City. So they re-routed to Arlington, Virginia, as fast as they could. Past a blur of fields full of indifferent cows. Past houses full of people who could hardly talk, people who couldn't describe what they were seeing and hearing, all the smoke and the blood and the office-supply confetti. Past towns that barely moved, gas stations with nobody in them, people sunken into a far-away stare.

Yet there was the sun, with only a few bangles of cloud every so often. America had been paralyzed but the earth kept trucking along, quiet and unbothered. It must have felt strange for Baier, to speed down empty highways — toward literal death and chaos — under a perfect sky, below cascading light and color.

Nature doesn't care if we make it out alive.



*

That day, Baier reported live from a Citgo station across the street from the Pentagon, rubble in heaps of flame behind him. It was like he'd fallen onto a different planet and was reporting back to home.

The next day arrived and it was so quiet everywhere. Nobody knew a damn thing. We could not believe our eyes. We all turned to reporters and anchors for answers. Most often, they blurted out whatever they could. Occasionally, they whimpered and cried.

Something about Bret Baier gave audiences a much-needed boost. Reliable, sturdy. Like he said what had to be said and not a word extra.

Fox kept him in D.C., indefinitely. A friend helped him find an apartment. He never went back to Atlanta. Two weeks later, Fox News appointed him Pentagon correspondent, a position that saw him travel the world, including 13 trips to Afghanistan and 12 to Iraq.

Halfway through George W. Bush's second term, Baier became Fox News' White House correspondent.

Then, a year before he would earn his current position as anchor, Baier became a father. His son was born with holes in his heart — five congenital heart defects. Twelve days later, the boy underwent open-heart surgery. Baier and his wife waited in tiled rooms drenched with flowers and ESPN and drab ultraviolet light, surrounded by machines full of beeps and whirring and beeps and whirring.

Baier's son has since undergone two additional open-heart surgeries, nine angioplasties, and one stomach operation.

In an interview with Parents Magazine, Baier said that his son's health problems have ""given me perspective about my job, going through policy and politics in Washington, D.C., to see the bigger picture.""

*

Part of the reason I couldn't tell whether or not it was Baier is he's usually up on the main stage. For the 2012 election, he moderated five Republican debates, and co-anchored FNC's America's Election HQ alongside Megyn Kelly.

The 2016 election would propel him into a much larger role. He anchored three Republican debates, but this time he had to handle Donald Trump.

Baier knew Trump personally, from before the election. They'd played golf together. He described Trump as ""a nice guy outside of his TV persona"" and never thought Trump would actually make a run for the Presidency. Onstage, Trump was much different. And Baier had been tasked with maintaining control.

A devout Roman Catholic, he appreciates a nice glass of wine and a fine cut of steak. He likes a good joke, too.

In January, 2019, Baier signed a multi-year deal with Fox News to continue ""Special Report."" A few weeks later, he and his family went to Montana for a ski trip. The weekend was wonderful. But they had to get back to New York because Baier was scheduled to appear on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" that Tuesday.

Imagine him, again in a car hurtling toward a fateful destination. How he squinted through the frost-pocked windshield and gripped the steering wheel. As he guided the white SUV along the two-lane road to the airport. The land looked haunted, barren, lifeless. Everywhere, the world was frozen white. Snow and ice blanketing the fields, gauze over the sky.

At some anonymous intersection, Baier pumped the brakes, but the tires hit an ice patch, and the SUV spun loose. An oncoming car slammed into the driver's side, launching the vehicle into an embankment, wedged on its side. A man named Zach stopped his pickup truck and helped the family crawl free, and the Montana Highway Patrol rushed them to the hospital.

""Don't take anything for granted,"" Baier tweeted later. ""Every day is a blessing and family is everything. It's always good to remind yourself of that before something does it for you.""

Before every debate that he moderates, Baier spends 10 minutes alone, praying.

A Freedom of Information Act request in 2011 revealed that Fox News was actually right. That the Obama Administration really did hate them. And had intentionally excluded them from a press pool two years earlier. Then laughed about it.

The documents unearthed snarky emails between various high-ranking aides in the Obama Administration. In one, the Deputy White House communications director bemoaned Baier's reporting on the bias. ""I'm putting some dead fish in the [Fox News] cubby — just cause Bret Baier is a lunatic."" That same day, deputy press secretary Josh Earnest bragged in an email that ""we've demonstrated our willingness and ability to exclude Fox News from significant interviews.""



The Trump administration pulled a similar stunt in July, 2018 by banning a CNN reporter from the press pool.

Trump and Fox News had developed a beneficial relationship by then. And CNN was a lifelong competitor, a public enemy.

That night, Baier delivered an official statement, ""This decision to bar a member of the press is retaliatory in nature and not indicative of an open and free press. We demand better. As a member of the White House press pool, Fox stands firmly with CNN on this issue of access.""

YouTube www.youtube.com

Fox News rebuked Trump in solidarity with CNN. It was a heartening gesture between two seeming enemies. Fox News were standing up for truth, defending journalism, rejecting tyranny even though the ban would have benefitted them as a company.



Who knows how many books and dissertations and articles have been written about Fox News, usually in relation to bias, usually with a scathing tone. The conclusions differ wildly, yet each one claims certitude.

Generally, academics and journalists have taken a doomsday tone when talking about Fox News. Accusations of evil, fear-mongering, bigotry, hatred, misinformation, propaganda, racism, homophobia, and so on.

Despite these outcries, Fox News has consistently held its spot as the most-watched network in the country. Imagine how that makes its critics feel.

In an August 3, 2018 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Baier said, ""the biggest problem is that the people who are most critical of Fox are usually people who have not watched Fox News.""

Bret Baier on CNN, FOX News, Donald Trump & Ronald Reagan www.youtube.com

Fox News is composed of two distinct departments. Punditry and straight news. Or ""opinion news"" and ""descriptive news."" Consistently, surveys of the public rate Fox News as both the least- and most-biased news network.

Last year, a survey found Fox News to be the second most-trusted television news brand in the country, after the BBC.



In a separate study, Democrats rated its bias score at (negative) -87, while Republicans placed it at (positive) +3. Which is like if, at a football game, one referee said ""Touchdown,"" while the other referee said ""Turnover, leading to Touchdown for the Defense."" It can't be both, can it?

Public opinion may not be the best metric for understanding Fox News, especially in 2019.

Quantitative studies have offered clearer conclusions. In 2016, a content analysis used crowdsourcing and machine learning to examine over 800,000 news stories published over a year by 15 major outlets, from the New York Times to Fox News. They wanted to chart media bias.

What they discovered is that news outlets are far more similar than we believe. Much of the perceived bias is a matter of separating ""opinion news"" from ""descriptive news."" For conservatives, it's punditry. For those on the left, it's op-eds and long form investigative pieces, although the left tends to insist that they're not biased, that they are instead just more apt to tell the truth, even though research has disproven this belief.

The researchers found a much larger bias-divide in opinion news, whereas descriptive news was practically neutral. One of the researchers described Fox News' descriptive news as ""guided by similar news values as more traditional, legacy media.""

University of California Berkeley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild wrote that ""Fox News stands next to industry, state government, church, and the regular media as an extra pillar of political culture all its own.""

Say what you want about Fox News; they play a crucial role in the so-called mainstream media. And, despite what Fox News will lead you to believe, they are definitely part of the mainstream. And they are by no means the innocent victim. And certainly not powerless. And they have all kinds of problems that I will not defend. But we'll talk about that in a later installment, the one about Kamala Harris at a gun control rally, advocating for propaganda.

After two months of political events, I suspected that different news networks have their own signifiers, like the distinct stripes and markings on various spiders.

Wall Street Journal reporters tended to carry old-timey notepads and interview any bystander they could find. Breitbart usually only sent one person, and he wandered around with his iPhone, recording every single thing. Politico, prim-suited men who could just as easily work on the stock market.

Most of the reporters dressed like that, in stagey business attire. Prim for a high school job fair. Meanwhile, the photographers, mostly men, looked like professional paintball players. The camera crews and technical staff were the only ones decked in tattoos and wearing sandals and generally not caring about the chaos all around them. On-camera talent were covered in makeup and shrink-wrapped into dresses or suits with chip-clips along the spine.

The Washington Post sent the classiest and most bored-looking people I have ever encountered. They never looked at their laptops as their fingers chopped at the keys, and you assumed they were pretending until you read their stories online. You could spot ABC because their camera crew wore faded red ABC hats. Associated Press looked like they had just come back from a battlefield assignment in Syria, and never donned the same press credentials as everyone else, preferring a tattered AP lanyard. And you always knew when someone was with the New York Times because they announced it to the entire room.

And Fox News? At democratic events, they usually hid. But not that day, in Houston, as Bret Baier walked up the aisle to a table a couple rows in front of me.

Most people arrived in the Media Filing Center several hours before the debate. Fox News got there just slightly after that, as everyone was wiggling in their seats and connecting their laptops to a shared outlet.

There were seven or so in the pack of Fox News, all grinning. They all had white to-go sacks from Chick-fil-A.

And the room got quieter, so Trump's plane got louder. It was a double trolling event.

As host of the debate, ABC would be providing dinner. This information was included in the credentials email that all of us had received. So nobody else had brought food with them. No need.

Even better, I was familiar enough with that part of Houston to know that there was not a Chick-fil-A anywhere close to us. Who knew where they'd gotten that Chick-fil-A, but odds are it wasn't warm. Who knew if there was even any food in the bags.

They had brought Chick-fil-A into a building full of national media during the third Democratic Presidential debate. The 2020 election was already full of outrage about plenty of things, and one of them was Chick-fil-A. To some folks, the red chicken logo might as well have been a swastika. That very week LGBT activists had vehemently — cartoonishly — protested the opening of several Chick-fil-A's throughout North America. Chicken sandwiches had become yet another flag on the tug-of-war rope in the Culture War of our country.

To be clear, the political left was anti-Chicken and the political right was pro-Chicken. The media tended to lean anti-Chicken, and frequently wrote about anti-Chicken causes, often scolding pro-Chicken voices, or ignoring the struggles of the pro-Chicken community only to deny any opinion on Chicken at all. That was the cowardly part, of you ask me, the pretending like they weren't activists.

The Democratic candidates definitely leaned anti-Chicken. Sometimes they took it so far that it upset moderate anti-Chicken advocates. Because was it really so bad to eat Chicken? Couldn't you be anti-Chicken but also enjoy Chicken occasionally? Why did everything have to be either ""all Chicken all the time unless you hate freedom"" or ""no chicken ever unless you support hate""?

The fight had spread everywhere. Airports, stadiums, malls, campuses. All had served as battlegrounds for the anti-Chicken versus the pro-Chicken.

The previous President was anti-Chicken. In fact, he may well have enflamed the entire movement. During his tenure, there were nationwide protests that saw pro-Chicken advocates angrily and proudly eating Chicken while anti-Chicken advocates protested outside and occasionally engaged in homosexual affection, which was being threatened by Chicken, according to them.

Every time the pro-Chicken folks bit into a Chicken sandwich, it was like they were gnawing away at the anti-Chicken people themselves. Degrading their identity. Because, for them, it was about the identity.

But the current President, unabashedly proud of his pro-Chicken stance, once served Chicken at the White House to some winning sports team, and the anti-Chicken activists saw it as proof that Chicken and hate go together. And maybe Chicken would even lead to the impeachment of the President they hate, which would mean the Vice President would become the President, but he's one of the most pro-Chicken people in America, so they'd have to impeach him, too. And the Supreme Court, it was overrun with pro-Chicken types.

This election, the Democratic front-runners competed for the bolder plan. They would end Chicken in America once and for all. They would obliterate our evil President and his Chicken Supremacy. Their stump speeches relied on harsh criticisms of pro-Chicken voters, who pretended to find the whole anti-Chicken movement amusing but were secretly enraged by it.

In fact, they were certain that the anti-Chicken movement had been systematically silencing them for years, and that they had to fight for their Chicken in order to keep everything that they valued, even all the not-Chicken.

The media and the democrats and Hollywood and academia — all hated the Chicken, because they hated the pro-Chicken people. If they had their way, no more Chicken, ever again. And no more pro-Chicken deplorables. And tonight the anti-Chicken politico-culture complex would prove it, with long rants which get confirmed by glowing articles, calculated takedowns about the merits of anti-Chicken and the evils of pro-Chicken.

Yet here was Fox News, with actual Chicken. And they were smiling. Maybe in part because the police who were guarding us all tended to be pro-Chicken. And this was Texas, after all, an incredibly pro-Chicken state. But there were 49 other states and 14 territories, and all of them were fighting for or against Chicken.

Some experts even said we were on the cusp of a Civil War.

Ryan: Mayor Pete's last night in town,"Pete Buttigieg deadpanned the stage, barely out of view on the eve of disaster.

For nearly a year, he had practically lived in Iowa, as he competed with a veritable boatload of Democratic presidential candidates. Despite the outlandishly crowded field, he had risen from what the Washington Post described as ""the most interesting mayor you've never heard of,"" to a front-runner in the presidential race, edging his position among the seven remaining candidates.

Super Bowl Sunday. With the first-in-the-nation-vote Iowa caucuses in 28 hours, this ""Get Out The Caucus"" rally was Buttigieg's last pre-caucus event. Not a parking spot for 10 blocks by the time Buttigieg was supposed to have appeared.

A couple thousand people packed inside the Roundhouse, a gymnasium that resembled an ant colony, with its spiraling dome built in 1965. Situated on the campus of Abraham Lincoln High School, with its imposing Collegiate Gothic architecture, hilltopped on the south side of Des Moines, near Gray's Lake — which, on that Feb. 2, 2020, had succumbed to Iowa snow and shortened days, so the water was frozen. Not solid, not deep — only on the surface.

Inside the gymnasium, a profusion of red and yellow. Sultry, humid. People sweating. Warmed by a nagging fluorescence. And bustling. Frantic.

Periodically, the crowd shouted ""BOOT-edge-edge"" to the cadence of ""U-S-A."" Some of their far more elaborate chants had surely been scripted.

Then, lightning shook the gymnasium in the form of Panic! at the Disco. An instrumental loop of their once-ubiquitous single ""High Hopes,"" which you have definitely heard. Over the past year, it has become Buttigieg's campaign song, especially after this video went viral. The choreographed dance routine became a meme, and more videos appeared of Buttigieg-supporter flash mobs, at parks, in conference rooms, at Irish pubs.

Saturday Night Live took a few jabs, with Weekend Update anchor Colin Jost joking, ""It's all part of Mayor Pete's strategy to get a negative percentage of the black vote.""

And, just like that, Buttigieg, 38, took the stage. Behind him, a giant American flag and risers full of Pete-gear-bedecked supporters shouting ""BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE. BOOT - EDGE - EDGE.""



The floor rumbled. The bleachers and stairs and blinking scoreboards shook. It was a tribal war ceremony. A pep rally for a game that could cost us everything. Our freedom, our lives, our fast food whenever we want it.

The Maltese Chicken

In many way, Buttigieg represents the anti-Trump.

He's polite. He's intellectual. He's young. A church-going Episcopalian, a Rhodes Scholar, a veteran, a former McKinsey management consultant, a Harvard grad, a piano player. He even once accompanied Ben Folds for a performance of ""Steven's Last Night in Town,"" a song about an enigmatic guy who's always about to leave but never does. Afterward, Folds said, ""It was a very difficult song he pulled off. I'm serious. He's a fine player.""

www.youtube.com

He's well-spoken, decorously well-spoken. Also fluent in French, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic and Dari, a dialect of Persian that he learned while serving overseas. Oh, and Norwegian.



Like presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, he's a veteran. He joined the Navy Reserve at 27, achieved the rank of lieutenant, with a Joint Service Commendation medal. Then, In 2014, he took a leave as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to serve a seven-month deployment in Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence officer as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

""I was packing my bags for Afghanistan while [Donald Trump] was working on Season 7 of 'The Apprentice,"" he said at a May 2019 rally.

In his autobiography, ""Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future,"" he says that, during his time in Afghanistan, he was mostly ""behind a sophisticated computer terminal in a secure area,"" although he served as a vehicle commander on convoys through Kabul 119 times.

I would heave my armored torso into the driver's seat of a Land Cruiser, chamber a round in my M4, lock the doors and wave a gloved goodbye to the Macedonian gate guard. My vehicle would cross outside the wire and into the boisterous Afghan city, entering a world infinitely more interesting and ordinary and dangerous than our zone behind the blast walls at ISAF headquarters.

Like fellow candidates Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders, and former candidate Kamala Harris, Buttigieg is a second-generation American. His father emigrated from Malta in 1979, became a naturalized American citizen, then taught as a professor. ""Buttigieg"" is Maltese for ""lord of the poultry.""

History in the Making

Two types of people at the rally — Buttigieg supporters decked in PETE 2020 gear, and journalists, strutting or looking bored. Meanwhile, I desperately fished through my backpack for my Houston Astros hat, failing, dropping everything, a human spill. But with a smirk, because the Astros had just been disgraced following revelations that they cheated their way to a World Series win, something about banging a trash can like it was a kettledrum.

All through Buttigieg's speech, various media chattered. With their PETE press badges stuck to their arms, they gabbed like people do at annual conferences or family reunions, indifferent to the presidential candidate 80 yards away.

Chuck Todd, host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" gabbed right beside us. Media pundits, anchors, columnists, all the important people, had converged on Des Moines.

It was like a journalism catwalk. It was like homecoming, for us, the media — the eloquent vultures who stomp around with our wings stretched as a show of dominance or a remedy to fear, compensating always.

Fox News anchor Bret Baier strutted up the aisle, flanked by an entourage. It looked like he'd deep-fried himself in orange baby powder.

Baier lacked the ordinariness that I'd sensed when I met him in Houston at the third Democratic debate. I liked Baier, even if he did snub me when I told him I write for Blaze Media. Now, he was a puffin of confidence, resembling some American emperor as he walked, parting the crowd.

Didn't any of these journalists want to know what Buttigieg had to say? Sure, when you cover an election, you hear a stump speech 40 times and it loses its spark. But our whole job was to comb for lice.

Buttigieg asked the audience, ""So, are you ready to make history one more time?""

They'd be making history, all right, far more than they expected, but not like they'd imagined. By the end of the next day, American democracy would take a pie to the face.

Youth and Inexperience

If elected president, Buttigieg would be the youngest in our nation's history, just two years over the minimum age. He got his start as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at the age of 29. After serving two terms, he left office on Jan. 1, 2020.

In a field of seasoned, older politicians, including a former vice president, Buttigieg has faced relentless scrutiny for his lack of political experience — it has come up every single debate. Most recently, in a now-viral campaign ad from former Vice President Joe Biden, who like Buttigieg, coincidentally, entered politics at age 29 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history.

So much of this campaign has been about age, and not in a charming way. A 73-year-old Ronald Reagan responded to a question about his age by saying, ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""

Buttigieg has often championed the idea of ""Intergenerational justice"" as a means of establishing an ""intergenerational alliance."" Connecting the generations.

During a May 2019 town hall for Fox News, Chris Wallace asked Buttigieg about the constraints of age for a president. Here's Buttigieg's response:

www.youtube.com

At 38, Buttigieg is technically a millennial, and the first to become a serious presidential candidate.



""We're not a generation that feels sorry for itself,"" Buttigieg told one journalist. ""But I think when somebody says, 'Gosh, why are you guys less likely to leave the home?' It's like, well, because college is unaffordable, most of the best opportunities are in cities that are unaffordable. And we graduated into a recession. So what do you expect?""

Politics Politics Politics

Despite all the chaos in the Roundhouse as Mayor Pete chanted to the crowd, I found Justin Robert Young, host of the Politics Politics Politics podcast.

Justin and I first connected last November, after my story on Kanye West's appearance at the Joel Osteen megachurch in Houston. Then Justin had me on his podcast. Immediately, we connected.

The Buttigieg rally was the first time we'd met in person.

Justin gave intermittent commentary into his ZOOM portable recorder, the kind with dual external microphones.

In person, as on his podcast, Justin Robert Young discusses politics with the grace and off-handedness and clarity of a philosophy professor explaining Immanuel Kant. Like a surfer gliding a wave.

But then he throws in some humor. He is what you could call an outcast of the media world. Same as me. There aren't all that many of us. We work for different publications, networks, podcasts — media of every political orientation. But we take umbrage with the politics of new media, it's Trumpian snarl and disdain, it's blunt sense of apathy.

He asked me for my prediction, my ""1, 2, 3, 4"" on who would win Iowa.

I get asked questions like this fairly often. I don't pretend to be a political expert. But if you're at the horse races, you pick a horse, and sometimes you just go with the horse trotting the wildest and maybe it will win.

""For my number one,"" I said, ""I'd guess Bernie. Two, Biden. Three, Warren. Four, Klobuchar.""

""No Pete?"" Justin asked.

""I mean, that would really surprise me.""

Outside the Wire

Buttigieg is the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate. He came out in 2015, at the age of 33, near the end of his first term as mayor, with an essay in the South Bend Tribune:

Like most people, I would like to get married one day and eventually raise a family. I hope that when my children are old enough to understand politics, they will be puzzled that someone like me revealing he is gay was ever considered to be newsworthy. By then, all the relevant laws and court decisions will be seen as steps along the path to equality. But the true compass that will have guided us there will be the basic regard and concern that we have for one another as fellow human beings — based not on categories of politics, orientation, background, status or creed, but on our shared knowledge that the greatest thing any of us has to offer is love.

Ten days later, the Supreme Court struck down all state bans on gay marriage, making same-sex marriage legal on the federal level. He married his husband, Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher from Michigan, in 2018. The following year, he appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine, with his Chasten, and the words ""First Family.""

The Atlantic said a Buttigieg presidency could ""transform the relationship between gay and straight America for the better."" One op-ed in the New York Times praised Buttigieg for changing America with what the author called ""Mayor Pete's gay reckoning."" Another noted that ""Mr. Buttigieg's ascent has made a sudden and unexpected reality of something [LGBT] donors thought was still years away, if not decades."" Although the author added that the LGBT community is by no means monolithic.

Any criticisms of his gayness, or his being a white gay man, have come not from conservatives or Republicans, but from the left, from LGBT groups and openly left-leaning activism-journalists — a discord that the right has crudely exploited for their own benefit, with concern-troll schadenfreude. Because most of the writers who've criticized Buttigieg are themselves LGBT. And, while they may focus far more on differences than unity, it's their prerogative.

Either way, it's complicated. All of it. For everyone. But especially for the people in the middle of the chaos.

The most cited Buttigieg hit piece is probably the one from The Outline, titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is bad for gays.""

The author dislikes Buttigieg's ordinariness, his lack of overt gayness, and, finally, his status as a ""democratic capitalist."" The author concludes,

But it is hard to escape the way that American capitalism and American democracy have worked in tandem both to dissipate and to assimilate the radical democratic energies of queer liberation by giving a very circumscribed sort of gay a conditional membership to the club.

LGBTQ Nation responded with an article titled, ""Why Pete Buttigieg is good for gays,"" rebuking the Outline article, ""That isn't an argument. That's self-hatred.""

A journalist for Slate wrote that

in a primary for the overwhelmingly pro-gay Democratic Party, Buttigieg can be more accurately lumped in with his white male peers than with anyone else.

Senior politics reporter for HuffPost Jennifer Bendery wrote,

[H]is candidacy is already exposing tensions in the LGBTQ community between gay white men, who benefit from the economic and social privileges of being white men, and all the other queer people who don't.

Buzzfeed wrote, ""You Wanted Same-Sex Marriage? Now You Have Pete Buttigieg.""

Vice wrote, ""Why Do White People Love Pete Buttigieg?""

The Root wrote, ""Pete Buttigieg is a lying MF.""

The New Republic published an article in which author Dale Peck, who is also gay, referred to Buttigieg as ""Mary Pete."" LGBTQ Nation called the article disgusting. Within a day, New Republic editors removed it, saying that it crossed the line into ""inappropriate and invasive."" The removal of the article caused its own controversy.

Buttigieg addressed the negative press on ""The Clay Cane Show,""

I just am what I am, and, you know, there's going to be a lot of that. That's why I can't even read the LGBT media anymore because it's all, 'he's too gay, not gay enough, wrong kind of gay.' All I know is that life became a lot easier when I just started allowing myself to be myself and I'll let other people write up whether I'm 'too this' or 'too that'

Negotiating

Outside, among the snow of things and the ice-veiled football field, a vendor wearing a Los Angeles Lakers beanie sold Buttigieg T-shirts and hats, prowling behind two poker tables.

""Buttigieg gave quite a speech,"" I said to Justin. ""But it was so neat and tidy.""

""Nice, is the word,"" he replied. ""What we saw was a coordinated effort to be the nice guy.""

""That's not so bad.""

Buttigieg has repeatedly championed the importance of dialogue between the left and the right. Which would involve broadening the information we consume. Twitter, obviously, perpetuates echo-chamber tribalism. But the news media are guilty of ideological round-abouts as well, so it's a matter of media literacy, what Buttigieg calls ""correcting our media diet."" He was the first Democratic candidate to appear on FoxNews.



""I also think sometimes there's a sense of condescension coming from our party,"" he told Bill Maher. ""I think a lot of people perceive that we're looking down on them."" Which can lead to radicalization. A loss in the sense of belonging.

Truth

Later, Justin and I drank cheap beer and watched the Super Bowl at Beechwood Lounge in Des Moines' Historic East Village, with its boutiques and microbrews and gay bars and pedestrians. Hell of a place to watch the Super Bowl. That long narrow room, steep, a revamped house of some kind. Low lighting. No frill from the bartenders, just abrupt conversation so you know they meant what they said. Home to fashionable outcasts, such as ourselves. The less militant kind with their passion and their certitude, the profound disquiet, a disgust with the status quo.

2020 marked the centennial Super Bowl. Also, it was Shakira's birthday, a fact that everyone in the nation buzzed with, later, during the halftime show, on account of her and J-Lo being hosts, and both giving acrobatically flawless performances. Photo by Kevin Ryan

Toward the end of the night Justin raised his finger, squinted his left eye, and said, ""For your series. You should find a universal truth. Something everyone knows but hasn't said or can't express. Give them a universal truth.""



On the flight to Des Moines, I read Forrest Gander's Pulitzer-Prize-winning poetry collection ""Be With."" All week, I kept thinking about one line. A seeming non sequitur. A sentence fragment. ""Intuition of the infinite.""

Is that truth? When we discover truth, are we grasping something infinite? A constant strain. Reaching for feathers as they float through the breeze. Chasing a rabbit near a busy road and all you want to do is save a creature but it's just too fast and now the danger has spread. Still, in the words of Robert Browning, ""Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?""

Our era already resigned itself to a life of mistruth, the Age of Fake News Supreme. We know the chaos of doubting whether something is the truth or a lie. A pattern that seems to worsen each day. So it has become harder than ever to apply a universal truth to hundreds of millions of people. But I would do it.

""You're going to see some ads saying there's only two ways to go,"" Buttigieg had said earlier that day at the rally. ""Either you're for a revolution or you're for the status quo. But the good news for Americans today is we have a historic majority ready not only to rally around what we're against to get a better president, but to come together in the name of what we are for as a country.""

During an appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Dr. Phil perfectly described how this is possible.

""Why do you think that nobody can talk to each other anymore?"" Colbert asked.

""You know, to tell you the truth, I don't think anybody's trying to get along right now,"" Dr. Phil said. ""Everybody is pissed off and it's like they don't want to get along. If I'm negotiating with somebody — if I'm negotiating with you, the first thing I'm going to do is figure out how to get you the most of what you want I possibly can.""

Colbert recoiled. ""Is negotiating all about winning?"" he asked.

""Certainly you want to win,"" said Dr. Phil, ""but you gotta define 'win.' If 'win' is all one-sided, that's not gonna last very long. If you and I make a deal and I say, 'Okay, here's the deal, you do all the work and I'm gonna get all the money,' I might talk you into that today, but three-four days later you're gonna go, 'Excuse me, can we — kiss my ass, I'm not doing that anymore. Nobody's gonna go along with that, you've gotta have a sense of saying, 'All right, let's start by saying, what do we agree on?""

""Okay, that's it,"" replied Colbert. ""What do we agree on? Because it seems like, right now, during the campaign and right now, too, people are having trouble agreeing on reality. People are having trouble agreeing on what is a fact, what is an alternative fact … Why is this happening, Dr. Phil?""

""Any time there's a dispute,"" Dr. Phil responded, ""the first thing I do is say, 'Okay, let's figure out what it is we agree on, because we might agree on more than we think, and then we can have these things over to the side that we disagree on.'""

He added, ""So. What do we agree on? Everybody agrees that we're all Americans, that we all enjoy the freedoms that we want, we all want to be safe — everybody agrees with those things, right? If you say, 'What do we not agree on' — okay, now we're talking about the disagreements, but we at least have some common ground. Nobody's talking about that.""

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova says what we're all thinking about trans swimmer Lia Thomas' 'Woman of the Year' nomination,"Following the NCAA announcement that transgender swimmer Lia Thomas was nominated for the 2022 ""Woman of the Year"" award by the University of Pennsylvania, tennis legend Martina Navratilova took to Twitter to express the sentiments we've all thinking when it comes to biological men competing in women's sports.

""Not enough fabulous biological women athletes, NCAA?!? What is wrong with you?!!!!!!!?"" tweeted the nine-time singles Wimbledon champion.

As you may have heard, UPenn nominated Thomas — a biological male who in 2017 ranked as the 462nd-best male swimmer on the school's men's team — for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's 2022 ""Woman of the Year"" award. Thomas joined the women’s team in 2020 after transitioning and almost immediately became the No. 1-ranked female collegiate swimmer in the country.

Navratilova, one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a vocal LGBT activist, has been speaking out about the unfair advantages of biological men competing in women's sports.

“It's not about excluding transgender women from winning, ever,” she told NewsNation in March. “But it is about not allowing them to win when they were not anywhere near winning as men. You try to keep it as close as possible to what it would have been had you been born in the female biological body in the first place.”

On BlazeTV's “Fearless with Jason Whitlock,"" Jason and contributor Delano Squires sounded the alarm about the less obvious concerns of transgender athletes such as Thomas. It's not just about violating norms of athletic fairness, but also the normalization of something that is downright dangerous to American children. At what point do surgeries and drugs used for gender transitions become abusive?

Gay Man Reveals Dark Side of LGBTQ Community,"Steven Crowder hit the streets to ask the public if they are proud to live in America and found the overwhelming majority of those who aren't proud are white suburban women.

In this installment of ""Talking with People,"" Crowder spoke with a gay man who revealed his take on the dark side of the LGBTQ community. The man, who comes from an immigrant family, explained to Crowder that 15 years ago, he was asked to participate in the PRIDE parade but turned down the opportunity when he was asked to ride on a sexually charged float, wearing a sexually provocative outfit while throwing candy and stuffed animals to children.

The man said many from the gay community see the T in LGBT as an embarrassment. Watch the clip to hear the whole conversation.

Christine Aguilera's pride costumes are too raunchy,"Christina Aguilera wore a medley of over-the-top raunchy costumes at this year’s Pride celebration in Los Angeles, the crowning jewel of which was a green, Hulk-like number complete with a giant green ""strap-on.""

Rolling Stone magazine (and many other outlets) lauded the pop star's performance at “LA Pride in the Park,” calling it ""iconic,"" “beautiful,” and everything ""the gays"" ever wanted.

Several posts on Twitter of Aguilera's Pride in the Park performance are being censored with a label warning, "" The following media includes potentially sensitive content."" And according to Libs of TikTok, even Aguilera had discretion enough to censor her own photo in a post on Instagram.

But the venue itself seems to think parents should bring the kids. The ""LA! Pride"" website says, ""LA Pride in the Park has no age minimum for the music performance."" Oh, and apparently kids under 5 get in free.

Still think you want to see this spectacle? Okay, click here at your own risk, but don't say we didn't warn you.

Last week, BlazeTV host Pat Gray talked about an article in ""Fatherly,"" an online magazine that claims to provide advice and other resources for parents, which touted all the great ""benefits"" of taking young children to LBGTQ+ Pride parades and events, despite a warning in the opening paragraph of ""sights that may be new to kids, like public nudity and kink."" ""Considering the benefits for all families — including seeing other LGBTQ+ families like yours, or showing up as an ally if your family members are straight and cisgender — the answer is absolutely [bring the kids to Pride celebrations],"" the article recommended.

One parent even said her kids learned to “laugh and enjoy things. Like there were these Beanie Babies with giant penises on them ... for a fourth- and fifth-grade kid, that's super funny.”

Pat Gray did not find the idea to be ""super funny"" at all.

Trans inmate who was moved after impregnating 2 women is not happy with new prison,"A transgender inmate has been moved to a new facility after impregnating two women while incarcerated at a New Jersey women’s prison, according to a local report.

Demi Minor, who is serving a 30-year sentence for manslaughter, was transferred from Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women to a prison for young adults last month after two women in the facility became pregnant from “consensual sexual relationships with another incarcerated person,” according to the DOC’s external affairs executive director Dan Sperrazza.

Minor was one of at least 27 prisoners who identify as transgender housed at the women only prison before being transferred to the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility — and she's not happy at all about the ""psychological damage"" caused by the move.

On the Justice 4 Demi website, Demi wrote about her terrible experience of ""being forced to live in a male prison"" where she ""was called he and him well over 30 times.""

""This is the hell that NJDOC wants to put me through, this is my punishment for what occurs over 2 months ago, they have violated my right to be safe and free from sexual harassment,"" Demi complained. ""While living here at GYSC, I have found my self under attack by young inmates who are immature and just plain ignorant towards a person like me. On Saturday I was in medication line when a inmate cut in front of me, and said “I am not standing behind no fag” the inmate than spit directly in my direction, I came back and washed my clothing’s knowing deep down, that I can not and will not live like this!! I don’t think DOC realizes the psychological damage that has been done from moving me out of a womens prison to a male facility, its harsh and, I don’t know what its like to live as a man, and In refuse to ever revert back to such habits or behavior.""

Demi said she was placed on suicide watch “due to the fact that [she] had hung [herself] in the van” but ""was placed in a dark cell within Detention housing, as inmates who are on watch are placed in the detention unit and not the infirmary!""

She also claimed guards denied her request to be strip-searched by a female officer, saying “everyone here is man including you.”

""The fact that this prison does not have air [conditioning], does not have cable, does not allow video visits, does not have an[y] LGBT groups is mind blowing, yet they said that I am here for safety no please understand that I am here for punishment, just the sad part is this punishment may kill me. Mentally I have not been myself and I am losing my essence. The Demi, who wants to wear make-up and hangout with her friends is not permitted here. They have said that I can have my make-up but the truth is we know its a death wish, its literally going to cause more harassment,"" Demi wrote.

A lot of people reacted to Demi's story with what might have been considered rationality or common sense just a few years ago:





But these days, we seem to live in a society that is devoid of common sense. Case in point, just last week Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was accused of inciting violence against transgender people because he doesn't think men can get pregnant.

Also, transgender swimmer Lia Thomas was nominated for the 2022 NCAA Woman of the Year award. Singer Macy Gray apologized to the outrage mob for daring to define a woman during an interview with Piers Morgan. And BlazeTV's Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report"" was suspended from Twitter after tweeting about Dr. Jordan Peterson's suspension from Twitter for using transgender actor Elliot Page's former name: Ellen Page.

Oh, and apparently teachers are now coming out as trans to their students, some as young as pre-school age, because providing this information will really help with the child's learning experience — right?

'You are obligated to follow God's truth': A powerful message for Christian teachers in public schools,"On a recent episode of ""Relatable,"" BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey had a powerful message for Christian teachers who are working in public schools.

""I am so thankful for Christian teachers who are in public schools,"" Allie began. ""I say that a lot, and still sometimes I get messages saying that I have like demonized public school teachers, which is not true at all.""

""You are light in the darkness. Unfortunately, you are kind of bound to the curriculum that you have to teach. You are kind of bound to the secular anti-God worldview of public education, which is anti-Christian by law. So, that is difficult, but it doesn't mean that you can't make a difference,"" she added.

Allie encouraged Christian teachers to always show students kindness — because ""you might be the only source of kindness and stability that some of these kids ever see"" — and to be a source of truth no matter how difficult that might become.

""You are bound to something that's higher than your curriculum, that's higher than the school board, that's higher than your administration, that's higher than the teachers' unions — and that is to the law of God,"" Allie stated.

""You are obligated to follow God's truth first and foremost. And so, that means that if you are told that you have to teach that there is no God, if you have to teach that America has exclusively been a place of oppression — that white kids are oppressors because of their skin color, black and brown kids are oppressed because of their skin color — if you have to teach that girls can be boys and boys can be girls, you are obligated not to do that. And I understand that there is risk that comes with that. There's a cost that comes with that. That it's easier said than done. Absolutely. But that is the cost of being a Christian in an anti-Christian world,"" she continued.

""The least that we can do, and have to do, as Christians is not to lie in a culture that is so inundated with and characterized by lies. So, you be a beacon of truth in every possible way that you can, and I promise God will use you to glorify him. And that's what we're all trying to do.""

Drag queen charged with 25 counts of child porn,"A Pennsylvania drag queen who counseled children at a ""safe haven"" for LGBTQ+ youth has been charged with 25 counts of child pornography, according to reports.

A criminal docket issued last week shows Brice Patric Ryschon Williams was charged with 25 counts of child pornography and one count of criminal use of a communication facility. The sexually explicit content found in Williams' possession includes at least 49 photos and 25 videos of naked, prepubescent boys. The images showed ""genitalia and boys performing sex acts,"" in some cases ""with an adult man.""

In addition to performing as a drag queen by the name of Anastasia Diamond, Williams is an HIV medical case manager at a local health center and last year joined GLO Harrisburg, a center that offers a “safe haven” for LGBTQ+ youth of color in central Pennsylvania. Williams was awarded the LGBT Center of Central PA Rising Star Award in 2020.

“I feel as though this is so important because I know there are little kids like me who are queer who are black who are still not able to look up to anyone. So that’s the reason why I got into this line of work. I wanted to make ... a big impact for folks in my community,"" Williams told a local Pennsylvania news outlet last year.

A video clip posted on Instagram also appears to show Williams performing for children in 2017.





What parent takes their child to a drag show, you ask? That's exactly what BlazeTV host Allie Stuckey wanted to know after learning that a bar in Dallas, Texas, hosted a drag show geared especially for kids.

""This should be criminalized! This should be illegal! Every Republican legislator and every Republican governor should, right now, be drafting a bill to make this kind of thing illegal,"" Allie stated.

Karen walks into a room of Muslims and calls them Hitler to their face,"A school board meeting was held in Dearborn, Michigan, which made headlines due to a massive turnout of parents voicing concerns over the kind of content being distributed across the school district.

BlazeTV's Steve Deace found himself appalled when a woman he described as ""Karen"" took the microphone and proceeded to call a group of concerned Muslim parents ""Hitler"" to their faces during her speaking time.

According to Steve, ""Karen"" either creates or enables every worst impulse in the culture. She is the ""spirit of Jezebel incarnate"" and a ""generation of American beta males gave way to the scourge of Karen the Menace.""

""At least Karen has some balls,"" Steve said. ""How many of you men wouldn't go to your school board meeting over the last few years and confront a bunch of guys and pleated khakis over their attempt to mentally and intellectually rape your children.""

""Karen, pushing 60, borderline morbidly obese, walks into a room of Muslims and calls them Hitler to their face!"" Steve said. ""To their face ... and drops the mic ..."" Video below.

Yahoo! News reported:

A school-board meeting in Dearborn, Mich., was shut down earlier this week by hundreds of protesters opposing the circulation of LGBTQ books across the city’s public school system.

Viral videos recorded by a ""Detroit Free Press"" reporter circulated on Twitter showing pandemonium breaking out at the meeting Monday night. Many of the protesters carried signs in English and Arabic: “Keep Your Dirty Books in the Closet,” “Stop Grooming Our Kids,” and “Homosexuality Big Sin,” some read.

Tensions boiled over when Roxanne McDonald, chair of the school board, limited attendee speaking time to three minutes. The proceedings were halted because the growing crowd feared violating the fire code. Shouts of “Vote them out!” broke out.

Pro-Palestine LGBTQ+ Americans SHOCKED to hear what Palestinians think about THEM,"It's amazing to see just how strongly many LGBT+ Americans are allied with Palestine in the Israel-Palestine conflict because the Palestinians aren't exactly pro-LGBTQ.

Documentary filmmaker Ami Horowitz decided to go into the West Bank to ask people on the streets of the Palestinian territories to explain their views firsthand. What he discovered was a shocking and even violent intolerance for the LGBT+ community.

Ami joined Glenn Beck on the radio program to share a sample of his eye-opening footage and the stunning reactions he received from pro-Palestinian (and vehemently anti-Isreal) LGBT+ Americans.

"Glenn Beck backs Ben Shapiro as Beto O'Rourke wages war on religious, parental rights","Glenn Beck tweeted his support for Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro, who is under fire from both left-wing media and politicians for defending America's religious freedoms during his podcast Friday.

Shapiro was responding to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's statement last week, during a CNN town hall on LGBTQ rights, in which the former Texas congressman said colleges, churches, and charities should be stripped of their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage.

Shapiro reminded O'Rourke that freedom of religion is one of ""the fundamental rights that the Constitution was created in order to protect,"" adding that ""people are not going to stand for"" a national policy that infringes on a parent's right to choose a school or church for their children.

""[I]f you come to tell me that you're going to indoctrinate my kids into a particular policy and that I can't pull my kid out of a school and send my kid to the school that I want to send them to, that I can't go to the church or synagogue that I want to go to, and if you make that national policy, not just California policy where I can move, but national policy -- people are not going to stand for that,"" said Shapiro.

""And if you send a truant officer to remove my child, I have two choices at that point, right? If I have no place to move because you have now made this national, federal policy, I now have two choices: One is to leave the country utterly. Two is to pick up a gun. Those are the only choices you have left me,"" he added.

""It's not extreme to defend the fundamental rights that the Constitution was created in order to protect. These rights pre-exist government. My right to raise my child in my faith is my right. That is a First Amendment right. There is only one reason the government exists: to protect those rights, not to invade those rights. It is my right to raise my child with the moral precepts that I find to be beneficial for my child. Beto O'Rourke does not to get to raise my child — and if he tries, I will meet him at the door with my gun. That is insane.""

Media Matters and others on the Left have framed Shapiro's comments as a call for violence, claiming he ""threatened"" O'Rourke with a gun. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) even went so far as to call for ""red flag"" laws to be used against the ""lunatic"" conservative.

""The problem is, we've somehow come to believe that the only way to solve any perceived ill in the world is for a government to act. That is against the Constitution,"" Glenn said on Monday's radio program.

""Have we fallen that far, that we all somehow believe that our duty as a citizen is to let our children be psychologically, and philosophically molded by some government stooge, into sexually active, gender and sex orientation fluid agents of change? They're our children!"" he asserted.

I don't know about you, but as for Mr. Shapiro: I'm with you, Ben. I'm with you,"" said Glenn.

""Beto, don't show up at my door demanding my kids learn about developing a sexual plan at the age of twelve. Because if you do, we're going to have a serious disagreement. And you'll also have a serious disagreement with me and many of my neighbors about the Second Amendment as well.

""The Second Amendment is not there for hunting. It's not there for sport. It is there to keep tyranny at bay. It is there for the citizens, so they have a way to rise up against an out-of-control government that wants nothing more than tyranny. They want the guns because that way they can control the populace,"" he added. ""It is never outrageous or radical to defend the Bill of Rights. Don't be a babysitter. You are a parent. Do your job and do not surrender this ground. Beto, stay out of my house. Stay out of my home school. Stay out of my kid's lives. You're not welcome there.""

Leftists MELT DOWN over Caitlyn Jenner’s GOP candidacy: 'Running as a Trump Republican & entering a world that hates you',"The less-than-favorable reaction to Caitlyn Jenner's bid for governor of California as a Republican has shown that leftists and so-called ""transgender rights activist"" care more about political party than actual transgender rights. Despite the fact that if she wins, Jenner would be the first trans governor in our nation's history — and prove that Republicans aren't 'transphobic' — Leftist activists would rather back Gavin Newsom — a cisgender, white male.

""Make no mistake: we can't wait to elect a #trans governor of California. But @Caitlyn_Jenner spent years telling the #LGBTQ+ community to trust Donald Trump. We saw how that turned out. Now she wants us to trust her? Hard pass,"" tweeted Equality California, one of the state's largest LGBTQ-rights groups.

""With all due respect, @Caitlyn_Jenner, you are running as a Republican?! Republicans deny your existence and are trying to erase trans youth. HELL NO,"" tweeted leftist activist and actress Alyssa Milano.

""Well done Caitlyn Jenner, running for governor wins you the one medal you never got: stupidest mother***ker on earth. Running as a Trump Republican & entering a world that hates you,"" tweeted ""Sons of Anarchy"" star Ron Perlman.

In this clip from the ""Glenn Beck Radio Program,"" Glenn and producer Stu Burguiere discussed the Left's hostile reaction to Jenner's candidacy for California governor and agreed that leftist trans activists are showing themselves to be more ""leftists"" than ""trans activists.""



""If Caitlyn Jenner did, let's say, run for governor and win as a Republican, wouldn't that go a long way to advance what [trans rights activists'] goal supposedly is? Like, if you really believe Republicans hate trans people and what you want is for society to have trans people accepted more broadly, what better way to accomplish that than having a Republican trans candidate?"" Stu asked.



""Yeah, see, but you just said the key words: 'If you really believe.' They don't really believe anything. I don't think they even really believe that Republicans hate gay people. I don't think they actually believe that. That's just a slogan that's been drilled in their head,"" Glenn said. ""It doesn't have anything to do with race or gender, or really anything else. It has everything to do with politics. That's it.""

Trans woman sues to force female aestheticians to wax male genitals,"On the radio program Tuesday, Glenn Beck and producer Stu Burguiere talked about Jessica Yaniv, a transgender woman in Canada who has filed at least 16 human rights complaints against female salon workers for declining to wax her male genitals.

Over the past year, Yaniv has filed complaints with British Columbia's Human Rights Tribunal against several female aestheticians, many of whom are single mothers and immigrants, accusing them of discrimination against a transgender person because they would not wax her scrotum.

This week, the Human Rights Tribunal will hold hearings to decide whether female aestheticians should be forced to handle male genitalia or risk losing their livelihood.

Yaniv also made headlines earlier this month when she asked the Township of Langley Council in British Columbia for permission to host ""topless"" swim parties for people ages 12 and up, and for parents to be banned from attending. She has also been called out for posting seemingly xenophobic comments on social media.

'There's a huge benefit': Chad Felix Greene on the 'intoxicating' incentive for fake hate crimes,"Senior contributor at The Federalist, Chad Felix Greene, (who also happens to be gay) joined Glenn Beck on Tuesday's radio show to talk about what motivatespeople, particularly those in the LGBT community, to stage fake hate crimes. They discussed the Jussie Smollett case and how the immense outpouring of praise and attention experienced by alleged hate crime victims is ""very intoxicating.""



""There's a huge benefit personally to every minority, but certainly the LGBT, to be able to say 'I survived the hate in this country,'"" Chad said.

""Once the [Jussie Smollett] story came out, dozens and dozens of activists, celebrities and politicians all suddenly poured out their love to this person. And that, from a human perspective, is a very difficult thing to be strong enough to walk away from,"" he added. ""That's a very intoxicating position to be in. And the left is so used to people not questioning it, that it seems like an easy thing to go after.""

Disney leaked videos,"On “The Rubin Report” Wednesday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin discussed shocking videos obtained by investigative journalist Christopher Rufo from a Walt Disney Company ""all-hands"" meeting.

Dave played a compilation of Rufo's videos showing several Disney executives and employees reacting to Florida's recently approved ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, and discussing how the company's LGBTQIA agenda can be instilled in children through their popular movies and theme parks.

In the video, Disney’s diversity and inclusion manager Vivian Ware exposed how Walt Disney World and Disney Land have been slowly eliminating any gendered language including the words ""ladies,"" ""gentlemen,"" ""boys,"" and ""girls."" Disney corporate president Karey Burke said she wants half of Disney's ""regular and recurring characters"" to be either members of the LGBTQ communities or minorities. And, executive producer Latoya Raveneau praised Disney for welcoming her ""not-at-all-secret gay agenda,"" adding that she's has been ""basically adding queerness"" to children's programming ""wherever I could"" and ""no one would stop me.""

""It's important to know what these people are doing,"" Dave said of the leaked videos. ""This has nothing to do with being prejudiced towards gay people. This has nothing to do with breaking up gay families, or not allowing a kid to say 'I have two dads', or that the parents can't come to the play at the school, or anything else. This is about transparency in education and making sure that state employees cannot infect children with whatever their ideas are and then hide it from the parents.""

"'Horrible things are happening right before our eyes': The left is NORMALIZING pedophilia, child sex trafficking","Buried underneath the left's favorite tag lines ""love is love"" and ""asylum is a human right,"" a much more sinister movement is growing: the normalization of pedophilia.

In this episode of ""Wilkow,"" host Andrew Wilkow argued that the truth has been branded as a ""crazy conspiracy theory"" because it exposes the people who control the dominant narrative.

Wilkow highlighted a New York Times article, titled ""Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,"" in which contributor Margo Kaplan argued that laws in this country are failing people who are living with pedophilia, a mental disorder defined as ""an intense and recurrent sexual interest in prepubescent children,"" and that these failures stem largely from two main misconceptions:

""Pedophilia is a status and not an act. In fact, research shows, about half of all child molesters are not sexually attracted to their victims,"" Kaplan wrote. ""A second misconception is that pedophilia is a choice. Recent research, while often limited to sex offenders — because of the stigma of pedophilia — suggests that the disorder may have neurological origins. Pedophilia could result from a failure in the brain to identify which environmental stimuli should provoke a sexual response.""

As Wilkow pointed out, Kaplan went on to argue that pedophiles should be protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but that Congress had ""explicitly excluded pedophilia"" from such legal protections.

Wilkow also reviewed an article from The Daily Caller, ""Pedophiles Believe They Should Be A Part Of The LGBT Community.""

""Pedophiles are rebranding themselves as 'MAPs' or 'Minor Attracted Persons' in an effort to gain acceptance and be included into the LGBT community,"" he read. ""According to Urban Dictionary, the blanket term MAP includes infantophiles (infants), pedophiles (pre-pubescent children), hebephiles (pubescent children), and ephebophiles (post-pubescent children). [...] These pedophiles seek to be a part of the LGBT+ community, even going so far as to make a 'Pride flag' for Gay Pride Month.""

Wilkow also discussed how leftist politicians and the mainstream media have tried to tie President Donald Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while protecting big name Democrats like former President Bill Clinton and former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.

""Ever since Epstein's death, the truth about the left's ties to child sex trafficking have started to unravel, and now it all makes sense. Why does Hollywood support the Democrats? Why do these sick, ultra-wealthy people donate to the Democrats? Why won't the Democrat-controlled mainstream media even really report on sex trafficking?"" he asked.

""Of course, this has been branded as a conspiracy theory. But the people it exposes are the very people that seek to control the dominant narrative. And now that we have the facts, we can no longer sweep it under the rug as we've done for so many years,"" he added. ""It's not about politics. It's about certain bad individuals having so much power that horrible things are happening right before our eyes.""

USA Today publishes hit piece on newly crowned Heisman winner. It backfires big time.,"Kyler Murray, the star quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners, won the Heisman Trophy on Saturday night in what was undoubtedly one of the biggest moments of his budding sports career. Unfortunately for Murray, the night ended with controversy surrounding comments he made as a young teenager.

What happened?

Shortly after Murray's crowning college sports achievement, USA Today writer Scott Gleeson, who covers ""social issues through a sports lens,"" published a story criticizing Murray for seemingly anti-LGBT tweets he made as a 15-year-old teenager.

Gleeson wrote:

But the Oklahoma quarterback's memorable night also helped resurface social media's memory of several homophobic tweets more than six years old.



When Murray was 15 years old, he tweeted at his friends (via his since-verified Twitter account) using an anti-gay slur to defame them. Four offensive tweets remained active on his account late Saturday night...

Gleeson's story quickly garnered attention online, but received a response he likely did not anticipate.

What was the reaction?

USA Today received widespread condemnation on social media for publishing the story — and even attempting to reach Oklahoma University's athletic department for comment — on a night of celebration for both Murray and Oklahoma University.

Can someone organize a boycott of USA Today?

LGBTQ advocates up in arms over Tennessee bill that would prohibit indecently exposing yourself in a locker room designated for the 'opposite sex',"Republican lawmakers in Tennessee on Wednesday filed a bill that some LGBTQ advocates claim unfairly targets transgender people, WTVF-TV reported.

State Rep. John Ragan introduced the measure that would expand indecent exposure offenses ""to include incidents occurring in a restroom, locker room, dressing room, or shower, designated for single-sex, multi-person use, if the offender is a member of the opposite sex than the sex designated for use,"" according to the bill.

Ragan told WTVF that he filed House Bill 1151 with the safety of his young granddaughters in mind.

""This bill is about making sure that it is clear where certain behaviors are appropriate and others are not,"" he said. ""The expectation is if you are in a restroom that is designated for your sex, you have an expectation of certain conditions.""

What do the bill's opposers say?

Some LGBT advocates have pointed to a section in the bill that explicitly states that certain conditions — including gender dysphoria and gender confusion — would not serve as a defense to the crime.

""A medical, psychiatric, or psychological diagnosis of gender dysphoria, gender confusion, or similar conditions in the absence of untreated mental conditions such as schizophrenia, does not serve as a defense to the offense of indecent exposure,"" the bill states.

Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, said the bill's language is designed to criminalize transgender people.

""This bill is really a way of putting in a little bit of language that's very damaging to the transgender community,"" Sanders said. ""It's really about criminalizing transgender people in certain kinds of public places.""

Sanders claimed that the bill could cause someone to be charged with a misdemeanor crime if they use a restroom that doesn't match their designated sex at birth.

Tennessee law doesn't allow transgender persons to change the sex on their birth certificates.

What else did Ragan say?

Ragan defended the bill — which he said doesn't change the definition of indecent exposure or the level of the criminal offense, which can range from a Class B misdemeanor to a felony.

""It doesn't target them [transgender individuals],"" Ragan told WTVF. ""What it does is prevent them from using that as an excuse.""

What else?

Sanders said HB 1151 is one of six filed this legislation session that the group has designated as the ""slate of hate"" bills.",https://www.theblaze.com/tennessee-indecent-exposure-bill,2019-02-13
TWILIGHT ZONE: Lesbian feminist uses logic to destroy the Dems gender equality bill,"On Wednesday's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat and Keith discussed the Equality Act, a bill that was reintroduced by House Democrats on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee. The bill aimed at bringing an end to ""discrimination"" against the transgender community.

In this clip, Pat highlighted Julia Beck, a lesbian feminist brought in by Republicans to testify against the Equality Act, a move that has outraged the feminist community.

Beck asserted that ""H.R.5 is a human rights violation, will strip all Americans of fundamental human rights, and will set feminism back 50 years effectively undoing all that women have fought for and won.""

""If the act passes in its current form as H.R. 5, then every right that women have fought for will cease to exist,"" Beck warned. ""H.R. 5 is a human rights violation. Every single person in this country will lose their right to single-sex sports, shelters, grants, and loans. The law will forbid ever distinguishing between women and men.""

What is in the bill?

A BILL

To prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1.SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ""Equality Act"".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:

(1) Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.

(2) A single instance of discrimination may have more than one basis. For example, discrimination against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual orientation of the two individuals in the couple, or both. Discrimination against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.

(3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (referred to as ""LGBT"") people commonly experience discrimination in securing access to public accommodations—including restaurants, senior centers, stores, places of or establishments that provide entertainment, health care facilities, shelters, government offices, youth service providers including adoption and foster care providers, and transportation. Forms of discrimination include the exclusion and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harassment, and violence. This discrimination prevents the full participation of LGBT people in society and disrupts the free flow of commerce.

(4) Women also have faced discrimination in many establishments such as stores and restaurants, and places or establishments that provide other goods or services, such as entertainment or transportation, including sexual harassment, differential pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.

(5) Many employers already and continue to take proactive steps, beyond those required by some States and localities, to ensure they are fostering positive and respectful cultures for all employees. Many places of public accommodation also recognize the economic imperative to offer goods and services to as many consumers as possible. Read on.

While Pat in no way agreed with Beck's feminist angle, he did give her due credit for making a well thought out, logical argument against the Equality Act.



""This is really well laid out and smartly delivered ... this is a battle between transgenders and lesbians,"" Pat said.

USA Today publishes hit piece on newly crowned Heisman winner. It backfires big time.,"Kyler Murray, the star quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners, won the Heisman Trophy on Saturday night in what was undoubtedly one of the biggest moments of his budding sports career. Unfortunately for Murray, the night ended with controversy surrounding comments he made as a young teenager.

What happened?

Shortly after Murray's crowning college sports achievement, USA Today writer Scott Gleeson, who covers ""social issues through a sports lens,"" published a story criticizing Murray for seemingly anti-LGBT tweets he made as a 15-year-old teenager.

Gleeson wrote:

But the Oklahoma quarterback's memorable night also helped resurface social media's memory of several homophobic tweets more than six years old.



When Murray was 15 years old, he tweeted at his friends (via his since-verified Twitter account) using an anti-gay slur to defame them. Four offensive tweets remained active on his account late Saturday night...

Gleeson's story quickly garnered attention online, but received a response he likely did not anticipate.

What was the reaction?

USA Today received widespread condemnation on social media for publishing the story — and even attempting to reach Oklahoma University's athletic department for comment — on a night of celebration for both Murray and Oklahoma University.

Can someone organize a boycott of USA Today?

Using dumb crap he tweeted when he was 15 to ruin the greatest achievement of his life.

Shame on @ScottMGleeson and @USATODAY for tearing down a guy over tweets made when he was 14 and 15 years old solely because he got an award in sports. Shame on them.

— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) December 9, 2018

Judging people's character in adulthood by what they post on social media at the age of **15** is beyond moronic; it's oppressive. I'm so glad the internet didn't exist to permanently record my every utterance in adolescence https://t.co/l9R0tO7rfE

Kyler Murray just had the greatest moment in his life and you guys want to ruin it with a stupid tweet you dug up from when he was FIFTEEN YEARS OLD?! If you want people to not hate you, stop doing things like this. There's no low mainstream media won't dive down to for clicks. https://t.co/j03Lp7g8VW

Did Murray respond?

Early Sunday morning, the star athlete aplogized for the tweets.

I apologize for the tweets that have come to light tonight from when I was 14 and 15. I used a poor choice of word that doesn't reflect who I am or what I believe. I did not intend to single out any individual or group.

Libs of TikTok Queer Trans Person Says Preschoolers Need to Learn About Queer Stuff,"A queer trans educator posted a video on TikTok to justify why preschoolers need to learn about sexuality. If you are prepared for two minutes and eight seconds of blood-boiling content, watch the video.

In the video, the queer person mentioned a website called ""Queer Kid Stuff."" Here is the message on the ""Queer Kid Stuff"" home page:

""Hi friend! Welcome to our corner of the internet. We’re Queer Kid Stuff! An edutainment company that brings LGBTQ+ and social justice media to kids and families! We make videos, podcasts, newsletters, and so much more!...""

Queer trans early childhood educator explains why we need to talk to preschoolers about gender and sexuality pic.twitter.com/bybPUSrQik — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) July 27, 2022

This site offers an eight-week remote learning course on social justice and LGBTQ+ topics for pre-k through third grade. The site also links to an ""educational resource"" page with a link to ""Woke Kindergarten.""

Woke Kindergarten claims it is a ""global, abolitionist early childhood ecosystem & visionary creative portal supporting children, families, educators, and organizations in their commitment to abolitionist early education and pro-black and queer and trans liberation.""



By flagging this video, the Libs of TikTok Twitter page exposed a hotbed of content that ""probably won't interest the public,"" and conservatives should ""definitiely not criticize on social media."" Especially considering how fiercely the movement is protected by the Biden administration.

'It's really sick and dark': Gay journalist Chadwick Moore says pedophiles are trying to gain acceptance into the LGBT community,"CORRECTION: Originally published on September 9, 2020, this article introduces a video clip in which Andrew Wilkow and guest Chadwick Moore discuss Senate Bill 145 and other then-current events which they perceived as attempts by ""the left"" to ""normalize pedophilia"" and in some cases, include sex offenders under LGBT legal protections. This is false. SB-145 is not intended to legally protect sex offenders or classify pedophilia as a sexual orientation, but ""to reform the state's sex offender registry to be fairer to young LGBT adults who may be in technical violation of statutory rape laws,"" according to this Reuters Fact Check. This article is not intended to endorse or validate the opinions expressed in the video.





California's controversial Senate Bill 145, which would reduce penalties for sexual relations with minors, passed both legislative houses last week and now sits on the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).



According to State Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill, the current law discriminates against the LGBT community.

""Senate Bill 145 is an anti-discrimination law,"" Wiener told KXTV-TV. He went on to explain that SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex offender registration for adults who have anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision. Also, SB 145 would only apply in cases involving minors between ages 14 and 17 and with an offender within a 10-year age range.

In this episode of ""Wilkow,"" BlazeTV host Andrew Wilkow was joined by journalist Chadwick Moore, a former liberal who once wrote that admitting he was a gay man to his father, ""a Republican and a farmer in Iowa,"" was easier than ""coming out as a conservative"" in New York.

Prompted by the controversy surrounding SB- 145, Wilkow and Moore discussed what they perceived to be attempts by ""the left"" to normalize pedophilia and include sex offenders under the legal protections of the LGBT community.

""It's really sick and dark,"" Moore opined. ""These things are coming out in the activist circles and entering the mainstream narrative. [...] You know, this is how the left always operates, with what's called the Overton window. They will put a really insane idea out there just to shift the frame of acceptable public discourse.""

""They are masters at using language to change the narrative and change how people view the world,"" Moore went on to suggest. He claimed that pedophiles are now calling themselves ""Minor Attracted Persons"" or ""MAPs"" and arguing that pedophilia is merely a ""sexual orientation"" in what he considered to be an attempt to gain acceptance into the LGBT community.

""It's truly baffling and sick and no one will call them out,"" Moore said.
