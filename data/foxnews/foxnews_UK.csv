Tolkien and ""The Canterbury Tales,"" as works that could lead to right-wing extremism.

British tabloids found this month that a report by the Research Information and Communications Unit (RICU) of the U.K.’s Prevent program flagged these works of fiction, along with a litany of other written works, family sitcoms and movies like ""Yes Minister,"" ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""The Great Escape,"" as ""key texts"" for ""white nationalists/supremacists.""

UK DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM IRANIAN FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF OVER JOURNALIST THREATS

The Prevent system is a ""national safeguarding program that supports people who are at risk of becoming involved with terrorism through radicalization,"" according to the Home Office’s website.

Fox News Digital could not verify the extent of the list of books, movies and shows flagged under the government program and the Home Office could not verify the existence of the list, noting they do not ""comment on leaks.""

The program has reportedly been embroiled in controversy since it was created two decades ago, with some critics arguing it discriminated against Muslims.

The program aimed at preventing terrorism has faced renewed criticism of late, though this time with Brits questioning its effectiveness as complaints over right-wing extremism are on the rise.

The program saw an independent review – made public earlier this month and described by some publications as ""scathing"" – that recommended nearly three dozen improvements.

The audit ultimately argued the program is ""not doing enough to counter nonviolent Islamist extremism"" and ""has a double standard when dealing with the extreme right wing and Islamism"".

The review itself received push back from human rights groups that rejected the findings as ""prejudice"" with ""no legitimacy,"" according to the Guardian.

But the U.K. government accepted the results and, in a comment to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the Home Office said, ""The Home Secretary made clear that Prevent will now ensure it focuses on the key threat of Islamist terrorism, as well as remaining vigilant on emerging threats.""

1,"UK nurse Lucy Letby denies injecting twin babies with air, insulin in murder case","A U.K. jury heard testimony accusing Lucy Letby, 33, of injecting one infant dubbed Child M with air in April 2016 before attempting to poison the infant’s twin, Child L, with insulin, reports said Monday.

Child M and Child L are just two of 10 infants that Letby has been accused of attempting to kill on top of the seven babies she is accused of murdering at the Countess of Chester Hospital, just south of Liverpool. Letby has denied all charges against her.

Jurors listened as the prosecution described how doctors and nurses worked to resuscitate Child M, a six-week premature boy, for 25 minutes in the late afternoon on April 9, 2016, by administering CPR and multiple doses of adrenaline after he stopped breathing, according to the BBC.

'SMILING' NURSE LUCY LETBY ACCUSED OF KILLING BABY GIRL AFTER FOUR ATTEMPTS

The infant was eventually stabilized and was placed on a ventilator before he and his twin brother were discharged from the hospital in May 2016.

The prosecution alleged Child M collapsed after Letby injected him with oxygen.

Letby, who was assigned to the infant for evening care and noted he had symptoms that were indicative of the brain being starved of oxygen, has denied the accusations.

Brain scans on Child M reportedly found that he suffered no adverse afteraffects.

Letby abruptly left the court’s proceedings last week after she broke down in tears when testimony began in relation to Child L, whom she has also denied attempting to murder.

The court heard how the infants started to deteriorate at ""pretty much the same time"" after Letby also allegedly attacked Child L in the early hours of April 10, 2016 – just hours after doctors had managed to stabilize Child M.

BABY ATTACKED BY ALLEGED ‘KILLER NURSE’ LUCY LETBY RECOVERED AFTER BEING MOVED TO NEW HOSPITAL

She has been accused of injecting Child L with a dose of insulin and the doctor on call recounted how he was concerned by the baby’s dropping blood sugar levels – an occurrence that could happen after an insulin dose is administered.

But when asked if she gave the infant insulin, Letby told police officers, who questioned her in 2019, ""That wasn't done by me.""

Letby said she didn’t think she or another nurse could have accidentally administered the insulin dose.

A blood sample from Child L had been sent from a lab at the nearby Royal Liverpool Hospital that showed insulin had been administered to the infant rather than having been naturally produced by its pancreas, a consultant clinical scientist at the Liverpool facility, Dr. Anna Milan, told the court.

2,"UK announces deal to send illegal migrants to Rwanda, says it is made possible by Brexit","The British government on Thursday announced that it will send migrants who illegally enter through its borders to Rwanda -- in a bid to stop illegal immigration that immediately drew criticism from left-wing politicians and activist groups.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the deal with the East African country, saying that it would allow anyone entering illegally, as well as any illegal immigrant who arrived since Jan 1., to be transported to Rwanda.

BREXIT PASSES FIRST MAJOR TEST IN UKRAINE WAR, OBSERVERS SAY

Johnson said in a speech that the move was made possible by Britain’s departure from the European Union, which gave Britain greater control over its immigration policies.

""This innovative approach driven by our shared humanitarian impulse and made possible by Brexit freedoms, will provide safe and legal routes for asylum while disrupting the business model of the gangs, because it means that economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the U.K.,"" Johnson said. ""While those in genuine need will be properly protected, including with access to legal services, on arrival in Rwanda and given the opportunity to build a new life in that dynamic country supported by the funding we are providing.""

Successive Britain governments have struggled with illegal immigration across the English Channel from France. Migrants will sneak onto the back of trucks or other vehicles coming across the channel between Calais and Dover -- or on small boats across the channel itself, often organized by criminal gangs.

Johnson said that seven out of 10 migrants who arrived on small boats were men under 40. Johnson said that attempted crossers have passed thorough ""manifestly safe countries, including many in Europe where they could and should have claimed asylum.""

More than 28,000 entered the U.K. on boats in 2021, up from 8,500 in 2020. It has led to concerns about exploitation by gangs, similar to the way cartels have exploited the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the danger to migrants.

ZELENSKYY CALLS FOR MORE SANCTIONS AS UK'S BORIS JOHNSON MAKES SURPRISE KYIV VISIT

Johnson, in his speech, focused on the costs of illegal immigration to the British taxpayer, claiming the U.K. is generous to immigrants but that ""we cannot sustain a parallel illegal system.""

""Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity is not,"" Johnson said, saying it was unfair to ask British taxpayers to write a ""blank check"" for anyone who wishes to live in the U.K.

The policy was immediately criticized by human rights groups, who denied Johnson’s assertion that Rwanda is a safe country. It drew criticism from the left-wing Labour Party, with leader Keir Starmer calling the plan ""unworkable"" and ""extortionate"" and accused Johnson of seeking to distract from the controversy over his attendance at parties during COVID-19 lockdowns.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said it had made its objections known to both countries.

""UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,"" UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Gillian Triggs said in a statement.

The Rwandan government said the five-year agreement would see Britain paying approximately $157 million for housing and other migrant services.

The campaign group Led By Donkeys said they painted the 5,400-square-foot blue and yellow flag to mark one year since Russia invaded Ukraine. It said activists wanted to remind Russian President Vladimir Putin that ""Ukraine is an independent state and a people with every right to self-determination.""

The group said activists safely halted cars before pouring 35 gallons of paint on the road. Vehicles then spread the paint in both directions to create the flag, it said.

4,"UK hits Russia, Belarus with more than 300 sanctions over Ukraine invasion","The U.K. government on Tuesday announced more than 300 more sanctions on Russia and Belarus over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine -- bringing the number of sanctions on individuals and other entities to more than 1,000.

The government imposed the sanctions after the passage of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act which allows the government to pass sanctions quickly.

RUSSIA ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS AGAINST BIDEN AND TOP US OFFICIALS

The new sanctions target 370 individuals, 30 of whom are oligarchs or their family members to the tune of more than $130 billion, the Foreign Office said in a statement. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that the announcement shows that the U.K. is going ""further and faster"" to hit those connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine,"" she said.

The sanctions come on top of the U.K.’s targeting of Russian defense companies, trade and transportation.

The sanctions include asset freezes and travel bans and included the founder of Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia, as well as owners of airports and steel companies. On the political front, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu are hit by the new sanctions.

The U.K. has also designated Putin’s press secretary and the Foreign Ministry’s director of information. Separately it announced additional import tariffs of 35% on Russian and Belarusian products ranging from vodka and white fish to iron, oil seeds and grain.

BIDEN CALLS FOR END TO NORMAL RUSSIA TRADE RELATIONS, BAN ON SEAFOOD, VODKA, DIAMOND IMPORTS

The measures ""will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect,’’ Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said.

The E.U. meanwhile imposed sanctions on luxury goods including pure-bred horses, Champagne, pearls and diamonds as part of its bid to target oligarchs -- who have become a key target for sanctions aimed at Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions stayed clear of energy sectors.

The E.U. also targeted more than a dozen extra entities and individuals -- including Chelsea F.C. owner Roman Abramovich, who was hit by both an asset freeze and travel ban. Abramovich was already sanctioned by the U.K.

5,UK Prime Minister Liz Truss resigns after less than 2 months in office,"U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday after less than two months in office amid pressure following a reversal of economic policies that led to economic instability.

Truss made the announcement a day after she defiantly declared that she is ""a fighter and not a quitter."" Ultimately, however, she said that circumstances have changed.

""Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,"" Truss said. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.""

Truss said that a leadership election will take place ""within the next week"" and that she will stay on as prime minister ""until a successor has been chosen.""

Truss' announcement came soon after Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigned via a letter that slammed the prime minister.

UK PM TRUSS DEFIANTLY STATES ‘I AM A FIGHTER’ AFTER CALLS FOR HER RESIGNATION

""The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes,"" Braverman said. ""Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics.""

Braverman, part of the right wing of the Conservative Party, ran for party leader earlier this year, coming up short when Truss won.

Braverman’s exit came days after Truss fired Treasury head Kwasi Kwarteng amid financial turmoil that included the British pound declining in value to be nearly equal to the U.S. dollar. The problems came after Truss’ administration pushed a tax cut plan in September, which Kwarteng’s replacement Jeremy Hunt scrapped in October.

Truss apologized to lawmakers on Wednesday and admitted she had made errors during her time in office — just six weeks, so far — but insisted that scrapping the tax cut plan was ""the right decision in the interest of the country’s economic stability.""

Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer blasted Truss on Wednesday, shouting in the House of Commons, ""Why is she still here?""

PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS UK PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS' TAX CUT PLAN WAS A ‘MISTAKE’

Many Conservative Party members were also saying Truss needed to go. Conservative lawmaker Simon Hoare told the BBC on Thursday that Truss had ""about 12 hours"" to fix the situation. Other Conservative Party lawmakers did not appear even to be willing to wait that long.

""It’s time for the prime minister to go,"" Miriam Cates said.

""She isn’t up to the job, sadly,"" Steve Double opined.

Many within the party hope that replacing Truss will stave off Labour Party momentum and help Conservatives maintain control in the long run. Possible replacements for Truss include Hunt; ex-Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, who Truss defeated earlier this year; and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt.

Truss will remain in power until the party chooses a replacement. That process could take weeks under current rules, which allow all party members to vote, although the party’s left wing is looking to change the rules to limit voting to members of Parliament. Such a change could mean Truss could be out within days.

The country’s immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, is heading a new taskforce to ensure that ""only those eligible can work, receive benefits or access to public service,"" The Telegraph reports.

""We’re delivering on our promise to increase raids on illegal employers: a new Enforcement Taskforce will ensure only those eligible can work, access public services and benefits,"" Jenrick tweeted Sunday.

The new initiative will include a 50% increase in immigration enforcement visits to construction sites, car washes, and gig economy firms.

7,UK prime minister fined after appearing to wear no seat belt in video,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will pay a fine for not wearing a seatbelt while filming a video to promote an economic program Friday.

The fine, issued by Lancashire Police to a ""42-year-old man from London,"" will cost around £100, or roughly $124 – pennies for a man who has a net-worth greater than that of the King of England. The fine can increase to £500, or roughly $620, should the case go to court.

Sunak had visited Lancashire to film the video as part of a trip across the north of England. He was trying to promote the government’s latest spending bill, which aimed to help ""level up"" or improve facilities and infrastructure in key parts of the country.

In the video, posted to Instagram, Sunak sits in the back of a car discussing how the government plans to spend its £2.1 billion fund, but eagle-eyed viewers couldn’t help noticing the prime minister wasn’t wearing a seat belt.

""Police chiefs have been caught red-handed wasting money on woke nonsense,"" Tom Ryan, a researcher at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, told the Telegraph.

The Telegraph reported that 27 police departments in England and Wales spent £66,689 on rainbow-themed merchandise between 2019 and 2022, according to data released under freedom of information laws.

The data, according to the Telegraph, found the South Wales Police force was the biggest spender, forking over £24,000, or roughly $29,000, for rainbow-themed T-shirts, badges, pens, whistles, flags, water bottles and even sporks.

Other departments spent funds to deck cars out with rainbow-themed stickers, on items called ""rainbow fuzzy bugs,"" as well as for fans and stickers.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council has previously said that rainbow-themed patrol vehicles act as ""hate-crime cars"" and encourage members of the public to report hate crimes, including social media posts, according to the Telegraph.

The Taxpayers’ Alliance, a nonpartisan group that advocates for lower taxes in the UK, slammed the spending, noting that crime is on the rise and funds should instead be used to bolster public safety.

Damien Bendall pleaded guilty to rape and four counts of murder in Derby Crown Court on Wednesday, Derbyshire Police said in a statement. He admitted to raping and murdering 11-year-old Lacey Bennett on Sept. 19, 2021.

Bendall also allegedly murdered her 13-year-old brother John Paul Bennett, the siblings’ mother and Bendall’s pregnant partner, 35-year-old Terri Harris, and the girl’s friend, 11-year-old Connie Gent, at a home in Killamarsh, a town and civil parish in North East Derbyshire, England.

Sitting outside the house when police arrive, body camera footage shows Bendall standing and telling officers that he has no weapons on him. He complies when asked to unbutton his coat, and officers ask if he harmed himself, noting the blood on Bendall’s hands. Bendall says he stabbed himself ""about four inches in with a bread knife and one on the stomach"" and continues to unbutton the top of his coat.

11,"UK sees record number of illegal immigrants crossing English Channel, as deportation plan stalls","The United Kingdom saw a record number of migrants in a single day coming across the English Channel this week, as the government struggles to implement a scheme to send illegal immigrants to Rwanda.

British media reported that 1,295 migrants crossed the channel from Europe in small boats on Monday, a daily record. The BBC reported that means that 22,557 migrants have crossed since the start of the year.

Illegal immigrants typically have crossed into the U.K. by hopping onto the backs of trucks as they crossed from Calais, France to Dover either by ferry or by the Channel Tunnel.

However, the number coming across via the Channel on small boats increased sharply after 2018. According to U.K. government figures, there were just 299 illegal immigrants caught coming across in small boats in 2018. In 2021 that number had soared to 28,526.

UK ANNOUNCES DEAL TO SEND ILLEGAL MIGRANTS TO RWANDA, SAYS IT IS MADE POSSIBLE BY BREXIT

The illegal immigrants are mainly from countries far from the U.K., and have moved through multiple safe countries in order to get to Blighty.

Official figures show that since 2018, Iranians and Iraqis represent half of all small boat arrivals, followed by migrants from Eritrea, Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Vietnam and then Albania. However, this year Albanians are now tied with Afghans as the nation with the most people arriving by small boats, with each accounting for 18% of the total. Additionally, some 2,165 Albanians arrived in Britain via this route in the first six months of 2022.

The British government, led by Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has repeatedly pledged to crack down on illegal immigration -- but has struggled to deliver on its promises.

Earlier this year, Johnson’s government announced a deal with Rwanda that would see illegal immigrants sent there instead -- a move that sparked outrage from Britain’s left-wing politicians as well as the United Nations.

UK GOVERNMENT PUSHES BILL TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, HOLD MIGRANTS OFFSHORE

The agreement was similar in some aspects to efforts by the Trump administration in the United States to implement ""safe third country"" agreements that would see migrants sent there instead. Such agreements are designed to stop those who are using asylum claims as a cloak to cover economically-driven migration.

Johnson said in a speech that the move was made possible by Britain’s departure from the European Union , which gave Britain greater control over its immigration policies.

""This innovative approach driven by our shared humanitarian impulse and made possible by Brexit freedoms, will provide safe and legal routes for asylum while disrupting the business model of the gangs, because it means that economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the U.K.,"" Johnson said. ""While those in genuine need will be properly protected, including with access to legal services, on arrival in Rwanda and given the opportunity to build a new life in that dynamic country supported by the funding we are providing.""

Johnson said that seven out of 10 migrants who arrived by small boats were men under the age of 40 and have passed through ""manifestly safe countries, including many in Europe where they could and should have claimed asylum.""

However, the first flight in June was blocked after the European Court of Human Rights -- separate from the European Union, from which the U.K. has departed -- issued an injunction.

Flights have been on hold since then amid the ongoing legal challenge with objections focused on alleged human rights issues related to sending migrants to the East African country.

""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast and which party is not,"" Braverman, a conservative, said this week. ""Let’s stop pretending they are all refugees in distress, the whole country knows that is not true.""

Braverman added that her country’s ""hopelessly lax asylum system"" is ""broken.""

Braverman’s comments drew harsh criticism from liberal politicians, including Kim Johnson, a lawmaker for the main opposition Labour Party, who said Braverman's language would inflame tensions amid the growing immigration crisis along the English Channel.

UK SEES RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CROSSING ENGLISH CHANNEL, AS DEPORTATION PLAN STALLS

Anne McLaughlin, a Scottish Nationalist Party member of Parliament, said she was ""disgusted, absolutely disgusted to hear a Home secretary deliberately use inflammatory language about vulnerable asylum seekers."" She called the remarks shameful.

""She’s totally unfit to be Home secretary,"" Labor MP Zarah Sultana said, according to The Sun.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick attempted to clarify Braverman's comment by saying ""you have to choose your words very carefully"" and that he would ""never demonize people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life,"" Sky News reported . However, Jenrick explained that Braverman ""was trying to express"" the severity of the crisis.

""The Home secretary was seeking to express the sheer scale of the challenge that faces the country, with people, including a significant proportion of economic migrants, seeking to make this journey,"" a spokesperson for newly installed U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, according to the BBC .

Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit Party as well as UKIP, defended Braverman on Twitter.

BRITAIN FACES RECORD MIGRANT INFLUX VIA ENGLISH CHANNEL, DEMANDS FRANCE CRACK DOWN

""It’s a word I’ve been using for two years that I’ve been condemned for,"" Farage said in a video message . ""I expect even more pressure to come on the Home secretary. I really hope she stays in post but believe me, the establishment are out to get her because she’s got the guts to say many of these people just are not refugees.""

The number of people making the hazardous journey across one of the world's busiest shipping lanes has risen sharply in recent years, with 40,000 reaching the U.K. so far this year, up from 28,000 in all of 2021 and 8,500 in 2020. Some have predicted the number of migrants crossing into the United Kingdom could pass 60,000 by the end of the year.

UK PLEDGES TO CRACK DOWN ON ‘APPALLING’ WAVE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACROSS ENGLISH CHANNEL

Braverman was reappointed by Sunak last week, six days after she resigned from the same role for breaching ministerial rules by sending a sensitive government document via her personal email.

She has also been accused of failing to listen to legal advice on the prolonged detention of migrants at a processing center and failing to secure adequate accommodation for them, both claims she has denied. She has, so far, ignored calls to resign once again.

Braverman's comments came the day after an immigration center in Dover was targeted with gasoline bombs on Sunday, injuring one person before the suspect reportedly killed himself.

""No Home secretary who was serious about public safety or national security would use highly inflammatory language on the day after a dangerous petrol bomb attack on a Dover initial processing center,"" Yvette Cooper, the home affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, said.

THE BRITISH POUND HAS TAKEN A TUMBLE. WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

Braverman is also facing criticism after revealing that ""high numbers"" of migrants could potentially take legal action against the government for being housed at processing centers longer than the law permits, The Sun reported.

Some have attempted to place blame on Braverman for the legal issues, which could mean payouts of up to 6,000 British pounds for each migrant, and alleged that she blocked migrants from being sent to hotels.

Braverman has denied that she ""deliberately"" blocked the transfer of migrants, adding that the criticisms were part of a ""political witch hunt"" that ignores the ""facts of the problem.""

""Illegal immigration is out of control,"" Braverman said.

About a fifth of British voters say dealing with immigration is the most challenging issue facing the country, according to a YouGov poll published this month.

""The number of people arriving in the U.K. via small boats has reached record levels and continues to put our asylum system under incredible pressure,"" a spokesperson for the U.K. Home Office told Fox News Digital. ""Manston remains resourced and equipped to process migrants securely and we will provide alternative accommodation as soon as possible.""

""We urge anyone who is thinking about leaving a safe country and risking their lives at the hands of criminal people smugglers to seriously reconsider,"" the statement continued. ""Despite what they have been told, they will not be allowed to start a new life here.""

The Home Office added that it will continue to provide for all the basic needs of migrants who arrive at their processing centers and said they are ""absolutely committed to securing the welfare of all migrants and staff"" at the Manston processing center.

13,"Charges dropped against UK woman for silent prayer outside abortion clinic, though she still vows legal fight","UK authorities have dropped charges against a woman who was arrested for silently praying outside an abortion clinic in December, but warned she may face additional charges.

Last December, Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, the director of the UK March for Life, was standing near the BPAS Robert Clinic in Kings Norton, Birmingham, when police approached after an onlooker complained she might be praying outside the abortion facility.

Vaughan-Spruce was standing in an area under a Public Spaces Protection Order (""PSPO""), which establishes a ""safe zone"" around abortion clinics and prohibits ""engaging in any act of approval/disapproval,"" including praying.

Despite the dropped charges, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) warned Vaughan-Spruce charges ""may well start again"" in the near future, according to a report by Alliance Defending Freedom UK. ""This is a warning prosecutors can issue when they expect that further evidence will be received,"" the legal nonprofit organization representing Vaughan-Spruce argued.

UK WOMAN ARRESTED FOR PRAYING NEAR ABORTION CENTER WARNS MORE ARRESTS MAY COME

To get a clear answer on whether silent prayer near abortion clinics is unlawful, Vaughan-Spruce says she will now be seeking a clear verdict in court.

The pro-life activist says she intends to continue supporting women seek alternatives to abortion.

""It’s important to me that I can continue my vital work in supporting women who’d like to avoid abortion if they only had some help. In order to do so, it’s vital that I have clarity as to my legal status. Many of us need an answer as to whether it’s still lawful to pray silently in our own heads. That’s why I’ll be pursuing a verdict regarding my charges in court,"" explained Isabel Vaughan-Spruce in a statement shared by ADF UK on Friday.

She blasted the PSPO buffer zones which made her silent prayer a ""criminal"" activity.

""It can’t be right that I was arrested and made a criminal, only for praying in my head on a public street. So-called ‘buffer zone legislation’ will result in so many more people like me, doing good and legal activities like offering charitable support to women in crisis pregnancies, or simply praying in their heads, being treated like criminals and even facing court,"" Vaughan-Spruce added.

UK MAN FINED FOR SILENTLY PRAYING OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC: REPORT

Vaughan-Spruce's legal counsel, Jeremiah Igunnubole, commended her next steps as necessary because of the CPS's warning more charges may be underway.

""Isabel is right to request proper clarity as to the lawfulness of our actions. It’s one thing for the authorities to humiliatingly search and arrest an individual simply for their thoughts. It’s quite another to initially deem those thoughts to be sufficient evidence to justify charges, then discontinue those charges due to ‘insufficient evidence’, and then to warn that further evidence relating to the already unclear charges may soon be forthcoming so as to restart the entire grueling process from the beginning,"" he explained.

Several other local councils have adopted PSPO zones, raising concerns about freedom of speech under threat across the UK.

The ADF UK legal counsel warned these buffer zones chill freedom of ""expression and thought.""

""This is a clear instance of the process becoming the punishment creating a chilling effect on free expression and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. ADF UK remain committed to supporting Isabel’s pursuit because no one should fear prosecution for silent prayer and thoughts in the privacy of their mind,"" commented Igunnubole.

On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" the pro-life activist revealed that abortion supporters have also expressed concern about these anti-protest laws.

Equating it to George Orwell's dystopian ""1984"" novel, she described her case as really about ""freedom of thought"" rather than abortion rights.

""This is more to do with freedom of thought here,"" she said. ""It's even gone further than freedom of prayer. I mean, we all talk about the cancel culture and the concerns we have about people being canceled [for] speaking in public,"" she told Carlson in December.

14,"Scandals in the UK: Boris Johnson's 'partygate,' Prince Andrew's demise and other misdeeds","MANCHESTER, England – Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s downfall was just one of many big stories in the U.K. this past year, as Johnson’s time as prime minister was overshadowed by scandal after scandal.

In fact, Johnson shook off so many of them during his time in office, it seemed his political standing would remain undamaged – leading to him being dubbed ‘Teflon Johnson’.

However, the ""Partygate"" scandal over parties, events and other gatherings held in government buildings, in breach of the U.K.’s strict COVID-19 lockdown rules, would slowly undermine his authority.

Johnson was accused of knowingly breaking the rules, feigning ignorance and lying about his knowledge of the illegal gatherings.

BORIS JOHNSON 'BROUGHT DOWN BY BORIS JOHNSON,' BUT WEAKENED ECONOMY DIDN'T HELP, EXPERTS SAY

The scandal remained in the spotlight for months as more details leaked out and became public, with Johnson maintaining his innocence, despite a flurry of newspaper headlines.

It proved particularly damaging because so many families who were forced to follow the rules were denied seeing loved ones who died of the virus – leading to accusations of double standards.

Police investigated, and it emerged Johnson had attended at least three parties, including one the day before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral.

In April 2022, he was fined for breaking lockdown rules, along with his wife Carrie and then-Chancellor of the Exchequer and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

Johnson became the first serving prime minister to break the law and face police sanctions; his reputation never recovered.

Additionally, when he was accused of misleading Parliament over claims senior Conservative Party colleague Chris Pincher had groped two men at a private club, it prompted many government ministers and Members of Parliament (MPs) to resign.

UK PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON APOLOGIZES AS PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR HIM TO RESIGN OVER ‘PARTYGATE’

Johnson later apologized for his handling of the affair, but it did little to calm the crisis, and he was forced to quit in July.

Below are some of the other stories that made big headlines in the U.K. in 2022.

PRINCE ANDREW

A long-running civil case involving the late Queen Elizabeth II’s son, the Duke of York, came to an end in March.

Prince Andrew was sued by Virginia Giuffre for sexual abuse following claims he had sex with her when she was 17 and had been trafficked by his friend, the billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew claimed he never met Giuffre but paid her an out-of-court settlement, reported to be as much as $14.5 million.

The scandal rocked the British royal family and severely damaged the duke’s public standing.

Andrew stepped back from royal duties in late 2019, saying the case had become a ""major disruption."" In January, the queen took steps to distance the royal family from him as the prospect of a damaging trial loomed.

'BULLY' PRINCE ANDREW HAD A ‘REVOLVING DOOR’ OF WOMEN ENTERING 'HIS BEDROOM,' FORMER ROYAL OFFICER CLAIMS

She stripped the duke of his honorary military roles, and he was forced to stop using his ""His Royal Highness"" title.

Reports have claimed Andrew wishes to return to public life, but the move is opposed by his brother King Charles III, who succeeded his mother on the British throne following her death in August.

BORIS BECKER

Tennis star Boris Becker was jailed in April for hiding $3 million of his assets to avoid paying his debts.

The three-time Wimbledon champion, 55, was declared bankrupt in June 2017 – owing creditors almost $61 million over an unpaid loan of more than $3.6 million on his estate on the Spanish island of Mallorca.

He was legally obliged to disclose all of his assets so that trustees could distribute available funds to creditors, but his trial heard he had acted ""deliberately and dishonestly"".

Becker was released from prison in early December after serving eight months of his two-and-a-half year sentence and was deported from the U.K., albeit in a private jet, after living there since 2012.

BORIS BECKER CLAIMS INMATE TRIED TO KILL HIM WHILE IN PRISON: 'I WAS SHAKING SO BAD'

He filmed a two-part documentary with Apple TV in which he talks about the emotional turmoil he felt prior to being jailed. In it, he admits he hit rock ""bottom"" while he was waiting to be sentenced.

FROM PARLIAMENT TO REALITY SHOW

Former U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was already a controversial figure over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Charged with leading the government’s response to the biggest peacetime emergency the U.K. faced, Hancock was heavily criticized for the decisions he made amid accusations more lives could have been saved.

However, it was his affair with his government-funded aide Gina Coladangelo that forced his resignation in June 2021 after CCTV cameras caught the couple kissing in his office.

Hancock admitted to breaking the government’s own social distancing rules, and he was forced to apologize for ""letting people down"".

He was able to stay on as an MP, but there was further controversy when he appeared on popular reality-TV show ""I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here,"" which sees contestants competing in various challenges in an Australian jungle.

UK HEALTH SECRETARY MATT HANCOCK RESIGNS AFTER IMAGES SHOW HIM KISSING AIDE

It was claimed he picked up as much as $485,000 for his appearance and he still received his MP’s salary on top, despite being thousands of miles away from the people he was supposed to represent.

Unsurprisingly, he was criticized my many, including Conservative Party colleagues. Additionally, some opponents branded his stint on the show an ""insult"" to bereaved families who had lost loved ones to COVID.

He was suspended as an MP, but when it became obvious he had lost the support of party members, he announced his intention to quit politics for new challenges.

LONDON'S POLICE CHIEF FORCED OUT

The head of the U.K. Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, resigned in February.

It followed a series of scandals that rocked the force following claims of institutional misogyny, racism and homophobia.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan later said the public had lost ""trust"" in the force, and he had lost ""confidence"" in Dick to carry our the necessary changes needed.

It followed claims from Dick that she had felt ""intimidated"" into stepping down.

Among the scandals that led to her resignation was the murder of Sarah Everard by serving Metropolitan Police firearms officer Wayne Couzens.

15,"UK commits to sending Ukraine Challenger 2 tanks, going further than Biden admin","The United Kingdom on Saturday pledged to send Ukraine tanks while its capital city once again fell victim to missile strikes and as heavy ground warfare continued in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would send Ukraine Challenger 2 tanks along with additional artillery systems following a Saturday call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The war has once again been ramping up and both Russia and Ukraine look to bolster their forces and take control over the battlefield in the Donbas where intense fighting continues along a 50-mile axis from Bakhmut and Soledar in Donetsk to Kremmina in Luhansk.

RUSSIA AGAIN CLAIMS VICTORY OVER UKRAINIAN CITY SOLEDAR, IN POSSIBLE RARE VICTORY

According to a readout of the call the British government said the leaders ""agreed on the need to seize on this moment with an acceleration of global military and diplomatic support to Ukraine.""

Zelenskyy has longed urged Western allies to send his troops on the east front tanks, but in recent weeks those calls have been amplified and partner nations like France and Poland have begun to answer the calls.

Earlier this month Paris pledged to send AMX-10 RC light tanks and Warsaw this week said it would send its German-made Leopard tanks to the war-torn nation.

Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday also said he was in talks with allied nations to send additional tanks, but he did not specify which nations he was referring to.

The U.S. has not yet committed to send tanks, though the Biden administration will send Bradley Fighting Vehicles which it has argued will prove valuable on the fluid warfront.

US COMMITS $3B IN LARGEST DEFENSIVE PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE YET TO CHANGE 'DYNAMIC ON THE BATTLEFIELD'

In a $3 billion drawdown package announced last week, the U.S. committed to sending 50 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 100 Armored Personnel Carriers, 55 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles and 138 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles.

The chief differences between Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the U.S.'s M1 Abrams tank is its lighter armor and cannon ability.

Though tanks possess heavier armor and longer-range firing power, they also transport fewer troops on the battlefield and are less easily maneuverable.

Germany last week also said it would send Ukraine 40 combat vehicles and a Patriot air defense missile system – a sophisticated battery capable of taking down ballistic missiles.

The U.S. has also pledged to train Ukrainian soldiers on the Patriot system and will send Kyiv one of its own batteries as well.

It is unclear how fast the U.K., France or Poland can get tanks on Ukraine’s front lines, but Washington said it would take a few months to get its vehicles over to Ukraine and get its fighters trained up on the U.S. systems.

The British prime minister told Zelenskyy that he and his government would work ""intensively"" to get the defensive aid promised by international partners delivered ""rapidly"" to best ""allow Ukraine to press their advantage, win this war and secure a lasting peace.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-commits-sending-ukraine-challenger-2-tanks-further-than-biden-admin,N/A
16,"UK's increased coronavirus cases linked to discount dining program, study claims","A discount dining program launched in the U.K. to help restaurants and pubs rebound following coronavirus lockdowns seems to have contributed to an uptick in COVID-19 cases, a new study suggests.

New research from the University of Warwick claims to have found evidence that ties at least part of the U.K.'s latest wave of COVID-19 infections to restaurants, and specifically after the British government shelled out $647 million, according to Bloomberg, to subsidize the cost of restaurant meals and drinks in August.

In July, the U.K. launched a discount dining incentive program to promote spending at restaurants, bars and cafes that were devastated financially from closings earlier this year due to COVID-19. The subsidized meal program, called “Eat Out to Help Out,” boasted half-priced meals (up to a certain monetary value) from Monday to Wednesday, to get more people interested in dining out.

However, researchers suggest that while the program boosted restaurant traffic, it could be to blame for between 8% and 17% of coronavirus cases that occurred across the pond between the summer months of August and into September, fueling a second wave of the virus.

CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN IN ENGLAND COULD LAST LONGER THAN 4 WEEKS

Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick and author of the paper “Subsidizing the spread of COVID19: Evidence from the UK's Eat-Out-to-Help-Out scheme,” published in the Centre for Economic Policy Research, discovered that the coronavirus spread faster in concentrated areas with restaurants that participated in the discounted dining program, and the infection rate slowed in those same areas once the program concluded.

“Areas with higher take-up saw both, a notable increase in new COVID19 infection clusters within a week of the scheme starting, and again, a deceleration in infections within two weeks of the program ending,” Fetzer noted in the paper.

There were also lower infection rates in areas that experienced rainy days — and restaurant traffic decreased — when compared to areas with nicer weather.

17,"UK to probe whether the 1998 Omagh bomb, one of Ireland’s deadliest incidents, could have been prevented","The U.K. government said Thursday it will hold a public inquiry into whether the deadliest bombing in Northern Ireland’s decades of violence could have been prevented.

Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced a judge-led independent probe of the 1998 car bombing in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and wounded hundreds more. An Irish Republican Army dissident group, the Real IRA, claimed responsibility.

A court in 2021 ordered the government to investigate in response to a legal challenge by Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden was killed by the 500-pound bomb. Gallagher alleges that intelligence failings allowed a ""preventable atrocity"" to occur in the busy market town.

AFGHANISTAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL BRAGS ABOUT ORDERING ATTACKS THAT KILLED HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS

Heaton-Harris said the inquiry ""will focus specifically on the four grounds which the court held as giving rise to plausible arguments that the bombing could have been prevented,"" including whether security services had advance intelligence of the bomb and whether they could have disrupted the plot.

The inquiry is likely to take two years — and potentially much longer. The inquirers will have the power to order evidence to be handed over and to compel witnesses to testify under oath.

Heaton-Harris said he hoped the decision to conduct an independent inquiry ""gives some comfort to those families who have long campaigned for this outcome.""

Gallagher said the inquiry would let bereaved families ""hopefully get the answers that we need and we can move on.""

18,"UK school chaplain sues after being fired, reported as terrorist for sermon questioning LGBTQ activists","A school chaplain in the United Kingdom is taking legal action against his former employer after he says he was fired because of a 2019 sermon that told students they are entitled to make up their own minds about the claims of LGBTQ identity politics.

""I gave a sermon in chapel saying you don't have to accept anybody's ideology, you make up your own mind,"" said Rev. Dr. Bernard Randall of his sermon, which remains available online. ""On certain issues, LGBT activists and Christians are in full agreement: there should be no discrimination, no one should be attacked personally or whatever. But there are issues where there's disagreement.""

Randall, an ordained minister in the Church of England who worked five years at Trent College in Derbyshire, England, was also reported to the government's counterterrorism watchdog by his school and blacklisted as a ""safeguarding risk"" to children by his diocese because of his sermon, he told Fox News Digital in a Tuesday phone interview.

In his sermon, Randall explained to his young students, all of whom were aged 11 to 17, what the Church of England's historical teachings are on marriage, sexuality and gender. He reminded them they are not required to embrace the claims of LGBTQ activists, and are entitled under English law to believe what they wish on such issues.

""So the school leadership took exception to that, dragged me in for an interrogation, suspended me, subsequently sacked me for gross misconduct despite being a Church of England school,"" he said. ""I was a Church of England minister in a Church of England act of worship, giving a sermon saying you may accept Church teaching.""

CHRISTIAN SCHOOL REFUSES TO CHANGE LONG-HELD POLICY EXCLUDING SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DESPITE ALLEGED DEATH THREATS

Randall said the idea for the sermon came to him after one of his pupils asked him to speak in chapel about why they ""have to accept"" LGBTQ ideology at a Christian school. Trent College, which is affiliated with the Church of England, had previously brought in Elly Barnes, CEO and founder of Educate and Celebrate, an LGBTQ education charity, to train school staff.

Barnes reportedly encouraged school staff to chant ""smash heteronormativity"" at a training session. Her group, which did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, aims to help schools and organizations ""embed gender, gender identity and sexual orientation into the fabric"" of their culture, according to its website.

Randall said he raised concerns at the time with school leadership that Barnes' directives would be at odds with the school's Protestant evangelical ethos, but that he was left out of the decision to implement her organization's program. Days after his controversial sermon in 2019, he was reportedly called before the school's deputy head and its designated safeguarding lead (DSL) and told that his beliefs were irrelevant and that his sermon had hurt some people's feelings.

Following an investigation, the school fired Randall. He later learned that the school's DSL also reported him to local law enforcement and Prevent, which polices allegations of terrorism in the United Kingdom. The government watchdog ultimately determined that he did not pose a terrorist threat.

After being fired, Randall was reinstated following an appeal, but he said his reinstatement came with a list of conditions, one of which forbade him to broach ""any topic or express any opinion (in Chapel or more generally around School) that is likely to cause offense or distress to members of the school body."" He also had to obtain prior approval from the school regarding the themes and content of his sermons.

Randall was furloughed during the pandemic, never restored to full-time hours and ultimately made redundant on Dec. 31, 2020.

UK POLICE SAY BRITISH ARMY VETERAN ARRESTED BECAUSE ANTI-LGBTQ SOCIAL MEDIA POST ‘CAUSED ANXIETY’: VIDEO

In an employment tribunal that begins Wednesday and could last as long as three weeks, Randall is bringing claims of harassment, discrimination, victimization and unfair dismissal on the grounds of his Christian beliefs against Trent College. With the aid of the Christian Legal Centre, he is also seeking compensation for unfair dismissal and a recommendation under the Equality Act 2010.

Citing the ongoing tribunal, Trent College administrators told Fox News Digital in a statement that they are ""unable to comment in detail on the specifics of the case.""

""At Trent College, we are proud of our commitment to supporting the wellbeing of all our students, regardless of faith, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. We want every one of our students to feel safe here, and we work hard to stay abreast of the latest thinking on inclusivity including the evolving LGBT+ landscape,"" the school added.

Randall said that his diocese also investigated him following his sermon. Rather than supporting him, the diocese deemed him a risk to children because of his views. The kicker on their assessment, he said, was that the investigating officer deemed ""the Church itself as a risk factor,"" acknowledging that portions of Scripture and church liturgy support Randall's position.

""They decided that simply holding to the Church's teachings meant that I was potentially a safeguarding risk; that I might cause anxiety to anybody who came to talk to me about matters regarding sexuality and whatever,"" he said. ""Based on no evidence other than I just accept the teachings of the Church that employs me and employs the people who are making the safeguarding assessment.""

The Diocese of Derby did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

Explaining how his situation has been ""challenging,"" Randall said, ""It hasn't made me any less confident of Christian truth. It made me a lot less confident in the Church of England, so trying to work out my place in the big scheme of things has been really difficult.""

""But ultimately, I'm an ordained minister. And when you get ordained, you promise to speak the truth. You're effectively appointed as a ‘prophet,’ so to speak, to society. I promised to do that, so that's what I'm doing,"" he said.

Randall noted that ""woke"" ideology has seemingly assumed all the trappings of a traditional religion, albeit one without God. He places his own experience within a much larger anti-religious trend spreading not just within the United Kingdom, but throughout the Western world.

""I definitely think that the whole ‘woke’ agenda — gender identity ideology, all of those things — is profoundly Marxist in its attitudes,"" he said. ""And we know that Marxists absolutely hate religion. They don't want religious people around because ultimately religious people — both Christians, Jews and others — speak what they hold to be truth higher than what the state says.""

""And for Marxists, the only truth is what the state tells you the truth is, so they have to stamp out any other version of the truth. And that's why religion comes under attack in sometimes blatant ways and sometimes the subtle, chipping away at the foundations, and making fun of religion as if it's foolish. Whereas, actually, those who believe know there's nothing foolish about having the joy and the peace and the promise of eternal life that faith in Jesus brings,"" he continued.

In a written statement about his ordeal, Randall wrote that ""woke activists are eating away at the [Church of England]'s guts."" Many have asked him if he would ever leave the Church because of what he is going through, but he noted to Fox News Digital that he is reluctant to leave because the institution is ""so deep in my DNA, really.""

""I've always been in the Church of England,"" he said. ""My family has always been Church of England. I can't quite imagine not being in the Church of England. It's more about the Church of England leaving me, in a sense. I'm not going to make any promises, but I think I want to stick it out.""

""And if I need to be a nuisance to try to call the Church back to where it should be, I think maybe that's my calling. God never promised an easy ride, so I'll stay where God has put me and do the good that he has put in front of me.

The war has once again been ramping up and both Russia and Ukraine look to bolster their forces and take control over the battlefield in the Donbas where intense fighting continues along a 50-mile axis.

Zelenskyy has long urged Western allies to send his troops on the east front tanks. Partner nations like France and Poland have begun to answer the calls.

Earlier this month Paris pledged to send AMX-10 RC light tanks and Warsaw this week said it would send its German-made Leopard tanks to the war-torn nation.

20,UK man fined for silently praying outside abortion clinic: report,"A UK man was reportedly fined after he admitted he was praying in front of an abortion clinic.

Adam Smith-Connor, a physiotherapist and army veteran from Southampton shared video of his confrontation with two local council officers while he was standing and silently praying outside a BPAS clinic in Bournemouth.

The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (""BPAS"") describes itself as the United Kingdom's leading abortion provider.

After repeatedly being asked what the nature of his prayer was, Smith-Connor told the authorities he was praying for his son who was ""deceased."" The officers warned him he was in an area under a Public Spaces Protection Order (""PSPO"") which establishes a ""safe zone"" around abortion clinics and prohibits ""engaging in any act of approval/disapproval"" including praying.

PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST ARRESTED FOR PRAYING SILENTLY NEAR AN ABORTION FACILITY

The abortion clinic in Bournemouth is the 5th one in the country to have this type of censorship zone, according to local news reports.

Smith-Connor recorded the exchange and shared the video with the UK branch of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a faith-based legal advocacy organization.

The man explained to ADF UK that he was praying for his son who was aborted over twenty years ago, a decision that haunts him to this day.

""22 years ago I drove my ex-girlfriend to a facility and paid for her to have an abortion. It was a pivotal moment in my life. The consequences of my actions that day came back to grieve me years later, when I realized I had lost my son Jacob to an abortion I had paid for. Recently, I stood outside a similar facility and prayed to God for my son Jacob, for other babies who have lost their lives to abortion, for their grieving families, and for abortion clinic staff,"" he said.

UK WOMAN ARRESTED FOR PRAYING NEAR ABORTION CENTER WARNS MORE ARRESTS MAY COME

The organization is challenging his fee and blasted the move in a statement.

""Nobody should be criminalised for what they believe – especially not when they express that belief silently, in the privacy of their own minds. Just like in the case of Isabel Vaughan-Spruce last month, Adam could now face prosecution for holding thoughts, and lifting those thoughts to God in prayer, within a censorship zone. The rapid proliferation of orders criminalising volunteers such as Adam and Isabel should be a wake up call to all those who value freedom of expression – even freedom of thought – no matter their views on abortion,"" said Jeremiah Igunnubole, Legal Counsel for ADF UK.

The UK man once worked in a hospital-based abortion unit before changing his views on the practice. He told ADF UK it was hard to believe he could be treated as a criminal for simply praying.

""I would never have imagined being in a position to risk a criminal record for praying silently. In the past, I assisted with abortions in hospital as part of my army medical training, but now I pray for those who perform abortions because I realise how harmful abortion is to women and families, and that every single human life is valuable – no matter how small. Most of all, I’m moved to pray because of what happened to my son, Jacob,"" he said.

Smith-Connor isn't the first person punished for praying outside abortion clinics in the UK.

A pro-life charity worker, Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, was standing near another BPAS clinic in Birmingham when police approached her after an onlooker complained she might be praying outside the abortion facility.

Vaughan-Spruce was arrested after silently praying in a PSPO ""censorship zone,"" according to ADF UK.

21,UK government rules out law change for return of Parthenon marbles to Greece after 'secret' meetings,"The Parthenon marbles housed in the British Museum continue to occupy the foreground of an ongoing debate about art repatriation. After reports of a series of ""secret"" meetings regarding the sculptures, the U.K. government confirmed there would be no law change to facilitate their return to Greece.

Made between 447 and 432 B.C. under the supervision of the sculptor Phidias and his assistants, the marbles in the British Museum's collection are displayed in the special-made Duveen Gallery, having once adorned the Parthenon atop Athens' Acropolis. They consist of 15 metopes (sculpted relief panels), 17 pedimental figures and 247 feet of the original frieze. The sculptures depict impressive scenes of battle and festival procession, as well as gods reclining.

Altogether, the British Museum's collection makes up half of the Parthenon's surviving sculptures.

RARE CIVIL WAR, WWI MILITARY ITEMS MADE BY TIFFANY & CO. TO HIT ILLINOIS AUCTION BLOCK

On Saturday, Greek newspaper Ta Nea revealed that since November 2021, the chair of the British Museum, George Osborne, has held a series of ""secret"" discussions on the return of the marbles with senior Greek government officials, including Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The latest meeting between Mitsotakis and Osborne was last week and insiders claim negotiations are at an ""advanced stage.""

Greece has long maintained that the marbles were stolen and have campaigned for their repatriation. On the other hand, the British Museum, alongside the U.K. government, has defended its right to possess and display them.

At issue are the actions of Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. Having been granted a permit, Elgin removed the sculptures and later sold them to the British government in 1816.

Elgin's actions were investigated by a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1816 and found to be entirely legal, prior to the sculptures entering the collection of the British Museum by Act of Parliament. Since then, arguments against the legality of Elgin's actions have focused on the original permit - namely, whether the Ottomans specifically authorized removal of the sculptures and whether they had the authority to do so in the first place.

CELTIC GOLD COINS STOLEN FROM GERMAN MUSEUM IN STUNNING HEIST

The Greek government made its first official request decades ago, but for the first time in many years, the reunification of the Parthenon marbles in Athens' specially designed Acropolis Museum looks like a real possibility.

At an event at the London School of Economics last week, Mitsotakis explained that progress was being made toward a ""win-win solution"" for the two sides. ""I do sense the momentum,"" Mitsotakis added.

A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that while the trustees are free to talk to whomever they want, the U.K. government has ""no plans to change the law, which prevents removing objects from the British Museum’s collection apart from in certain circumstances.""

FLORIDA BEACH'S MYSTERY DEBRIS UNCOVERED BY HURRICANE NICOLE LIKELY SHIPWRECK FROM 19TH CENTURY

Under the 1963 British Museum Act, objects can only be removed if they are ""duplicates"" or if ""the object is unfit to be retained in the collections of the Museum and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students.""

The British Museum responded to the reports in a Monday statement.

""We are seeking new positive, long-term partnerships with countries and communities around the world, and that of course includes Greece,"" it said.

The Museum still intends to operate within the law, explaining it would not dismantle its collection ""as it tells a unique story of our common humanity.""

A compromise could see the marbles shared between the two countries.

22,Twitter erupts over clip of UK woman arrested for silently praying across from abortion clinic: 'Terrifying',"Conservatives and free speech activists on Twitter railed against a recent video depicting police interrogating and ultimately arresting a pro-life woman who was silently praying outside a U.K. abortion clinic.

Those who watched the woman's arrest after admitting she was ""praying in my head"" were appalled. Some claimed this was proof that Great Britain had become a dystopia.

The woman who was arrested, Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, is the director of the U.K. March for Life.

DEFROCKED CATHOLIC PRIEST FRANK PAVONE SPEAKS OUT: ‘KNOWN’ FOR DECADES THAT SOME BISHOPS ‘HATE’ PRO-LIFE WORK

According to Alliance Defending Freedom UK (ADF UK), Vaughan-Spruce ""was standing near the BPAS Robert Clinic in Kings Norton, Birmingham in an area ADF UK called a 'censorship zone,' when police approached her after an onlooker complained she might be praying outside the abortion facility.""

According to ADF UK, Birmingham authorities have established buffer zones near abortion clinics, making it illegal for people to engage in behavior disapproving or approving of abortion. This includes ""graphic, verbal or written means, prayer or counseling.""

The clip shows the woman silently standing on a curb across from an abortion clinic as British law enforcement officers approach her. One asks why she is standing there and responds that she’s there because of the abortion clinic. She denies that she is part of any protest.

The officer then asks, ""Are you praying?"" to which she responds, ""I might be praying in my head."" The officer then asks her if she’d be willing to go to the station for questioning about her actions. ""If I’ve got a choice, then no,"" she responds, after which the officer states, ""You're under arrest"" and claims she’s charged with ""suspicion of failing to comply with Public Spaces Protection Order.""

23,U.K. doctor testifies in Lucy Letby 'killer nurse' trial: 'Nothing I've seen before or since',"A doctor in the U.K. testifying in the trial of alleged killer nurse Lucy Letby recounted how one baby’s condition deteriorated after being treated by the criminally charged nurse.

""It’s nothing I’ve seen before or since,"" Dr David Harkness, a consultant pediatrician who was a registrar at the time Letby was working at Countess of Chester Hospital’s neonatal unit between 2015 and 2016, told a court this week, The Sun reported .

Harkness explained that he was called into a room by Letby when a child began vomiting blood, and within an hour the child’s condition began rapidly deteriorating with purple patches appearing on his stomach.

Harkness said that he knew the child was in critical condition but did not believe at first that the baby would die.

25,Boris Johnson resignation will not impact UK support for Ukraine: experts,"Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister should not significantly impact the United Kingdom’s support for Ukraine even as the war against Russia drags on and the costs keep piling up.

""Concerning British policy, we do believe that it remains unchanged,"" Former Minister of Infrastructure Volodymyr Omelyan told Fox News Digital. ""Regardless of who is coming to take over the Prime Minister's post, he will or she will pay the same attention to the international agenda.""

Johnson on Thursday announced his intent to step down from the top position following increasing calls for his resignation from within his own party coupled with dozens of ministers quitting his government due to a series of scandals that had led to a ""loss of trust"" from the public.

But with Johnson’s resignation comes the fear that Ukraine has lost one of its staunchest allies: Only perhaps President Biden has remained so vocally committed to Ukraine’s defense in the face of Russian invasion.

BORIS JOHNSON RESIGNS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR UK

Johnson made two separate visits to Kyiv, including one in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s withdrawal from the capital city as a show of support and confidence in Ukraine’s achievements. The first visit drew plaudits from all corners for Johnson’s courage to walk into a warzone.

But British Defense Minister Ben Wallace on Thursday reassured Ukraine that the U.K. would remain ""full square behind"" Kyiv despite Johnson’s resignation.

""The assistance the UK gives to Ukraine is not just from one person,"" Wallace told Sky News. ""Not me, not the Prime Minister. It is the whole effort.""

""Actions matter in all of this and while the Prime Minister will be incredibly sad to leave this post, he has led from the front on Ukraine, as he had done on Covid and, obviously, Brexit, and I think that is not lost on many people.""

CROWDED LIST OF CANDIDATES IN MIX TO SUCCEED BORIS JOHNSON WITH NO ‘OBVIOUS HEIR APPARENT’

Ted Bromund, Senior Research Fellow in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News Digital he does not believe the U.K. will change its position, as the party itself has pushed an anti-Putin stance and agenda that will not disappear with Johnson.

""You have to bear in mind that, you know, the UK had Russian assassinations on its soil, has a long history now of having troops deployed in the Baltic nations in support of the NATO mission,"" he argued. ""It has a long history, unlike France and Germany, of actually being willing to put his money where his mouth is as far as opposing the Russians.""

And Ukraine officials do not question the British commitment to supporting Ukraine, no matter who takes over. Omelyan said he is ""very grateful for all Boris Johnson's efforts to help Ukraine, and we believe that he was and still is a great, charismatic leader.""

""We want to do our best to be with our allies in the first year of year and with this great memory and great efforts, I think that previous policy will remain the same,"" he said. ""In Ukraine, we are all very grateful to us and great in difficult circumstances.""

UKRAINE WAR: NATO COALITION STRENGTH HINGES ON ‘FRAGILE’ GOVERNMENTS BRAVING ECONOMIC STRESS, PETRAEUS SAYS

Support for Ukraine has wavered in Europe, with polls indicating that following strong solidarity with Kyiv in the first 100 days of the invasion the public now appears more divided over the long-term goals. The European Council on Foreign Relations found that most countries would prefer a ""peace"" solution than continue to pursue ""justice"" for Ukraine.

But Omelyan believes that the threat of Russian aggression against other European nations will drive leaders in those countries to continue supporting Ukraine in its defense: French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi visited Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy just last month as a ""message of European unity.""

""We understand that it's not about people getting upset or getting, let's say, fed up,"" Omeylan said. ""This war in Europe is about the future.""

""If you recall the first weeks of the war, not all leaders of the European Union or European nation were very much supportive of Ukraine, but people stood with us,"" he added. ""The big difference is that leaders finally understood the threat coming from Russia and will do everything possible.""

Zahawi was also appointed after his predecessor resigned.

As recently as Wednesday, the prime minister was defiant, arguing he had a mandate from voters.

A group of Johnson’s most trusted Cabinet ministers visited him at his office in Downing Street Wednesday, telling him to stand down after losing the trust of his party. But Johnson instead opted to fight for his political career and fired one of the Cabinet officials, Michael Gove, British media reported.

Five cabinet ministers had quit by Thursday and more than 50 officials have left in the last two days since the latest scandal broke. Johnson is accused of lying about not knowing about groping allegations against a man whom he appointed as a senior government minister.

Johnson's most prominent scandal, Partygate, undercut his trust with voters during the coronavirus pandemic. Johnson was among party members who attended parties at 10 Downing Street and other places while health restrictions prohibited gatherings for regular citizens.

""I just said to him, ‘Look, it’s just when you go now, and it’s how you go,"" Bernard Jenkin, a senior Conservative Party lawmaker, told the BBC he said to Johnson Wednesday. ""You can go with some dignity or you can be forced out like Donald Trump, clinging to power and pretending he’s won the election when he’s lost.’’

Weeks earlier Johnson narrowly survived a no-confidence vote from his own Conservative party.

27,UK PM Sunak expected to veto Scottish transgender law allowing teens gender recognition certificates,"U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to veto a Scottish bill aimed at granting 16- and 17-year-olds access to gender recognition certificates Monday.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) passed legislation in December allowing residents to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC) without a medical diagnosis and also lowered the age requirement to 16. U.K. law allows the British Parliament four weeks to weigh in on Scottish legislation. That deadline will pass Wednesday, and Sunak is expected to veto the bill before then, according to the Express.

""Lots of people have got concerns about this new Bill in Scotland, about the impact it will have on women’s and children’s safety,"" Sunak said. ""So I think it is completely reasonable for the UK Government to have a look at it, understand what the consequences are for women and children’s safety in the rest of the UK, and then decide on what the appropriate course of action is.""

In addition to removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis, the Scottish bill would also allow residents to apply for a GRC after just three months of living under a new gender identity, down from the previous two years.

Scotland’s Social Justice Secretary Shona Robinson vowed last month that the Scottish parliament plans to ""vigorously contest"" any attempts by Westminster to ""undermine the democratic will"" of Scotland’s government.

U.K. media has noted that under Section 35 of the 1998 Scotland Act, Westminster can ban Scottish legislation if it thinks it has an ""adverse effect"" on laws that otherwise fall under British Parliament jurisdiction.

Sunak's government has expressed concern about how the bill will affect single-sex areas for women and kids.

""We share the concerns that others - including the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women and Girls - have with the Bill, particularly around safety issues for women and children,"" a government spokeswoman told Express on Monday.

""We are looking closely at these issues, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK wide legislation,"" she added.

28,"Nigel Farage says America's 'disease of woke' spread to UK, Biden doesn't like British allies 'very much'","Nigel Farage – also known as ""Mr. Brexit"" – had some harsh words for the U.S. and President Biden as he discussed problems on both sides of the pond in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""[The U.K.] caught the disease of woke from the USA, and it now has a stranglehold on our institutions, to the dismay of the silent majority,"" Farage said.

Farage lamented the change in the relationship between the U.S. and U.K. since Biden took office, arguing that the two countries had a better dynamic when former President Trump was in power, and that Trump might have signed a free trade deal with Britain, helping the country as it continues to find its footing with Brexit.

Despite saying that he did not think Biden ""likes the U.K. very much,"" he stressed the potential benefits for each country that would come with helping to grow the famous ""special relationship.""

""Longer term, clearly, America, for goodness’ sake, we speak the same language,"" Farage said. ""We have common law. We're the biggest foreign investor in the U.S., the biggest foreign investor here, and enormous cultural links.""

""So I think trade with America between us and America should grow. Trade between [the U.K.] and India, I think, should grow. And they’re the two really big areas that I see opportunities for us, going ahead.""

Farage also criticized Biden for ""doing all that he can to slowly but surely"" turn America away from leading as an energy exporter.

As harsh as Farage was on Biden, he spared little love for Britain’s ruling Conservative Party, saying that current British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak – whom Farage called ""Britain’s first Goldman Sachs prime minister – had ""virtually disappeared"" and is ""not a leader.""

""In terms of leadership, he doesn't have the ability, which is why he actually lost the contest to become the Conservative Party leader, lost it by some margin to Liz Truss, and yet, by default, in the end, got the top job,"" Farage said. ""Yeah, he may be a very clever man, but he's not a leader.""

Farage laid the blame for many of the country’s current problems at the feet of the governing Conservative Party, such as the lack of a ""reasonable"" response to the nationwide strikes across a number of industries in Britain and a failure to deliver the kind of Brexit voters expected.

""I have to say that when it comes to life-saving jobs like ambulance driving, I don't personally believe that strikes are morally acceptable, but I think the government's standoffish position on this isn't right,"" Farage explained. ""I think they really should be advising these trade unions in 10 Downing Street and say, look, you know, what is it you want? Is it class warfare? Is it bringing down a conservative government that in the case of the railway unions, there does appear to be a hard leftist agenda?""

""I think with the others there are reasonable compromises that can be made, and yet they won't quite get pay rises in line with inflation,"" he added.

The Conservative Party has also failed to clamp down on rising illegal immigration - something that Brexit would have supposedly stymied. Farage pointed to an incident with the Australians, who faced widespread international criticism after turning back a boat of Indonesian refugees trying to enter the country.

Britain worked out a deal to send illegal immigrants to Rwanda, but the first planned deportation flight was blocked in June by a last-minute injunction granted by the European Court of Human Rights, and the strategy's lawfulness was subsequently challenged at London's High Court, Reuters reported.

Britain should have had the ""guts"" to take on the European Court, but Sunak and his government worried more about international condemnation and foreign allies' reactions than sticking to its policies, according to Farage.

""They're stuck,"" he said. ""They keep promising they will deliver. I promise you they won't.""

UK HOME SECRETARY FACES BLOWBACK, CALLS TO STEP DOWN AFTER CALLING MIGRANT CRISIS AN ‘INVASION’

Farage accused the mainstream parties and media in Britain of never accepting the Brexit referendum, which has prevented the country from acting on the real opportunity that independence presented.

""Brexit doesn't make sense unless you put in place supply-side reforms unless you use the opportunity of not being in the European single market to make regulation, to make rules simpler, cheaper and easier,"" Farage said. ""The big sadness is that the Conservative government literally have done nothing - done absolutely nothing - nothing for your small business in the high street, nothing for your big brokerage house in the City of London.""

""I can tell you, as you know, the man [who] has been christened Mr. Brexit as somebody who dedicated his life to it. This is not the Brexit that I wanted, and I'm very, very disappointed,"" he added, acknowledging that the current form of Brexit is not delivering on the promises made but stressing that independence remains popular.

Such independence, he insisted, allowed the U.K. to take a leading role in supporting Ukraine when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his invasion, and to roll out vaccinations when and how they wanted, thanks to the ability to regulate and approve vaccines at the country’s own pace.

""Fine: I was happy with that at the time,"" Farage continued. ""They never believed it. And it is leading to a growing level of disenchantment.""

All of this turmoil and lack of leadership has created a prime opportunity for a ""political insurgency"" for a new center-right party, according to Farage. He believes that the Conservative Party has slid to the left, ending up at center-left, with other parties even further left.

The two leading parties – the Conservative Party and the Labour Party – now ""virtually mirror each other on every major policy"" and leaving ""no choice"" on ideology or significant policy, which Farage believes has led to the leaving the country virtually unworkable.

Moore, in his first-ever on-camera interview outside the U.K., presented a complex picture of the international landscape, particularly regarding the challenges of remaining ""upstream"" of China as well as a number of blunt statements regarding Russia and its actions in Ukraine.

Moore criticized China for ""beating the Russian drum and selling"" Putin’s narrative on Ukraine ""without any sense of irony."" ""They’re selling their snake oil around the world,"" Moore said.

He also raised the negative side of doing business with China, pointing to Sri Lanka, which made ""really misplaced economic decisions"" in trusting China and falling prey to its Belt and Road Initiative. The West, he argued, shows a greater willingness to work in an ""independent and creative"" environment.

Most startling, Moore labeled China as the U.K.’s top priority – ahead even of any counterterrorism efforts.

""We are putting more effort into China,"" Moore said. ""We now devote more effort to China than any other single subject.""

""So, for example, it just moved past counterterrorism in terms of our mission, and that feels like a very big moment – post-9/11, post-7/7 in London – but it reflects the seriousness of the mission for us,"" he added.

The greatest challenge with China is dealing with an ""opaque"" system, especially after China crushed U.S. spy sources in 2010, killing or imprisoning at least 18 such operatives and setting the U.S. back ""decades.""

""But I would just say that … we have this huge advantage that the Chinese don’t because we have friends – we have allies, we have an ability to work in a trusted way to try and take on this challenge.""

The U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand share intelligence in a system known as the Five Eyes Alliance. Moore argues that in addition to this alliance, which allows free movement of intelligence between the five nations, the U.S., U.K. and their partners also offer a ""middle ground"" for countries that China and Russia do not.

""You know, there are a lot of countries out there that may not share our values,"" he said. ""They may not share our political systems, but they are a vital battleground for us as we seek to compete with the Chinese, and if we leave a vacuum in those places, the Chinese will fill it.""

Moore outlined how he seeks to ""forge a relationship"" with the intelligence service of a given country that ""might fall into that category"" and try to find common ground.

""I’m not leaving my values at the door,"" he added, stressing that his values remain ""critical"" to his service. ""I will find ways of finding a common ground and I think we’ve got to do that, and part of that is frankly not seeing this as some kind of set of a 1950s cowboy movie [where] the bad guys have black hats and we all have white hats.""

""It’s a messy, contested world out there, and we’ve got to be prepared.""

One area in which this preparation came in handy was dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Moore once again highlighted the value of knowing ahead of the invasion what Putin intended to do, and how that led to numerous failures.

""We had the enormous privilege in the U.S. and U.K. intelligence services of knowing what [Putin’s] plan was, and he had three things he wanted,"" Moore said. ""One was to remove [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, second was to capture Kiev, and third was to sow disunity within the NATO alliance.""

""If you turn to those three briefly … I think that's a fail, if you completely failed to capture Kyiv."" That, he said, means Russia suffered a ""very, very bloody nose.""

He echoed estimates from CIA Director William Burns that Russia had lost some 15,000 troops – at least – during the invasion, saying it was a ""conservative"" estimate that would equal the same number of troops Russia lost in the 10-year Afghanistan operations in the 1980s. Like Burns, he also said Putin was not in poor health.

He said Russia’s greatest failure of all resulted in NATO growing in strength – once again highlighting the value of cooperation between Western allies in order to achieve their goals. With Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, Moore believes NATO stands stronger than ever before.

""I never thought I would see Sweden and Finland join [NATO],"" he said. ""Sweden's just giving up 200 years of neutrality to do that. So on all of those, I think they count as epic fails.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-spy-chief-russia-china-partnership-insists-west-advantages,N/A
30,"UK school chaplain sues after being fired, reported as terrorist for sermon questioning LGBTQ activists","A school chaplain in the United Kingdom is taking legal action against his former employer after he says he was fired because of a 2019 sermon that told students they are entitled to make up their own minds about the claims of LGBTQ identity politics.

""I gave a sermon in chapel saying you don't have to accept anybody's ideology, you make up your own mind,"" said Rev. Dr. Bernard Randall of his sermon, which remains available online. ""On certain issues, LGBT activists and Christians are in full agreement: there should be no discrimination, no one should be attacked personally or whatever. But there are issues where there's disagreement.""

Randall, an ordained minister in the Church of England who worked five years at Trent College in Derbyshire, England, was also reported to the government's counterterrorism watchdog by his school and blacklisted as a ""safeguarding risk"" to children by his diocese because of his sermon, he told Fox News Digital in a Tuesday phone interview.

In his sermon, Randall explained to his young students, all of whom were aged 11 to 17, what the Church of England's historical teachings are on marriage, sexuality and gender. He reminded them they are not required to embrace the claims of LGBTQ activists, and are entitled under English law to believe what they wish on such issues.

""So the school leadership took exception to that, dragged me in for an interrogation, suspended me, subsequently sacked me for gross misconduct despite being a Church of England school,"" he said. ""I was a Church of England minister in a Church of England act of worship, giving a sermon saying you may accept Church teaching.""

CHRISTIAN SCHOOL REFUSES TO CHANGE LONG-HELD POLICY EXCLUDING SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DESPITE ALLEGED DEATH THREATS

Randall said the idea for the sermon came to him after one of his pupils asked him to speak in chapel about why they ""have to accept"" LGBTQ ideology at a Christian school. Trent College, which is affiliated with the Church of England, had previously brought in Elly Barnes, CEO and founder of Educate and Celebrate, an LGBTQ education charity, to train school staff.

Barnes reportedly encouraged school staff to chant ""smash heteronormativity"" at a training session. Her group, which did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, aims to help schools and organizations ""embed gender, gender identity and sexual orientation into the fabric"" of their culture, according to its website.

Randall said he raised concerns at the time with school leadership that Barnes' directives would be at odds with the school's Protestant evangelical ethos, but that he was left out of the decision to implement her organization's program. Days after his controversial sermon in 2019, he was reportedly called before the school's deputy head and its designated safeguarding lead (DSL) and told that his beliefs were irrelevant and that his sermon had hurt some people's feelings.

Following an investigation, the school fired Randall. He later learned that the school's DSL also reported him to local law enforcement and Prevent, which polices allegations of terrorism in the United Kingdom. The government watchdog ultimately determined that he did not pose a terrorist threat.

After being fired, Randall was reinstated following an appeal, but he said his reinstatement came with a list of conditions, one of which forbade him to broach ""any topic or express any opinion (in Chapel or more generally around School) that is likely to cause offense or distress to members of the school body."" He also had to obtain prior approval from the school regarding the themes and content of his sermons.

Randall was furloughed during the pandemic, never restored to full-time hours and ultimately made redundant on Dec. 31, 2020.

UK POLICE SAY BRITISH ARMY VETERAN ARRESTED BECAUSE ANTI-LGBTQ SOCIAL MEDIA POST ‘CAUSED ANXIETY’: VIDEO

In an employment tribunal that begins Wednesday and could last as long as three weeks, Randall is bringing claims of harassment, discrimination, victimization and unfair dismissal on the grounds of his Christian beliefs against Trent College. With the aid of the Christian Legal Centre, he is also seeking compensation for unfair dismissal and a recommendation under the Equality Act 2010.

Citing the ongoing tribunal, Trent College administrators told Fox News Digital in a statement that they are ""unable to comment in detail on the specifics of the case.""

""At Trent College, we are proud of our commitment to supporting the wellbeing of all our students, regardless of faith, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. We want every one of our students to feel safe here, and we work hard to stay abreast of the latest thinking on inclusivity including the evolving LGBT+ landscape,"" the school added.

Randall said that his diocese also investigated him following his sermon. Rather than supporting him, the diocese deemed him a risk to children because of his views. The kicker on their assessment, he said, was that the investigating officer deemed ""the Church itself as a risk factor,"" acknowledging that portions of Scripture and church liturgy support Randall's position.

""They decided that simply holding to the Church's teachings meant that I was potentially a safeguarding risk; that I might cause anxiety to anybody who came to talk to me about matters regarding sexuality and whatever,"" he said. ""Based on no evidence other than I just accept the teachings of the Church that employs me and employs the people who are making the safeguarding assessment.""

The Diocese of Derby did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

THOUSANDS OF CHURCHES RAISE ALARM ABOUT SCOPE OF NEW CANADIAN ‘CONVERSION THERAPY’ BAN

Explaining how his situation has been ""challenging,"" Randall said, ""It hasn't made me any less confident of Christian truth. It made me a lot less confident in the Church of England, so trying to work out my place in the big scheme of things has been really difficult.""

""But ultimately, I'm an ordained minister. And when you get ordained, you promise to speak the truth. You're effectively appointed as a ‘prophet,’ so to speak, to society. I promised to do that, so that's what I'm doing,"" he said.

Randall noted that ""woke"" ideology has seemingly assumed all the trappings of a traditional religion, albeit one without God. He places his own experience within a much larger anti-religious trend spreading not just within the United Kingdom, but throughout the Western world.

""I definitely think that the whole ‘woke’ agenda — gender identity ideology, all of those things — is profoundly Marxist in its attitudes,"" he said. ""And we know that Marxists absolutely hate religion. They don't want religious people around because ultimately religious people — both Christians, Jews and others — speak what they hold to be truth higher than what the state says.""

""And for Marxists, the only truth is what the state tells you the truth is, so they have to stamp out any other version of the truth. And that's why religion comes under attack in sometimes blatant ways and sometimes the subtle, chipping away at the foundations, and making fun of religion as if it's foolish. Whereas, actually, those who believe know there's nothing foolish about having the joy and the peace and the promise of eternal life that faith in Jesus brings,"" he continued.

In a written statement about his ordeal, Randall wrote that ""woke activists are eating away at the [Church of England]'s guts."" Many have asked him if he would ever leave the Church because of what he is going through, but he noted to Fox News Digital that he is reluctant to leave because the institution is ""so deep in my DNA, really.""

""I've always been in the Church of England,"" he said. ""My family has always been Church of England. I can't quite imagine not being in the Church of England. It's more about the Church of England leaving me, in a sense. I'm not going to make any promises, but I think I want to stick it out.""

""And if I need to be a nuisance to try to call the Church back to where it should be, I think maybe that's my calling. God never promised an easy ride, so I'll stay where God has put me and do the good that he has put in front of me.

31,Rishi Sunak set to be next UK prime minister after Penny Mordaunt drops out of race,"Former defense minister Penny Mordaunt has dropped out of the race to replace former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss, handing former finance minister Rishi Sunak the victory.

Mordaunt was the last remaining obstacle to Sunak becoming the U.K.'s next prime minister after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson dropped out of the race on Sunday evening. Candidates needed to secure 100 supporters from within the Tory party by Monday afternoon, but Mordaunt's campaign only reported 90. Sunak had nearly 190.

Truss was in power for just 44 days before resigning last week amid uproar at her economic policies, which called for expansive tax cuts. While her administration ultimately rolled back virtually all of her plans, the damage was done and U.K. markets remained in chaos.

Sunak announced his candidacy to replace Truss on Sunday, garnering widespread support after Johnson dropped out of the race.

""The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis,"" Sunak wrote in a statement. ""That's why I am standing to be leader of the Conservative Party and your next prime minister.""

32,Liz Truss vs. lettuce: UK prime minister outlasted by livestreamed vegetable,"A humble piece of produce outlasted the United Kingdom's most recent prime minister.

U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday after less than two months in office amid pressure following a reversal of economic policies that led to economic instability.

UK PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS RESIGNS AFTER LESS THAN 2 MONTHS IN OFFICE

The Daily Star newspaper took the opportunity to celebrate – the outlet has been livestreaming a head of store-bought lettuce via their website and challenged Truss to last longer than the slowly wilting vegetable.

Truss announced her resignation a day after she defiantly declared that she is ""a fighter and not a quitter.""

33,Boris Johnson resignation will not impact UK support for Ukraine: experts,"Boris Johnson’s resignation as prime minister should not significantly impact the United Kingdom’s support for Ukraine even as the war against Russia drags on and the costs keep piling up.

""Concerning British policy, we do believe that it remains unchanged,"" Former Minister of Infrastructure Volodymyr Omelyan told Fox News Digital. ""Regardless of who is coming to take over the Prime Minister's post, he will or she will pay the same attention to the international agenda.""

Johnson on Thursday announced his intent to step down from the top position following increasing calls for his resignation from within his own party coupled with dozens of ministers quitting his government due to a series of scandals that had led to a ""loss of trust"" from the public.

But with Johnson’s resignation comes the fear that Ukraine has lost one of its staunchest allies: Only perhaps President Biden has remained so vocally committed to Ukraine’s defense in the face of Russian invasion.

BORIS JOHNSON RESIGNS: WHAT'S NEXT FOR UK

Johnson made two separate visits to Kyiv, including one in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s withdrawal from the capital city as a show of support and confidence in Ukraine’s achievements. The first visit drew plaudits from all corners for Johnson’s courage to walk into a warzone.

But British Defense Minister Ben Wallace on Thursday reassured Ukraine that the U.K. would remain ""full square behind"" Kyiv despite Johnson’s resignation.

""The assistance the UK gives to Ukraine is not just from one person,"" Wallace told Sky News. ""Not me, not the Prime Minister. It is the whole effort.""

""Actions matter in all of this and while the Prime Minister will be incredibly sad to leave this post, he has led from the front on Ukraine, as he had done on Covid and, obviously, Brexit, and I think that is not lost on many people.""

CROWDED LIST OF CANDIDATES IN MIX TO SUCCEED BORIS JOHNSON WITH NO ‘OBVIOUS HEIR APPARENT’

Ted Bromund, Senior Research Fellow in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News Digital he does not believe the U.K. will change its position, as the party itself has pushed an anti-Putin stance and agenda that will not disappear with Johnson.

""You have to bear in mind that, you know, the UK had Russian assassinations on its soil, has a long history now of having troops deployed in the Baltic nations in support of the NATO mission,"" he argued. ""It has a long history, unlike France and Germany, of actually being willing to put his money where his mouth is as far as opposing the Russians.""

And Ukraine officials do not question the British commitment to supporting Ukraine, no matter who takes over. Omelyan said he is ""very grateful for all Boris Johnson's efforts to help Ukraine, and we believe that he was and still is a great, charismatic leader.""

""We want to do our best to be with our allies in the first year of year and with this great memory and great efforts, I think that previous policy will remain the same,"" he said. ""In Ukraine, we are all very grateful to us and great in difficult circumstances.""

UKRAINE WAR: NATO COALITION STRENGTH HINGES ON ‘FRAGILE’ GOVERNMENTS BRAVING ECONOMIC STRESS, PETRAEUS SAYS

Support for Ukraine has wavered in Europe, with polls indicating that following strong solidarity with Kyiv in the first 100 days of the invasion the public now appears more divided over the long-term goals. The European Council on Foreign Relations found that most countries would prefer a ""peace"" solution than continue to pursue ""justice"" for Ukraine.

But Omelyan believes that the threat of Russian aggression against other European nations will drive leaders in those countries to continue supporting Ukraine in its defense: French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi visited Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy just last month as a ""message of European unity.""

""We understand that it's not about people getting upset or getting, let's say, fed up,"" Omeylan said. ""This war in Europe is about the future.""

""If you recall the first weeks of the war, not all leaders of the European Union or European nation were very much supportive of Ukraine, but people stood with us,"" he added. ""The big difference is that leaders finally understood the threat coming from Russia and will do everything possible.""

34,Texas synagogue hostage suspect was banned from UK court over 'threatening' 9/11 outburst: report,"The British suspect who died after allegedly taking Jewish worshippers hostage at a Texas synagogue had been banned from a U.K. courthouse two decades ago for allegedly making disparaging remarks to staff members after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on American soil, according to a report.

The suspect, 44-year-old Malik Faisal Akram, was restricted from the Blackburn Magistrates' Court in September 2001 due to an outburst about the New York City attack, UK’s The Telegraph reported.

Just a day after Manhattan’s World Trade Center was struck by jihad pilots, Akram was accused of remarking to Lancashire court ushers, ""you should have been on the f****** plane,"" Peter Wells, the deputy justice clerk, wrote in a letter detailing the Lancashire magistrates’ committee's decision to ban him.

""This caused a great deal of distress to an individual who was simply doing his job and should not be subjected to your foul abuse,"" Wells said, describing how Akram had been a regular ""menace,"" hurling ""threatening and abusive"" language at staff for months ""even when he isn’t due before the bench.""

In order ""to protect the health and safety of staff,"" Akram was told he could be held in contempt of court or face a fine if he entered the building ""other than when due to appear in court to answer a summons or surrender to bail or to make a payment in respect of any outstanding financial penalty owed by you.""

Saturday’s hours-long standoff at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas — about 15 miles northeast of Fort Worth — ended with the suspect dead and all hostages safe.

Akram could be heard on a Facebook livestream video demanding the release of an imprisoned Pakistani neuroscientist known in counterterrorism circles as ""Lady Al-Qaeda.""

Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2010 of trying to kill U.S. Army officers in Afghanistan, is being held at a federal prison in Fort Worth.

Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said he drew from his past hostage training with the FBI, local police, Anti-Defamation League and Secure Communities Network during the incident, deciding in the last hour to first make sure the other hostages were ready to run before the rabbi suddenly hurled a chair at the suspect.

""It was terrifying,"" Cytron-Walker told CBS News, explaining the suspect knocked on the glass door of the synagogue earlier that morning. He let him in and made him tea, thinking he needed shelter. The rabbi said he sat with the man and then during morning prayer, heard a click, which turned out to be a gun.

""We were threatened the entire time. But no, fortunately, none of us were physically injured,"" the rabbi said. ""They really teach you in those moments that when your life is threatened, you need to do whatever you can to get to safety. You need to do whatever you can to get out.""

U.S. and U.K. authorities have not verified much about Akram’s criminal background or disclosed how he entered the U.S. before the Texas hostage incident. The U.K.’s Home Office on Monday declined to comment to Fox News Digital on reports claiming Akram was known to the intelligence agency M15.

The FBI has extended investigations as far as London and Tel Aviv, and two teenagers were detained in Manchester, England, on Sunday in connection to the investigation into the Texas hostage incident.

Malik Faisal Akram’s brother, Gulbar Akram, released a statement through the Blackburn Muslim Community detailing how he was called into a police station in Greenbank, where he worked in an incident room with terrorism police liaising with the FBI and negotiators during the hostage incident.

In an interview with the New York Times, Gulbar Akram said he spoke to his brother during the siege happening some 5,000 miles away to talk him down. Without providing many details, Gulbar told the newspaper his brother was known to counterterrorism police. He also said Faisal had mental health issues, worsened after the recent death of their other brother from the coronavirus.

He said his brother was arrested at age 19 for wielding a baseball bat during a fight with his cousins and spent a six-month stint at a young offenders’ institute. Gulbar Akram said their parents had emigrated to the U.K. from Pakistan in the 1960s and raised six sons in Blackburn, England.

The FBI Dallas Field Office declined to confirm to Fox News Digital whether Akram had flown into New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, which is what some outlets are reporting, citing unnamed sources or Akram’s brother. Speaking to reporters at a Philadelphia food bank Sunday, President Biden described the incident as an ""act of terror"" and said it was believed the suspect had been staying at homeless shelters before the incident and purchased the weapon ""on the streets.""

The president vowed to make more information public at an upcoming press conference Wednesday.

Answering a question about the hostage incident before Parliament on Monday, U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had participated in a bilateral call with her counterpart at Homeland Security and has been working with the FBI. She vowed increased security for the Jewish community in the U.K.

35,"UK tightens security over hacking fears from Russia, China","The United Kingdom has started tightening its cybersecurity over concerns that Chinese and Russian agents may target ministers.

Russian spies allegedly hacked former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s phone in the summer during her challenge for party leadership, which ultimately resulted in her taking the country’s top seat for around 44 days.

British politicians have called for an independent investigation into the report, particularly regarding the claim that Truss hid the hack over fears it would undermine her campaign. She served as the foreign minister and was involved in Britain’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the time of the alleged hack.

However, Westminster has also moved to tighten up security measures at several levels over fears of further hacks. Ministerial aides will undergo vetting for connections to ""hostile state actors"" such as China and Russia, iNews reported.

The check will occur as an extension of the counter-terrorism check starting Oct. 31 and will examine whether applicants previously worked with public figures from ""hostile"" nations and, therefore, may be unqualified to handle extreme sensitive material to which ministers have access.

Conservative MP Bob Seely said that the change was a ""move in the right direction"" and ""should have happened years ago.""

The government allegedly planned to apply these changes even before the revelation of the hack on Truss’s phone, but the news would have accelerated those plans.

36,Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson leads as he looks to retake top job,"Boris Johnson is one of the leading contenders vying for the job as U.K. prime minister despite having been ousted from office just three months ago upon losing the support of his own party, reports said Friday.

Conservative lawmakers in the U.K. faced a renewed crisis this week when Liz Truss resigned as prime minister Thursday after filling the role for just 44 days.

UK PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS RESIGNS AFTER LESS THAN 2 MONTHS IN OFFICE

Despite leaving office amid a series of scandals like ""partygate"" and the mass resignation of several top officials over allegations of sexual misconduct involving his former Tory Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher, Johnson is believed to be one of the top contenders among Conservative lawmakers reported Reuters.

As opinion polls reportedly show that Britain’s Conservative Party could face a wipeout in the next national election, Tory officials are looking to garner the 100 votes needed from Conservative lawmakers to fill the top job now.

However, Johnson is not guaranteed to retake his post as prime minister and is expected to face off with his former finance minister, Rishi Sunak.

A party election among Tory lawmakers will be held Monday so long as all candidates are able to achieve the 100-vote minimum, according to Reuters.

If only one candidate garners the minimum votes needed, then that contender will automatically get the job.

WHY DID BORIS JOHNSON RESIGN AS UK PRIME MINISTER?

Once the race is narrowed to just two candidates, the vote will be opened to the roughly 170,000 lawmakers who make up the Conservative Party, the publication explained.

Not everyone in Johnson’s party, or even in his former cabinet, is apparently convinced he could achieve the sweeping comeback needed to retake the prime minister's job, reports suggested Friday.

Moore argues that in addition to this alliance, which allows free movement of intelligence between the five nations, the U.S., U.K. and their partners also offer a ""middle ground"" for countries that China and Russia do not.

""You know, there are a lot of countries out there that may not share our values,"" he said. ""They may not share our political systems, but they are a vital battleground for us as we seek to compete with the Chinese, and if we leave a vacuum in those places, the Chinese will fill it.""

FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR O'BRIEN TO CHAIR NIXON FOUNDATION, HOPES TO ‘EDUCATE’ US ON CHINA THREAT

Moore outlined how he seeks to ""forge a relationship"" with the intelligence service of a given country that ""might fall into that category"" and try to find common ground.

""I’m not leaving my values at the door,"" he added, stressing that his values remain ""critical"" to his service. ""I will find ways of finding a common ground and I think we’ve got to do that, and part of that is frankly not seeing this as some kind of set of a 1950s cowboy movie [where] the bad guys have black hats and we all have white hats.""

""It’s a messy, contested world out there, and we’ve got to be prepared.""

One area in which this preparation came in handy was dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Moore once again highlighted the value of knowing ahead of the invasion what Putin intended to do, and how that led to numerous failures.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR HIGHLIGHTS TAIWAN AS ‘MOST-SENSITIVE’ ISSUE, CLAIMS US DOES NOT SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE

""We had the enormous privilege in the U.S. and U.K. intelligence services of knowing what [Putin’s] plan was, and he had three things he wanted,"" Moore said. ""One was to remove [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, second was to capture Kiev, and third was to sow disunity within the NATO alliance.""

""If you turn to those three briefly … I think that's a fail, if you completely failed to capture Kyiv."" That, he said, means Russia suffered a ""very, very bloody nose.""

He echoed estimates from CIA Director William Burns that Russia had lost some 15,000 troops – at least – during the invasion, saying it was a ""conservative"" estimate that would equal the same number of troops Russia lost in the 10-year Afghanistan operations in the 1980s. Like Burns, he also said Putin was not in poor health.

He said Russia’s greatest failure of all resulted in NATO growing in strength – once again highlighting the value of cooperation between Western allies in order to achieve their goals. With Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, Moore believes NATO stands stronger than ever before.

""I never thought I would see Sweden and Finland join [NATO],"" he said. ""Sweden's just giving up 200 years of neutrality to do that. So on all of those, I think they count as epic fails.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-spy-chief-russia-china-partnership-insists-west-advantages,N/A
38,Photo of Kentucky coal miner sitting with son at UK basketball game goes viral,"Kentucky head men’s basketball coach John Calipari got his wish to do something special for a certain family that attended his team’s Blue and White scrimmage over the weekend.

Calipari posted a photo to Twitter of a coal miner and his son watching the Blue-White scrimmage in Pikeville, which raised money for those affected by flooding in Eastern Kentucky in August.

Michael McGuire didn’t want to miss his 3-year-old son, Easton’s, first live basketball game, ESPN says. He rushed after his shift in his work boots and uniform to Appalachian Wireless Arena to watch the game with his son despite the hard work still showing on his body.

41,"UK PM Liz Truss already engulfed in turmoil amid economic storm, plunging poll numbers","New U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss has seen a calamitous start to her tenure in 10 Downing Street, as a newly announced raft of policies triggered economic turmoil — and sent her Conservative Party’s poll numbers into freefall.

Truss won the Tory leadership contest last month, replacing the resigning Boris Johnson as both party leader and prime minister. She stepped into the role just days before the death of Queen Elizabeth II and as Brits across the country feared significant energy price hikes in part due to war in Ukraine.

Last week, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng announced a mini-budget that included moves to cut rising energy bills — but which also controversially included deep tax cuts accompanied by an increase in borrowing. Truss said that the dramatic moves were necessary to protect Brits from soaring energy costs.

""People across the United Kingdom will have heard their energy bills could spiral as high as £6,000 and beyond. Families and businesses were set to be squeezed further by tax rises,"" she said in The Sun on Saturday. ""I know how hard it is and how worried people have been, so we had to act.""

BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

""If we had not stepped up, the cost would have been unthinkable and unforgivable,"" she said.

But with the country facing high inflation of 10%, and exacerbated by the government’s refusal to release an accompanying budgetary analysis by Britain’s independent watchdog, the announcement spooked the markets, causing the pound to plummet to a record low against the dollar. That immediately led to fears of more inflation, as well as risks to people's mortgages — where many Brits are on two-year fixed rate mortgages.

The pound's nosedive forced the Bank of England to announce a $70 billion emergency move to buy bonds to stabilize the pound, which so far appears to have stabilized the embattled currency and reinvigorated its value.

The storm has opened up a new political weak spot for the Tories which the left-wing Labour Party have used to attack what has been traditionally one of the Tories’ strongest issues — stewardship of the economy. Leader Keir Starmer, a centrist who has brought the party to the middle after the radical left-wing leadership of predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, tore into the government this week over the issue.

UK PRIME MINISTER ELECTION SEES LIZ TRUSS VICTORY OVER RIVAL RISHI SUNAK

""The government has lost control of the British economy — and for what? They’ve crashed the pound — and for what? Higher interest rates. Higher inflation. Higher borrowing. And for what? Not for you. Not for working people. For tax cuts for the richest 1% in our society,"" he said in a conference speech. ""Don’t forget. Don’t forgive.""

The impact on Truss' political fortunes were compounded by two polls showing that support was nosediving, with one YouGov poll finding that Labour now hold a massive 33 point lead over the Tories. If accurate, the poll would signal the sort of electoral drubbing last seen in 1997, when Tony Blair’s Labour Party ousted the Tories in a landslide, and exiled them from office until David Cameron entered Number 10 in 2010.

Meanwhile, Truss is reportedly facing grumblings with her own Cabinet over plans to increase legal immigration into the country, despite prior promises from the Tories to decrease overall levels of immigration. Some analysts are warning that Truss risks losing the support former PM Johnson found in traditionally Labour strongholds in the North and elsewhere by embracing a more populist approach centered around Brexit and ""leveling up"" areas outside of London.

""These policies appear destined to confirm many people’s worst instincts about the Conservative Party, cementing an image of the governing party as being on the side of a very small, rich, London-centric elite of bankers and High Net Worths who never really cared about levelling-up the rest of the country and never really saw a problem with being heavily dependent on London, the City, and the south-east,"" British pollster and academic Matthew Goodwin wrote in an analysis this week.

On Saturday, the situation worsened for Truss as rail unions ground trains to a halt with coordinated strikes as they called for wage increases to rise with inflation. Meanwhile, even with government action cushioning the blow, energy bills still rose on Saturday. The government announced that a typical household will pay around £2,500 a year, up from £1,971 last year. The government said that without the energy caps it put in place, it would be £3,500 a year.

Truss, meanwhile, is standing by her government’s moves, telling Brits that the status quo was not working and ""I am going to do things differently.""

""It involves difficult decisions and does involve disruption in the short term,"" Truss said in The Sun. ""Not everyone will like what we are doing, but I want to reassure the public that the Government has a clear plan that I believe is right for the country.""

The government’s insistence on pushing forward has reported infuriated even Truss’ allies. The Times reported that one senior government figure was rebuffed when suggesting a change of course. That figure told the outlet that it was like ""talking to crack addicts.""

Meanwhile, it was reported that Labour officials, delighted at their political rivals' misfortune, were referring to the crisis as ""the Trussterf---.""

42,"UK, France sign agreement in attempt to stop migrants from crossing English Channel","The U.K. and France signed an agreement Monday that will see more police patrol beaches in northern France in an attempt to stop migrants from trying to cross the English Channel in small boats — a regular source of friction between the two.

As scores of people were picked up and brought ashore Monday by a U.K. Border Force vessel, the British government said it had agreed to pay France $75 million in 2022-2023 — almost 10 million euros more than under an existing deal — in exchange for France increasing security patrols along the coast by 40%.

That includes 350 more gendarmes and police guarding beaches in Calais and Dunkirk, as well as more drones and night vision equipment to help officers detect unauthorized crossings.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal would mean ""for the first time, British officials embedded in French operations to strengthen coordination and the effectiveness of our operations.""

The agreement, signed by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and British Home Secretary Suella Braverman in Paris, contains proposals to fight crime by harvesting information from intercepted migrants to help tackle smuggling networks.

FRANCE, GERMANY SET FOR TENSE MEETING AS MACRON, SCHOLZ DIFFER ON ENERGY CRISIS, CHINA

No specific target for boat interceptions was included.

The U.K. receives fewer asylum-seekers than many European nations, including Germany, France and Italy, but thousands of migrants from around the world travel to northern France each year in hopes of crossing the channel. Some want to reach the U.K. because they have friends or family there, others because they speak English or because it's perceived to be easy to find work.

In recent years there's been a sharp increase in the number of people attempting the journey in dinghies and other small craft as authorities clamped down on other routes such as stowing away on buses or trucks.

FRANCE PUSHES FOR 'ENERGY SOBRIETY' AHEAD OF POSSIBLE WINTER ENERGY SHORTAGE

More than 40,000 people have arrived in Britain after making the hazardous Channel trip so far this year, up from 28,000 in all of 2021 and 8,500 in 2020.

The European Union borders and coast guard agency, Frontex, says 62,323 migrants were detected in the channel in the first 10 months of 2022, a 70% increase on the same period last year. The figure includes both successful and intercepted crossings.

Dozens have died in the attempt, including 27 people in November 2021 when a packed smuggling boat capsized.

Le Monde published a chilling investigation Monday into the French coast guard’s mismanagement of that sinking, the deadliest to date. It quoted from repeated, increasingly desperate distress calls from the boat, communications that are part of a French judicial investigation.

French coast guard officials demanded more information of the people aboard, or told them to call British emergency services instead, according to the newspaper. It quoted coast guard officials as saying they underestimated the boat’s problems because they get so many similar calls from migrant vessels in trouble, and don’t have enough resources to come to everyone’s aid.

Britain and France have long wrangled over how to stop the people-smuggling gangs that organize the journeys.

Monday's announcement comes as Sunak, who took office three weeks ago, aims to improve relations with Britain’s neighbors, which soured under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his briefly serving successor Liz Truss.

PARIS MOVES TO SAVE ENERGY DUE TO UKRAINE WAR BY TURNING OFF THE EIFFEL TOWER'S LIGHTS

Sunak met French President Emmanuel Macron last week at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt, and the first U.K.-France summit in several years is planned for early 2023.

In another attempt to deter the crossings, Britain’s government has announced a controversial plan to send people who arrive in small boats on a one-way journey to Rwanda, to break the business model of smuggling gangs. Critics say the plan is immoral and impractical, and it is being challenged in the courts.

Critics also have slammed the British government for failing to process asylum applications quickly, leaving thousands stuck in overcrowded holding centers and temporary accommodation.

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity in Britain, said enforcement measures would do little to stop the cross-channel traffic.

""The government must take a more comprehensive approach and create an orderly, fair and humane asylum system,"" he said. ""It is a global issue which will not be resolved by enforcement measures alone.""

Braverman, a champion of the Rwanda plan who has been accused by critics of demonizing migrants, acknowledged ""there are no quick fixes."" But she told broadcasters that Monday's arrangement will ""significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France and ensure U.K. and French officers are working hand in hand to stop the people smugglers.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-france-sign-agreement-attempt-stop-migrants-crossing-english-channel,N/A

44,UK poised for 'Tier 4' lockdown as new coronavirus strain linked to surge in cases emerges,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday imposed a new round of restrictions for London and much of southern England after officials said they have identified a new COVID-19 strain that can spread more quickly and is believed to be linked to a rise in infections across those areas.

Johnson said that the capital and other areas in southern England currently under Tier 3 -- the highest level of coronavirus restrictions -- will move to an even stricter new Tier 4 that requires non-essential shops, hairdressers and indoor leisure venues to close after the end of business hours Saturday.

""I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is, for instance, for grandparents to see their grandchildren, for families to be together,"" Johnson said. ""But we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and will be guided by the science.""

The announcement comes a day after the country reported more than 28,500 new COVID-19 cases, with nearly 500 deaths. The latest official figures showed infections climbing across the U.K., with a sharp increase in London. The percentage of people testing positive over the past week rose in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to data released Friday by the Office of National Statistics.

Mike Ryan, chief of the World Health Organization’s emergency program, said Monday that the WHO was aware of a genetic variant of COVID-19 reported in about 1,000 individuals in England.

""Authorities in the U.K. are looking at its significance. We have seen many variants -- this virus evolves and changes over time,"" he said.

CHICAGO-AREA HOSPITAL PAUSES VACCINATIONS AFTER 4 WORKERS EXPERIENCE ADVERSE REACTIONS: REPORT

England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, told Reuters on Saturday that it was too early to tell whether the new strain caused a higher mortality rate or impacted vaccines.

""We have alerted the World Health Organization and are continuing to analyze the available data to improve our understanding,"" he said.

Officials moved this week to tighten up the existing restrictions for much of the population by putting large parts of southern England into the highest virus alert level, Tier 3.

Asked whether England would follow Northern Ireland in imposing a six-week lockdown starting Dec. 26, Johnson signaled he was prepared to take more drastic action.

""We're hoping very much that we will be able to avoid anything like that,"" Johnson said during a visit to Manchester. ""But the reality is that the rates of infection have increased very much in the last few weeks.""

""At the moment it doesn't look like the tier system is holding the epidemic wave back, unfortunately,"" John Edmunds, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory panel, told Sky News. ""So I think we are going to have to look at these measures and perhaps tighten them up"" after Christmas, said Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

45,Boris Johnson resigns: What's next for UK,"Boris Johnson took one of his last walks out of Number 10 Downing Street this week. After more government officials called for him to quit, the U.K. prime minister stepped down as Conservative party leader which will lead to his departure as PM.

Until the end, the flamboyant leader blamed a political feeding frenzy for his downfall. ""The herd instinct is powerful,"" he remarked. ""In politics, no one is remotely indispensable.""

In fact, though, most analysts said the main reason for Johnson’s downfall was a loss of trust following a series of scandals including perceived misconduct during the COVID-19 lockdowns and most recently, his promotion of a lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct.

Johnson said again Friday he would stick around as an ""interim"" or ""caretaker"" prime minister until his party chooses a successor. That is not thought to be until early September.

FORMER ADVISER TO BORIS JOHNSON SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WENT ‘WOKE’ AND ‘FORGOT HE’S A CONSERVATIVE

One of those not pleased with that: opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer. ""He needs to go completely,"" Starmer said. ""None of this nonsense about clinging on for a few months.""

Who will replace Boris Johnson? There are no clear frontrunners. The first major player to throw his hat in the ring is former finance minister Rishi Sunak. Others expected to follow include foreign secretary Liz Truss and defense secretary Ben Wallace.

But it’s thought none, for better or worse, will be as colorful as the man they've called ""Bojo.""

His boosters said it was a good thing Johnson took Britain out of the European Union. Many critics were not so sure.

Most said, though, that his championing of work on U.K. COVID-19 vaccines was an accomplishment – as well as his defense of Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was saddened by Johnson’s departure. The Kremlin said it was a ""just reward.""

BORIS JOHNSON'S SCANDALS: UK PRIME MINISTER FACED MULTIPLE CONTROVERSIES IN OFFICE

Former President Trump was a fan of the outspoken Boris Johnson. The outgoing prime minister was even dubbed ""Britain’s Trump.""

President Biden was less favorable, but in a statement he said, in part, ""I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with the government of the United Kingdom.""

In the end, it was the British public who lost patience with the scandal-ridden politician and also turned against him. ""He should have gone a long time ago,"" was one comment echoed around the U.K.

Johnson, in the end, after some three years in the job, said he understood. ""I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world,"" he said, ""but ‘them’s the breaks.’""

Both candidates are required to have at least 100 backers within the Tory party by Monday afternoon in order to be considered for a wider vote. If both candidates secure 100 supporters, the Party will then hold a vote and the winner will be announced Friday, according to CNBC.

Sunak outperformed Mordaunt in the September run for the prime minister spot, which Truss ultimately won.

While the government was planning to ease restrictions on June 21, Johnson announced the U.K. will push back reopenings until July 19 at the latest, amid rising infections and hospitalizations tied to the variant. The additional weeks are hoped to give the National Health Service (NHS) more time to deliver jabs into arms.

""We’ve obviously faced a difficult choice,"" Johnson said during a press conference. ""We can simply keep going with all of step 4 on June 21st, even though there is a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and thousands more deaths would ensue that could otherwise have been avoided. Or else, we can give the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.""

Cases are growing by 64% each week, doubling in the worst affected areas, while the average number of people admitted to the hospital in England is increasing by 50% week over week, climbing to 61% in the northwest, he said.

Those restrictions will remain in place, with the exception of weddings with over 30 guests where social distancing is in place, among other events.

""Since today I cannot say that we have met all our four tests for proceeding with step 4 on June the 21st, I think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,"" he said, noting that the U.K. is aiming to fully vaccinate about two-thirds of the adult population by July 19, including everyone over age 50, all the vulnerable, frontline workers and everyone 40 and up who received initial doses by mid-May.

49,UK neighbors cut tree in half over bird poop dispute: ‘We were absolutely distraught’,"When words fail, sometimes you just have to cut down half a tree – at least, that’s what one couple did.

The couple, in Sheffield, U.K., called in an arborist to cut down half of the branches of a 16-foot-tall fir tree that were hanging over their driveway, according to reports. The rest of the tree is in their neighbor’s yard.

Their neighbor, Bharat Mistry, told SWNS that the tree has been in his front yard for 25 years. However, during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown last March, Mistry’s neighbors reportedly asked to have the tree removed, BBC reported.

More recently, the neighbors complained about birds in the tree making too much noise and pooping on their driveway, so Mistry told SWNS that he tried to work on a solution.

""We had asked if we could get it trimmed back and put a net in it so it would stop birds getting in, but there was no compromise with them,"" Mistry told SWNS.

""Last weekend he said he was going to get a tree surgeon to cut it down and we asked him not to but they came on Friday and did it,"" Mistry added.

Mistry told BBC he and his family -- including his wife and two daughters -- were angry when it first happened, but they’ve since ""calmed down a bit.""

""We were absolutely distraught,"" Mistry told SWNS. ""We pleaded and pleaded with them not to do it, but their mind was made up. That tree was coming down.""

""I believe he has the right to cut down anything that is overhanging onto his property,"" Mistry added. ""But you have to ask, why after 25 years would you do that?""

He continued: ""It is really sad to look at because the tree has been there for so long and it's a really pretty tree.""

Mistry told SWNS he hasn’t spoken to his neighbors since they cut the tree down, but before the pandemic, the two families got along.

""We have never had any issues with them before this, we got on fine,"" Mistry said. ""Our children would play with their grandchildren when they were younger, we've always got on.""

""He used to bring the bins in for us,"" Mistry added. ""It's such a shame it has come to this.""

Mistry also said that he had previously agreed with his neighbor to trim the tree into a ball shape and make sure it wasn’t otherwise in his neighbor’s way.

""It must have been no more than 3 feet onto his land,"" Mistry told SWNS. ""It is above head height, the bottom of the branches start at about 8 feet high and we have cut off the branches lower down to be amiable with them.""

Photos of the odd tree have been posted on social media and have been turned into memes, SWNS reported.

The oddity has even become something of a tourist attraction.

""We've had a lot of people walking past to look at it, people you can just tell have come out of their way to walk their dog on a different route to have a look,"" Mistry told SWNS.

""People have stopped to take pictures, there has been a lot posted on social media,"" he added. ""You think we'd probably do the same if it was another house, but it does feel a bit like an invasion of privacy.""",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/cut-tree-branches-half-bird-dispute,N/A
50,"UK PM Sunak heads to Northern Ireland, fueling speculation of post-Brexit trade talks","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak traveled to Northern Ireland on Thursday evening to meet with local political leaders, a sign that the U.K. and European Union may be nearing a settlement of the post-Brexit trade dispute that has brought economic headaches and political turmoil to the region.

Sunak and Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris are making the trip to talk with people on all sides of the issue and ensure any solution resolves ""the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the U.K.’s internal market,"" the prime minister's office said.

In further signs that a deal may be imminent, British media reported that Foreign Secretary James Cleverly would travel to Brussels Friday to meet the bloc’s chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic.

UNITED KINGDOM PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK PLEDGES TO WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH SCOTLAND'S LEADER

Any deal faces a tough audience: unionist politicians who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K. collapsed the region's power-sharing government almost a year ago because of their opposition to the existing trade arrangements with the EU, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. They say they will not return to government until the protocol is substantially changed.

The protocol was an effort to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland by preserving the free flow of trade between it and the Republic of Ireland, which share the only land border between the United Kingdom and the EU.

When the U.K. left the bloc, the British government and the EU agreed to keep the border free of customs checks and other obstacles because the free movement and goods and people is a key pillar of the peace process that ended 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland. But that raised concerns about how the EU would protect its market from British goods that might not meet the bloc's regulatory standards.

Instead, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K Unionists say that effectively creates a border in the middle of the Irish Sea, undermining Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.

The protocol has become a huge political headache for the U.K. government and a thorn in the country’s relations with the EU. The two sides have bickered since the divorce became final in 2020, with Britain threatening to unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, and the EU accusing the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.

But the mood has improved since Sunak, a pragmatic supporter of Brexit, took office in late October.

The U.K. government hopes to resolve the EU trade dispute and break the political impasse before the 25th anniversary in April of Northern Ireland’s 1998 Good Friday peace accord. It is pinning its hopes on striking a deal with the EU that would ease the checks and coax unionists back into the government.

The U.K. Supreme Court ruled, in a unanimous decision from all 5 judges, that Scotland does not have the power to hold a new referendum on independence without the permission of British parliament.

The judgment is a setback for the Scottish government’s campaign to break away from the United Kingdom and six weeks after lawyers for the pro-independence Scottish administration and the Conservative U.K. government argued their cases at hearings in London.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would respect the ruling but continue the fight for independence, saying Scotland’s ""democratic right to choose our own future"" was at stake.

53,President Biden says UK Prime Minister Liz Truss' tax cut plan was a 'mistake',"U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss' push to cut taxes for her country's highest earners was a ""mistake,"" President Biden stated Saturday.

Truss was forced to scrap large portions of her tax plan last week amid market turmoil and disintegrating public confidence. White House officials had hitherto declined to comment on Truss' policies, but Biden broke his silence while eating ice cream with reporters in Oregon.

""I was not the only one that thought it was a mistake,"" Biden said. ""I think the idea of cutting taxes on the super-wealthy at a time when — anyway, I disagreed with the policy, but that’s up to Great Britain to make that judgment, not me.""

Truss had initially pushed to eliminate the U.K.'s top tax bracket, effectively cutting taxes for citizens making more than $168,000 per year. While she scrapped that plan in early October, it did little to stabilize markets.

EUROPEAN NATIONS SHIFT RIGHT AS ECONOMIC WOES GRIP CONTINENT

She was ultimately pushed to fire her Treasury chief and longtime friend, Kwasi Kwarteng, last week. She also walked back a promise to cancel an increase in taxes on corporations.

The British' Pound's value plummeted to near-parity with the U.S. dollar when Kwarteng first announced Truss's tax cut plan in late September. Truss' walk-backs have succeeded in increasing the Pound's value from $1.03 to $1.12.

Biden argued the U.S. economy is ""strong as hell"" in his Saturday comments. The assertion drew widespread criticism.

54,UK PM Sunak expected to veto Scottish transgender law allowing teens gender recognition certificates,"U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to veto a Scottish bill aimed at granting 16- and 17-year-olds access to gender recognition certificates Monday.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) passed legislation in December allowing residents to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC) without a medical diagnosis and also lowered the age requirement to 16. U.K. law allows the British Parliament four weeks to weigh in on Scottish legislation. That deadline will pass Wednesday, and Sunak is expected to veto the bill before then, according to the Express.

""Lots of people have got concerns about this new Bill in Scotland, about the impact it will have on women’s and children’s safety,"" Sunak said. ""So I think it is completely reasonable for the UK Government to have a look at it, understand what the consequences are for women and children’s safety in the rest of the UK, and then decide on what the appropriate course of action is.""

In addition to removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis, the Scottish bill would also allow residents to apply for a GRC after just three months of living under a new gender identity, down from the previous two years.

Scotland’s Social Justice Secretary Shona Robinson vowed last month that the Scottish parliament plans to ""vigorously contest"" any attempts by Westminster to ""undermine the democratic will"" of Scotland’s government.

U.K. media has noted that under Section 35 of the 1998 Scotland Act, Westminster can ban Scottish legislation if it thinks it has an ""adverse effect"" on laws that otherwise fall under British Parliament jurisdiction.

Sunak's government has expressed concern about how the bill will affect single-sex areas for women and kids.

""We share the concerns that others - including the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women and Girls - have with the Bill, particularly around safety issues for women and children,"" a government spokeswoman told Express on Monday.

""We are looking closely at these issues, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK wide legislation,"" she added.

The city, located in South Wales, included the measure in its 2023/2024 draft budget. If implemented about half of the town’s lights would be off between midnight and 6 a.m., BBC News reported.

Newport’s Green Party councilmember Lauren James said it was imperative that safety considerations be considered.

""I hope that the council is looking into it, and make sure that there are things like high-visibility strips on steps, so it’s safe for those who do have to be out at those times,"" she said.

Another council member, Andrew Sterry, said his constituents had expressed concerns over a possible increase in crime.

The U.S. has charged Assange with 17 counts of espionage and one count of computer misuse, according to the Department of Justice. The charges arise from accusations that he helped former Army data analyst Chelsea Manning illegally obtain sensitive U.S. documents.

It is believed to have mutated in a patient who caught both variants at the same time but it's unclear if it first mutated in the U.K or another country, according to the Mirror newspaper.

A month ago, University of Cypress virologist Leondios Kostrikis’ said he had identified deltacron, which was dismissed by many experts as a likely lab contamination or error. The new discovery is unrelated, according to BNO News, a Dutch wire agency.

ANTIHISTAMINES MAY HELP RESOLVE LONG COVID, REPORT SUGGESTS

The Friday update from the UK’s Health Security Agency showed the ""Delta x Omicron Recombinant"" was currently under ""monitoring and investigation.""

Both delta and omicron have proven to be highly contagious but it’s unclear how widespread the hybrid strain is or how transmissible. The agency didn't say if it has been detected in more than one patient, according to the Mirror.

U.K. health officials at the agency aren’t particularly concerned about the new strain at this point because case numbers are low, the Daily Mail reported, citing a source.

Deltacron ""shouldn't pose too much of a threat,"" University of East Anglia infectious disease expert Paul Hunter told the publication because a majority of the population is vaccinated or have a certain level of immunity from surviving the disease.

58,"New UK Prime Minister Liz Truss won't be 'afraid of picking a fight' with Biden, experts say","New United Kingdom Prime Minister Liz Truss is likely to take a more forceful approach to British foreign policy — including with the U.S. — at a time of major geopolitical upheaval, experts tell Fox News Digital.

Truss, an experienced Conservative Party official who's currently the foreign secretary, is expected to bring a hawkish stance on both Russia and China. She's also expected to emphasize the special relationship between the U.K. and the United States, as her predecessor Prime Minister Boris Johnson did.

But amid tension across the Atlantic over trade and Brexit issues, Truss might be willing to push back harder against the U.S. and President Biden on some issues.

""I don't think she's going to be afraid of picking a fight with Joe Biden over crucial areas of British national interest. She will stand up to the U.S. president where necessary,"" Nile Gardiner, a former adviser to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, told Fox News Digital. Gardiner now works for the conservative Heritage Foundation.

BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

""Liz Truss is a determined, feisty figure,"" John Kampfner, the executive director of the U.K. in the World Initiative for the British think tank Chatham House, told Fox News Digital. ""She's an ardent ideologue, she heaps praise on Margaret Thatcher, both in terms of her domestic policy and foreign policy.""

The most high profile split between Truss and Biden could be on Brexit and what's known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was negotiated with the European Union as part of Brexit. The agreement effectively leaves Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, in the European Union's single market, along with its neighbor the Republic of Ireland, an independent country.

U.K. leaders want to renegotiate this deal because, they say, it erodes the standing of Northern Ireland within the U.K. But European Union leaders — and some in Washington — oppose such a move, arguing it could risk undermining more than two decades of peace between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Kampfner said Truss has made very clear where she stands on the Northern Ireland Protocol — and will be fundamentally at odds with Biden.

""She will antagonize the Biden administration in her approach to Northern Ireland and Europe,"" Kampfner said of Truss.

""The White House has been very unhelpful over Northern Ireland, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, has made several threats to Great Britain in terms of sinking a U.S-U.K trade deal because of the Northern Ireland issue."" Gardiner said. ""I expect that Liz Truss is going to be more assertive in her dealings with Joe Biden than Boris Johnson.""

UK PRIME MINISTER ELECTION SEES LIZ TRUSS VICTORY OVER RIVAL RISHI SUNAK

Another area of potential dissent between Truss and Biden could be the U.S. administration's efforts to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran.

Biden was the vice president when the U.S. agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with several other countries, including the U.K., aimed at limiting Iranian nuclear ambitions while easing sanctions on the rogue state. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal after taking office, reinstating sanctions. And Biden's administration has made a new deal a priority since taking office.

Truss hasn't yet taken a firm stance on renewed negotiations. But some in Truss' Conservative Party are sour on the idea of the negotiations, Gardiner said, raising ""the possibility that you see a break from where the U.S. is at the moment.""

Kampfner, meanwhile, predicted that Truss may seek flexibility on the Iran issue to avoid stoking divisions with the U.S. on more fronts than she needs to.

BRITISH PUB OWNERS FACE MURKY FUTURE AS ENERGY PRICES SKYROCKET: ‘SOUL DESTROYING’

China could also be an area of disconnect between Truss and the Biden administration, Kampfner said, despite the fact both countries are moving toward more hawkish stances on the Asian nation.

""She is very tough on China,"" Kampfner said. ""Britain called China a ‘systemic competitor.’ And she wants to call it an ‘acute threat,’ which is quite some step. Does that go too far for the Biden administration?""

""Under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, the U.K sought to build stronger economic relationships with China,"" Gardiner said. ""Which in the case of Chinese telecommunications companies, such as Huawei for example, threatened national security. So Liz Truss is in favor of a much more robust approach toward China.""

Truss' hawkishness also extends to Russia and beyond, according to Kampfner, who said the new prime minister seeks to shake up the way international organizations do business in the 21st century. Whether that is successful, he said, remains to be seen.

""She is portraying herself as a disrupter in chief in a disrupted world. … She sees all these multinational institutions, and she considers them to be stuck or to be atrophied or to be bust,"" Kampfner said.

He added: ""It sounds interesting.

""I think it’s now very clear that we will have a substantial third wave of infections,"" Prof Andrew Hayward of University College London said, appearing on BBC One's ""Andrew Marr Show."" ""The really big question is how much that wave of infections is going to translate into hospitalizations. The fact that we’ve got 55% of the adult population double vaccinated means that this will be substantially less bad than it could’ve been but we still don’t know exactly how bad it could be.""

Government data indicates over 41 million people in the U.K. have received at least one dose, while nearly 30 million are fully vaccinated. A study from Public Health England suggested the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective against the variant two weeks post-second dose, and 33% effective after the initial dose. A recent report from PHE found that the Delta variant, B.1.617.2, was behind over 90% of sequenced cases.

DELTA COVID-19 VARIANT ‘PROBABLY GOING TO BECOME’ DOMINANT STRAIN IN US, GOTTLIEB SAYS

The variant is associated with an increased hospitalization risk and recent findings suggested the variant is 60% more transmissible.

""I think 60% more infectious is extremely worrying, that’s the main thing that will drive the speed with which the next wave comes along,"" Hayward said. ""The fact that the level of hospitalizations from this infection appear to be maybe up to double those from the previous infection is of course also extremely concerning even in the context of people having had a single dose of vaccine.""

The news comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to extend COVID-19-related restrictions on Monday by several weeks amid a concerning rise in infections driven by the Delta variant, Reuters reported.

60,UK poultry farmers demand government issue housing order over rising Avian flu cases,"Poultry farmers in the United Kingdom are calling for their government to issue a nationwide housing order for chickens and captive birds after a bird flu outbreak last month.

Currently, parts of the U.K., including Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, already have a housing order for all poultry, which requires owners to keep their birds indoors and follow strict measures to protect their flocks from disease. A nationwide housing order would apply to individuals who own birds on commercial or non-commercial properties.

The response from chicken and egg producers comes as England deals with 27 outbreaks in September across three counties. Producers specializing in Christmas goose are being hit especially hard by Avian Influenza.

Christine Middlemiss, the chief veterinary officer of the United Kingdom, said she expects bird flu cases to rise for the foreseeable future due to migration patterns of birds coming back to the country.

Outbreaks have also occurred in Oxford, Staffordshire, Cheshire and Devon, according to The Guardian. Therefore, farmers are demanding the government extend the current housing order to the whole nation.



""The sheer persistence of avian influenza over the past year, coupled with soaring energy and feed costs, has put the whole British poultry sector under huge emotional and financial pressure,"" said the National Farmers Union poultry board chair James Mottershead in a statement.

He added, ""Given the recent rise in avian influenza cases and the distress they cause for farming families, the implementation of housing measures in the east of England is a necessary step.""

""The number one priority for poultry farmers has always been the health and welfare of their flock,"" Mottershead continued.

61,UK Prime Minister Liz Truss ends national ban on fracking amid energy crisis,"U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss ended England's ban on fracking Thursday, opening the door to domestic shale gas production amid a European energy crisis.

The return of fracking is just one piece of a larger energy and economy plan Truss is pursuing in her first weeks since gaining office. Her administration also announced a national freeze on household energy prices, a plan that will cost the government tens of billions.

Under Truss' plan, household energy costs will be limited to $2,900 per year after ballooning to $4,100 in 2022.

The U.K. and other European countries have faced a worsening energy crisis due to heavy dependence on oil and gas imports from Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin limited exports to Europe after NATO countries imposed severe economic sanctions on the county for its invasion of Ukraine.

The grandmother recalled medics telling the family that the child was not responding to treatment, and the mother continued to plead for her child’s life saying, ""Please don’t let him die, please don’t let him die.""

""You need to let him go,"" the grandmother told the mother after doctors said that ""Child A"" would likely have brain damage and further complications if it survived, but the mother urged the doctors to ""carry on.""

REMAINS OF PREGNANT WOMAN MURDERED BY HUSBAND MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO DISCOVERED DURING GARDEN EXCAVATION

The mother, who had been admitted to the hospital for an emergency Caesarean section, eventually relented and ""simply nodded her head"" and acknowledged that doctors should stop giving the child chest compressions.

The child had been handed over to the care of neonatal nurse Lucy Letby, who stands accused of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill 10 others, before collapsing in 2015 after Letby alleged injected air into the child’s bloodstream.

The next day, Letby was accused of attempting to murder the woman’s second twin baby, referred to as ""Child B"" in court testimony, by the same method.

OHIO WOMAN'S SECOND BABY KILLED 'AS A RESULT OF CO-SLEEPING': WHAT IS CO-SLEEPING?

The child’s mother said that she was ""frantic, anxious and extremely upset"" after the death of her child and did not want Child B ""to be out of my sight"" but eventually attempted to watch a movie to calm down when she was told her second child was going through a ""very similar situation"" to her first child.

""We returned to the ward and attempted to watch a film and the next thing I know we were getting woke up by a nurse,"" the mother said. ""’You need to come now’. My heart sank. Not my baby. Not again.""

Child B was suffering from a rapidly falling heart rate and oxygen levels, and displaying discolored and spotty skin, which a consultant told the jury the hospital had never seen before.

UK HITS RECORD 7M CITIZENS WAITLISTED FOR ‘ROUTINE’ HEALTH CARE UNDER STATE-RUN SYSTEM

The mother stayed with Child B throughout the night and said that her child was ""restless"" and acting ""as if she was trying to tell me something was wrong"".

The mother was discharged from the hospital but continued to come visit Child B daily at 9 a.m. and stayed on the unit monitoring her child. The child eventually recovered and was discharged with doctors believing it will have no adverse effects from the incident.

The mother said she ""searched for a reason why"" following the death of Child A and was ""furious"" when she was told that the post-mortem examination was inconclusive and possibly due to a preexisting blood condition.

The mother and father ""asked for answers we never really got"", the jury was told.

Letby, 32, pleaded not guilty this month to the accusations that she murdered five baby boys and two girls, and attempted to murder 10 other children between 2015 and 2016.

BIDEN SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT 'PAVES THE WAY' FOR MEDICAID TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS

Letby was a ""constant, malevolent presence"" in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital, prosecutor Nick Johnson argued before a jury at Manchester Crown Court in northwest England.

Johnson told jurors ""a poisoner was at work"" at the hospital, which he said had been marked by a ""significant rise in the number of babies who were dying and in the number of serious catastrophic collapses"" after January 2015, before which he said its rates of infant mortality were comparable to other busy hospitals.

Hospital authorities eventually determined that Letby was the ""common denominator"" in the deaths and that Letby's changing work hours aligned with each incident.

END OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC COULD BRING MAJOR TURBULENCE FOR US HEALTH CARE

Police searched Letby's home in 2018 and reportedly found notes that appeared to be admissions that the nurse had intentionally murdered the babies she stands accused of killing.

""I don't deserve to live,"" read one of Letby's notes, which were projected onto a large TV screen for the courtroom to see earlier this month. ""I killed them on purpose because I'm not good enough to care for them. I am a horrible evil person.""

One note read in large capital letters: ""I AM EVIL. I DID THIS.""

Ben Myers, a lawyer for Letby's defense, characterized the notes as expressions of ""anguish not guilt.""

Myers argued that ""anyone with an ounce of human understanding"" would perceive her notes as ""the anguished outpouring of a young woman in fear and despair when she realizes the enormity of what is being said about her.""

64,UK museums shy away from using ‘mummy’ to describe ancient Egyptian remains: it’s ‘dehumanizing’,"""A dead Egyptian body, or a live British matriarch,"" read the clue that Alex Trebek gave Jeopardy! contestants on a February 2015 episode.

""What is a mummy?"" one of the contestants replied.

Though Trebek accepted the response, a museum administrator in the U.K. today might tut-tut this exact wording.

The National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh and the Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle have decided to avoid using the term ""mummy,"" preferring ""mummified remains"" or ""mummified person"" instead.

""The word ‘mummy’ is not incorrect, but it is dehumanizing, whereas using the term ‘mummified person’ encourages our visitors to think of the individual,"" explained a spokeswoman from the National Museums Scotland to the Daily Mail.

THE HAGIA SOPHIA: A LANDMARK THAT WAS CONVERTED FROM A CHURCH TO A MOSQUE, TO A MUSEUM, AND THEN MOSQUE AGAIN

""Where we know the name of an individual we use that, otherwise we use ‘mummified man, woman, boy, girl or person’ because we are referring to people, not objects,"" she added.

Jo Anderson, assistant keeper of archeology at the Great North Museum, explained the language change in a lengthy blog post in 2021. The blog specifically focused on Irtyru, an ancient woman who has been on display in Newcastle for a considerable period.

""The word ‘mummy’ now often evokes the image of a supernatural creature or monster,"" explained Anderson, adding that she hopes these ancient men and women will be treated as ""real humans who were once alive and had very specific beliefs about how their bodies should be treated after death.""

The British Museum in London rebutted a claim by the Daily Mail that they had banned the term themselves but agreed with the approach of their colleagues in Edinburgh and Newcastle.

FRENCH CITY BELIEVES MADONNA MAY OWN PAINTING LOST DURING WWI, ASKS FOR LOAN

Separate from the linguistic debate, whether it is ethical to display human bodies in this way remains a live issue.

Anderson described several ways in which the remains of Irtyru were desecrated, including the unwrapping of her bandages by three surgeons in front of a ticketed audience and the application of shellac.

""A large bolt and ring were attached through the cranium to enable her to be hung upright. At the same time, a large metal staple was inserted into Irtyru’s spine, which secured her to the baseboards of the coffin beneath,"" wrote Anderson.

Even mummies that haven't been handled like this are displayed outside their original context, another point of contention.

66,"UK tightens security over hacking fears from Russia, China","The United Kingdom has started tightening its cybersecurity over concerns that Chinese and Russian agents may target ministers.

Russian spies allegedly hacked former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s phone in the summer during her challenge for party leadership, which ultimately resulted in her taking the country’s top seat for around 44 days.

British politicians have called for an independent investigation into the report, particularly regarding the claim that Truss hid the hack over fears it would undermine her campaign. She served as the foreign minister and was involved in Britain’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the time of the alleged hack.

However, Westminster has also moved to tighten up security measures at several levels over fears of further hacks. Ministerial aides will undergo vetting for connections to ""hostile state actors"" such as China and Russia, iNews reported.

The check will occur as an extension of the counter-terrorism check starting Oct. 31 and will examine whether applicants previously worked with public figures from ""hostile"" nations and, therefore, may be unqualified to handle extreme sensitive material to which ministers have access.

Conservative MP Bob Seely said that the change was a ""move in the right direction"" and ""should have happened years ago.""

The government allegedly planned to apply these changes even before the revelation of the hack on Truss’s phone, but the news would have accelerated those plans.

Lord John McFall, Baron of Alcluith and Speaker of the House of Lords, urged parliament in March to strengthen its vetting process on the heels of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine following calls for a Russian-born member of the house to lose their privileges, the Guardian reported.

""I would urge the government to look at this, drawing upon the work of those who have already taken extensive evidence on this and proposed sensible reforms,"" McFall said in a letter published in March. ""I am always open to engagement with the government on these matters.""

He called the reform ""just one element"" of a ""bigger package of reform"" needed in the House of Lords.

68,UK's Rishi Sunak officially becomes prime minister amid economic crisis,"Former finance minister Rishi Sunak met with King Charles III as he officially entered the top job as the U.K.’s newest prime minister Tuesday.

The meeting with the Charles and Sunak, the first British Asian to hold the high office, is part of the ceremonial transfer of power known as ""kissing hands"" and followed Liz Truss’ announced resignation last week.

Sunak is now the third U.K. leader in seven weeks and the first prime minister to be welcomed into office by Charles since the passing of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.

NEW UK PRIME MINISTER RISHI SUNAK ACKNOWLEDGES 'SOME MISTAKES WERE MADE' UNDER LIZ TRUSS

The pair met at Buckingham Palace where the King invited Sunak to form a government – a process that his mother carried out for the final time less than 50 days ago with Truss – officially allowing Sunak to take up the top job.

Truss held her final cabinet meeting Tuesday morning at 10 Downing Street before she officially handed in her resignation.

Truss, the shortest serving prime minister in British history, met with the King at Buckingham Palace for the last time where she formally resigned.

Sunak made his first address to the nation outside 10 Downing Street where he pledged to prioritize getting the economy back on track and rebuilding public trust in the government.

There was some confusion Tuesday as the U.K. announced new restrictions on social gatherings for the northeast.

CORONAVIRUS INFECTED YOUNG ADULTS MORE THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS OVER SUMMER

Politico reports that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the rule of six -- no more than six people can gather in one place -- does not apply to gatherings outside. He later corrected himself on Twitter, saying he misspoke.

""This is vital to control the spread of coronavirus and keep everyone safe,"" Johnson later tweeted. ""If you are in a high-risk area, please continue to follow the guidelines from local authorities.""

UK MEDICAL EXPERTS RAISE NATION'S COVID-19 ALERT LEVEL

The U.K.'s guidelines are clear that when meeting friends and family apart from your home or support bubble, you must not meet in a group of more than six, indoors or outdoors.

Until the end, the flamboyant leader blamed a political feeding frenzy for his downfall. ""The herd instinct is powerful,"" he remarked. ""In politics, no one is remotely indispensable.""

In fact, though, most analysts said the main reason for Johnson’s downfall was a loss of trust following a series of scandals including perceived misconduct during the COVID-19 lockdowns and most recently, his promotion of a lawmaker accused of sexual misconduct.

Johnson said again Friday he would stick around as an ""interim"" or ""caretaker"" prime minister until his party chooses a successor. That is not thought to be until early September.

FORMER ADVISER TO BORIS JOHNSON SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WENT ‘WOKE’ AND ‘FORGOT HE’S A CONSERVATIVE

One of those not pleased with that: opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer. ""He needs to go completely,"" Starmer said. ""None of this nonsense about clinging on for a few months.""

Who will replace Boris Johnson? There are no clear frontrunners. The first major player to throw his hat in the ring is former finance minister Rishi Sunak. Others expected to follow include foreign secretary Liz Truss and defense secretary Ben Wallace.

But it’s thought none, for better or worse, will be as colorful as the man they've called ""Bojo.""

His boosters said it was a good thing Johnson took Britain out of the European Union. Many critics were not so sure.

Most said, though, that his championing of work on U.K. COVID-19 vaccines was an accomplishment – as well as his defense of Ukraine in its war against Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was saddened by Johnson’s departure. The Kremlin said it was a ""just reward.""

BORIS JOHNSON'S SCANDALS: UK PRIME MINISTER FACED MULTIPLE CONTROVERSIES IN OFFICE

Former President Trump was a fan of the outspoken Boris Johnson. The outgoing prime minister was even dubbed ""Britain’s Trump.""

President Biden was less favorable, but in a statement he said, in part, ""I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with the government of the United Kingdom.""

In the end, it was the British public who lost patience with the scandal-ridden politician and also turned against him. ""He should have gone a long time ago,"" was one comment echoed around the U.K.

Johnson, in the end, after some three years in the job, said he understood. ""I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world,"" he said, ""but ‘them’s the breaks.’""

71,UK police clear couple arrested in Gatwick Airport drone disturbances,"London's Gatwick Airport was operating without problems Sunday, but the fugitive drone operators who brought incoming and outgoing flights to a standstill over multiple days remained at large — and a potential threat — after police cleared two local residents who were arrested as suspects.

Sussex Police were hopeful they had halted the disruptive and costly drone incursions during one of the heaviest travel periods of the year with Friday's arrests of a couple who live near the airport. But they were released Sunday, and police said they were no longer suspects.

Tens of thousands of passengers suffered through long flight delays or were stranded by cancellations after two drones were reported seen above the airfield at Gatwick on Wednesday night, prompting an immediate suspension of all air traffic.

Sussex Chief Detective Jason Tingley said Sunday he could not rule out new drone activity at Gatwick or other U.K. airports. He also said it was possible that witnesses who reported sightings after the first ones aroused alarm were mistaken.

""Of course, that's a possibility. We are working with human beings saying they have seen something,"" Tingley told the BBC.

At the same, he said police were making progress in a three-pronged investigation: tracking ""persons of interest,"" investigating 67 reported drone sightings, and examining a damaged drone found near Gatwick.

The drone in police hands may provide useful forensic clues, such as the DNA of people who handled it, Tingley said. But the rain the London area got on Friday and Saturday might have washed away some evidence, he said.

Airport authorities consider drones a menace because they could damage a plane in flight or be sucked into a plane's engine, causing a deadly crash

After the shutdown extended into Thursday, increased military protection was brought in Thursday night to watch for more drones while planes resumed taking off and landing at Britain's second-busiest airport.

The government has kept the details of the security operation secret, but the military equipment is thought to offer better tracking capabilities and give authorities early warning if drones approach Gatwick, located 30 miles south of London.

At the airport on Sunday, flight arrival and departure boards showed fewer delays than on Saturday. Additional tracking gear at the periphery of the runway and an increased police presence were the only clear signs of the headaches experienced there in the past four days. But officials have stepped up surveillance of the surrounding airspace behind-the-scenes.

British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said the unspecified ""military measures"" have bolstered confidence that the airport will be able to remain open without further interruptions. But anti-drone technology is a relatively new, imperfect field, Grayling said.

It is not clear how officials will respond if another drone gets too close. The best guide may be what happened on Friday night, when the airport was shut down for 70 minutes after a drone was spotted. The military deployment allowed the airport to reopen relatively quickly, authorities have said.

No confirmed drone incursions have taken place since then — a factor that led many to assume police had found the responsible operators when they arrested the two suspects Friday night.

That hope ended Sunday when the couple — a 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman — was allowed to return to their home in Crawley, a 5-minute drive from Gatwick.

Detective Tingley said he is satisfied the two were not involved. He is hoping a tip will provide a crucial lead.

Tingley said police did not identify the suspects but The Mail on Sunday tabloid named them and published a large front-page photo of them with the headline, ""Are These the Morons Who Ruined Christmas?""

The crisis at Gatwick marked the first time drones caused sustained disruption at a major airport. There is not much data on the dangers drones pose to airplanes because they are a relatively new phenomenon.

Police say the motive for the drone incursion is not yet known but they do not believe it is ""terror-related.""

Gatwick Airport, which handles roughly 43 million passengers per year, has offered a 50,000 pound ($63,000) reward through Crimestoppers for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the drone operators.",https://www.foxnews.com/travel/uk-police-clear-couple-arrested-in-gatwick-airport-drone-disturbances,N/A
72,UK poultry farmers demand government issue housing order over rising Avian flu cases,"Poultry farmers in the United Kingdom are calling for their government to issue a nationwide housing order for chickens and captive birds after a bird flu outbreak last month.

Currently, parts of the U.K., including Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, already have a housing order for all poultry, which requires owners to keep their birds indoors and follow strict measures to protect their flocks from disease. A nationwide housing order would apply to individuals who own birds on commercial or non-commercial properties.

The response from chicken and egg producers comes as England deals with 27 outbreaks in September across three counties. Producers specializing in Christmas goose are being hit especially hard by Avian Influenza.

Christine Middlemiss, the chief veterinary officer of the United Kingdom, said she expects bird flu cases to rise for the foreseeable future due to migration patterns of birds coming back to the country.

COLORADO REPORTS FIRST HUMAN CASE OF H5 BIRD FLU IN US IN POULTRY WORKER

Outbreaks have also occurred in Oxford, Staffordshire, Cheshire and Devon, according to The Guardian. Therefore, farmers are demanding the government extend the current housing order to the whole nation.



""The sheer persistence of avian influenza over the past year, coupled with soaring energy and feed costs, has put the whole British poultry sector under huge emotional and financial pressure,"" said the National Farmers Union poultry board chair James Mottershead in a statement.

He added, ""Given the recent rise in avian influenza cases and the distress they cause for farming families, the implementation of housing measures in the east of England is a necessary step.""

""The number one priority for poultry farmers has always been the health and welfare of their flock,"" Mottershead continued. ""That is why the National Farmers Union is now urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to consider expanding the regional housing measures on a national basis to reflect any increase in the levels of risk across the country,""

73,"New UK Prime Minister Liz Truss won't be 'afraid of picking a fight' with Biden, experts say","New United Kingdom Prime Minister Liz Truss is likely to take a more forceful approach to British foreign policy — including with the U.S. — at a time of major geopolitical upheaval, experts tell Fox News Digital.

Truss, an experienced Conservative Party official who's currently the foreign secretary, is expected to bring a hawkish stance on both Russia and China. She's also expected to emphasize the special relationship between the U.K. and the United States, as her predecessor Prime Minister Boris Johnson did.

But amid tension across the Atlantic over trade and Brexit issues, Truss might be willing to push back harder against the U.S. and President Biden on some issues.

""I don't think she's going to be afraid of picking a fight with Joe Biden over crucial areas of British national interest. She will stand up to the U.S. president where necessary,"" Nile Gardiner, a former adviser to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, told Fox News Digital. Gardiner now works for the conservative Heritage Foundation.

BRITAIN'S PRIME MINISTER LIZ TRUSS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

""Liz Truss is a determined, feisty figure,"" John Kampfner, the executive director of the U.K. in the World Initiative for the British think tank Chatham House, told Fox News Digital. ""She's an ardent ideologue, she heaps praise on Margaret Thatcher, both in terms of her domestic policy and foreign policy.""

The most high profile split between Truss and Biden could be on Brexit and what's known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was negotiated with the European Union as part of Brexit. The agreement effectively leaves Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, in the European Union's single market, along with its neighbor the Republic of Ireland, an independent country.

U.K. leaders want to renegotiate this deal because, they say, it erodes the standing of Northern Ireland within the U.K. But European Union leaders — and some in Washington — oppose such a move, arguing it could risk undermining more than two decades of peace between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Kampfner said Truss has made very clear where she stands on the Northern Ireland Protocol — and will be fundamentally at odds with Biden.

""She will antagonize the Biden administration in her approach to Northern Ireland and Europe,"" Kampfner said of Truss.

""The White House has been very unhelpful over Northern Ireland, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, has made several threats to Great Britain in terms of sinking a U.S-U.K trade deal because of the Northern Ireland issue."" Gardiner said. ""I expect that Liz Truss is going to be more assertive in her dealings with Joe Biden than Boris Johnson.""

UK PRIME MINISTER ELECTION SEES LIZ TRUSS VICTORY OVER RIVAL RISHI SUNAK

Another area of potential dissent between Truss and Biden could be the U.S. administration's efforts to renegotiate a nuclear deal with Iran.

Biden was the vice president when the U.S. agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with several other countries, including the U.K., aimed at limiting Iranian nuclear ambitions while easing sanctions on the rogue state. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal after taking office, reinstating sanctions. And Biden's administration has made a new deal a priority since taking office.

Truss hasn't yet taken a firm stance on renewed negotiations. But some in Truss' Conservative Party are sour on the idea of the negotiations, Gardiner said, raising ""the possibility that you see a break from where the U.S. is at the moment.""

Kampfner, meanwhile, predicted that Truss may seek flexibility on the Iran issue to avoid stoking divisions with the U.S. on more fronts than she needs to.

China could also be an area of disconnect between Truss and the Biden administration, Kampfner said, despite the fact both countries are moving toward more hawkish stances on the Asian nation.

""She is very tough on China,"" Kampfner said. ""Britain called China a ‘systemic competitor.’ And she wants to call it an ‘acute threat,’ which is quite some step. Does that go too far for the Biden administration?""

""Under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, the U.K sought to build stronger economic relationships with China,"" Gardiner said. ""Which in the case of Chinese telecommunications companies, such as Huawei for example, threatened national security. So Liz Truss is in favor of a much more robust approach toward China.""

Truss' hawkishness also extends to Russia and beyond, according to Kampfner, who said the new prime minister seeks to shake up the way international organizations do business in the 21st century. Whether that is successful, he said, remains to be seen.

""She is portraying herself as a disrupter in chief in a disrupted world. … She sees all these multinational institutions, and she considers them to be stuck or to be atrophied or to be bust,"" Kampfner said.

He added: ""It sounds interesting. Whether or not you can do that when you need to invest long term in partnerships, and relationships, and when you're a medium-sized country… I think she will end up by tempering… her really quite ultra-radical stance.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-uk-prime-minister-liz-truss-wont-be-afraid-picking-fight-biden-experts-say,N/A
74,COVID-19: UK monitoring hybrid delta-omicron strain called 'deltacron',"Health officials in the United Kingdom officially began monitoring a hybrid strain of the delta and omicron coronavirus known as ""deltacron"" last week after it was identified in a patient in the country, according to the country's Health Security Agency.

It is believed to have mutated in a patient who caught both variants at the same time but it's unclear if it first mutated in the U.K or another country, according to the Mirror newspaper.

A month ago, University of Cypress virologist Leondios Kostrikis’ said he had identified deltacron, which was dismissed by many experts as a likely lab contamination or error. The new discovery is unrelated, according to BNO News, a Dutch wire agency.

ANTIHISTAMINES MAY HELP RESOLVE LONG COVID, REPORT SUGGESTS

The Friday update from the UK’s Health Security Agency showed the ""Delta x Omicron Recombinant"" was currently under ""monitoring and investigation.""

Both delta and omicron have proven to be highly contagious but it’s unclear how widespread the hybrid strain is or how transmissible. The agency didn't say if it has been detected in more than one patient, according to the Mirror.

U.K. health officials at the agency aren’t particularly concerned about the new strain at this point because case numbers are low, the Daily Mail reported, citing a source.

Deltacron ""shouldn't pose too much of a threat,"" University of East Anglia infectious disease expert Paul Hunter told the publication because a majority of the population is vaccinated or have a certain level of immunity from surviving the disease.

""So at the moment I'm not overly worried at the moment. If both Delta and Omicron are falling then, in theory, this should struggle to take off,' Hunter added.

75,Russia relying on WWII ground tactics leaves vulnerabilities to modern warfare: UK defense,"Russia on Friday continued to bombard Ukraine from the skies as its forces remain stalled on the ground in what U.K. defense officials have said is down to antiquated World War II tactics.

According to satellite imagery Russian forces are constructing ""extensive defensive positions"" along the front lines, particularly in the northern Luhansk region near the city of Svatove which Russian forces are reportedly ""prioritizing.""

""Russian constructions follow traditional military plans for entrenchment,"" the U.K. defense ministry assessed in its daily update, noting that Russian tactics are ""largely unchanged since the Second World War.""

RUSSIA LAUNCHES 'MAJOR MISSILE ATTACK' ON UKRAINIAN ENERGY FACILITIES, INFRASTRUCTURE IN MULTIPLE CITIES

Defense officials pointed out that these dated practices will likely mean Russia’s ground defenses – which have gained little traction in months and lost two significant cities to Ukrainian forces – are ""vulnerable to modern, precision indirect strikes.""

""The construction of major defensive lines is further illustration of Russia’s reversion to positional warfare that has been largely abandoned by most modern Western militaries in recent decades,"" the assessment added.

Russia in the early hours of Friday morning launched one of the largest missile strikes across Ukraine since the war began after it levied 76 missiles across the country, 60 of which were successfully downed by Ukrainian air defenses.

NO UKRAINE CEASEFIRE FOR CHRISTMAS UNLESS RUSSIA WITHDRAWS: KYIV

Cruise missiles were launched from the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and the Engels Air Base, located over 370 miles inside Russian territory and the site of a drone strike earlier this month, which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv.

Ukraine’s Air Force said it also saw shelling from Belarus as well as ""long-range radar detection aircraft and the MiG-31K fighter jet carrying the ‘Kinzhal’ missiles"" deployed from the Russian ally.

76,London terror attack: UK wants encrypted WhatsApp messages,"The U.K. government wants WhatsApp to give security services access to encrypted messages in the aftermath of the Westminster Bridge terror attack. Officials, however, could face stiff challenges if they choose to apply U.K. surveillance legislation to the U.S.-based firm, according to a digital privacy advocate.

British press reports suggest Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood used the WhatsApp messaging service just minutes before the Wednesday rampage that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News Sunday to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping.

APPLE DENIED MASSIVE ICLOUD HACK

“We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other,” she said, in a BBC interview. “We need to make sure that our intelligence services do have the ability to go into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.”

Last year the U.K. passed the Investigatory Powers Act, which aims to strengthen the country’s surveillance powers.

However, the London-based Open Rights Group, which advocates for digital privacy and free speech online, told Fox News that any attempt to apply U.K. surveillance legislation would take the government into uncharted legal waters.

""The U.K. claims the power to ask companies with U.K. users to change their products as long as it is reasonable or technically feasible,” explained Jim Killock, Open Rights Group executive director, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “Although WhatsApp is U.S.-based, its parent company, Facebook, has offices and assets in the UK -- and so it might be compelled to respond to such a request. However, none of this is tested in law; we don’t know whether there would be resistance or if the U.S. government might try to intervene.”

TRACTOR HACK: FARMERS ARE HARNESSING HACKED SOFTWARE FOR JOHN DEERE REPAIRS

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, says that it is working with U.K. authorities following Wednesday’s attack. “We are horrified at the attack carried out in London and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations,” it said, in a statement emailed to Fox News.

In an interview with Sky News, Rudd said that tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Twitter need to step up in the battle against terrorism. “They really have to take responsibility for the fact that their sites, their platforms, their publishing enterprises, are being used by terrorists,” she said.

The Cabinet Minister is meeting with key players in the tech industry on Thursday and will urge them to play a bigger role in tackling terrorists. “I want them to be part of this answer,” she said, but would not rule out changes to the law, if needed. “I am not taking anything off the table,” she added.

MILITARY PERSONNEL DATA LEAKED IN DUN & BRADSTREET DATABASE

The tech industry has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the deadly 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.

The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple's help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone.

Controversy has swirled around WhatsApp before. Judges in Brazil, for example, blocked the messaging app on three occasions amid rows over handing over messages to the courts.

The Westminster Bridge attack has thrust secure messaging apps firmly into the spotlight again. ISIS sympathizers cheered the attack using channels in the Telegram app. ISIS used Telegram to claim credit for the Paris terror attacks in November 2015, prompting the messaging app to remove a slew of ISIS-related channels.

77,UK reportedly tells Trump he cannot meet with Brexit architect Nigel Farage,"The U.K. government has reportedly told President Trump he must not meet Brexit architect and former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage when Trump visits the U.K. later this month.

The U.K. Daily Telegraph, citing a source within the British government, reports that 10 Downing Street made it clear that Trump “must not meet Farage” during his working visit to the U.K. on July 13.



Trump has embraced Farage, who is also a Fox News contributor, and called him “the man behind Brexit” during the 2016 campaign.



Farage told Fox News he would not comment on any conversations he had with the White House but said the Telegraph report was “utterly consistent” with past behavior from the U.K. government.



“The one thing they do not want me doing is having a photograph with the U.S. president when he’s in London with both of us saying ‘Brexit is a great idea, why doesn’t the government just get on with it?’”

A Downing Street spokesman referred Fox News to comments it made to the Telegraph, saying it was ""not even aware of a meeting being requested"" and that ""either way we are not trying to stop one.""



Farage played a key role as UKIP leader in putting pressure on then-Prime Minister David Cameron’s government to call for the 2016 referendum on whether the U.K. should leave the European Union, and also for securing a win for the “Leave” campaign.



In particular, Farage was key in promoting limiting immigration as a defining issue of the “Leave” campaign, just as then-candidate Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign was doing the same.



Since the Brexit result, Farage has been a thorn in the government’s side as he has repeatedly blasted the government for dragging its feet on implementing Brexit, and for being too soft in negotiating with Brussels.



“Number 10, the establishment Conservative Party, have a pathological hatred of me,” Farage told Fox News on Friday. “They see me as being the reason they had to offer a referendum, they see me as being one of the major reasons they lost the referendum and now they have to implement something they don’t believe in. They hate it and they’ll never forgive me until the day I die.”



Trump ruffled feathers in November 2016 when, shortly after his election win, he suggested Farage as British ambassador to the U.S.



“He would do a great job,” he tweeted.



Farage told Fox News that the reported red line from the British government reflects not just a nervousness about Farage, but also about Trump.



“I think they’re nervous about what Trump is going to say about NATO, about Brexit. I think they’re very nervous indeed,” he said.



Trump’s visit is expected to be met with significant protests from left-wing activists, promoted by members of the left-wing Labour Party who have repeatedly called for Trump to be uninvited.

UK PRIME MINISTER MAY UNDER PRESSURE TO CANCEL TRUMP VISIT OVER MIGRANT CONTROVERSY



Last month, Prime Minister Theresa May was grilled by MPs with calls to scrap the visit, particularly after the controversy surrounding illegal immigration and the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. While she said “the pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing,” she defended the Trump visit.

“We have a special and longstanding relationship with the United States and I think it is right -- there will be a range of issues I will be discussing with President Trump ... and I think it’s important that we make sure that when we see the president of the United States here in the United Kingdom we’re able to have those discussions,” she said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/uk-reportedly-tells-trump-he-cannot-meet-with-brexit-architect-nigel-farage,N/A
78,"UK climate activists block fire engine, ambulance from responding to emergencies","Dozens of climate activists protesting against fossil fuel production blocked multiple emergency service vehicles from driving to their destination in London on Tuesday morning, according to video of the incident.

The activists, with the climate group Just Stop Oil, laid in the middle of a busy road in the central London neighborhood Knightsbridge, forcing a fire engine and ambulance to divert from their route, the video, published by U.K. media outlet Leading Britain's Conversation (LBC), showed. The protest also halted rush hour traffic, creating a major blockade and forcing police officers to intervene.

""I’m driving a lady who has to get to hospital with a baby,"" a driver who was one of several blocked by the protest told the activists, LBC reported.

A truck driver told the protesters to stop sitting on the road ""like a bunch of lemons.""

""Where are the police? There’s not one, is there? In 15 minutes, not one,"" a taxi cab driver told LBC.

Another tax driver said police were slow to act because of the paperwork involved, according to LBC.

Just Stop Oil, though, said 32 of its members were ultimately arrested during the protest. The group also defended the action, saying it was not prepared to watch while ""countless millions"" die from climate change.

""32 supporters of Just Stop Oil have been arrested for peacefully blocking Knightsbridge and Brompton Road,"" Just Stop Oil tweeted. ""All chose to step up into Civil Resistance because it is our only chance to prevent the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced.""

""They do not want your sympathy, they want you to step up and join them,"" the group added. ""We are not prepared to watch while the Government plans for countless millions to die. We are going to stop new oil whether those in power agree or not. We are not asking, we are going to make it happen.""

The group didn't provide a comment to Fox News Digital.

A spokesperson for the group previously told Fox News Digital that the group was prepared to continue to engage in ""civil resistance"" measures, but was committed to nonviolence.

""We are basically calling for individuals and institutions to go into civil resistance against the U.K. government, stopping them from one of the biggest acts of criminality in this country's history, in terms of going ahead with fossil fuel, oil, gas, coal projects,"" the spokesperson said in July.

79,"UK to face ‘substantial third wave’ of coronavirus as Delta variant spreads, expert says","A top expert with the U.K.’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) on Sunday warned the region is approaching a third wave of COVID-19 infections as a highly transmissible variant first detected in India continues to proliferate.

""I think it’s now very clear that we will have a substantial third wave of infections,"" Prof Andrew Hayward of University College London said, appearing on BBC One's ""Andrew Marr Show."" ""The really big question is how much that wave of infections is going to translate into hospitalizations. The fact that we’ve got 55% of the adult population double vaccinated means that this will be substantially less bad than it could’ve been but we still don’t know exactly how bad it could be.""

Government data indicates over 41 million people in the U.K. have received at least one dose, while nearly 30 million are fully vaccinated. A study from Public Health England suggested the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective against the variant two weeks post-second dose, and 33% effective after the initial dose. A recent report from PHE found that the Delta variant, B.1.617.2, was behind over 90% of sequenced cases.

DELTA COVID-19 VARIANT ‘PROBABLY GOING TO BECOME’ DOMINANT STRAIN IN US, GOTTLIEB SAYS

The variant is associated with an increased hospitalization risk and recent findings suggested the variant is 60% more transmissible.

""I think 60% more infectious is extremely worrying, that’s the main thing that will drive the speed with which the next wave comes along,"" Hayward said. ""The fact that the level of hospitalizations from this infection appear to be maybe up to double those from the previous infection is of course also extremely concerning even in the context of people having had a single dose of vaccine.""

The news comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to extend COVID-19-related restrictions on Monday by several weeks amid a concerning rise in infections driven by the Delta variant, Reuters reported. The Delta variant is the dominant strain in the U.K.; it has overtaken the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 Alpha variant.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/uk-substantial-third-wave-coronavirus-delta-variant,N/A
80,Britain's new Prime Minister Liz Truss can be a UK powerhouse just like Margaret Thatcher was,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Margaret Thatcher was a titan on the world stage, a visionary leader who transformed Britain from the ""sick man of Europe"" in the 1970s into a global power again in the 1980s. Now, over 30 years after Lady Thatcher left office, the question naturally arises: Can Liz Truss, Britain’s third female prime minister (following Theresa May), also prove to be a capable leader?

Truss, who previously served as Foreign Secretary and International Trade Secretary, succeeds Boris Johnson, who resigned as Prime Minister following a rebellion among Conservative Members of Parliament. She faces immense challenges, from soaring inflation and a large-scale energy crisis, to the continuing war in Ukraine and growing aggression from the enemies of the free world, including Russia, China and Iran.

Truss is the right leader for Britain at this moment. She models herself on Thatcher’s leadership and is a self-described ""Thatcherite,"" who believes in cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and shrinking the size of the state.

A born-again Brexiteer (after originally opposing Brexit in the 2016 referendum), she is a strong defender of British national sovereignty and self-determination, and has resolved to stand up to the European Union on vital areas of British national interest, including amending the hugely flawed Northern Ireland Protocol.

LIZ TRUSS BECOMES UK PRIME MINISTER, BORIS JOHNSON SUBMITS RESIGNATION TO QUEEN ELIZABETH

Truss is already off to a flying start, appointing a strongly conservative cabinet, many of whom are on the right of the Conservative Party. It includes rising stars Suella Braverman as the new Home Secretary in charge of securing Britain’s borders and ending illegal migration from France, as well as Kemi Badenoch in the position of International Trade Secretary, overseeing Britain’s drive to secure a trade deal with the United States. Both Braverman and Badenoch have also been at the forefront of Britain’s culture wars, and key figures in combating the left’s nefarious ""woke"" agenda.

Liz Truss models herself on Thatcher’s leadership and is a self-described ""Thatcherite,"" who believes in cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and shrinking the size of the state.

In addition, leading free-marketeers Kwasi Kwarteng and Jacob Rees-Mogg have been appointed to the key positions of Chancellor of the Exchequer and Business Secretary respectively, with vital roles at a time when Britain’s economy is under great duress. Ben Wallace, who has been an outstanding Defence Secretary, remains in his post, and will be a major thorn in the side of Vladimir Putin and Russia’s barbaric efforts to invade Ukraine.

As Prime Minister, Liz Truss must follow Thatcher’s example and pursue policies that advance economic freedom, and roll back the frontiers of bloated state power.

Encouragingly, she has called for an aspiration-based society, one that champions individual freedom over government handouts, and celebrates the free market instead of tying its hands. She should resist the siren calls to spend more taxpayer money, and work to defeat the specter of socialism, which has brought so much economic ruin to Britain in the past, and wrecked dozens of economies across the world.

In an era of declining American leadership under Joe Biden and his far-left presidency, Truss has an opportunity to be a robust leader of the free world, willing to stand up to imperial Russia, Communist China, and Islamist Iran. She should be assertive in her dealings with the Biden administration, and stand her ground on issues of vital British national interest, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, which threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom.

Truss should stiffen the resolve of the United States in confronting the mounting menace posed by China’s brutal Communist Party, and also urge President Biden to end the negotiations with Iran, and walk away from the dangerous idea of reviving the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.

Truss can be a hugely consequential prime minister if she follows the example of the Iron Lady who came before her. Great Britain needs the kind of steadfast, principled conservative leadership that Margaret Thatcher stood for and believed in.

There are high hopes for Truss. Britain’s future as a great nation in the Brexit era will depend ultimately on the path she takes her nation down in the next few years.

81,"UK coronavirus variant likely already in this state, doctor warns","The U.K. coronavirus variant is likely already in Vermont, warned the president of the University of Vermont Medical Center this week.

The variant, identified as B.1.1.7, was first discovered in the U.K. several weeks ago but has since appeared in several U.S. states, including Colorado, where it was first identified in the country, as well as New York, California, Florida, Georgia, and, as recently as Thursday, in Pennslyvania.

The strain is thought to be more transmissible than COVID-19. At this time, experts appear confident that existing coronavirus vaccines will work against the variant.

Speaking at a Burlington city press conference Wednesday, University of Vermont Medical Center President Dr. Stephen Leffler said Vermonters shouldn’t be surprised if the variant is identified in the Green Mountain State in the next five to 10 days.

UK CORONAVIRUS VARIANT MOST LIKELY TO SPREAD AMONG THIS AGE GROUP, STUDY SUGGESTS

""We should assume it’s already in Vermont,"" said Leffler, per local outlet VTDigger.

Leffler also spoke to the variant’s transmissibility, warning that its ability to infect even more people than the strain originally identified in the early days of the pandemic could have adverse effects on the community.

""The old version — let’s say you would infect only two other people. Chances are both of those people will recover as well. Let’s say the new version, you infected 10 other people.

So far, officials with Pfizer and BioNTech — the companies whose COVID-19 vaccine candidate proved highly efficacious in late-stage clinical trials and was the first jab to see emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — have voiced confidence in its ability to protect against the strain while also touting the flexibility of the technology should a tweak need to be made.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Thursday that Isla Bryson would not be incarcerated in a woman's correctional facility ""either short term or long term"" following media reports Bryson had been transferred to the Cornton Vale women's prison, The Guardian reported.

The news of Bryson being in a female prison prompted outcry from lawmakers and even United Nations officials.

HOMELESS UK MAN STOPS ARMED DRIVER'S DRUG-FUELD RAMPAGE: ‘I HAD TO ACT’

""This rapist decided that he was no longer a man only after appearing in court on a rape charge,"" said Russell Findlay, a conservative member of Scottish Parliament. ""We now have the utterly perverse situation where a Scottish court refers to someone who says he identifies as female using 'her penis' to rape two vulnerable women. We warned of the inevitability of this happening if the SNP's gender self-ID law passed, but for it to have become reality is deeply worrying and an affront to the victims.""

Findlay was referring to a law passed by Scottish Parliament last month that allows people as young as 16 to seek a gender recognition certificate to confirm a change in one's legal sex after living in their new gender for just three months — and without the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.

Bryson, 31, was found guilty this week of raping two women while she identified as a man previously named Adam Graham, following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Prosecutors successfully argued during a six-day trial that Bryson attacked one victim in 2016 and another in 2019.

83,UK woman arrested for praying near abortion center warns more arrests may come,"A British woman arrested near a Birmingham, England abortion center for praying, under a new protest prohibition statute, told Fox News she fears her situation will not be the last in the U.K.

On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Isabel Vaughan-Spruce said she has long engaged in silent prayer outside clinics, saying dozens of women have accepted her offers of help and go on to continue their pregnancies rather than terminate them as-planned.

She explained to host Tucker Carlson how the anti-protest policy has since been used to include similar behavior at abortion centers.

""In September this year, the local council in Birmingham brought in this censorship zone, this PSPO – formerly these were used for dog fouling and drunken behavior and things like that,"" Vaughan-Spruce said. ""But they're now popping up around the country surrounding abortion centers, and they banned behavior like protesting, but it also names prayer and counseling as forms of protesting.""

PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST ARRESTED FOR PRAYING SILENTLY NEAR ABORTION FACILITY

""Four times, I went and stood near the closed abortion center and silently prayed there. And as you can see, the police came and asked me if I was protesting, which I wasn't. They asked me if I was praying, and I said I might be silently praying; I was arrested.""

Vaughan-Spruce added authorities detained her in a cell, interrogated her regarding what she was praying about, and was later released on bail with an appearance scheduled for February on four counts of protesting and engaging in an act intimidating of service users.

However, she also said people on both sides of the abortion debate have come to her aid. Even abortion rights advocates, she said, have concerns about the protest law.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN KANSAS ANNOUNCES TELEMEDICINE ABORTIONS

""That in itself is very encouraging to hear, that it's not necessarily about people who support abortion or don't support abortion. This is more to do with freedom of thought here,"" she said. ""It's even gone further than freedom of prayer. I mean, we all talk about the cancel culture and the concerns we have about people being canceled [for] speaking in public.""

Vaughan-Spruce said the idea of arresting somebody over what they are thinking, not visibly doing, is surreal, and that her supporters invoke George Orwell and his novel, ""1984.""

Carlson concluded what happened to Vaughan-Spruce was an ""act of evil,"" and said British officials from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on down should not be standing aside silently..

Birmingham's authorities established a buffer zone around abortion clinics, which makes it illegal for an individual to engage in any act or attempted act of approval or disapproval as it relates to abortion and includes ""verbal or written means"" like ""prayer or counseling.""

""It makes no sense for Britain to be engaged in nuclear negotiations with Iran while Tehran executes British citizens,"" Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""Reviving the JCPOA is just immense folly, and it is long overdue for the U.K. to reverse course over negotiations with Iran.""

""I think we are likely to see a significant toughening of the British position toward Iran,"" he continued, adding that European appeasement toward Iran has proven ""hugely counterproductive.""

Iran announced Saturday that it had executed British Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari, who previously served as Iranian deputy minister of defense from 2000 to 2005. Officials lured him back to Iran and arrested him in 2019 to face accusations of spying for Britain.

ALI REZA AKBARI: IRAN EXECUTES FORMER SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL OVER BRITISH SPY CLAIMS

Akbari and his family denied that he worked as a British intelligence operative, but appealed to the British government for help to obtain his release. His family instead alleged that Akbari served as an important piece in an internal power struggle within the regime, according to The Guardian.

But the regime carried out the execution last week in a move that prompted immediate condemnation from the British government.

""When we heard the tragic news on Saturday morning, we acted immediately to demonstrate our revulsion,"" British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in an address to Parliament. ""I ordered the summoning of Iran’s chargé d’affaires to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to make clear our strength of feeling.

The British ambassador to Iran has been temporarily recalled to the U.K. to discuss next steps regarding how to deal with Iran, The Telegraph reported. Cleverly announced a series of new sanctions against Iran’s prosecutor general for ""appalling human rights violations.""

FROM PHISHING SCAMS TO PROPAGANDA: HOW RUSSIA, ROGUE NATIONS UTILIZE CYBER CAPABILITIES AGAINST THE US

Cleverly raised the issue with U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken on Monday when the two met, and Britain may indicate an end to its support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), known as the nuclear deal. Britain has played a key role in helping to bring the deal to fruition, the result of which would provide Iran funds as Western allies would ease sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear program.

But sources told The Telegraph that ""the landscape and proposition has completely changed"" since negotiations first began, ""largely because of the behavior of the Iranian regime.""

The execution increased tensions surrounding a number of issues that have remained unresolved and contentious between Britain and Iran, such as Britain’s plan to brand the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as terrorists.

Iranian hardliners have urged the regime to continue its press against the alleged British spy network that would have worked with Akbari, with Hossein Shariatmadari, editor of a newspaper with close ties to the IRGC, demanding that Tehran must exact ""revenge"" against the U.K.

""Now it is our turn to take revenge, and it is expected that the Ministry of Information will provide some information related to the leads, commanders, and agents of the British and Mossad intelligence services who were involved in technical interrogations and publish the expert knowledge obtained,"" Shariatmadari wrote.

Iran also blasted the U.K. for its condemnations, highlighting Prince Harry’s recent admission in his new book that he killed 25 Taliban fighters and felt little remorse over it as evidence that the U.K. is ""in no position to preach"" on human rights.

""The British regime, whose royal family member, sees the killing of 25 innocent people as removal of chess pieces and has no regrets over the issue, and those who turn a blind eye to this war crime, are in no position to preach others on human rights,"" Iran’s foreign minister wrote on Twitter.

85,UK government admits 'inappropriate' to argue Bible 'offensive' in case against Christian street preacher,"The government of the United Kingdom acknowledged it was ""inappropriate"" for state prosecutors to argue in court that parts of the Bible are ""simply no longer appropriate in modern society and […] would be deemed offensive if stated in public.""

The Wessex Area of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had made such an argument while attempting to convict Christian street preacher John Dunn of a hate crime earlier this year, according to a press release from the London-based Christian Legal Centre, which represented Dunn.

Prosecutors argued that Dunn, a 55-year-old British army special forces veteran who has preached openly for 15 years in the southwestern English town of Swindon, was guilty of hate speech when he offended some members of the public by denouncing homosexuality.

CASE TOSSED OUT AGAINST CHRISTIAN STREET PREACHER ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED HOMOPHOBIA

The case against Dunn, which could have seen him slapped with a criminal record, was tossed out last month after the women who originally complained about him declined to further engage with the case.

Baroness Hoey, a nonaffiliated parliamentarian, subsequently raised a question in the House of Lords regarding the anti-biblical rhetoric from the government prosecution.

Responding to Hoey's question, Keith Stewart, the advocate general for Scotland, replied: ""The Wessex Area of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has undertaken a post-case review and acknowledges that the statement was inappropriate.""

CHARITY APOLOGIZES TO CHAPLAIN THREATENED WITH ‘CONSEQUENCES,’ ‘RE-TRAINING’ FOR WEARING CROSS PIN

""The statement was not intended to and does not represent a change to published CPS Policy. It is not indicative of a general approach by the CPS to cases involving the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the right to freedom of expression,"" Stewart continued.

""As a result of the post-case review, in future, where skeleton arguments are ordered, in cases where there is scope for argument to arise as to rights such as that of freedom of expression, such arguments will be submitted to the Senior District Crown Prosecutor for signing off, prior to service,"" he added.

UK SCHOOL CHAPLAIN SUES AFTER BEING FIRED, REPORTED AS TERRORIST FOR SERMON QUESTIONING LGBTQ ACTIVISTS

Dunn said in statement that he was ""pleased"" that the government recognized the arguments made against him were ""wrong.""

""I faced the prospect of criminal conviction for over two years on these grounds. I hope what has happened will protect other Christians who find themselves unfairly on the wrong side of the law for speaking biblical truth,"" he said.

Andrea Williams, executive director of the Christian Legal Centre, also praised the government's apparent backtrack, claiming what the prosecution had said about the Bible ""was a clear example of overreach from the CPS and demonstrated the extent to which they misunderstand the Bible and freedom of speech.""

""Their arguments in this case were so steeped in the prevailing secular political orthodoxy, it was chilling,"" she continued.

""Scraping the barrel in this way to try and convict a Christian preacher does not just waste a lot of people’s time, but consistently creates wider and far-reaching implications for Christians across the U.K. who believe in Jesus and for society in general,"" Williams said, adding that the government's recognition of its own impropriety ""represents good news for U.K. Christians, and such arguments must never be made by the CPS again.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-government-admits-inappropriate-argue-bible-offensive-case-christian-street-preacher,N/A
86,Mysterious child hepatitis outbreak: UK study may identify a prime suspect,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated their original Health Advisory on May 11 regarding their investigation of the mysterious worldwide outbreak of hepatitis in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) said a case-control study that will be completed this week should provide more clarity if adenovirus or COVID-19 is causally linked to the mysterious condition, according to multiple reports.

""As of May 5, 2022, CDC and state partners are investigating 109 children with hepatitis of unknown origin across 25 states and territories, more than half of whom have tested positive for adenovirus with more than 90% hospitalized, 14% with liver transplants, and five deaths under investigation,"" the CDC said.

Approximately 18% of cases worldwide actively also tested positive for COVID-19, according to a Medical Xpress report.

‘FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH’ TO PREVENT SOME EFFECTS OF AGING MAY HAVE SURPRISNG SOURCE: STUDY

""The big focus over the next week is looking at serological testing for previous exposure and infections with COVID,"" Philippa Easterbrook, from the WHO’s global hepatitis program, told a press conference.

Easterbrook said within the week the United Kingdom will have data on a case control study comparing whether the detection rate of adenovirus in the children who have hepatitis differs from that in other hospitalized children who don’t have the liver disease.

""That will really help hone down whether [adenovirus] is just an incidental infection that's been detected or there is a causal or likely causal link,"" Easterbrook said.

""At present, the leading hypotheses remain those which involve adenovirus — with also still an important consideration about the role of COVID as well, either as a co-infection or a past infection.""

""A fundamental question is whether there is a characteristic pattern in the pathology of the liver in these patients. Such a pattern might be seen at the advanced stage when liver transplantation was performed, or earlier before the severe liver damage of the unknown process had perhaps obscured an earlier characteristic pattern,"" said Dr. Daniel Lucey, clinical professor of medicine at Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine.

""If such a liver pathology pattern has been found, then it could be used to help identify the etiology of the hepatitis or at least serve to provide a unifying clinical-pathologic syndrome as soon as possible.""

None of the U.K. liver samples "" … show any of the typical features you might expect with a liver inflammation due to adenovirus but we are awaiting further examination of biopsies,"" Easterbrook added.

Because adenoviruses are used in some of the COVID-19 vaccinations, one theory on social media suggested a link between the jab and the hepatitis outbreak in the U.K., where most of the cases have been reported, according to Reuters.

But these adenoviruses in the vaccines are ""harmless transporters which have been modified so they cannot replicate or cause infection,"" according to BBC News.

""There is no evidence of any link to the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The majority of cases are under 5 years old, and are too young to have received the vaccine,"" the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.

The United Kingdom International Health Regulations National Focal Point first reported 10 cases of severe hepatitis of unknown etiology on April 5, 2022, in children ranging from 11 months to 5 years old in Scotland, the WHO said.

WHAT MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF 3 AMERICANS AT THE SANDALS RESORT IN THE BAHAMAS?

""On May 11, the European CDC reported a total of 449 probable cases in 27 nations including from Europe, the Americas (North, Central and South), Asia and the Middle East,"" Lucey said.

""The highest numbers of cases so far are: U.K. (163), USA (109), Italy (35), Spain (22), Brazil (16), Indonesia (15), Israel (12), Sweden (nine), Argentina (eight), Japan (seven) and Canada (seven).""

More than five cases have only been reported in six countries. The United Kingdom have reported the most cases in the world, but no child has died so far in the country, according to a May 12 UKHSA statement.

Hepatitis, otherwise known as liver inflammation, is commonly caused by viruses, medications or exposure to certain chemicals, according to Healthline.

""Most of the children in the reported cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain,"" says Dr. Norberto Rodriguez-Baez, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

""These symptoms were followed by development of jaundice,"" he added.

Jaundice is when the skin and eyes turn yellow because the liver loses its ability to clear bilirubin properly, per Healthline.

87,UK to offer all adults COVID booster beginning in September,"All adults in the United Kingdom will be offered a COVID-19 booster starting from September, health officials said, hours after the country became the first in the world to approve an Omicron-adapted shot.

The preference is to deploy what is known as a bivalent vaccine that targets both the original virus and the Omicron variant through the autumn campaign, but that will depend on the UK health regulator (MHRA) approving such shots and the state of vaccine supplies.

Previously, the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had advised boosters should be given to over 50s, individuals in clinical risk groups, frontline workers and care-home staff ahead of the winter, when respiratory viruses are typically at their peak.

UK REACHES RECORD COVID LEVELS; NEARLY 5 MILLION INFECTED

Around 26 million people in Britain are estimated to be eligible for an autumn COVID-19 booster having had at least two COVID vaccine doses already, a UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) spokesperson said.

On Monday, the MHRA gave Moderna's bivalent shot conditional approval.

The endorsement of the vaccine is based on data that showed it produced a marginally better immune response against some Omicron variants, versus the original novel coronavirus - although whether that translates into stronger protection against serious disease is unclear.

UK contracts with Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech - the partnership behind the other mRNA vaccine that has been tailored to also target Omicron - dictate that supply will switch to bivalent shots upon MHRA approval.

A UKHSA spokesperson declined to provide details on how much supply the country has of the Moderna bivalent shot.

""Where feasible, it would be preferable for a single type of booster vaccine to be offered throughout the duration of the autumn programme for simplicity of deployment,"" the JCVI said in a statement on Monday.

At the same time, the JCVI also advised that the original Moderna vaccine, the original Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Novavax shot - for certain patients - can be used in the autumn booster campaign.

""It is important that everyone who is eligible takes up a booster this autumn, whichever vaccine is on offer,"" Wei Shen Lim, chair of COVID-19 immunisation on the JCVI, said in a statement.

Lost Momentum

While the original COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide good protection against hospitalisation and death, vaccines have become less effective as the virus has evolved.

Britain was the first to approve COVID vaccinations in 2020, but has since lost momentum and is now in such a vulnerable position ""any booster programme is to be warmly welcomed,"" Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, London, told Reuters.

UK GOVERNMENT BELIEVES WUHAN LAB LEAK MOST LIKELY COVID-19 ORIGIN: REPORT

The debate about the nuances of which booster is tricky - the bivalent booster may offer some additional benefit against the BA.5 variant now dominant in Britain, although this may not be substantial, Altmann said.

""Still, the benefit coming into a difficult winter will be palpable if we can really encourage large-scale uptake,"" he said.

88,Hepatitis spike among kids linked to COVID lockdowns: UK docs,"Doctors remain mystified by the source of an outbreak of a severe liver disease in children.

Now, U.K. health officials believe a spike in hepatitis cases among children may be linked to COVID-19 lockdowns. Doctors in the U.K. believe children are getting the illness because of weakened immune systems due to lack of exposure to illnesses during lockdowns.

Research is continuing, but experts believe the hepatitis spike is linked to the adenovirus, which is like the common cold.

""It has been detected in around 74 of those cases that have actually been tested for this,"" says Phillipa Easterbrook, a WHO senior scientist. ""It is very unusual for an adenovirus to cause this type of severe symptoms.""

NEARLY 200 CASES OF MYSTERY LIVER DISEASE IN CHILDREN: OFFICIALS

Doctors say nearly 200 children in 12 countries have been diagnosed with acute hepatitis, which causes liver inflammation. Seventeen of those children have gotten liver transplants. At least one child has died.

Illinois health officials say they are now investigating three cases of severe hepatitis in children in recent weeks. This follows a cluster of nine cases in Alabama and two more in North Carolina last month.

According to satellite imagery Russian forces are constructing ""extensive defensive positions"" along the front lines, particularly in the northern Luhansk region near the city of Svatove which Russian forces are reportedly ""prioritizing.""

""Russian constructions follow traditional military plans for entrenchment,"" the U.K. defense ministry assessed in its daily update, noting that Russian tactics are ""largely unchanged since the Second World War.""

""The construction of major defensive lines is further illustration of Russia’s reversion to positional warfare that has been largely abandoned by most modern Western militaries in recent decades,"" the assessment added.

Russia in the early hours of Friday morning launched one of the largest missile strikes across Ukraine since the war began after it levied 76 missiles across the country, 60 of which were successfully downed by Ukrainian air defenses.

90,"UK bars, cinemas may require proof of COVID-19 vaccination to visit","Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.’s vaccine minister, said on Monday that bars, cinemas and sports venues may compel people to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination before entering.

Zahawi clarified that getting a vaccine ought to be voluntary, but businesses might be able to use a contact tracing phone app that could include a person’s vaccine status.

“I think you’d probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system as they’ve done with the app,” Zahawi told the BBC.

He added: “The sort of pressure will come both ways: from service providers – who will say ‘look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated’ – but also we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.’” Zahawi told the BBC.

Asked whether he thought it would be possible to do anything without the vaccine he said, “people have to make a decision but I think you’ll probably find many service providers will want to engage in this in the way they did with the app.”

Zahawi is overseeing the country's biggest vaccine program in decades. His comments on a possible app come as the the U.K. is currently assessing two vaccines — one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the other by Oxford University and AstraZeneca — to see if they are safe and effective. The Guardian newspaper reported that hospitals have been told they could receive the first doses of the Pfizer shot the week of Dec. 7, if it receives approval.

95,Britain's new Prime Minister Liz Truss can be a UK powerhouse just like Margaret Thatcher was,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Margaret Thatcher was a titan on the world stage, a visionary leader who transformed Britain from the ""sick man of Europe"" in the 1970s into a global power again in the 1980s. Now, over 30 years after Lady Thatcher left office, the question naturally arises: Can Liz Truss, Britain’s third female prime minister (following Theresa May), also prove to be a capable leader?

Truss, who previously served as Foreign Secretary and International Trade Secretary, succeeds Boris Johnson, who resigned as Prime Minister following a rebellion among Conservative Members of Parliament. She faces immense challenges, from soaring inflation and a large-scale energy crisis, to the continuing war in Ukraine and growing aggression from the enemies of the free world, including Russia, China and Iran.

Truss is the right leader for Britain at this moment. She models herself on Thatcher’s leadership and is a self-described ""Thatcherite,"" who believes in cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and shrinking the size of the state.

A born-again Brexiteer (after originally opposing Brexit in the 2016 referendum), she is a strong defender of British national sovereignty and self-determination, and has resolved to stand up to the European Union on vital areas of British national interest, including amending the hugely flawed Northern Ireland Protocol.

Truss is already off to a flying start, appointing a strongly conservative cabinet, many of whom are on the right of the Conservative Party. It includes rising stars Suella Braverman as the new Home Secretary in charge of securing Britain’s borders and ending illegal migration from France, as well as Kemi Badenoch in the position of International Trade Secretary, overseeing Britain’s drive to secure a trade deal with the United States. Both Braverman and Badenoch have also been at the forefront of Britain’s culture wars, and key figures in combating the left’s nefarious ""woke"" agenda.

In addition, leading free-marketeers Kwasi Kwarteng and Jacob Rees-Mogg have been appointed to the key positions of Chancellor of the Exchequer and Business Secretary respectively, with vital roles at a time when Britain’s economy is under great duress. Ben Wallace, who has been an outstanding Defence Secretary, remains in his post, and will be a major thorn in the side of Vladimir Putin and Russia’s barbaric efforts to invade Ukraine.

As Prime Minister, Liz Truss must follow Thatcher’s example and pursue policies that advance economic freedom, and roll back the frontiers of bloated state power.

Encouragingly, she has called for an aspiration-based society, one that champions individual freedom over government handouts, and celebrates the free market instead of tying its hands. She should resist the siren calls to spend more taxpayer money, and work to defeat the specter of socialism, which has brought so much economic ruin to Britain in the past, and wrecked dozens of economies across the world.

In an era of declining American leadership under Joe Biden and his far-left presidency, Truss has an opportunity to be a robust leader of the free world, willing to stand up to imperial Russia, Communist China, and Islamist Iran. She should be assertive in her dealings with the Biden administration, and stand her ground on issues of vital British national interest, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, which threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom.

Truss should stiffen the resolve of the United States in confronting the mounting menace posed by China’s brutal Communist Party, and also urge President Biden to end the negotiations with Iran, and walk away from the dangerous idea of reviving the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.

Truss can be a hugely consequential prime minister if she follows the example of the Iron Lady who came before her. Great Britain needs the kind of steadfast, principled conservative leadership that Margaret Thatcher stood for and believed in.

There are high hopes for Truss. Britain’s future as a great nation in the Brexit era will depend ultimately on the path she takes her nation down in the next few years.

96,Why did Boris Johnson resign as UK prime minister?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said it was ""clearly the will"" of the Conservative Party that he step down from the top job following a series of scandals that have plagued his office for years.

Johnson – who survived a vote of no confidence just one month ago for a COVID-related scandal that has been dubbed ""Partygate"" – was faced with renewed controversy this week after an unprecedented number of cabinet members and party leaders resigned in protest of his leadership.

Members of his party began to call on the controversial prime minister to step down after a sexual misconduct scandal arose involving his former Tory Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher.

UK PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION

Pincher, who was appointed by Johnson in February, resigned on June 30 after he was accused by two men of drunkenly groping them at a Conservative event the night prior.

The party whip said he ""drank far too much"" and had ""embarrassed myself and other people"" following the event, reported the BBC.

Immediately following his resignation, Downing Street backed Pincher and said he had acknowledged his wrongdoing and would hold on to his seat in Parliament. But he was suspended from the Conservative Party and has been forced to serve as an Independent.

The issue took a turn for Johnson after a spokesman at No, 10 claimed the prime minister was not aware of any other allegations of wrongdoing.

BORIS JOHNSON'S RESIGNATION CAPS OFF TUMULTUOUS TENURE

Reports later surfaced showing that Johnson was reportedly made aware of a complaint filed against Pincher during his post as Foreign Office minister from 2019 to 2020 that involved ""inappropriate behavior.""

The allegations levied at Pincher were confirmed after a disciplinary process investigated the matter, at which point Johnson and his then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab were informed, according to the BBC.

Downing Street then reversed its position and said the prime minister did know about media reports regarding the allegations but said they had been ""either resolved or did not progress to a formal complaint.""

""It was in one way concluded in some form. These issues tend to be anonymous,"" a spokesman told the BBC.

On Tuesday former top Foreign Office civil servant Sir Simon McDonald revealed that Johnson had not only been made aware of the allegations but was briefed on them in person.

Downing Street then claimed the prime minister had forgotten about the matter before he instated Pincher to the top job.

Johnson later admitted that Pincher’s appointment had been a ""bad mistake,"" but the damage had been done.

Two of the U.K.’s most senior cabinet members, finance minister Rishi Sunak and health secretary Sajid Javid, quit in protest Tuesday.

A wave of more than 40 members of Parliament and their aides, along with several other cabinet members, handed in their resignations Wednesday after Johnson seemingly refused to step down.

The defiant prime minister caved to the growing demands for his resignation after one of his closest allies, treasury chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, publicly resigned Thursday after just 48 hours on the job and called on Johnson to step down for the sake of the country.

Johnson is expected to stay in office until an internal party election can select a new leader – a process that is expected to take place over the summer.

98,UK pub shooting leaves 1 dead on Christmas Eve,"A shooting at a pub in England on Christmas Eve resulted in one woman dead and three men injured, according to police.

The Associated Press reported that the incident occurred just before midnight local time at the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey, and that the Merseyside Police said they were investigating it as a murder.

""This investigation is in the very early stages, and we understand that this is a truly shocking and devastating incident that has happened just before Christmas Day in a busy venue full of young people,"" Detective Superintendent David McCaughrean said.

99,British scientists believe pollution did not cause UK mass crab deaths,"British scientists said Friday they don’t think pollution killed thousands of crabs that washed up on beaches in northeast England, though they are unsure what did cause the unusual die-off.

The crustaceans were found dead or dying along more than 44 miles of coastline in late 2021, with some displaying unusual ""twitching"" while in the throes of death.

Environmentalists suspected toxins released by dredging to expand a port in Teesside, a heavily industrial area, might have been responsible. Research last year by academics, backed by the fishing industry, suggested the industrial pollutant pyridine, possibly from dredging at the mouth of the River Tees, as a potential cause.

But a panel of scientists and industry experts set up by the British government said it found no evidence pollutants were to blame.

The group, chaired by Gideon Henderson, chief scientific adviser to the government’s environment department, said it was ""very unlikely"" that pyridine or another toxic pollutant caused the die-off.

""We just could not find evidence for high levels of pyridine in the coastal sea water,"" said Lancaster University environmental chemist Crispin Halsall, who worked on the report.

The group concluded it was ""about as likely as not"" that a pathogen new to U.K. waters – a potential disease or parasite – caused the crab deaths. The scientists said they were unable to identify what pathogen, if any, was responsible.

""We’ve come up with probably more questions than answers,"" Tammy Horton, a researcher at Britain’s National Oceanography Center who worked on the study, said.

She said it was ""highly unlikely"" there would be any human health implications from a pathogen of crab and ""seafood would be safe to eat.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-scientists-believe-pollution-did-not-cause-uk-mass-crab-deaths,N/A
