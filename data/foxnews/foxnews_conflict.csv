""This does feel like the way it was when and why we left in the 90s. Like my old PTSD I’ve finally fixed is coming back. I literally only just forgot about those ‘always on the edge’ feelings and actually started worrying about things like bbq grills. I’m crying as I’m typing this because all man deserves to worry about ‘bbq grills’ and not f---ing war.

""Conjuring"" actress Vera Farmiga, who has Ukrainian roots, posted to Instagram the country's flag along with some lyrics from its national anthem. She used the hashtag #IStandWithUkraiine.

Regina Spektor, a Grammy-nominated singer, compared Putin's actions to the Nazis during World War II in an Instagram post.

""Today my heart hurts because no matter how many great works of art and music (Guernica…. Masters Of War… Most of Okudzhava and Vysotsky… Vonnegut… Remarque… all those films in all those languages…) portray the horrors of war, new Masters of War seem to rise up again in all the nations… Sending new children to slaughter each other,"" wrote Spektor, 42, who was born in Moscow before her family left the former Soviet Union for New York City in 1989.

""There were, and still are, real Nazis in the world. But in Ukraine that are just millions of civilians being pulled into a war, and in Russia there are children being sent to fight and die for no reason other than the bottomless and horror filled 'more more more more more more more' of politicians and corporations. And it's terrifying.""

""90 Day Fiance"" star Yara Zaya, 27, who was born and raised In Ukraine, described her heartbreak in an interview with Fox News Digital on Thursday.

""It's honestly really hard for me because, yes, I do live in the United States now, but Ukraine, it is my home,"" Zaya said. ""I love my country, and it's just so hard for me to even think that in 2022, in this world right now, war still exists, and people can kill other people for land and money.""

Zaya said she's spoken over the phone with friends in Kyiv, who woke up to explosions early Thursday.

""My friends are calling me all the time. I just talked to my friend, and she's like, ‘Yara, I’m so scared. I'm hearing the bombs. I'm hearing the explosions. I don't want to hear the noise,'"" she said.

Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was reported in several areas, as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine's president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government, cause massive casualties and ripple out damage to the global economy.

The military said Friday that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district on the outskirts of Kyiv, and police told people not to exit a subway station in the city center because there was gunfire in the area. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armored vehicles rolled down the streets, while many residents stood uneasily in doorways of their apartment buildings.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv ""could well be under siege"" in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to install his own regime.

"Nicola Peltz says Victoria and David Beckham are 'great in-laws,' denies any conflict in the family","Nicola Peltz says it’s ""just a bit of a bummer"" when people believe there is family drama between her and her mother-in-law, Victoria Beckham.

The actress, who wed Brooklyn Beckham in a lavish wedding in April, maintains that there is no conflict with her in-laws, even though Victoria did not end up designing her wedding dress.

""They're great in-laws,"" Peltz told Grazia magazine of Victoria and David Beckham.

She emphasized that there is no drama surrounding her wedding dress after early reports indicated that her future mother-in-law was supposed to design her gown. Peltz ended up walking down the aisle in Palm Beach, Florida in a custom Valentino gown.

NICOLA PELTZ BECKHAM RESPONDS TO SUPPOSED FEUD WITH MOTHER-IN-LAW VICTORIA BECKHAM

""Well, I was planning on wearing Victoria's wedding dress, and I was truly so excited to be able to wear a design that my future mother-in-law created,"" she told the outlet. ""I thought that was so beautiful and such a beautiful story.""

Peltz had a plan for her wedding dress, but it began to unravel when Victoria’s atelier said she could not go through with the gown she had envisioned.

She shared that her friend, Leslie Fremar, and her mother, Claudia, helped her come up with the design for her dress.

VICTORIA BECKHAM SLAMMED FOR BEING ‘OUT OF TOUCH’ WITH ‘POSH SPICE’ TIKTOK

""I thought, 'Oh, this is going to be so fun. One of my best friends and my mom.' We connected to start designing the dress, and then a few days went by, and I didn't hear anything,"" she said.

""Victoria called my mom and said her atelier couldn't make it. So, I spoke to my mom and Leslie, and I was like, 'Well, unfortunately, this can't happen, so what's the next step?' I've been a fan of Valentino and their couture for so long. I was really lucky to be able to travel to [the atelier] to try on the dress. That's really what happened,"" Peltz clarified to the outlet.

Peltz was aware that there were rumors that there was a negative reason behind why she did not walk down the aisle in a gown designed by Victoria, and she told the outlet that those rumors really bothered her.

VICTORIA BECKHAM SAYS SHE'S 'LUCKY' TO HAVE FOUND 'SOULMATE' DAVID BECKHAM

""When I read things that say [things like] I was never planning on wearing a [Victoria Beckham] dress or things like that, it does hurt my feelings,"" Peltz said. ""I try not to let it, but it's just not the truth. It's just a bit of a bummer when you're like, 'Oh, people think that,' but it's just not true.""

In August, Peltz addressed the rumored feud with her mother-in-law in an interview with Variety. Since her wedding to Brooklyn in April, rumors have been swirling that Peltz doesn’t get along with her mother-in-law and that the two are feuding.

""I was going to, and I really wanted to, and then a few months down the line, she realized that her atelier couldn’t do it, so then I had to pick another dress,"" Peltz explained to Variety. ""She didn’t say you can’t wear it; I didn’t say I didn’t want to wear it. That’s where it started, and then they ran with that.""

Victoria Beckham started her own clothing line in 2008. Her website describes the line as a mix of pieces to match the evolving style of women and staple pieces every woman should have no matter what current trends are.

Peltz’s husband, Brooklyn, who was also present for the interview, had a different take on the whole ordeal. Having grown up in the media spotlight, Beckham seemed to have an understanding of how quickly rumors can spread and how to deal with it.

""I’ve learned they’re always going to try to write stuff like that,"" Beckham said. ""They’re always going to try and put people down. But everyone gets along, which is good.""

"Russia-Ukraine: Biden announces sanctions, troop movements in response to invasion: LIVE UPDATES","Attack helicopters and F-35s moved to Europe amid Ukraine crisis

The U.S. military is moving more troops and equipment to Europe as tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate.

The military is moving F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a battalion of 20 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters from Germany, as well as 800 soldiers from Italy, to Baltic states and Poland in an attempt to reinforce NATO's eastern flank, according to reporting from Task & Purpose.

President Biden on Tuesday stressed that the additional troop movements were defensive in nature, making clear her did not intend to send the U.S. military into an armed confrontation with Russia.

“Today, in response to Russia’s admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized additional movement of U.S. forces and equipment already stationed in Europe, to strengthen our Baltic allies: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,"" Biden said.",https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/russia-ukraine-invasion-imminent,N/A
"Dennis Prager: Israel-Palestine conflict is not what Left wants you to believe, it’s not over land","Conservative radio host Dennis Prager joined ""Fox News Primetime"" to discuss rising anti-Semitic attacks plaguing American cities and says the Left is wrong about the conflict in the Middle East, ""The issue is not the land.""

PRAGER: When I was in college, which was not recently, I was taught that a black cannot be a racist. And I remember thinking that's impossible. I mean, it's simply impossible. I couldn't believe I heard that, but every professor who addressed the issue said that. The world of the left is a make-believe world. There is one point that I would like to make that is extremely instructive and has not been noted. And that is these attacks are on Jews and they are coming from various Muslim extremists in the United States, obviously not from all Muslims, I'm not implying that, but people need to understand something they don't understand. The Middle East dispute is not over land. Israel is the size of New Jersey. It is smaller than El Salvador. There are 22 Arab states. There is a state with a majority of Palestinians called Jordan. The issue is not land. The issue is religion. Again, this is not what the left wants you to believe. They want you to believe it's over land. No, it's not. There is a big chunk of the Muslim world that would like to exterminate the Jewish state beginning with, of course, Iran. That is why if you look at the rhetoric, it's always ""F the Jews,"" ""F the Jews"" in all of these attacks. It's never ""F the Israelis."" It's always ""F the Jews.""

If the only country in the world you think does not have the right to exist is the only Jewish country in the world, then one has the right to infer that you have something against a Jewish state but not any other state. Imagine somebody saying, you know, I love Italians, I'm not anti-Italian, but I don't think Italy has the right to exist. You would say, sir, I'm not an idiot, you hate Italy and you hate Italians. That's the way it works. If the only state that can't exist on earth is a Jewish state, you have something against the Jews.

Hannity predicts Russia-Ukraine conflict could spiral 'out of control' very quickly,"Sean Hannity sounded the alarm on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Tuesday's opening monologue of ""Hannity.""

""This has the potential to spiral way out of control very quickly,"" he said. ""Weakness should not be an option. That's all I'm seeing right now. It is time for Germany, and NATO, and Europe, our Western European allies, to break free of their dependence on Russian oil and gas.""

""The only answer - the only country that has more natural resources - oil, gas, coal - that would be us, the United States,"" he continued. ""And if you really want to beat Putin, we're not going to have a shooting war with Putin. I don't want one, you shouldn't have one.""

SEN BARRASSO: RUSSIA'S ENERGY SUPPLY IS A 'CASH COW' FOR PUTIN'S AGGRESSION AS POSSIBLE UKRAINE INVASION LOOMS

""We should flood the market with our own energy supply. That will help with inflation, create high-paying career jobs, [and] it's going to be good for national security.""

The Fox News host speculated about the reach of Putin's ""territorial ambitions.""

He recalled how the Russian president invaded Georgia in 2008 and started a ""puppet government"" there. Putin also arranged ""client states"" in Moldova and Belarus, Hannity said. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea.

""Now he's rolling into eastern Ukraine with Kyiv in his crosshairs,"" Hannity continued. ""What's next? Based on his own public remarks, he seems pretty hell-bent on restoring the old Soviet Union. And recently, Putin added all three Baltic countries to his official list of so-called ‘unfriendly nations.’""

""So what, are they soon now going to be targets of Vladimir Putin's territorial ambitions?,"" he asked, questioning what President Biden would ""do about it.""

Ingraham: Biden and media seek Russia conflict to cover for failing presidency,"In her ""Ingraham Angle"" commentary on Monday, host Laura Ingraham said President Biden and the Democrats are ""stumbling on the warpath"" as they frantically seek a distraction from Biden's failing presidency.

As inflation and crime soars, coronavirus continues and polls tank, Biden's political and media allies are desperate to change the subject, she said.

""More than a month ago, President Biden assured a very war-weary nation that putting troops in or around Ukraine was not on the table. Well, now it looks like that's right up there with the other promises he made, like if you get vaxxed, you can go back to normal and just 100 days of masking,"" she said.

""Anyone paying attention to Biden's presser last week heard the sounds of the war-drums beating [as] the media desperately wants to get off the raging crime, raging COVID, raging inflation story that's driven Biden to another new low in the polls today.""

Ingraham added that some of Biden's media allies couldn't do a better job of trashing and undermining the United States if it were Vladimir Putin himself.

""Putin doesn't even need to spend money crippling Washington, D.C. when our own press corps does it for free,"" Ingraham remarked.

""The media has helped Putin by supporting policies to increase the price of oil and gas. Now, most Americans understand that cheap energy is bad for Russia. But the media doesn't want Americans to have cheap energy. They've done everything possible to stop drilling and to smear the fracking revolution that promises energy independence.""

""Soaring energy prices are helping Putin buy more weapons. The media have undermined our military readiness now for years, we suffered disaster after disaster in Afghanistan, capped by the utter failure to successfully end that war,"" she continued.

She warned that Democrats and Republican neoconservatives are helping take the U.S. down the same path as the costly and protracted war in Afghanistan that concluded with a deadly withdrawal.

""America cannot and must not dilute the strength she has left on another hopeless crusade urged on by the same people who screwed up in Afghanistan,"" she said. ""Our real threat militarily and economically is the [Chinese Communist Party], which loves it when we squander our resources on pointless foreign ventures and quagmires – it makes them thrilled,"" she said.

""Of course, the CCP can always count on the America haters, though, to downplay the threat they pose. Two days ago, the New York Times published what can only be described as a fawning personal tribute to President Xi.""

She further warned that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and many of the other Republican leaders lean toward a hawkish perspective.

""If he wants to avoid being thrown out by another populist uprising in 2024, he needs to resist the war machine's temptation,"" Ingraham said.

""We have enough failed war baggage in the GOP. And for the rest of us, we have to focus on finding leaders in both parties who can build this country up instead of always tearing her down.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/ingraham-biden-media-russia-conflict,N/A
Russia-Ukraine conflict: How the showdown between neighbors came to be,"Rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine have the entire world in a chokehold — but how did this rivalry of neighbors all begin?

In Fox Nation’s new special ""Fox Nation 101: The Ukraine Crisis,"" Russian scholar and former Moscow correspondent David Satter details the history between the two countries beginning with the birth of ancient Russian city Kyiv -- the center of contemporary Ukraine.

But the fall of the Soviet Union centuries later was the ultimate turning point, bringing freedom to Crimea and Ukraine – a nation that had differentiated itself from Russia with European influence and ""national feelings,"" Satter said.

The scholar explained that multiple treaties were signed with Ukraine, all of which validated the existing borders with Russia and Crimea. Meanwhile, the communist governments of former Eastern European satellite countries were overthrown and granted independence, including East Germany which was reunited with the west at the destruction of the Berlin Wall.

The countries in the belt between Germany and Russia soon recognized their need to join NATO, Satter said, as they stood vulnerable if Russia were to regain power again.

""Russia objected but the United States insisted that any country is free to join NATO,"" he said. ""That it’s a decision to be made by that country itself.""

But, according to Satter, Russia was insistent about Ukraine not joining NATO and would consider it a ""provocation"" if the union were to take place.



NATO allies began to back off from encouraging Ukraine and Georgia to join and even declined to extend an invitation to both countries at the Bucharest Summit in 2008.

""This was, to a certain extent, a reaction to Russian pressure - but the Russians reacted almost immediately with an invasion of Georgia,"" he said. ""Which could be interpreted to be a demonstration that NATO made a mistake by not establishing a strong position that it would protect these countries against external aggression.""

Since then, there have been no efforts to recruit Ukraine or Georgia as NATO members; only efforts to uphold friendly relations with the United States. Satter explained that extending membership to Ukraine could be a possibility in the future, but ""nothing more.""



CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION

""And, in fact, nothing has changed recently,"" he said. ""There was no move, whatever to make Ukraine a member of NATO at the time that Putin began making his threats.""

Presently, Russia has built up its military at the Ukrainian border and has prepared necessary equipment for invasion. Even though the Ukrainians are determined to resist, if necessary, Putin’s position to launch a war is ""unpredictable,"" Satter said.

""I think this is an opportunity that Putin is seizing. I think he feels that he can intimidate the U.S. and NATO, that he can extract concessions, that he can intimidate the Ukrainians, and that he can demonstrate that he's in charge to the Russian people,"" he said. ""Anything that seems to show that Russia is a great power.""

"In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, war should not be blind: Will Cain","For two years, emotion has been driving our prism throughout what should be the most consequential, rational, logical decisions of our lives – whether or not to go outside, whether or not to breathe free air, whether or not to inject our children with a vaccine.

In calmer moments, we would say, ""Yeah, I think I want to hear out all the arguments on this one."" But we didn't because the emotion of fear took our culture and changed it into something that we would never have accepted and most likely, never have recognized.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES

Today, when it comes to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I can see that we're headed down a similar path. Here's what I mean: This time we're not driven by fear; we're driven more by empathy. We see horrible images go across our social media feed or on our television screen. We see civilian lives, loss of life. We see absolute travesties that warrant, at some point, a discussion of war crimes. And we're driven by empathy to do something. You can't let this continue. We have to do something. And by the way, the emotion of fear is playing a role as well because we sit here and not irrationally fear what Vladimir Putin's next move may be.

I want to be clear about something: I'm not telling you that I believe emotion has no role in life. In fact, as I've gotten older, I've actually started to appreciate more the role of emotion. There was probably a time when I thought rationality and logic and turning ourselves into essentially automated robots was the best way to achieve a just society. I was wrong. Logic is cold. It has its role, and you can tell anyone who listens to this knows I lean heavily on logic.

But I've also come to understand sometimes that the world operates by very simple emotions – fear, strength, weakness, courage. I know that not only is the world explained by emotion, but emotion is important. It makes life richer. It can't be all black and white. It brings out the colors, and sometimes even though something is irrational, that's part of being human. That's part of this life.

But when it comes to making a decision about whether or not to go to war, one that could result in nuclear war, one whose costs could be incalculable, I do want to be as rational as possible. Emotion, empathy, the humanitarian cause, the pleas of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the words in our mind that carry such heavy impact — words like freedom, the concept of the underdog – they all lurk, playing on the irrational decision. But I don't think we can give in to it. I don't think we should just do something.

I mean, let's just put into context what that kind of irrationality leads to, how that kind of irrationality is a false North Star. I don't hear many calls right now for us to do something in Syria. In Syria, little children are gassed. Chemical weapons. Chemical warfare. They die. They're disfigured. People die by the thousands in Syria because there's a civil war between separatists and Bashar al-Assad, the authoritarian dictator in Syria, who, by the way, is backed by Vladimir Putin, who's being funded and given weapons and supported by Russia.

And oh, by the way, one more time: This travesty, these war crimes, this horrible, horrible loss of human life has been going on for over a decade, but we haven't been compelled by our media. Our brains haven't given into images to just do something. Why? And don't think Syria and Ukraine are the only places in the world where horrible things are happening. But I want to be clear about something: That doesn't mean we don't do something even if we don't do it everywhere. I don't believe that. I don't think just pointing out our inconsistency says, well, throw up your hands – don't do anything.

It just means, hey, recognize we may not be living in the land of principle. We may not be living in the land of reason and logic. On the other side — and it's weird how political lines are totally scattered right now – I can hear from those on the right who say, ""What are you so afraid of? Why are you such a coward? Why does Vladimir Putin scare you so much? We got to go get him.""

I think it's worth setting aside for a moment, in our own decision-making, about putting American interests first.

And look, even though I used that voice, I don't blow off that kind of mindset, either. I love that America irrationally has an empathetic streak to help people, even when we don't help everyone. I also love that America irrationally sometimes just wants to kick some ass and do the right thing. But I know that those are instincts. I don't want to rip them out of the human experience. But I also want them to have the steering wheel.

You can't just go marching boots into Ukraine. You can't impose a no-fly zone. You have to go through the process of the dominoes of warfare playing out, and you have to try to get inside the mind of your opponent. You do it if you're playing chess, you would do it if you were on the basketball court. You would do it if you're on the offensive line facing a defensive lineman.

You would try to get into the mind of your opponent. What will they do? Will he try a spin move? Which way is he going to cross over, left or right? You would ask yourself what you have to guard, not just to play defense, so that you know how and when to play offense, and you have to do the same thing in warfare.

"Washington Post has ‘conflict of interest’ because of billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, ex-staffer says","The Columbia Journalism Review published a scathing piece Tuesday accusing the Washington Post of having a clear ""conflict of interest"" because it’s owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos.

Dan Froomkin feels recent moves ""have called renewed attention to how Bezos’s ownership constitutes a massive and almost entirely unaddressed conflict of interest for the Post,"" with tweets critical of President Biden at the top of the list.

Froomkin penned a detailed piece headlined, ""The Washington Post has a Bezos problem,"" which examines the way the paper’s billionaire owner can influence its journalism.

""For a news organization, being owned by an oligarch can be complicated,"" Froomkin wrote.

FOX NEWS CRUSHES MSNBC, CNN IN THIRD QUARTER VIEWERSHIP AS ‘THE FIVE’ MAKES HISTORY

Bezos, the Amazon founder who is among the richest people to ever live, bought the Post in 2013 when the paper was in a ""downward spiral"" and ""flirting with irrelevance,"" according to Froomkin.

""Bezos’s money changed everything, bulking up the newsroom, revolutionizing its technology, and firmly reestablishing it as a dominant voice in the national media,"" Froomkin wrote. ""But the conflicts of interest are self-evident. Pretty much every public-policy issue the Post covers affects Bezos’s sprawling personal and business interests in material ways. The very existence of people as rich as Bezos clashes with the notion of economic fairness.""

""In May, Bezos started posting highly provocative anti-Biden tweets, mocking the president’s moves to expose corporate greed and increase taxes on the wealthy. In July, he accused Biden of ‘straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics,’"" Froomkin wrote before adding that Amazon has a massive lobbying budget and has been ""ruthlessly effective at fending off privacy protections, antitrust issues, internet regulation, tougher labor laws, and greater worker protection.""

Froomkin wrote that nearly a decade after Bezos purchased the Post, he finally has a leadership team in place filled with people he chose. And while many newspapers are owned by the ultra-wealthy, Froomkin believes Bezos is different.

""The world has never seen wealth like this before, and it has never been so interconnected,"" Froomkin wrote.

Froomkin declared that ""nobody"" at the Post would answer his questions about how much influence Bezos actually has on the paper.

""The Washington Post operates independently and discloses its ownership within articles when applicable. Our aggressive coverage of labor and business speaks for itself,"" a Post spokesperson told Froomkin.

The Post declined a request for additional comment.

SHARON OSBOURNE SAYS SHE UNDERSTANDS PRESS DISTRUST: ‘I WOULDN’T TRUST CBS AS FAR AS I COULD THROW THEM’

Several Post staffers told Froomkin that Bezos doesn’t interfere with editorial decisions, but one admitted a reluctance to ""take him on.""

Froomkin then dove into the ""Twitter war"" Bezos had with President Biden which he feels made ""long-neglected concerns about his influence on the newsroom became considerably less abstract.""

""Most notably—given Bezos’s views about Biden and inflation—Post news coverage of Biden’s domestic policy has consistently been more negative than its competitors,"" Froomkin wrote.

Froomkin feels the Post is harder on Biden than other mainstream news organizations, but insisted nobody is suggesting ""Bezos is specifically or directly telling Post reporters and editors what to write or how to write it"" and he’s largely uninterested in newsroom operations.

Biden's weakness in Ukraine-Russia conflict has only further emboldened China in a new kind of war,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin deserves the world’s unmitigated scorn, but not the United States’ undivided attention. For while Russia today may be an enemy of the West, it is not really a rival. For that, we must look to China.

Putin’s fantasy of resurrecting a greater Russian empire is just that, a fantasy. In reality, Russia is a stale husk of its former self. In the chess game of grand strategy, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not a rook attacking a pawn – it’s a petulant child overturning the board.

BIDEN, XI DISCUSS RUSSIA'S WAR AGAINST UKRAINE AND 'OTHER ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN' IN VIDEO CALL

Yes, the United States must assist Ukraine and our NATO allies to answer Putin’s aggression. And President Biden should do everything in his power to strangle Russia’s energy industry and unleash our own. But talk of this war drawing the United States into a new global conflict misses the point: We’re already in one and have been for years.

It’s one that China started a long time ago. And that conflict is not one the United States should worry about being ""drawn into,"" but one we will either join or lose.

China today is a more dangerous adversary than the Soviet Union at its height. The Chinese Communist Party enjoys strategic advantages Moscow never did, with greater capacity to project power around the world.

Five decades of diplomatic engagement with China, and three of open trade, should leave us with no illusions about the CCP’s ambitions or its ruthless pursuit of them. Like the Soviet Union, the CCP does not care about gauzy abstractions like ""the international community"" or even their own people, as clearly demonstrated by their social credit system and their treatment of religious minorities.

As my colleague Dean Cheng wrote, ""Xi made clear that the PRC won’t tolerate being lectured, nor will it evolve in directions set by others. China has its own ‘core interests,’ which it will not make concessions on — an important point when considering developments ranging from the South China Sea to human rights to cyberspace and outer space to expectations of a more liberal CCP.""

Even more important than what we do to Russia or in Ukraine is what China sees us do.

China is in this fight. The United States still isn’t. And President Biden’s waffling weakness on Ukraine is only further emboldening them. Consider how China has undercut the economic sanctions against the Russian economy through new oil and gas deals. It is past time for the United States to take CCP at its word and treat it like the dangerous strategic rival it is.

How?

Congress and the president can start by finally clarifying our relationship as that of genuine adversaries, not friendly competitors.

All members of the CCP and other Chinese nationals should be barred from national-security-related research funded by federal contracts and grants, as well as from owning land near U.S. national security facilities. Americans should likewise be barred from investing in any firms connected to China’s military or surveillance state.

We should resurrect the China Initiative, the Department of Justice’s highly effective project targeting Chinese espionage that President Biden has just ended. We need to hold the CCP’s leaders and lackeys accountable for their atrocities, from whatever happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2019 to the ethnic cleansing of China’s Uighur minority.

5 CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR CHINA INSIDE US; 3 ARRESTED, 2 AT LARGE

American CEOs, too, should be made personally liable if their businesses knowingly provide technological assistance to Beijing’s human rights abuses. Additionally, Chinese media outlets and official spokesmen should be booted from American social media. Injecting CCP propaganda into America’s domestic political debates represents Big Tech at its worst.

Diplomatically, we need to stop negotiating meaningless climate treaties and nuclear arms control agreements that bind us and our allies, but let China continue to produce carbon and warheads to their hearts’ content. We also must start building a permanent, China-resistant economy via strategic economic disentanglement. That means working with allies to establish strategic stockpiles of critical electronics and the raw, rare-earth minerals they require, new production and manufacturing capacity – especially in critical industries like energy and pharmaceuticals – with the unequivocal goal of cutting China out of U.S. supply chains.

As we strategically withdraw from China, we should strategically embrace Taiwan – diplomatically, economically, and militarily, including selling them as many weapons as they want to buy. This approach is neither an escalation nor a provocation. It’s a realization of both about how we see China and how China sees the world. America has no interest in starting another Cold War, but we have every interest in winning the one Beijing launched against us years ago.

And it is in the context of this new Cold War that we should see all our strategic challenges, including Putin’s war against Ukraine. Even more important than what we do to Russia or in Ukraine is what China sees us do, and whether they look at the United States as a formidable adversary or a declining and irresolute superpower.

For us, whether we like it or not, the most important theater in Putin’s war in Ukraine is neither Kyiv nor Moscow, but Beijing. If Biden doesn’t have the grit and determination to deal with the CCP, then he’ll never be able to deal with Putin.

"Judith Miller: Israel-Palestinian conflict – why violence has real consequences for Israel's Arabs, Hamas","When Middle Eastern summer heat coincided earlier this week with Muslim holy days and a long-simmering property dispute in Jerusalem, the result was predictably explosive.

So far, dozens of Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the exchange of the rockets fired at Israeli civilians by Hamas from Gaza and Israel’s retaliatory air strikes on Gazan military targets. But there are unprecedented aspects to the latest round of violence, the worst in seven years, that deeply trouble Israelis.

Among the most challenging is the spread of the violence to Israel’s own Arab population, a development that has thrown Israeli national politics into even greater disarray and is likely to prompt Israeli Jews to reconsider their own community’s relationship with the country’s 1.9 million Israeli Arabs, or roughly 20 percent of the country’s 10 million people.

Unlike the earlier Palestinian ""Intifadas,"" the uprisings that began in 1987 and 2000 respectively that affected mainly Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the current fighting has spread to Israel’s own Arab communities, descendants of the Palestinians who remained in Israel after the 1948 war that created the Jewish state.

ISRAEL CRISIS: WHY IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND

In the mixed city of Lod in central Israel, for instance, over 200 Israeli Arab protesters, many of them masked, carrying Palestinian flags and shouting religious slogans in Arabic, threw stones, burning tires, and firebombs at police, burned Jewish cars and businesses, and even tried lynching their Jewish neighbors.

Several synagogues were vandalized along with a Jewish cemetery. Police fired back with pepper spray and stun grenades. After a Palestinian man was fatally shot, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a state of emergency there.

Israeli police have also clashed with Palestinian citizens of Israel in nearby Ramle, the northern city of Haifa, Acre, the Jaffe area of Tel Aviv, the heavily Arab city of Nazareth and the Israeli Arab villages of Kafr Kana, Kafr Manda, and Umm al-Fahm, where a succession of radical Islamic religious leaders has held key city posts.

As of Wednesday morning, police had arrested over 45 people at protests throughout northern Israel. In Tiberius and other cities and towns, Jewish vigilantes have responded violently. In the town of Bat Yam, for instance, Jews attacked a man they thought was Arab but was Jewish, kicking him as he lay on the ground. The incident was widely broadcast on Israeli TV.

PROTESTS BREAK OUT ACROSS US AS VIOLENCE ESCALATES BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS

Israeli Arabs are furious over the air strikes on Gaza, the expulsion of Palestinians from the Al Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, holy to both Muslims and Jews, and the impending expulsion of some 70 Palestinians from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Israeli Jews tend to see the effort as part of a long-running property dispute. But Arabs regard it as a right-wing settlers’ attempt to change the demographics of East Jerusalem and a broader Israeli expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland. ""Ethnic cleansing"" is what Israeli critics like Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., call it.

The latest violence is also likely to make it even harder for Israel’s political parties to end the country’s political stalemate and form a government. Despite four indecisive elections in two years, neither Netanyahu nor his rivals have been able to cobble together a majority coalition to rule Israel. Now, mainly because of the Arab Israeli protests, said Ret. Brigadier General Yossi Kuperwasser, a former head of research for the Israeli military’s intelligence division, neither of Netanyahu’s main challengers – Yair Lapid and Naftali Bennett –will be willing to rely on Israeli Arab parties to form a government.

In a webinar Wednesday sponsored by the Philadelphia-based Middle East Forum, Kuperwasser said that Israel cannot risk being seen as dependent on Israeli Arabs when ""Israel is fighting a war not just in Gaza, but internally."" If Israel’s squabbling political parties are unable to form a government, a fifth election seems inevitable.

The most recent violence is also putting intense pressure on the United Arab Emirates and other Arab countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords, normalizing their relations with Israel. The diplomatic breakthrough was one of Donald Trump’s few foreign policy achievements. Although most analysts do not think that the Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, or signatories will withdraw from it, efforts to expand ties, cooperation, and trade with Israel are unlikely as long as the mayhem continues.

Netanyahu said this week that the air strikes against military targets in Gaza would continue for some time, and Israel’s military said that it has already killed 14 senior Hamas commanders and officials. Both Israel and the U.S. consider Hamas a terrorist organization.

Kuperwasser said Wednesday that Israel had already attacked 1,000 Hamas military targets and could do far more damage to its military infrastructure without sending troops into the area it once occupied all but unilaterally abandoned.

Still, radical Hamas has gained political advantage from the conflict -- over both Israel and the Palestine Authority, its Palestinian rival in the West Bank.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas recently canceled what would have been the first Palestinian elections in 15 years partly out of concern that Palestinians would chose Hamas to lead them over his own corrupt, inefficient group.

Firing over 130 rockets into Israel has also enabled Hamas to portray itself as the defender of Palestinian rights, not only in Gaza, but now also for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the rest of Israel.

Russia-Ukraine conflict puts Biden administration's weakness on full display,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

From negotiating with the malign Iranian regime while they have threatened former President Trump, or allowing the Taliban to sweep through Afghanistan and directly imperil American lives, or refusing to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its central role in the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic or for its aggression towards Taiwan, the Biden administration’s record after one year in office is marked by abject weakness.

But his weakness has been unmatched in attempting to deter Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine.

NATO SENDING FIGHTERS, SHIPS TO REGION; UK TO WITHDRAW SOME STAFF FROM EMBASSY IN UKRAINE

For months now, Vladimir Putin has massed Russian military forces on the Ukrainian border. Last month, on December 17, the Kremlin unveiled two draft agreements that essentially acted as ultimatums for NATO and the Biden administration.

The demands? For the United States and NATO to guarantee that NATO would not expand further east, that the United States would withdraw its nuclear missiles from Europe, and that no NATO country would cooperate militarily with former Soviet countries. In effect, Vladimir Putin wants to reestablish Russian dominance over Eastern Europe by recapturing old Soviet bloc countries.

Of course, this would be disastrous for Europe and American national security. President Putin made no offers or concessions in exchange for these demands. He included no guarantees to withdraw the mass of Russian troops in the Donbass region of Ukraine, and proposed no plan to end Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea.

All he ‘promised’ was to no longer threaten America. Any competent team in the White House, any capable American president, would have responded to such threats with immediate and tangible costs to the Russians.

STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUES ‘DO NOT TRAVEL’ WARNING FOR UKRAINE AS EMBASSY STAFF IS TOLD TO LEAVE

They would have responded to the massive military build-up on Ukraine’s border with preemptive, crushing economic sanctions and an ironclad guarantee to help Ukraine defend itself should Russia invade. President Biden should be rallying European allies to commit themselves to standing against Putin and his lawless, authoritarian actions. But deterrence was lost with Biden’s weakness.

In fact, a competent administration’s efforts to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have started a long time ago, when Team Biden first took office. Unfortunately, no such deterrence has been established. When President Putin demanded that the Biden administration give him a New START treaty extension, they gave it to him for nothing.

In the wake of Russian cyberattacks which shut down the Colonial Pipeline, President Biden told them you can only attack certain sectors but ‘sixteen’ are off limits. These were places where the administration had the chance to establish deterrence. Instead, it showed weakness, and President Biden’s recent comments to the press – in which he indicated that a ""minor incursion"" by the Russian military into Ukraine would somehow be permissible – have only encouraged a Russian invasion.

The Trump administration made it clear, from day one, that we would not tolerate actions which undermined American security and our interests without imposing costs on those responsible. With Ukraine, we not only firmly stated our intention to oppose a Russian invasion, but also supplied Ukraine with vital military aid which made any potential invasion far less appealing to the Kremlin.

The Biden administration, while still supplying Ukraine with military aid, has been far murkier on whether the actions it would take in response to a Russian invasion – especially given President Biden’s recent comments about the lack of a response to a ""minor incursion."" And the Biden administration should be enacting broad based sanctions now to preempt any invasion.

President Biden’s actions indicate that he simply doesn’t believe a Russian invasion will have much impact on Americans. But were President Putin to achieve his objectives, a Russian-controlled Ukraine would have major implications for the American people. Energy prices would skyrocket due to the invasion’s effect on global energy markets, directly affecting how much it costs for every American to heat their home. Instability in Europe would strain our economic relationships there, resulting in less jobs here at home for Americans.

War in Europe would endanger millions and destabilize the globe and our own security. And how can we make the case for controlling our own southern border while we allow a free nation’s sovereign borders to be violated with impunity?

Only strength deters war; weakness begets it. President Xi Jinping, Chairman Kim, the Ayatollah – they and others like them are watching to see how America will respond to Russian attempts not only to invade a free nation, but to do so in direct defiance of NATO and the United States.

If America shows further weakness here, if we fail to lead from the front, as President Biden has so many times in only his first year, we will only invite more catastrophic attacks in Taiwan, Korea, Israel, and elsewhere.

The whole world watches how America leads. And when we fail to do so, we create instability and the cost, the risks to all Americans is real.

It will not only be the people of Ukraine who suffer – it will be America and our allies and the world as well.

We have to establish deterrence in the model of Reagan and the model that we had for the four years of the Trump administration. If we do that, America will be safe and secure and prosperous, and the world will be more stable.

"Russia, Ukraine conflict cannot have America sitting on the sidelines","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

America can’t sit this one out. Backed up by China, Putin has yanked fresh U.S. military forces into Europe. As months go by, the U.S. will be stretched thin covering NATO’s eastern flank plus the Pacific where China looms. Add in seven percent annual inflation, and it’s a huge cost in the defense budget.

George Washington told us to beware of foreign entanglements. Wouldn’t that be nice? However, just like in 1939, evil is once again bubbling up from central Europe. Vladimir Putin has 130,000 forces ready to unleash war on 44 million people in Ukraine for reasons that start and stop with Putin and his personal delusions.

Until just a few weeks ago, nobody thought the US would actually have to get involved in defending Ukraine against Russia. But the new geopolitical reality of this crisis has stark long-term consequences, and here’s why:

China’s involved.

WAR REPORTER IN UKRAINE COMPARES SENTIMENT ON THE GROUND TO FLORIDA BEFORE HURRICANE: IT'S ‘GAME TIME’

When Xi Jinping backed up Putin, that really sealed it. The Feb. 4 agreement between Putin and Xi Jinping – during the Olympics, no less – put in place an alliance that runs on oil and gas and will help China and Russia bedevil America. Already, China has helped Iran and North Korea defy sanctions. Now they are poised to help Russia, too. If the U.S. ignores Ukraine, that’s a win for China.

A lot of this is Biden’s fault.

Biden started telephoning Putin to complain about Ukraine last spring, and the Geneva Summit in June 2020 was supposed to be about Ukraine. Putin steamrollered on. Then came the fall of Afghanistan, which showed Biden was clumsy as commander in chief. No wonder Putin sees Biden’s presidency as an opportunity to push NATO away from Ukraine. Putin’s wrong; NATO is strong, but a loss over Ukraine will eat at the alliance and leave NATO members vulnerable to China’s economic temptations.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS EMERGE WITH UKRAINE TROOP BUILDUP

Watching Ukraine’s democracy suffer under bloody assault will be unbearable.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday to expect ""aerial bombing and artillery,"" then a massive ground invasion if Putin strikes. Just look at how Russia handled Syria. Hospitals bombed massive artillery shelling, and forget precision weapons. Russian military doctrine prizes mass firepower. Urban fighting would be ""horrific"" said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Milley. Already we are seeing riveting pictures of citizens of Ukraine training with guns. Americans will have to watch it all unfold on TV and social media.

The U.S. military will be stretched.

Even if no one helps Ukraine, don’t think the crisis in Eastern Europe will end. NATO allies and partners are scared. With Russia holding Ukraine and Belarus, augmented U.S. forces will be in Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and maybe Hungary, too, for a very long time. Simultaneously, U.S. forces will have to be on high alert as China reaches toward Taiwan and helps Iran carry on with its nuclear blackmail. Don’t forget there are two fresh domains: space and cyberspace. Russia has killer satellite capabilities and very evil cyber tools. Picture Putin victorious in Ukraine – no telling what he could try next. The Pentagon is already scrambling to invest in hypersonic weapons and other modern systems to keep pace with China’s threat. Massed power in Europe will drive huge costs that don’t advance American military technology.

Invading Ukraine is bad for Russians.

Leave aside the casualty predictions for a moment. Taking Ukraine is a bad business decision. Although Putin has tried to prepare by divesting dollars, sanctions will hurt. It will take years for trade and investment flows to recover back to the point where Russia’s economy can grow. That’s bad for America because it will deepen Russia’s dependence on China. If Putin deescalates and the Minsk talks resume the economic forecast for Russia is better, and there’s at least an option for natural tensions to unwind the China-Russia links.

Any way you slice it, a Russian takeover of Ukraine emboldens China. That’s why America can’t sit this one out. U.S. airpower with NATO could do a lot to foil Putin’s plans, if activated. Of course, Biden and NATO leaders can do nothing unless President Zelensky requests direct military help.

Those amassed Russian forces around Ukraine are tilting the world toward China. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once asked: ""Who do we want to provide leadership in the world? Somebody else?""

Let’s be clear. The choice is here. Stepping back to let Russia and China do their worst with Ukraine means retreat for U.S. leadership.

Russia-Ukraine conflict exposes Biden security team's inability to plan ahead,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As the largest war in Europe nears its first anniversary, it has become evident to all that President Biden and his security team have failed in their ongoing planning for Ukraine.

The prevailing thinking in the White House and the Pentagon revolves around giving to Ukraine the ""right kit"" – first, Stingers and Javelins, then HIMARs, Patriots, Bradleys, and now Abrams tanks.

Is this endless stream of high-tech military hardware supposed to make Vladimir Putin surrender? Here are three reasons why the Biden administration’s inability to craft a serious strategy, based on realistic goals and affordable costs, puts us all in danger.

1. A lack of strategy

President Biden evidently understands the risks of getting more and more involved in what is promising to be an unwinnable war. When criticized for his lackluster response to Putin’s assault on Ukraine last February, Biden explained why he would not deploy U.S. forces into Ukraine as follows, ""That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.""

PUTIN'S PIVOT IN UKRAINE WILL BRING ABOUT PERMANENT WAR IN EUROPE

Biden also displayed a sound grasp of the danger of arming Ukrainians to the teeth when he evoked the possibility of Armageddon in an address to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in October.

And yet, what seemed to be off limits just a few weeks ago is now en route to Kyiv. A day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was promoting ""big business"" opportunities to U.S. and international investment firms – at the National Association of State Chambers meeting in Boca Raton, Florida – Biden announced the delivery of 31 Abrams tanks.

After Zelenskyy got his tanks, he is now asking for F-16 fighter jets, something the president has so far denied.

What is driving Biden’s risky behavior? Is it another sign of his possible declining mental health? There’s certainly plenty of concern about that.

Last July, 54 House Republicans signed a letter to the president calling on Biden to take a cognitive test, a mental check that the president is yet to take.

Trying to protect her failing husband from mounting pressure, first lady Jill Biden has been hustling to ""shield"" her husband from journalists pestering him about the mishandling of classified documents.

Could it be Biden’s inability to stand up to foreign leaders?

The unexpected decision on the Abrams tanks came after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz refused to send Leopards to Ukraine until Washington supplies its own tanks. Is it another example of a gross lack of strategy from this administration?

Regardless of the driving factors, Biden appears to be on shaky ground, especially during this critical time when the conflict in Ukraine will likely escalate into a broader war in Europe and very possibly will drag the United States into it, too.

2. Failure to understand the adversary’s mindset and modern warfare

The Biden team naively rationalizes that Abrams tanks will change the battlefield dynamics as they are superior to the Russian main battle tank, T-90, an upgrade from the T-72. Indeed, the Abrams is an exquisite piece of armor laced with the very latest technology. But Putin is not a moron. Russia does not fight symmetrically.

There will be no repeat of the World War II Battle of Kursk, in which 3,000 German tanks clashed with Soviet armor, nearly double that number. After an eight-day ""slogging match,"" the Russians won by what one military historian called ""suicidal bravery"" by getting close enough to throw mines under the tanks and having aircraft pick off German tanks from above. Consistent with Russia’s warfare style, Soviet forces out-sacrificed the Germans, with the Russians losing 3,800 tanks, while the Germans lost 760.

What the Pentagon seems to forget is that the enemy does have a vote. Even the Taliban and insurgents have figured out a way around U.S. high-tech superiority, forcing the Biden administration to capitulate in Afghanistan. But not until U.S. losses in life and treasure brought reality to the tactically brilliant yet strategically incompetent Pentagon brass who pursued an unachievable mission for 20 years. The fact that U.S. tanks were vulnerable to the improvised explosive devices (IED)s was a big surprise to our ""planners.""

In response to a U.S. promise of tank deliveries to Ukraine, one of the Russian companies announced on Monday a cash bounty program aimed at incentivizing the Russian troops to be creative at neutralizing the threat of Western tanks. It offered $72,000 in cash to the first Russian soldiers who would destroy or capture American and Western-made tanks and $7,200 for attacks that follow. While Washington has upgraded its M1s to augment the tank’s survivability, the Russians who are watching its top perceived enemy’s every move no doubt have been working on counter-measures and counter-tactics.

Putin views the war in Ukraine as his Cuban missile crisis, as Ukraine’s potential acceptance into NATO would bring the alliance even closer to Russia’s borders. Moscow is putting everything on the line to minimize this risk that it views as unacceptable. The Pentagon is foolish to assume that the Abrams tank will become a game-changer in the war and will bring peace to Ukraine.

4. Reducing US combat readiness as China’s threat looms

The steady outflow of U.S. weapons that integrate top secret technology in them poses grave risk to U.S. security. The latest models of Abrams, for example, contain much classified data related to the upgrades aimed at survivability.

It is for this reason that every Abrams that is sold to foreign customers, even allies, has the depleted uranium armor – which is intended to mitigate vulnerabilities – removed, according to the specialized military website, Breaking Defense. What has become an unrestricted supply of top of the line materiel to Ukraine – which is not, officially, even a U.S. ally – drives up the risk of these secrets falling into our adversaries’ hands.

As Biden is hyper-focused on transferring the best of the best of our arsenal to help Ukraine, he is depleting our own weapons stockpiles, thus eroding our country’s combat readiness.

According to a recent study by a Washington think tank, the replacement times for key weapons systems range from five to 18 years. We are in the red when it comes to 155 mm ammunition, Javelins and Stingers. The gap in the Stinger inventory will take 18 years to close.

AG Garland's potential conflict of interest on son-in-law's firm backing critical race theory under scrutiny,"A conservative government watchdog is seeking information related to reports that Attorney General Merrick Garland 's son-in-law is the co-founder of a company that promotes critical race theory (CRT) in the classroom.

America First Legal (AFL) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with DOJ on Wednesday seeking records related to Garland's Oct. 4 memo, which directed DOJ's National Security Division and the FBI to investigate ""threatening"" parents at school board meetings speaking out against CRT.

Garland's directive has been criticized for politicizing DOJ because it came just days after a controversial letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) to President Biden, suggesting that parents pushing back during school board meetings are engaging in ""domestic terrorism."" Now, Garland is also under increased scrutiny for his son-in-law's ties to a company that backs CRT.

AG GARLAND FACES SCRUTINY OVER TIES TO ZUCKERBERG-BACKED ED CONSULTANCY AMID CRITICAL RACE THEORY BATTLES

In 2018, Garland's daughter Rebecca married Xan Tanner, co-founder of Panorama Education, a consultancy tied to Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's charitable foundation – dubbed the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative – was listed in 2017 as one of several organizations that gave a collective $16 million to Panorama, which would use that for social-emotional efforts.

A press release read: ""Panorama Education will use the funding to expand its tools that help school districts develop students’ social and emotional skills, promote family engagement with school, and increase college readiness.""

Stephen Miller, America First Legal founder and former adviser to President Trump, told Fox News that it is important to look into any ""ethical conflicts"" stemming from Garland's personal family financial interests.

""AG Garland ordered the DOJ to use its vast national security powers to target parents who object to Critical Race Theory being forced onto innocent children. It is therefore exceptionally urgent that the Department disclose all records pertaining to the Garland family’s financial interest in Critical Race Theory and any and all ethical conflicts that arise from that financial interest,"" said Miller.

""Accordingly, Mr. Tanner’s financial interest in a business that benefits from CRT and gender ideology indoctrination might render the Attorney General’s participation in measures to promote or protect such activities, including the October 4, 2021 memorandum, ethically problematic,"" said America First Legal in the announcement of the FOIA request.

PARENTS RESPOND TO DOJ, SCHOOL BOARDS' STATEMENTS: ‘I AM WHAT A DOMESTIC TERRORIST LOOKS LIKE?’

""Merrick Garland has declared a war on parents,"" Asra Nomani of Parents Defending Education (PDE) tweeted in response to Garland's memo. ""His daughter is married to the cofounder of @PanoramaEd which is under fire for its multimillion contracts with school boards. At @DefendingEd , parents sent us tips. We raised the alarm. Now Garland is trying to silence parents.""

DOJ did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on America First Legal's FOIA.

The department previously stated that ""there has been misinformation circulated that the Attorney General’s directive is an effort to silence those with particular views about COVID-related policies, school curricula, or other topics of public discussion.""

""This is simply not true. As stated clearly in the Attorney General’s guidance to the FBI and United States Attorney’s Offices, the Department’s efforts are about rooting out criminal threats of violence, not about any particular ideology,"" said DOJ spokesperson Wyn Hornbuckle.

Biden administration preparing for 'wrong kind' of China conflict in case of Taiwan invasion: book,"An article published in a new book from the American Enterprise Institute warns that the Biden administration's preparations for a possible armed conflict with China could be totally wrong, arguing that a war against Beijing would last far longer than officials may realize.

In the think tank's publication, ""Defending Taiwan,"" senior fellows Hal Brands and Michael Beckley write that ""Washington may be preparing for the wrong kind of war,"" while offering suggestions for how they can plan the right way.

""The Pentagon and many defense planners appear to be focused on winning a short, localized conflict in the Taiwan Strait. That would mean riding out an opening missile blitz, blunting a Chinese invasion, and thereby forcing Beijing to relent,"" Brands and Beckley say in their article, ""Getting Ready for a Long War: Why a US-China Fight in the Western Pacific Won’t End Quickly.""

They also claim that China is making the same mistake, and that their leaders ""seem to envision rapid, paralyzing strikes that break Taiwanese resistance and present the United States with a fait accompli.""

US CAN RELY ON WHAT CHINA DECRIES AS THE ‘ASIAN NATO’ FOR DETERRENCE, FORMER OFFICIALS SAY

""Both sides would prefer a splendid little war in the western Pacific, but that is not the sort of war they will get,"" they write.

To the contrary, they argue that a war between the U.S. and China over Taiwan ""is likely to be long, not short; regional, not localized; and far more easily started than ended.""

A main reason for believing that a war would be drawn out is that both sides would have much to lose and the ability to sustain losses.

""If the United States managed to beat back a Chinese assault against Taiwan, Beijing wouldn’t simply give up,"" they write, explaining that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ""explicitly"" stated that the matter of Taiwan must be resolved during this generation and that ""reunification"" is needed for ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" If he would admit defeat, Brands and Beckley claimed, it could cost Xi his power and ""perhaps even his life.""

On the American side, they cite the repercussions for the balance of power, the outrage at home over what would likely be ""a Pearl Harbor-style missile attack"" against the U.S. to start the war, and the harm a swift defeat without hurting China would cause to Washington's reputation as reasons for why the White House would remain in the fight.

TAIWAN WARNS CHINA IT HAS A MISSILE CAPABLE OF STRIKING BEIJING

Predicting a long war, Brands and Beckley put forth four ways in which Washington can prepare. The first, they say, is for the U.S. and Taiwan to increase their stockpiles of supplies and ammunition so they can beat China in ""the race to reload."" Second, they say the U.S. ""should demonstrate the ability to hang tough"" by taking measures including ""securing critical networks, expanding Taiwan’s system of civilian shelters, and enlarging its stockpiles of fuel, food, and medical supplies.""

Next, they say the U.S. should ""own the escalation ladder"" by getting ready to cut off China via blockades so they ""can threaten to turn an extended conflict into an economic catastrophe for China.""

Finally, they assert that the U.S. needs to define what victory looks like in realistic terms. Given that both sides are nuclear-armed, they predict ""a negotiated compromise"" will be how it eventually ends.

So how would it end?

""The simplest settlement would be a return to the status quo ante: China stops attacking Taiwan in exchange for a pledge that the island would not declare, and America would not endorse, formal independence,"" Brands and Beckley say, suggesting that the U.S. could offer to withdraw forces from Taiwan as an added incentive.

Biden Cabinet member's daughter lobbying Congress on issue her mom has final say on: 'Conflict of interest',"Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's daughter Somah Haaland traveled to Washington, D.C., last week to lobby federal lawmakers to support a moratorium on oil and gas leasing near a historical site in New Mexico.

Somah Haaland – who is a media organizer for the Pueblo Action Alliance, a cultural and environmental group in New Mexico – traveled to Capitol Hill alongside a group of fellow climate activists, according to the environmental group WildEarth Guardians. The activists argued that drilling near the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico would cause irreparable damage to local communities and the environment.

""For over a century, the Greater Chaco region has been under siege by an onslaught of oil and gas drilling, negatively impacting public health, air, water, climate, and cultural resources,"" the WildEarth Guardians said in a release Thursday.

""In recent years, the Bureau of Land Management has skirted updates to its resource management plans, rubberstamping multistage horizontal fracking without ever analyzing the cumulative impacts of this technology,"" it continued.

BIDEN ADMIN SIDES AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS IN CRACKDOWN ON OIL LEASING NEAR INDIGENOUS SITE

The WildEarth Guardians, Somah Haaland's group Pueblo Action Alliance and several other prominent environmental groups formed the Greater Chaco Coalition in recent years to advocate against fossil fuel drilling within a 10-mile radius of the historical site.

In addition to lobbying lawmakers, the activists screened a film narrated by Somah Haaland that ""showcases the threats"" posed by oil and gas leasing in the region,"" according to the WildEarth Guardians. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., attended the screening along with ""agency officials.""

NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES RIP BIDEN ADMIN FOR DOUBLE STANDARD

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a subagency within Secretary Deb Haaland's Department of Interior (DOI) that is tasked with managing nearly 250 million acres of federal lands, is expected to soon finalize a rule acceding to activists' demands. Earlier this month, the agency closed a comment period for its proposal to withdraw 351,500 acres of public lands within 10 miles of the Chaco site for 20 years.

Secretary Deb Haaland, the second Native American to ever serve in a presidential Cabinet as a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, has previously signaled her support for the moratorium, saying it would protect the area's ""rich cultural legacy."" In 2021, she started the Honoring Chaco Initiative, a collective of stakeholders assigned with studying the impacts of continued oil and gas drilling on the land.

""In our comments on the withdrawal, we pointed out the conflict of interest Secretary Haaland already has as a member of a Puebloan nation that is advocating for the 10-mile buffer,"" Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, told Fox News Digital. ""Her daughter actively lobbying for the buffer highlights the conflict of interest and lack of discretion.""

Industry groups like Western Energy Alliance, locals and the Navajo Nation have expressed vehement opposition to the moratorium, arguing it would have a negative financial impact on the region. According to the Navajo Nation, there are currently 53 Indian allotments located in the 10-mile buffer zone that generate $6.2 million per year in royalties for an estimated 5,462 allottees and there are 418 unleased allotments in the zone that are associated with more than 16,000 allottees.

BIDEN ADMIN OFFICIAL HIT WITH ETHICS COMPLAINT FOR ROLE IN FEDERAL OIL LEASING PAUSE

""We're not destroying anything – we are Native Americans ourselves. Nobody is destroying the park,"" Delora Hesuse, a Navajo Nation citizen who owns allotted land in the Greater Chaco region, told Fox News Digital in September. ""The oil companies sure aren't destroying the park. And they have new technology.""

""It just seems like they are listening more to the environmentalist people,"" Hesuse added.

Opponents of the moratorium, including the Navajo Nation Council and Western Energy Alliance, have proposed a compromise proposal that would ban oil and gas leasing within five miles of the site, instead of the 10-mile moratorium backed by climate activists. The DOI, though, has yet to acknowledge the compromise, instead moving forward with the rulemaking process for the 10-mile buffer.

""The department is completely ignoring a compromise solution advanced by the Navajo Nation, whose lands are directly affected by the decision, whereas the Puebloan people are hundreds of miles away,"" Sgamma told Fox News Digital.

""As we stated in our comments, the Interior Department needs to restart the process and consider the compromise solution from the Navajos which balances the cultural interests of the Puebloan peoples while minimizing the economic harm to Navajos actually living in the Chaco area,"" she continued.

""It appears that Secretary Haaland’s interests and kinship ties are clouding her ability to make a reasoned, balanced decision.""

For years, Somah Haaland has been an activist for Indigenous causes. Haaland now works on activist work through artwork and filmmaking, according to a bio page on the Pueblo Action Alliance website.

""Somah’s introduction to grassroots work and organizing began when they became a voter registrar and started working as an intern on various democratic political campaigns when they were in high school,"" the bio states. ""As they began to work with PAA in the summer of 2020, their worldview and understanding of colonialism began to expand.""

Biden says US 'not seeking conflict' with Russia as Putin meeting looms,"President Biden said Wednesday he will tell Russian President Vladimir Putin at an upcoming summit that there will be ""consequences"" if Russia takes harmful action toward democratic governments, but that he is not seeking conflict with Russia.

Biden addressed the state of U.S.-Russia relations amid rising tensions following ransomware attacks that targeted critical infrastructure, including the Colonial Pipeline and a key meat supplier. The president will meet with Putin in Geneva, Switzerland later this month.

""We’re not seeking conflict with Russia,"" Biden said during a speech to military service members stationed in the United Kingdom. ""We want a stable, predictable relationship. Our two nations share incredible responsibilities and among them, ensuring strategic stability and upholding arms control agreements.""

""I take that responsibility seriously, but I’ve been clear – the United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way when the Russian government engages in harmful activities,"" he added.

BIDEN WARNS CLIMATE CHANGE IS ‘GREATEST THREAT’ TO US SECURITY

Biden is expected to press Putin on the recent ransomware attacks, both of which are believed to have been carried out by criminal organizations based in Russia. His administration previously imposed sanctions on Moscow over its role in the SolarWinds hack and efforts to interfere in the 2020 election, among other actions.

The president said he would meet with Putin ""to let him know what I want him to know."" Biden will meet with G7 leaders and NATO allies during his trip to Europe, which marks his first overseas travel since entering the White House.

Biden vows to avoid China conflict as Japan ramps up accusations against Xi Jinping,"President Joe Biden assured Asian leaders that U.S. competition with China would not ""veer into conflict"" Sunday as Japan accused Chinese leader Xi Jinping of infringing on its sovereignty.

Biden is meeting with leaders from across Asia this week while attending the G20 summit in Indonesia. He is schedule to meet in-person with Xi on Wednesday, their first face-to-face conversation since Biden gained office. Tensions between China and the U.S. and its allies have risen in recent years, with the eastern power growing increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan and Japan.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida accused China of ""continuously and increasingly"" infringing on its sovereignty on Sunday, according to Reuters.

Chinese fishing and naval vessels have frequently ventured into Japanese waters in recent months.

They will also address how to ""responsibly manage competition"" and will ""work together where our interests align,"" particularly on geopolitical challenges that effect the global community.

U.S.-China tension are at their worst regarding Taiwan, which China has repeatedly threatened to take by force. Taiwan split from mainland China in 1949 after Democratic forces lost a civil war to the Chinese Communist Party and fled to the island.

Chinese ambassador warns of ‘military conflict’ with US over Taiwan,"The Chinese ambassador to the United States this week gave another hawkish warning about growing tensions over Taiwan -- predicting a ""military conflict"" if Taiwan kept moving toward independence.

""If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict."" Qin Gang said in an interview with NPR.

CHINA CLAIMS US WILL PAY ‘UNBEARABLE COST’ FOR AIDING TAIWAN

As the U.S. focuses its attention on the growing crisis in Ukraine, where more than 100,000 Russian troops have gathered at the border, China has been increasingly aggressive toward the independent territory that it believes should belong to Beijing.

China launched 39 aircraft, mostly fighter jets, near Taiwan Sunday — the largest show of force in months. The launch came the same day the U.S. Navy sailed two aircraft carriers along with a pair of amphibious assault ships alongside allies in the Philippine Sea.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in January accused the Taiwanese government of being responsible for tensions in the region, and alleged that the U.S. ""has gone back on its commitment made when it established diplomatic relations with China, condoned and abetted ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, and tried to distort and hollow out the one-China principle.""

""This will put Taiwan into an extremely precarious situation and bring an unbearable cost to the U.S. itself,"" he said.

CHINA FLIES DOZENS OF WARPLANES NEAR TAIWAN

Taiwan and China split in 1949 and China has been increasing pressure on the self-ruled nation, while opposing its involvement in international organizations. The U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan, but maintains an unofficial alliance.

President Biden was asked in October whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack to which Biden said affirmatively that ""We have a commitment to do that."" After Biden’s remarks, the White House soon clarified the comment, and said the president was not abandoning the longstanding U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity.

In the NPR interview this week, Qin described Taiwan as the ""biggest tinderbox."" He claimed that China had no desire for war, but also did not rule it out.

Durbin's Catholic faith is a 'conflict of interest' for holding Supreme Court accountable: pro-choice group,"The Roman Catholic faith of Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., presents a ""conflict of interest"" with his duty to hold the Supreme Court accountable as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the pro-choice activist group Ruth Sent Us, which appeared to threaten protests outside Durbin's houses.

The Senate Judiciary Committee announced Friday that Durbin is ""pressing the CEOs of Discord and Twitch about the role the platforms play in disseminating hatred and extremist content—and what they’re doing in response"" in the wake of the Buffalo shooting.

Ruth Sent Us, which has become notorious for organizing protests at the homes of Supreme Court justices in the wake of the leaked draft opinion striking down the key abortion precedent Roe v. Wade, urged Durbin to ""clean up SCOTUS first.""

""Announce televised hearings into the traitors and sexual assaulters on the Court,"" the organization posted on Twitter, listing Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito (author of the draft opinion), and Brett Kavanaugh. ""Watch your power grow.""

SAN FRANCISCO ARCHBISHOP BARS PELOSI FROM RECEIVING HOLY COMMUNION DUE TO ABORTION SUPPORT

Ruth Sent Us also appeared to threaten protests at Durbin's houses. ""We’re going to start protests at your homes to make sure you hear our message,"" the group added Friday.

Ruth Sent Us added another reply Sunday, criticizing Durbin for his faith.

""Durbin, there is a conflict of interest between your Catholic faith and your role as Chair of [the Senate Judiciary Committee], with sole discretion to hold hearings into corrupt Catholic Justices,"" the activist group wrote. ""We demand answers. Catholic [Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.], speak up as well.""

Ruth Sent Us shared a link to a Feb. 2018 article reporting that Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of the Roman Catholic diocese of Springfield, Illinois, decided to uphold a 2004 decision to deny Durbin Holy Communion over his abortion votes, particularly his vote against the Pain-Capable Unborn Children's Protection Act in 2018.

The pro-choice group's tweet comes amid renewed debate about Catholic leaders denying Holy Communion to pro-choice politicians.

GARLAND ALLOWING ‘MOB RULE’ IN US BY NOT PROSECUTING DEMONSTRATORS AT JUSTICES HOMES, REPUBLICANS SAY

San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone announced Friday that he would bar House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from receiving Holy Communion due to her stance on abortion.

""A Catholic legislator who supports procured abortion, after knowing the teaching of the Church, commits a manifestly grave sin which is a cause of most serious scandal to others,"" Cordileone wrote in a letter to Pelosi. ""Therefore, universal Church law provides that such persons ‘are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.'""

The San Francisco Examiner's editorial board urged Pope Francis to remove Cordileone for this.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church is unambiguous on the question of abortion, both in procuring one and assisting in the practice: ""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.""

""Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,"" the catechism says, calling abortion and infanticide ""abominable crimes.""

SUPREME COURT LEAK CONFIRMS RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S PRESCIENT WARNING ABOUT ROE V. WADE

It also declares, ""Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life.""

Democrats have full-throatedly supported abortion following the leak of Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization – the draft that overturns Roe. Although Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed that the draft is genuine, it dates back to February, and it does not represent the current or final opinion of the Court.

Although Ruth Sent Us has tagged its protests with the message ""SCOTUS6,"" Politico's sources inside the Court claim that only five justices – Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, Niel Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Thomas – would overturn Roe. Roberts would support the Mississippi law at issue in case. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Stephen Breyer (who is retiring at the end of the term) will reportedly dissent.

In the wake of the historic leak, pro-choice protesters have repeatedly targeted the homes of Supreme Court justices, after Ruth Sent Us called for such protests.

Activists targeted Roman Catholic churches for protests on Mother's Day, and Ruth Sent Us promoted such protests.

Vandals also targeted a church in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this month, spray-painting ""bans off our bodies"" and ""my body my choice"" on the building.

Protesters have also picketed the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has a 100% rating with the pro-choice activist group NARAL Pro-Choice America. Durbin, who may face a similar protest, has an 88% rating with NARAL. Leahy, whom Ruth Sent Us also targeted, has a 100% rating.

Gabbard’s tweet came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine early Thursday morning and videos and photos surfaced on social media purportedly showing the reality of war in Europe. As the sun rose, sirens sounded near Kyiv as the Ukrainian president declared martial law across the country.

In the lead-up to the invasion, Putin expressed several grievances with Ukraine and the United States, including the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, which the United States has not taken off the table despite requests from Russia to do so.

President Biden condemned Putin after the country carried out military operations in Ukraine.

""The world will hold Russia accountable,"" Biden said in a pair of tweets Wednesday, moments after Russia carried out the military action.

""President Putin’s actions demand a firm response. That’s why we’re imposing full blocking sanctions on VEB and Russia’s military bank, cutting off Russia from western financing, imposing sanctions on elites, and more,"" Biden added in another tweet. ""We will continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates.""

"Henry Kissinger warns against escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, urges peace talks","Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said this week that negotiations must get underway soon to end Russia's Ukraine war, in order to avoid ""a war against Russia itself.""

""In my view, a movement towards negotiations on peace needs to begin in the next two months or so. The outcome of the war should be outlined by them before it creates upheavals and tensions that will be even harder to overcome, particularly between the eventual relationship of Russia towards Europe and of Ukraine towards Europe,"" Kissinger, 98, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,

""Ideally, the dividing line should return to the status quo ante. I believe pursuing the war beyond that point could turn it into a war not about the freedom of Ukraine, which has been undertaken with great cohesion by NATO, but into a war against Russia itself, and so this seems to me to be the dividing line, that it is just impossible to define... It will be difficult.""

NATO and its allies have struggled to put forward a cohesive or unified front, with nations such as Italy and Hungary failing to crack down on Russian imports or separate themselves from Russian energy.

"Impeachment witness urges Burisma probe, testifies to concern of Hunter Biden ‘conflict’","State Department official George Kent testified Wednesday that he would “love” to see Ukraine look into the circumstances surrounding the closure of a probe tied to natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, while also raising concerns that Hunter Biden’s role on the board of that firm created the appearance of a conflict of interest.

During questioning by GOP counsel Steve Castor at the first public hearing of the House impeachment inquiry, Kent was asked about the Ukrainian investigation into Burisma Holdings and why it was closed.

IMPEACHMENT HEARING TESTIMONY DETAILS TRUMP PURSUIT OF UKRAINE 'INVESTIGATIONS,' AS GOP DECRIES 'SHAM' PROBE

Kent testified that it was his and other officials’ “strong assumption” that the founder of the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, had stolen money, and that a prosecutor had taken “a bribe to close the case.”

Castor asked Kent whether he was in favor of that matter “being fully investigated and prosecuted.”

“I think since U.S. taxpayer dollars are wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid,” Kent answered.

Kent, though, was not saying he wanted an investigation into Burisma over Hunter Biden’s role, and testified that he did not witness any U.S. officials working to protect that firm from criticism or investigations.

The Biden family's actions in Ukraine, along with a separate issue connected to 2016 election interference, were at the core of what Trump wanted investigated out of Kiev. Trump's now-famous July phone call – in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch the investigations – prompted a whistleblower complaint and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

To that backdrop, Hunter Biden's actions occasionally were discussed in Wednesday's opening hearing, though not at length.

In Ukraine, meanwhile, the Burisma investigation isn't entirely closed. Last month, Ukraine’s current prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said at a news conference that his office was instructed to review cases that have been closed to make sure they were fairly and thoroughly handled — including the probe into Burisma. That announcement did not mean that Ukraine was opening a new investigation into Burisma or the Bidens.

UKRAINE TOP PROSECUTOR SAYS BIDEN-LINKED BURISMA CASE WILL BE REVIEWED

Kent told congressional investigators last month during his closed-door deposition that he had repeatedly raised concerns with the Obama administration about Burisma, and also discussed the administration’s efforts to remove Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin from his post. At the time, Shokin was investigating Zlochevsky.

Shokin was fired in April 2016 and the case was closed by the prosecutor who replaced him, Yuriy Lutsenko. Joe Biden once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin.

Biden allies, though, maintain that his intervention had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns.

At the time, as vice president to former President Obama, Biden was running U.S.-Ukraine policy, and anti-corruption campaigns.

Kent also said Wednesday that the vice president’s role in Ukraine was “critically important” and was “the top cover to help us pursue our policy agenda.”

Kent said that he raised concerns with the former vice president's office in 2015 that Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma could present “the possibility of the perception of a conflict of interest.”

U.S. top diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor also testified on Wednesday and said for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about “the investigations,” to which Sondland responded that “the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.”

Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine.

“Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,” Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. “At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.”

This conversation would have taken place a day after the phone call between Trump and Zelensky. Taylor made clear it was his understanding the term ""investigations"" indeed referred to the Biden family and Burisma.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-witness-urges-burisma-probe-testifies-to-concern-of-hunter-biden-conflict,N/A
"Israel-Palestinian conflict: White House defends not publicly calling for cease-fire, says approach is 'quiet'","The White House on Monday defended not publicly calling for a cease-fire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying the Biden administration’s approach to reducing violence in the region is through ""quiet, intensive diplomacy.""

Over the weekend, President Biden conveyed ""the need for Hamas to cease firing rockets into Israel and affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorist attacks,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during the press briefing Monday, noting that Hamas has fired ""more than 3,000 rockets"" into Israel amid the ongoing conflict.

LIVE UPDATES: ISRAELI MILITARY TARGETS HOME OF GAZA'S TOP HAMAS LEADER

""Our focus, our goal, every single action we take, every statement we make, is with the objective of reducing violence and bringing an end to conflict on the ground,"" Psaki said.

""The prism we are making all our decisions through is how we can help to bring an end to violence and de-escalate the situation on the ground, and our calculation, at this point, is having those conversations behind the scenes, weighing in with our important strategic partnership we have with Israel and other countries in the region is the most constructive approach we can take,"" Psaki said.

She added: ""Our approach is through quiet, intensive diplomacy and that is where we feel we can be most effective.""

The White House also maintained that ""the only way"" to bring an end to the violence ""is for there to be a two-state solution over time.""

""We share a view that a two-state solution is the only way to bring a lasting end to the violence,"" Psaki said, while noting it is unclear, at this point, who in the administration would broker those negotiations.

The White House’s comments comes amid the worst violence between Israel and the Palestinians since the devastating 2014 war in Gaza.

ISRAELI STRIKES KILL 26, TOPPLE BUILDINGS IN GAZA CITY

Hamas , the Palestinian militant group, has launched a sustained rocket campaign targeting civilian areas in Israel; in response, Israel directed heavy artillery and airstrikes into Gaza, killing at least 180 people, including 55 children and 33 women. Over 1,200 people have been wounded. Eight people in Israel have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.

Biden has condemned the violence and asserted Israel's right to defend itself.

Meanwhile, a source confirmed to Fox News that the Biden administration has approved a $735 million weapons sale to Israel. The administration sent a formal notice of the sale to Congress on May 5 – nearly a week before Hamas began launching massive rocket attacks into Israel.

But progressive Democratic lawmakers are demanding that the Biden administration take a tougher stance against Israel.

""I think the administration needs to push harder on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to stop the violence, bring about a cease-fire, end these hostilities, and get back to a process of trying to resolve this long-standing conflict,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told CBS’s ""Face the Nation.""

Biden has condemned the violence and asserted Israel's right to defend itself, eliciting a swift backlash from some members of his own party who wanted the president to address what they viewed as human rights violations by Israeli forces in Gaza.

""This is happening with the support of the United States,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said on Saturday, tweeting a video of Israel bombing, and destroying, a building that housed media organizations\, including Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. (Israel contended the buildings contained Hamas cells.)

""I don’t care how any spokesperson tries to spin this,"" the New York firebrand continued. ""The U.S. vetoed the U.N. call for ceasefire. If the Biden admin can’t stand up to an ally, who can it stand up to? How can they credibly claim to stand for human rights?""

DEMOCRATS TAKE TOUGHER STANCE AGAINST ISRAEL AS CONFLICT ESCALATES

Ocasio-Cortez is among the activist lawmakers pushing the U.S. to condition the billions in aid it provides to Israel.

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., suggested on the House floor last week that the U.S. should consider conditioning aid to the country ""if our budgets are a statement of our values, what do we value? Whose lives do we value?""

At the same time, more than two dozen House Democrats sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling on him to use diplomatic pressure to prevent the displacement of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, according to The Wall Street Journal. Ocasio-Cortez, one of the letter's signatories, questioned U.S. aid to the Jewish state.

""The United States needs to take responsibility for the violence that we are supporting,"" she told the Journal on Friday. ""We can’t advance this idea that we’re some neutral party in this situation if our actions are consistently targeting Palestinians.""

And in a New York Times op-ed on Friday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., similarly urged the White House to speak out against the Israeli government's actions, arguing that U.S. involvement is vital to de-escalation.

Israeli ambassador condemns UN commission for 'one-sided' report on Palestinian conflict,"A UN Human Rights Council commission of inquiry presented a report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Thursday that Israel and its allies said was one-sided and failed to advance peace in the region.

The commission's chair Navi Pillay, at the opening of a UN meeting discussing her report, said that she was examining ""the root causes"" of the ""protracted conflict spanning three quarters of a century,"" a reference to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. She then, however, said that one root cause was Israel's continued presence in the West Bank, which only began in 1967.

""After 55 years Israel is treating the occupation as a permanent fixture,"" Pillay said, asserting that Israel has engaged in a ""de facto annexation"" of the Palestinian territories.

In response to Pillay and her commission's report, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan noted that the commission only blamed Israel for the situation, ignoring Palestinian violence.

NETANYAHU RIPS AUSTRALIA FOR ‘ABSURD’ DECISION ON ISRAELI CAPITAL: ‘DENYING HISTORY IS DENYING REALITY’

""The Commission of Inquiry report being presented is a one-sided, terror white-washing, and morally bankrupt document that does nothing – nothing – remotely productive for the Palestinians or the region,"" Erdan said. ""In fact, it only makes matters worse. It shows that terrorists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the true oppressors of the Palestinian people, that terror pays off.""

Erdan added: ""Their report deliberately omits any mention of Hamas or their thousands of indiscriminately fired rockets, while exclusively placing all the blame for every aspect of the conflict on the law-abiding, liberal democracy of Israel.""

Accompanying Erdan to the meeting were the parents of 5-year-old Ido Avigal, who was killed when a Hamas rocket hit his family's home in Israel.

""Can you look into the eyes of Ido’s parents and explain to them why you deliberately ignored their son’s murder?"" Erdan asked. ""How can you be so heartless? How?""

ISRAEL ANNOUNCES MARITIME BORDER DEAL WITH LEBANON

Erdan referred to the commission's work as an ""inquisition"" and called the commission and the Human Rights Council a ""mockery."" He said that the only reason why Pillay was chosen to lead the commission was that she had previously demonized Israel as an ""apartheid"" state.

""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" he shouted at the council.

Prior to the meeting, Erdan addressed the media and noted the commission is an example of the council's disproportionate focus on Israel. He noted that 30% of the council’s commissions of inquiry target Israel, and they have condemned Israel more than they have condemned Syria, Iran, and North Korea combined.

""It’s clear that the council has an obsession – an obsession – with Israel,"" he said.

This sentiment was echoed by several other countries after Pillay gave her presentation. Hungary, Germany, Australia, Canada, and the United States were among those who spoke out against the council's disproportionate focus on Israel. The U.S. said the commission's report ""does nothing to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" a sentiment also expressed by the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, who described the report as one-sided.

The Palestinian delegation, however, thanked Pillay for a ""factual and law-based report"" and called her ""a champion of human rights."" Among the countries that also supported the commission and its report was Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, and Iran.

Several countries mainly took issue with the broad scope of the commission. The European Union, Albania, and Uruguay were among those who said they did not support the creation of the commission for that reason.

Following the comments from the various member states, Pillay had the floor again. She denied being antisemitic, saying she is 81 years old and had never been called that before. She also sympathized with the Avigal family and said the commission and its members ""unequivocally condemn any acts of violence.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/israeli-ambassador-condemns-un-commission-one-sided-report-palestinian-conflict,N/A
"Ivanka's West Wing office is Trump's latest conflict of interest, ethics experts say","Ethics experts say the decision to give Ivanka Trump a West Wing office raises yet another conflict-of-interest issue for the family.

The White House told Fox News on Tuesday that while Ivanka will be given an office in the West Wing, she will have neither an official title nor government salary. But despite these conditions, ethics attorneys in both the Bush and Obama administrations say Ivanka is a government employee.

“Even though the White House denies it, Ivanka is for these and other reasons a ‘special government employee’,” Ambassador Norm Eisen, former White House Ethics Counsel under President Obama, said. “So we are headed for yet another Trump ethics dispute in a White House and administration that is already chock full of them.”

Richard Painter, former White House ethics counsel for George W. Bush, agreed.

“It is very important for the White House to acknowledge she is an employee and not play games,” Painter told Fox News. “They have given her an office. I’m assuming they will give her the devices — which she needs, because the last thing we need is to be playing ‘Hillary games’ on a private server. She’s going to get security clearance -- she is a government employee.”

Painter said that in the Bush White House, he was responsible for giving ethics briefings to those who were not given an official title or salary, and that the administration acknowledged such people were, in fact, working for the government.

“You don’t need to be full time or have a salary to be considered a government employee,” Painter said.

Eisen said that, despite these conditions confirmed by the White House, Ivanka Trump is subject by law to ethics rules, and not voluntarily subject to them as she and the administration have claimed.

“Why not head it off by going all the way now, and fully submitting to ethics rules rather than the half-measures that have been laid out, however positive their direction?” Eisen said.

At issue, yet again for the Trump family, is an anti-nepotism measure enacted in 1967 after Pres. John F. Kennedy famously appointed his brother, Robert Kennedy, as U.S. attorney general. The statute states a “public official,” including the president, “may not appoint, employ, promote, advance or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving over or which he exercises jurisdiction.”

The Trump team has said since the election that they feel that the law is for government “agencies,” not the White House. The administration has since employed Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, to be a senior adviser to Trump.

Trump is not the first to contend with anti-nepotism laws—a recent example, was in 1993 when President Bill Clinton appointed then-first lady Hillary Clinton as chairwoman of the president’s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. A court doubted that Congress intended to include the White House and the Executive Office of the President as agencies under federal anti-nepotism law, and upheld Mrs. Clinton’s appointment to the unpaid position.

“Ivanka has a lot of wiggle room to play around in policy. She may have more of a Hillary Clinton first lady role than that of Laura Bush,” Painter said. “But the bottom line is that if Ivanka does work outside of the social realm and moves into policy, she becomes an employee.”

Painter stressed that so long as Ivanka stays away from policies involving trade with the countries she imports clothes in and out of, he didn’t expect an ethical dilemma.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ivankas-west-wing-office-is-trumps-latest-conflict-of-interest-ethics-experts-say,N/A
Jobs Panel Member Whose Solar Firm Won Loan Guarantees Raises 'Conflict of Interest' Concerns,"A clean-energy firm led by a member of President Obama's jobs council has a stake in projects that have reaped nearly $2 billion in loan guarantees from Washington, a case that has raised conflict-of-interest concerns as the same jobs council pushes for more ""government-backed"" investment in renewable energy.

The company, NextEra Energy, secured a loan guarantee in August for a solar project in California. An affiliate has taken over another California project that won a separate guarantee in September. The firm is no lightweight -- NextEra Energy Resources, the subsidiary working on both solar projects, is the biggest producer of wind and solar energy on the continent.

But the company also enjoys a connection to the Obama administration -- company Chairman and CEO Lewis Hay sits on the president's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, which last month issued a report calling, among other things, for a new federal financing program to attract private investment for clean energy projects via loan guarantees and other tools.

To the backdrop of the uproar in Washington over the $535 million loan guarantee to now-bankrupt solar firm Solyndra and a $43 million guarantee to another firm called Beacon Power Corporation also filing for bankruptcy, some are raising concerns about the role of members like Hay on the jobs council.

Unlike Solyndra, NextEra is turning a profit. Its second-quarter report showed net earnings of $580 million, better than in the second quarter of 2010. Third-quarter earnings for the company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will be announced Friday. The concern with NextEra centers more on Hay's work on the jobs council than the loan itself.

""A person who receives a loan of over $2 billion for his private company certainly would not be an independent voice in whether or not energy loans are wise investments for the taxpayer,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told FoxNews.com. ""He is in a position that he couldn't possibly be objective.""

The conservative National Center for Public Policy Research described the jobs council's recommendations as a case of ""self-dealing."" Tom Borelli, director of the group's Free Enterprise Project, said Hay and other members with a stake in the industry should recuse themselves from drafting guidelines that would benefit that sector -- a point Sessions echoed.

""It's crony capitalism,"" Borelli said. ""In a jobs panel, it's a clear conflict of interest.""

He said members of the jobs council whose companies bet big on green energy are now feeding the president recommendations to support those bets. He also raised questions about council Chairman Jeffrey Immelt's involvement, considering his company GE has heavily invested in the clean energy sector -- it also shares a stake in one project with NextEra.

Borelli's group receives some funding from the Exxon Mobil Corporation -- though so do an array of prominent think tanks, ranging from the Brookings Institution to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group is a persistent critic of President Obama's environmental policies.

Asked about NextEra, the Energy Department noted that the White House jobs council ""has no role in evaluating any loan applicants."" That job falls to career officials at the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office.

Without discussing the recommendations made by the jobs council itself, the department defended the loan guarantees awarded to NextEra.

""Decisions are made on the merits of the project after extensive due diligence by the career officials in the DOE loan office. These projects were carefully reviewed and analyzed by officials in the loan program and were approved because they will create jobs while helping America win the clean energy race. Together these two projects are expected to support more than 1,400 jobs. Since utilities have already agreed to buy clean electricity from these new power plants for many years to come, there is a revenue stream in place to repay the loan,"" the department said in a statement.

Requests for comment from NextEra were not returned. Hay earns nearly $10 million in total compensation from NextEra, according to Forbes estimates.

Though the National Center for Public Policy Research accused the jobs council of crony capitalism, in the case of Hay it's unclear where the quid pro quo would lie.

Hay, appointed to the jobs council in February 2011, is a prolific contributor to mostly Republican candidates. Recipients of his largesse include Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Marco Rubio of Florida and the political action committee run by House Republican Leader Eric Cantor. He contributed to Sen. John McCain's campaign in 2008, not Obama's.

Still, Borelli claimed the jobs council is skewed to favor clean-energy investment recommendations.

In the jobs council's latest October report, the group called for more federal involvement to help renewable energy firms compete with their counterparts in places like China and the United Kingdom.

""Without bold action, the United States risks falling behind its international competitors in the clean energy industry,"" the report reads. Noting credit is tight, the group said ""federal financing incentives"" can help attract private investment and called for a new institution to do just that.

The council estimated that a new program leveraging federal resources to attract private investment for clean energy could spur the creation of more than 100,000 jobs.

Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, said Hay's involvement on the jobs council represents an ""obvious conflict of interest.""

Mitchell said any top-level jobs council would be expected to draw its membership from a variety of different sectors with a variety of different interests. But he said any representative who stands to gain from certain recommendations to the president should recuse himself.

""It definitely doesn't pass the smell test,"" Mitchell said.

Many sectors are represented on the council, and Hay is not the only one whose company could be affected by government action on the economy -- making potential conflicts in some cases difficult to avoid, considering the council's broad mandate to help spur job creation. The council includes Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly, whose sector is facing proposed increases in passenger security fees as part of Obama's deficit-reduction plan, and Jim McNerney, CEO of The Boeing Company, which does extensive business with the federal government. The company is also locked in a union dispute before the National Labor Relations Board over a proposed plant in South Carolina.

Asked for comment, the Republican lawmaker leading the congressional probe into the Solyndra deal would not address the case of NextEra specifically, saying only that his investigation would cover all companies under the loan program.

""Until the start of this year, no oversight had ever been conducted on the DOE loan guarantee program and this investigation is looking into all of the companies that received these guarantees,"" Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said in a written statement.

Sessions said he's concerned the administration is losing sight of its responsibility to manage the taxpayers' money carefully.

The specific NextEra projects that received partial guarantees were the Genesis Solar and Desert Sunlight solar plants in Riverside County, Calif.

The first received a partial guarantee of $852 million, with the government's share about $682 million. The project is projected to create 800 construction jobs and 47 permanent jobs, while producing enough electricity for more than 48,000 homes, according to the Department of Energy. It is sponsored by NextEra Energy Resources.

The Desert Sunlight project received a $1.46 billion partial guarantee, with the government's share about $1.17 billion. The project is backed in part by the government, though the loans themselves are coming from private investors.

That operation is tied to the projected creation of 550 construction jobs and 15 permanent jobs. According to the Department of Energy, it will be one of the biggest solar photovoltaic plants in the world, and will help power more than 110,000 homes. The loan guarantee for Desert Sunlight was finalized one day before solar company First Solar announced the sale of the project to affiliates of NextEra Energy Resources and GE Energy Financial Services. A NextEra affiliate will manage the project.

NextEra Energy Resources is a major subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. Hay is chairman of both.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jobs-panel-member-whose-solar-firm-won-loan-guarantees-raises-conflict-of-interest-concerns,N/A
"Moscow looks to sever Minsk agreements as Russia, Ukraine conflict persists","The State Department on Wednesday warned against any move by the Kremlin to sever its commitment to the Minsk agreements as it looks to recognize two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as ""independent.""

The Russian State Duma – the lower chamber in the Russian parliament – voted Tuesday to send President Vladimir Putin an appeal to recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

NATO CHIEF CONTRADICTS RUSSIA WITHDRAWAL CLAIMS, SAYS NO PROOF OF PULLING BACK

Located in the Donbas region, in Ukraine’s most eastern front, the breakaway republics have been engaged in armed conflict with the Ukrainian army since 2014.

Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine signed a ceasefire agreement in 2014.

An additional agreement signed in 2015 in Minsk by Russia, Ukraine, leaders from the separatist groups and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reinforced the ceasefire and called for a series of steps to end the conflict.

Ukraine has long argued that Russia has not upheld its end of the bargain by withdrawing all its troops from the region – though Moscow denies there are any forces to withdraw, according to reporting by Reuters.

The State Department has maintained that Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and continues to control armed forces in Donbas.

""To be clear: Kremlin approval of this appeal would amount to the Russian government’s wholesale rejection of its commitments under the Minsk agreements,"" the State Department said Wednesday. ""Enactment of this resolution would further undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, constitute a gross violation of international law, call into further question Russia’s stated commitment to continue to engage in diplomacy to achieve a peaceful resolution of this crisis.""

The move by the Russian government comes as tensions in Eastern Europe remain heightened after months of military movement and the buildup of roughly 150,000 Russian troops near Ukraine’s border.

Russia has additionally deployed 30,000 troops to its allied neighbor Belarus.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: NATO LEADER SAYS 'WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN FORCES': LIVE UPDATES

Despite its aggressive military buildup, the Kremlin has maintained it has no intention of invading Ukraine and on Tuesday it claimed it will be partially drawing down its military forces.

NATO and U.S. officials said they were cautiously optimistic at the news but NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the alliance had seen no evidence Russia has taken steps to withdraw troops.

Ukrainian officials last week launched the risk reduction mechanism under the Vienna Document and called on Putin to provide detailed information regarding its military activities along Ukraine’s borders.

Russia has yet to respond to the demands from Ukraine, nor has it returned NATO’s written responses issued in answer to Russia’s expressed security concerns.

""We keep demanding transparency from Russia which refused to attend yesterday’s meeting under the Vienna Document,"" Minister of Foreign Affairs for Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, said Wednesday.

"Pentagon: Russia buildup on Ukraine border is largest since Cold War, conflict would be 'horrific'","Top Pentagon officials on Friday said the build-up of Russian troops along Ukraine's border is the largest since the Cold War, warning that conflict in Eastern Europe would be ""horrific,"" but stressed that it is ""not inevitable,"" maintaining that there is ""still time and space for diplomacy,"" as the Kremlin continues to threaten further incursion in Ukraine.

During a briefing Friday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin explained that Russia has been deploying forces to Crimea and along Ukraine’s border for months, and has ""progressed at a consistent and steady pace"" involving tens of thousands of Russian troops.

US HANDS RUSSIA WRITTEN RESPONSE TO DEMANDS, SAYS UP TO KREMLIN HOW TO PROCEED

Austin, though, said the United States does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine.""

""He clearly now has that capability and there are multiple options available to him, including the seizure of cities and significant territories, but also coercive acts of provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories,"" Austin explained, acknowledging that the United States is focused on Russian disinformation, including the ""potential creation of pretext for further invasion or strikes on Donbas.""

""Any Russian attack or further incursion into Ukraine would not only ignite conflict, it would also violate the bedrock principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination,"" he said, noting that the United States is taking this ""very seriously, both as a strong partner of Ukraine and as one of 30 members of NATO who are unified in opposition to Russia’s attempts to undermine those core values and threaten peace and security in Europe.""

AUSTIN: ‘STILL TIME AND SPACE FOR DIPLOMACY': LIVE UPDATES

Austin said, at this point, ""conflict is not inevitable.""

""There is still time and space for diplomacy,"" he said. ""The United States, in lockstep with our allies and partners, has offered Russia a path away from crisis and toward greater security.""

Austin said the Department of Defense will ""continue to support"" diplomatic efforts, and maintained that the U.S. ""remains committed to helping Ukraine defend itself through security assistance material.""

Austin said that since 2014, the United States has committed more than $2.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, noting that President Biden, in December authorized an additional $200 million in assistance, which included javelins and other weapons and equipment.

""The United States will stand should to shoulder with our NATO allies and that includes reinforcing security on NATO’s eastern flank,"" Austin said.

Earlier this week, Austin placed 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened preparedness for deployment to the region.

""We placed thousands of U.S. troops on prepare to deploy orders earlier this week, and if NATO activated its response forces, these troops will be ready to go,"" Austin said Friday.

PUTIN'S UKRAINE AGGRESSION IS A ‘RED MEAT’ DISTRACTION FOR THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN SAYS

Austin acknowledged that the situation on Ukraine’s borders is ""changing rapidly,"" but said Biden administration officials will continue to present the president with options to ""defend our national security interest in response to Russian actions.""

""An attack against one NATO member is an attack against us all,"" Austin said. ""And as President Biden has said, the United States holds this as a acred obligation and we will do right by that commitment.""

Austin added that Putin ""can do the right thing as well.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS: MOSCOW'S TOP DIPLOMAT SAYS 'WE DON'T WANT WARS': LIVE UPDATES

""There is no reason that this situation has to evolve into conflict. He can choose to deescalate. He can order his troops away. He can choose dialogue and diplomacy,"" Austin said. ""Whatever he decides, the United States will stand with our allies and partners.""

Meanwhile, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley addressed the situation should Russia choose to invade Ukraine, explaining that ""it will not be cost free in terms of casualties or other significant effects.""

""There is a small contingent of U.S. and NATO advisors and trainers currently in Ukraine,"" Milley explained, adding that the U.S. ""has zero offensive combat weapon systems nor any permanent forces or bases in Ukraine.""

""Our role is limited and that we help train, advise and assist with tactics, techniques and procedures,"" Milley said. ""We participate in institutional development of the Ukrainian ministry of defense.""

""The president and the secretary of Defense have authorized the United States military to increase our readiness in the event we have to reinforce or assist our NATO allies,"" Milley continued.

He added: ""War is not inevitable, as the secretary said, the right answer here is a diplomatic solution.""

But Milley did set the scene, telling reporters Friday that ""given the type of forces that are arrayed, the ground maneuver forces, the artillery, the ballistic missiles, the air forces, all of it packaged together, if that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant. Very significant.""

""And it would result in a significant amount of casualties,"" he stressed. ""And you can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on. And so it would be horrific. It would be terrible and it's not necessary.""

Milley did warn, though, that there is ""a potential"" that Russia ""could launch on very, very little warning.""

""That's possible, and there's a wide scale of options that are available to Russian leadership, and the best option they should pick, in my view, is a diplomatic solution to resolve whatever differences they have,"" Milley said.

But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey. Lavrov told Russia radio stations Friday that ""we don’t want wars,"" despite amassing more than 125,000 troops along Ukraine’s border.

""If it depends on Russia , then there will be no war. We don't want wars. But we also won't allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,"" Lavrov said, according to Reuters.

SIX US FIGHTER JETS ARRIVE IN ESTONIA AMID UKRAINE-RUSSIA TENSIONS

Lavrov reportedly added that he expects to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the coming weeks, one day after saying that the U.S. and NATO’s responses to its security demands in relation to Ukraine offer ""little ground for optimism.""

Meanwhile, the State Department on Thursday unequivocally warned that if Russia invades Ukraine the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will sit unused at the bottom of the ocean. The controversial pipeline has become the U.S. and NATO’s biggest bargaining chip in its attempts to preserve Kyiv’s sovereignty.

And earlier this week, Biden administration officials told Fox News that they are also preparing ""severe"" sanctions against Russia should it invade Ukraine, which would have an ""immediate and visible effect on the day they are implemented.""

""That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time, we will start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there,"" a senior administration official said. ""We've made efforts to signal this intention very clearly, and I would say, a deepening selloff in Russian markets, its borrowing costs, the value of its currency market, imply default risk, reflect the severity of the economy consequences we can and will impose on the Russian economy in the event of a further invasion.""

Republicans demand probe of potential White House staff conflicts related to student loan debt plan,"EXCLUSIVE: Top House Republicans are demanding an ethics investigation into the White House's proposed student loan forgiveness plan, which they say is an illegal ""unjust wealth transfer"" from hardworking Americans and also a conflict of interest for Biden administration political appointees working on the policy.

The White House's most recent proposal would forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers with a household yearly income below $300,000.

In a letter to the director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics Emory Rounds Wednesday, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., and House Committee on Education and Labor Republican Leader Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., take issue with the policy.

""This policy is an unjust wealth transfer from hardworking Americans to highly educated upper-middle-class graduates who borrowed from taxpayers to earn their degree, and, in some cases, multiple degrees,"" the lawmakers write.

""In addition to the substantial and negative ramifications of this illegal action, we are especially concerned that this policy may have been promulgated by White House staffers who stand to financially benefit from the decision, especially considering recent reports that White House political appointees owe millions in student loan debt. Public officials should never use their office to unjustly enrich themselves, and such behavior would directly violate the Ethics Pledge that President Biden implemented for all political appointees,"" they continue.

STUDENT LOAN REFINANCE RATES FREEFALL FOR 5-YEAR VARIABLE-RATE LOANS

Comer and Foxx ask Rounds for assistance in determining whether White House staffers have a conflict of interest or if their families could benefit from Biden's policy that they are currently working to enact.

""Presumably, political appointees with outstanding student loans are included in the reported student loan forgiveness scheme the Biden administration is planning to undertake, thereby raising concerns of whether appointees with conflicts of interest pushed student loan forgiveness to receive a financial windfall,"" they write.

The Republicans cite a recent report that found that one in five White House staffers who filled out a financial disclosure form have student loans that are still being paid off. The total for the group amounts to nearly $4.7 million in unpaid loans. That number is likely to be higher since junior staff or appointees below a certain pay level are not required to disclose their financials, the lawmakers point out.

""Public officials should not be responsible for crafting policies from which they stand to financially benefit,"" the letter states.

BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PLAN: EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO FAR

Foxx and Comer state that this ""gross abuse of power"" by employees would also ""explicitly violate President Biden's Ethics Pledge.""

They ask the director of government ethics to provide to them a list of all Biden administration employees who have worked on the student loan forgiveness policy and all documents and communications that would reveal whether those staffers have worked on pushing the policy.

In addition, they demand signed copies of all ethics pledges from those individuals and any ethics waivers that may have been given to the staff working on the policy.

The Department of Education recently announced it would cancel $5.8 billion in full loan discharges for 560,000 borrowers who attended a campus owned or operated by Corinthian Colleges, amounting to the ""largest single loan discharge"" in department history.

That number adds to an already robust $25 billion in student loan relief under Biden. About 43 million federal borrowers still owe a total of $1.6 trillion in college debt, according to the Education Data Initiative.

Republicans accuse Dem election lawyer of 'serious conflict of interest' in case to reverse Iowa House race,"EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans are raising ""serious"" ethical concerns in the contentious effort to overturn the six-vote victory of GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in Iowa's 2nd Congressional District.

In the case, Democrat Rita Hart is asking the House Administration Committee to investigate 22 ballots she alleges were not properly tallied that would make her the real winner of the seat.

The House Administration Committee is currently weighing whether or not to launch a recount effort that could ultimately decide whether Miller-Meeks is removed from office, and Hart is sworn in as the new representative.

FOURTH TIME THE CHARM: IOWA REP.-ELECT MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS TO BE SWORN IN SUNDAY

Republicans on the House Administration Committee, however, say Hart's high-profile lawyer on the case, Mark Elias, has serious conflicts of interest because he and his firm Perkins Coie also represent half of the Democratic committee members who will be deciding the case.

In a letter obtained first by Fox News, the Republicans said Elias and Perkins Coie are not only working on behalf of Hart, but they also represent Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who chairs the House Administration Committee, and fellow Democratic members Pete Aguilar of California and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania.

PELOSI: 'OF COURSE' THERE'S A SCENARIO WHERE GOP WIN IN TIGHT IOWA RACE OVERTURNED

There are only six Democrats in total on the committee, and three of them share the same legal team as Hart, the Republicans allege in the letter they penned to Lofgren on Friday. The committee is also considering a second election contest involving Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois -- and Elias is representing her, too.

HOUSE TABLES MOTION TO DISMISS CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF CONTESTED IOWA RACE

""We write to bring to your attention to a serious conflict of interest regarding Marc Elias, an attorney with the law firm Perkins Coie,"" the GOP committee members write. ""In the election contests currently before us, Mr. Elias simultaneously represents Members of the Committee, the triers of fact and law, and parties to these contests, an arrangement clearly prohibited by attorney ethics rules and obligations.""

Elias did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. Spokespeople for the House Administration Committee Democrats also did not immediately respond.

The letter alleges that this arrangement violates Rule 1.7 of the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which prohibits an attorney from engaging in representation that involves ""a concurrent conflict of interest."" The letter also raises ethical concerns about Elias and Perkins Coie being sanctioned by the court in a previous election law case.

""We are gravely concerned that these serious conflicts of interest and ethical lapses on the part of counsel compromise the work of this Committee, and, more specifically, demonstrate further that the Democratic Members of this Committee operate not in search of the truth but solely in search of partisan, political gain,"" the GOP letter states.

The letter was authored by Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the Administration Committee, who has been fiercely opposed to Hart's election contest. He was joined by the two other Republicans on the committee: Reps. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin.

AG GARLAND'S SON-IN-LAW'S COMPANY ISSUES 'RESOURCE' CLAIMING TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE WHITE SUPREMACISTS

""Attorney General Garland’s son-in-law is Alexander Tanner. Mr. Tanner is a corporate official of Panorama Education Inc.,"" the statement adds. ""Panorama’s website assures school boards it may purchase racial and gender indoctrination, data mining, and other services using parents’ tax dollars. Publicly available corporate data shows investors, including tech billionaire oligarchs, have invested over ninety million dollars in Panorama. Panorama’s business, its investors, and Mr. Tanner are likely to be adversely affected if parents protest and stop school boards from funding racial and gender indoctrination (i.e. ‘equity’) programs aimed at K-12 public school students.""

The firm argues that federal ethics rules required Garland to disclose and seek clearance in order to preside over a matter where his son-in-law has a vested financial interest in Critical Race Theory being accepted by school boards.

""The nut of the matter is this,"" Senior Counselor and Director of Oversight and Investigations America First Legal Foundation Reed Rubinstein told Fox News. ""His son-in-law’s business depends for its revenue on the willingness of school boards to purchase their services for racial and gender based indoctrination and other sorts of surveys and data mining. If parents are protesting successfully and stop this sort of activity then the business of Panorama and the son-in-law’s ownership interest is adversely affected. If the parents win then Panorama and its investors lose.""

In the filing, obtained by Fox News, AFL points out that Garland previously pledged in his ethics agreement with the Department of Justice that ""in the event that an actual or potential conflict of interest arises during my appointment, I will consult with the Department ethics officials and take the measures necessary to resolve the conflict, such as recusal.""

AG GARLAND'S POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON SON-IN-LAW'S FIRM BACKING CRITICAL RACE THEORY UNDER SCRUTINY

AFL also filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with DOJ on earlier this month seeking records related to Garland's Oct. 4 memo, which directed DOJ's National Security Division and the FBI to investigate ""threatening"" parents at school board meetings speaking out against CRT.

Garland's directive has been criticized for politicizing DOJ because it came just days after a controversial letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) to President Biden, suggesting that parents pushing back during school board meetings are engaging in ""domestic terrorism."" Now, Garland is also under increased scrutiny for his son-in-law's ties to a company that backs CRT.

Last week, the National School Boards Association issued an apology for the letter it sent to the Biden administration. ""On behalf of NSBA, we regret and apologize for the letter,"" the NSBA said , noting that ""there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter.""

TOP SHERIFF ASKS GARLAND TO RESCIND 'TROUBLING' SCHOOL BOARD MEMO: 'SHERIFFS HAVE ALWAYS ENFORCED THESE LAWS'

Garland refused to say Thursday when grilled by Republican Rep. Mike Johnson whether he sought ethics guidance concerning his son-in-law’s business before he issued his explosive memo this month saying the FBI will investigate threats by parents against school board members.

Panorama was reportedly paid at least $27 million from as many as 1,500 school districts across the country since 2017, raising questions about how much Garland’s family stands to benefit from law enforcement cracking down on school board opposition.

""An employee of the executive branch is discouraged from engaging in conduct that's likely to affect the financial interest of someone close to them,"" Johnson told Garland. ""Your son-in-law, your daughter, clearly meets that definition. So the question is, did you follow that regulation? Did you have the appropriate agency ethics official look into this? Did you seek guidance as the federal regulation requires?""

Garland repeatedly refused to answer the question, saying only that the memo targets threats of violence against school officials.

""This memorandum is aimed at violence and threats of violence,"" Garland said.

""Did you seek ethics counsel before you issued a letter that directly relates to the financial interest of your family? Yes or no?"" Johnson asked.

""This memorandum does not relate to the financial interests of anyone,"" Garland responded.

""I take that as a no,"" Johnson said.

Garland also refused to say whether he would consider submitting to an ethics review.

""Obviously we didn’t find his answers satisfying or convincing,"" Rubinstein told Fox News. ""The appearance of conflict for the attorney general is a significant matter given the nature of how his son in law’s business makes its money.""

Rubinstein added that he believes Garland’s staff ""let him down"" by not instructing him to seek clearance on whether or not he should recuse himself over the school board matter.

Both the Justice Department and Panorama Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

"Russia 'does not want a direct conflict with US forces,' intelligence community assessed in January","US intelligence officials in January assessed that Russia did ""not want a direct conflict with U.S. forces,"" but instead, sought ""U.S. recognition"" of its ""claimed sphere of influence"" over much of the former Soviet Union.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Tuesday released its 2022 annual threat assessment, which was submitted in early February. The assessment only includes intelligence through the end of January—weeks before Russia launched its multi-front war against Ukraine.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

The intelligence community's assessment states that Russia ""will remain an influential power and a formidable challenge to the United States amidst the changing geopolitical landscape during the next decade.""

The IC assessed that Russia will continue to pursue its interests in ""competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways.""

The IC, at the time, said Russia would press ""to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad,’ while exploring possibilities to achieve a more stable relationship with Washington.""

""We assess that Russia does not want a direct conflict with U.S. Forces,"" the IC assessed in January. ""Russia seeks an accommodation with the United States on mutual noninterference in both countries’ domestic affairs and U.S. recognition of Russia’s claimed sphere of influence over much of the former Soviet Union.""

The intelligence community explained that Russian officials have long believed that the United States is trying to undermine Russia, ""weaken"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, and ""install Western-friendly regimes in the former Soviet states and elsewhere,""—moves, the IC said, Russian officials ""conclude gives Russia leeway to retaliate.""

President Biden, in the weeks leading up to Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and in the thirteen days since Putin launched the war, has maintained that U.S. forces will not fight inside Ukraine against Russia. Instead, the United States has deployed thousands of troops to Eastern Europe with the intent of defending NATO allies.

And while the Biden administration and its European allies and partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, the West has, so far, ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying enforcing one would put the U.S. and NATO in direct confrontation with Russia and would expand the conflict.

At the time of the assessment, Russia had not yet invaded Ukraine. The intelligence community, at the time said Russia was continuing to ""prepare for a military attack against Ukraine, with well over 100,000 troops massed near the Ukraine border, including Russian military forces in Belarus, occupied-Crimea, and the separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine.""

The intelligence community assessed that Moscow would ""continue to employ an array of tools to advance its own interests or undermine the interests of the United States and its allies.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: INTEL OFFICIALS PREDICT 'UGLY' WEEKS AHEAD AS PUTIN DOUBLES DOWN

""These will be primarily military, security, and intelligence tools, with economic cooperation playing a smaller role,"" the IC stated. ""We expect Moscow to insert itself into crises when Russia’s interests are at stake, the anticipated costs of action are low, or it sees an opportunity to capitalize on a power vacuum.""

The assessment added that Russia ""probably will continue to expand its global military, intelligence, security, commercial, and energy footprint and build partnerships aimed at undermining U.S. influence and boosting its own.""

Meanwhile, the U.S. intelligence community assesses that Russia will remain ""the largest and most capable"" rival in weapons of mass destruction to the United States ""for the foreseeable future,"" as it ""expands and modernizes its nuclear weapons capabilities and increases the capabilities of its strategic and nonstrategic weapons.""

""Russia also remains a nuclear-material security concern,"" the IC reported, noting that Russia ""views its nuclear capabilities as necessary for maintaining deterrence and achieving its goals in a potential conflict against the United States and NATO,"" and sees a ""credible nuclear weapons deterrent as the ultimate guarantor of the Russian Federation.""

The intelligence community stated that Russia is continuing its development of long-range nuclear-capable missile and underwater delivery systems meant to ""penetrate or bypass U.S. missile defenses.""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A 'VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD'

""Russia is expanding and modernizing its large, diverse, and modern set of nonstrategic systems, which are capable of delivering nuclear or conventional warheads,"" the report states, adding that Moscow believes such systems ""offer options to deter adversaries"" and ""control the escalation of potential hostilities.""

The intelligence community also found that Russia believes the expansion and modernization of its nonstrategic systems could ""counter U.S. and allied troops near its border.""

The intelligence community also assessed that Russia would remain a ""top cyber threat"" in 2022, as it refines and employee its espionage, influence, and attack capabilities.

""We assess that Russia views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries’ decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool,"" the report states.

The intelligence community found that Russia is particularly focused on improving its ability ""to target critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems"" in the United States, as well as in U.S. allied and partner countries. The IC found that Russia’s successful compromise of that infrastructure would demonstrate Russia’s ""ability to damage infrastructure during a crisis.""

The IC, at the time, said Russia is also using cyber operations to ""attack entities it sees as working to undermine its interests or threaten the stability of the Russian Government.""

""Russia attempts to hack journalists and organizations worldwide that investigate Russian Government activity and in several instances, has leaked their information,"" the report states.

This week, New York state said it is facing ""increased risk"" of cyberattacks from Russian retaliators, with NYPD officials warning that New York City is currently on ""ultra-high alert.""

The IC also found that Russia presents ""one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, using its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide Western alliances, and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to undermine U.S. global standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and influence U.S. voters and decision making.""

""We assess that Moscow probably will build on these approaches to try to undermine the United States as opportunities arise—Russia and its influence actors are adept at capitalizing on current events in the United States to push Moscow-friendly positions to Western audiences,"" the assessment states.

The IC in January also found that Moscow would continue ""online influence operations"" in the United States, and in other countries, like Belarus and Ukraine, and other countries of key Russian interest.""

The annual threat assessment was released just after Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and other top U.S. intelligence officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee and warned that the coming weeks of Putin’s war will get ""ugly"" as he takes an even more aggressive approach to try to take over Ukraine.

PUTIN'S DESIRE TO BRING BACK SOVIET UNION, ADVANCED AGE DRIVING INVASION, UKRAINE CAUCUS CO-CHAIR SAYS

""Our analysts assessed that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate, essentially doubling down to achieve Ukrainian disarmament neutrality to prevent it from further integrating with the U.S. and NATO if it doesn’t reach some diplomatic negotiation,"" Haines testified.

Haines noted that while Putin may take a tougher stance now, he may be lowering his expectations in terms of possible outcomes as he sees more and more obstacles in his way.

""What he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring,"" Haines said.

Meanwhile, the annual threat assessment was not just limited to Russia, but addressed other global threats facing the United States for 2022, including China, North Korea, Iran and more.

""In the coming year, the United States and its allies will face an increasingly complex and interconnected global security environment marked by the growing specter of great power competition and conflict, while collective, transnational threats to all nations and actors compete for our attention and finite resources,"" the intelligence assessment states.

The assessment states that China is increasingly a ""near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas—especially economically, militarily, and technologically—and is pushing to change global norms and potentially threatening its neighbors.""

And as many have said Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has emboldened China with regard to its ambition to take Taiwan, the intelligence community warned that Beijing is using a coordinated approach to compel neighbors to ""acquiesce"" to its preferences, ""including its territorial and maritime claims and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan.""

""Beijing will press Taiwan to move toward unification and will react to what it views as increased U.S.– Taiwan engagement,"" the IC states. ""We expect that friction will grow as China continues to increase military activity around the island, and Taiwan’s leaders resist Beijing’s pressure for progress toward unification.""

The assessment added that China’s ""control over Taiwan probably would disrupt global supply chains for semiconductor chips because Taiwan dominates production.""

""In the South China Sea, Beijing will continue to use growing numbers of air, naval, and maritime law enforcement platforms to intimidate rival claimants and signal that China has effective control over contested areas,"" the assessment states. ""China is similarly pressuring Japan over contested areas in the East China Sea.""

The IC also assessed that China presents ""the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. Government and private sector networks.""

""China’s cyber pursuits and export of related technologies increase the threats of attacks against the U.S. homeland, suppression of U.S. web content that Beijing views as threatening to its control, and the expansion of technology-driven authoritarianism globally,"" the report states.

The intelligence community also found that ""instability and conflicts continue to threaten U.S. persons and interests,"" some of which have ""direct implications for U.S. security.""

""For example, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan threatens U.S. interests, including the possibility of terrorist safe havens re-emerging and a humanitarian disaster,"" the assessment states.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-does-not-want-a-direct-conflict-with-us-forces-2022-intelligence-community-assessment-finds,N/A
"State Dept. official flagged Hunter Biden's 'conflict of interest' in Ukraine, testimony shows","George Kent, a career official at the State Department, told House investigators conducting the impeachment inquiry against President Trump that he raised concerns about Hunter Biden's lucrative service on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company -- but was told that it wasn't appropriate to discuss the matter because of the health struggles of Biden's eldest son, Beau.

According to a transcript of his Oct. 15 closed-door deposition released Thursday, Kent confirmed that he had no ""direct knowledge"" that U.S. aid to Ukraine was ever connected to the opening of a new investigation against the Bidens concerning their business dealings there.

Kent said that in January or February 2015, he ""became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board"" of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings while his father Joe Biden was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president.

""I did not know that at the time,"" Kent testified. ""And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president's staff and I cannot recall who it was, just briefing on what was happening into Ukraine, I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back, and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest.""

After discussing those concerns with Biden's staff, Kent testified, ""The message that I recall hearing back was that the Vice President's son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.""

Kent, who serves as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and was defying the State Department's instruction that he not testify, additionally confirmed that ""nobody in the Ukrainian Government became aware of a hold on military aid"" until Aug. 29th -- a month after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

READ KENT'S FULL DEPOSITION

Democrats have alleged Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed to investigate the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine, although Zelensky has said he felt no such pressure.

Kent testified that to the best of his knowledge, the aid issue was ultimately ""resolved by the president,"" and U.S. military aid was released to Ukraine in September. However, there was a period when Ukraine was on notice that the aid was suspended: Politico reported in August that the Ukraine aid was being held up -- two weeks before it was released.

Kent further acknowledged that it is appropriate for the Trump administration to ""look at the level of corruption"" in foreign countries when determining whether to provide, or withhold financial assistance. Speaking to Zelensky, Trump noted Ukraine's history of corruption and urged his counterpart to probe any potential election interference efforts originating from the country.

""Part of our foreign assistance was specifically focused to try to limit and reduce corruption,"" Kent said. ""And we also tried, to the best of our knowledge and abilities, to do due diligence to make sure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent for the purposes that they were appropriated and that they are as effective as they can be.""

Fox News is told the GOP will likely focus on the fact that Kent testified he was getting second-hand information from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman regarding concerns about Trump's call with Ukraine's leader. Republicans are expected to argue that while Vindman expressed reservations about the July call, Kent was giving House investigators nothing more than his own interpretation of how Vindham perceived the conversation.

Republicans are also focusing on how Kent was evidently upset about being pushed to the side on Ukraine policy, and arguing that while there may have been “irregular channels” for diplomacy, such an arrangement is not an impeachable offense.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY ANNOUNCES IN 2017

During his deposition, Kent asserted that he was told to ""lay low"" on Ukraine policy as the Trump administration, and the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, were interacting with Ukraine outside of traditional foreign policy channels.

He claimed was told by a Ukrainian official that Giuliani had conspired with Yuriy Lutsenko, the then-prosecutor general of Ukraine, to ""throw mud"" as part of a “campaign of slander” against former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

""Well, Mr. Giuliani was almost unmissable starting in mid-March,"" Kent told investigators. ""As the news campaign, or campaign of slander against, not only Ambassador Yovanovitch unfolded, he had a very high a media promise, so he was on TV, his Twitter feed ramped up and it was all focused on Ukraine.""

AT LOUISIANA RALLY WEDS NIGHT, TRUMP QUOTES FOX NEWS ARTICLE ON 'SLEAZEBALL' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTY

High-level Ukrainians, Kent asserted, wanted ""revenge"" against the diplomat. Yovanovitch, recalling her termination as Ukraine's diplomat, choked up during a closed-door hearing last month.

""Based on what I know, Yuriy Lutsenko, as prosecutor general, vowed revenge, and provided information to Rudy Giuliani in hopes that he would spread it and lead to her removal,"" Kent testified. ""I believe that was the rationale for Yuriy Lutsenko doing what he did. Separately, there are individuals that I mentioned before, including Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who started reaching out actively to undermine Ambassador Yovanovitch, starting in 2018 with a meeting with former Congressman Pete Sessions on May 9th, 2018, the same day he wrote a letter to Secretary Pompeo impugning Ambassador Yovanovitch’s loyalty and suggesting that she be removed.""

Kent added: ""And others also in 2018 were engaged in an effort to undermine her standing by claiming that she was disloyal. So that’s the early roots of people following their own agendas and using her as an instrument to fulfill those agendas.""

Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May, and Trump told Ukraine's leader in July that she was ""bad news"" and would ""go through some things.” Yovanovitch has separately told House investigators that ""people with clearly questionable motives"" tried to get rid of her, and that she was ""shocked"" by Trump's actions concerning Ukraine.

Kent, Yovanovitch and diplomat William Taylor are expected to appear in the public sessions as part of the impeachment inquiry.

UKRAINE ENVOY CLAIMS 'CLEAR KNOWLEDGE' OF QUID PRO QUO, BUT NO 'DIRECT KNOWLEDGE' OF TRUMP PLANS

Concerning Talyor, Kent testified that ""he told me he indicated to [U.S. envoy to the EU] Gordon [Sondland], he said, This is wrong. That's what I recall him saying to me, again, orally reading out of a conversation of which I was not a part. And Gordon had told him, Tim [Morrison], and Tim told Bill Taylor, that he, Gordon, had talked to the President, POTUS in sort of shorthand, and POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelenskyy to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton.""

Kent said he told diplomat Kurt Volker that ""asking another country to investigate a prosecution for political reasons undermines our advocacy of the rule of law.""

On Wednesday released a transcript of testimony from Taylor's closed-door deposition, in which he claimed to have a “clear understanding” that Trump wanted to leverage military aid to Ukraine in return for investigations that could benefit him politically -- while acknowledging that, like Kent, he didn't have firsthand knowledge of ""what was in the president's mind.""

“That was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the President [of Ukraine] committed to pursue the investigation,” Taylor said.

Taylor is a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who has emerged as a key figure of interest in the Trump impeachment inquiry, having alleged a quid pro quo was at play despite White House denials.

TRUMP-UKRAINE HOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TO START 'OPEN HEARINGS' NEXT WEEK

The transcript shows that Taylor testified he had been told by other officials that the White House was willing to hold up both military aid and a prospective White House meeting with Ukraine's president to extract a public announcement from Kiev that probes related to election interference and Burisma Holdings were underway.

""That's what Ambassador Sondland said,"" Taylor said, referring to E.U. ambassador Gordon Sondland. ""He said that they were linked. They were linked.""

But Republicans have pushed back that Taylor did not have primary knowledge regarding the key events in question, but rather based his testimony off conversations with others.

READ THE TAYLOR TRANSCRIPT

In one exchange between GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin and Taylor during his deposition, Taylor was asked whether he had any firsthand knowledge of Trump conditioning an investigation into the 2016 election and the Bidens on military aid.

Taylor said he did not speak to the president, or have any direct communication with the president regarding the requests for investigations. Instead, he said he was basing much of his testimony on what former United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and Sondland told him.

“What I know is what Ambassador Sondland was able to tell me about those investigations and Ambassador Volker,” Taylor said. “I don't know what was in the president's mind.”

Top Pennsylvania Dems can’t meet Biden due to scheduling conflict,"Two top Democrats in Pennsylvania running for high office said they will miss President Biden during the president's stop in Pittsburgh on Friday due to scheduling conflicts – just weeks after Stacey Abrams, the Georgia gubernatorial candidate, cited the same reason.

John Fetterman, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Josh Shapiro, the attorney general, will both miss the president’s visit to Mill 19, a research and development center. He is expected to discuss his infrastructure deal, WTAE reported.

Fetterman is running for Senate, and Shapiro is the likely Democratic nominee for governor, according to the Associated Press. The AP report pointed out that their ""high-profile absences come as Democrats in other states have begun taking modest steps to distance themselves from the first-term president, whose approval ratings have fallen sharply in recent months.""

The report said leading Pennsylvania Democrats, who are not on the ballot this year, did not have the same scheduling conflicts. The offices for Fetterman and Shapiro did not immediately respond to after-hours emails from Fox News.

Another top Senate candidate, Rep. Conor Lamb, a longtime Biden supporter based in Pittsburgh, will attend, his office confirmed. All three had been invited to participate in a photo line with the president, the AP reported.

Earlier this month, Fox News reported on how Abrams’ decision to skip Biden’s voting rights speech in Georgia was seized on by Republicans. Ben Williamson, an adviser for former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, tweeted, ""There’s bad, and then there’s ‘Gubernatorial candidate in a state you carried cancels on you’ bad.’""

Trump on turbulence in the West Wing: 'I like conflict',"President Donald Trump on Tuesday asserted that he likes and wants “conflict” among his aides in the White House, as he pushed back against reports of a dysfunctional West Wing.

“It’s tough,” Trump said about working in the White House, during a joint news conference Tuesday afternoon with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.

The president said: ""I like having two people with different points of view. And I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it. And I think it’s the best way to go.”

Earlier Tuesday, Trump suggested in a tweet that he would still like to see some staffing changes.

“The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House,"" Trump tweeted. ""Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great energy!”

During Tuesday's news conference, Trump was asked whether he was referring in his tweet to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom he has recently criticized. But the president declined to discuss their relationship.

“I don’t really want to talk about that,” Trump said.

Sessions is back in the president’s political crosshairs after announcing that the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz would investigate potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses in the wake of the release of two House Intelligence Committee memos.

Trump, who has previously blasted Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election, slammed Sessions last week for appointing an “Obama guy” to lead the investigation into potential “massive” surveillance abuses.

Overall, the president said, “the White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job.”

Trump said “there will be people that change,” but “they all want to be in the White House.”

“Believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House,” Trump continued. “They want a piece of the Oval Office, they want a piece of the West Wing.”

The Trump administration has had plenty of staff turnover in its first 14 months. Most recently, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks announced her resignation last week.

Hicks stepped into that role after Anthony Scaramucci was forced from the post after just 10 days over the summer.

FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, FROM COMEY TO MCCABE

Also last month, a senior communications official, Josh Raffel, who worked closely with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, left the administration.

Earlier in February, Rob Porter left his post as White House staff secretary amid revelations of past domestic abuse allegations leveled by two ex-spouses. And White House speechwriter David Sorensen also resigned amid domestic abuse allegations.

"Trump warns of 'major, major conflict' with North Korea","President Trump warned a ""major, major conflict"" with North Korea could result from the ongoing standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, but he said he hoped diplomacy would prevail.

In an exclusive Oval Office interview with Reuters ahead of the 100-day benchmark in his administration, Trump candidly acknowledged that the international situation could go off the rails.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely,"" Trump said.

""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea."" — President Trump

""We'd love to solve things diplomatically, but it's very difficult,"" he added.

Trump also said South Korea should pay for the $1 billion U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile defense system in place to protect it from an attack from the north.

The wide-ranging interview also included Trump's plan to defeat the Islamic State terror network.

""I have to say, there is an end. And it has to be humiliation,"" he said, when asked about what the endgame was for defeating Islamist violent extremism.

But talk was dominated by the North Korea situation, which has vexed past presidents, but seems to have reached a fever pitch amid repeated threats and new tests of missiles by Kim Jong-un.

""He's 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want, but that is not easy, especially at that age,"" Trump said. ""I'm not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I'm just saying that's a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he's rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he's rational,"" he said.

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping is helping to mitigate the issue.

""I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn’t want to see turmoil and death. He doesn’t want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man, and I got to know him very well.""

Trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed U.S. lawmakers on the North Korean threat and one day before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the United Nations Security Council on sanctions to further isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.

The Trump administration on Wednesday declared North Korea ""an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority."" It said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure, including Chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally, and would remain open to negotiations.

U.S. officials said military strikes remained an option, but played down the prospect, though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine to the region in a show of force.

Any direct U.S. military action would run the risk of massive North Korean retaliation and huge casualties in Japan and South Korea, and among U.S. forces in both countries.

Sen. Wicker pledges 'rigorous' oversight of Ukraine aid as conflict reaches tipping point,"EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Roger Wicker said the Biden administration has ""failed"" to clearly communicate the critical interest the U.S. has in supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, and that Congress will continue ""rigorous"" oversight of the over $26.7 billion in military aid contributed to the effort.

According to excerpts of his first floor speech as Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member first obtained by Fox News Digital, Wicker, R-Miss., plans to state the high importance of making clear the United States' interest in Ukraine.

""As the first anniversary of this war approaches, we should reflect on the progress made by Ukraine and consider how to help them decisively win this conflict so that a lasting peace can take root,"" the excerpts read. ""To do so, we first need to state clearly what our American interests are in Ukraine. That is something the president and his advisors have repeatedly failed to do, choosing instead to make vague references to the ‘rules-based international order.’""

UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: GERMANY AGREES TO SEND 2 BATTALIONS OF LEOPARD 2 TANKS AFTER HEAVY PRESSURE

""We will continue to maintain and expand the rigorous oversight structure we have placed over military aid,"" the excerpts continued. ""As of today, Congress has imposed more than two dozen separate, detailed oversight requirements on the Biden administration, and we continue to monitor their responses closely.""

BIDEN APPROVES SENDING 31 M1 ABRAMS TANKS TO UKRAINE, IN REVERSAL

""If we make the right choices, we can ensure a Ukrainian victory over Russia, send a message of strength to China and others who wish us ill, and restore the United States as the world’s Arsenal of Democracy.""

Wicker's floor speech comes the day after President Biden on Wednesday approved the delivery of 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine, just hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said Ukraine would also receive Leopard 2 tanks from Berlin as Russia plans for a major offensive.

The president, joined by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, described the vehicles as the ""most capable tanks in the world"" and said they "" will enhance Ukraine’s ability "" on the battlefield.

Biden said Western aid to Ukraine ""is not an offensive threat to Russia .""

The Pentagon announced last week that it is sending an additional $2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine , including 90 Stryker combat vehicles for the first time and another 59 Bradley fighting vehicles.

The U.S. has sent more than $26.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.

A senate aide told Fox News Digital that Congress is focused on delivering military aid to Ukraine as well as conducting careful oversight of every dollar.

Not only is it critical that the American people understand that every dollar advances national security, said the aide, it sends a strong signal to China that the U.S. invests in its allies.

Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer, and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" said that the start of 2023 means the beginning of the ""hottest"" phase of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Koffler, who is also a Fox News contributor, noted that last week, Russia announced ""major changes"" to strengthen its military, which she says is a sign that Moscow is ""recasting"" its approach in Ukraine.

"" Vladimir Putin’s new strategy is focused on fighting a large-scale war rather than a 'special military operation,'"" Koffler said, which will most likely result in a permanent conflict in the European theater.

Nuclear conflict anywhere on Earth would cause global crop crisis,"A nuclear conflagration between India and Pakistan would devastate global food supplies, a new study claims.

A new study led by a University of Chicago scientist finds that such a conflict would have horrifying consequences well beyond that region of the world.

Researchers combined climate, agriculture and economic models to show that a limited nuclear conflict would produce a decade of global cooling and a severe decline in crop production that would compromise global food security.

""The impact is very stark,"" first author Jonas Jägermeyr, a postdoctoral researcher in University of Chicago's Department of Computer Science and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a statement.

According to the study, by year four after the nuclear conflict, 132 of 153 countries -- with a total population of 5 billion people -- would experience food shortages above 10 percent.

HEAT STRESS COULD IMPACT 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE PER YEAR BY END OF THE CENTURY

""It would be the largest anomaly ever recorded, larger than the Dust Bowl event in the '30s and exceeding the impact from the largest volcanic eruptions in modern history,"" Jägermeyr said.

This type of sudden change in climate would lead to severe crop losses, which would end up exacerbating the effect of a regional conflict, causing a global crisis.

BEARS COME OUT OF HIBERNATION EARLY AFTER HOTTEST WINTER IN HISTORY

The study, which was published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was able to simulate the global indirect consequences from the use of nuclear weapons and the subsequent release of massive amounts of fire-related soot into the Earth's atmosphere.

""Sudden cooling is actually more harmful to global crop production than the same amount of anthropogenic warming,"" Jägermeyr explained in a statement.

""It primarily hits the northern breadbasket regions, while basically happening overnight compared to a gradual, long-term, systemic climate change where societies have potential for adaptation. In this case, cooling happens within a year, and we don't have the capacity to roll out new varieties of crops to adapt to a changed environment,"" he said.

IndyCar founder Tony George cites conflict of interest in resigning from Hulman & Co. board,"IndyCar founder Tony George resigned Friday from the Hulman & Co. board of directors, citing a conflict of interest in his recent attempt to reacquire the series.

""I realize that my recent efforts to explore the possibility of acquiring IndyCar represent the appearance of a conflict, and it is in everyone's best interest that I resign,"" George said in a statement. ""It goes without saying that I want to do what is best for this organization.""

IndyCar is owned by the Hulman-George family, which has owned Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1945. The series is governed by the Hulman & Co. board of directors, which is at 10 members after George's resignation.

Among those still on the board are his mother, Mari Hulman George, and his sisters, Nancy L. George, M. Josephine George and Katherine M. George-Conforti. Hulman & Co., through president and CEO Jeff Belskus, reiterated Friday that IndyCar is not for sale.

George had been rumored for months to be trying to take back control of the series he founded in 1996 and oust current CEO Randy Bernard, and he reportedly submitted a purchase proposal last week.

""Tony George has made the difficult decision to resign from the board because of his involvement with a group that has recently expressed an interest in purchasing the Hulman & Co.-owned IndyCar organization,"" Belskus said. ""While the business is not for sale and no offers to sell it have been considered or are being considered, we applaud Tony's efforts to resolve the appearance of a conflict and appreciate the gravity of this decision.""

George was ousted as CEO of IndyCar by his mother and sisters in 2009. He also resigned his spot on the board of directors, but rejoined in 2011. He was president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway from 1990-2004, and was CEO of IMS from 1990-2009.

Belskus said there is no immediate plan to fill George's vacancy on the board. George is a co-owner with his stepson, driver Ed Carpenter, of IndyCar team Ed Carpenter Racing.

""Tony has been involved with our businesses for many years and has contributed significantly through his leadership role with IMS and IndyCar and as a member of this board,"" Belskus said. ""We wish Tony much success in the future.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/indycar-founder-tony-george-cites-conflict-of-interest-in-resigning-from-hulman-co-board,N/A

"Russian, Belarusian NHL players facing 'discrimination and racism' amid conflict in Ukraine, agent says","NHL players from Russia and Belarus are facing an immense amount of harassment since the attacks on Ukraine began last week, and several of them have even received death threats, according to one agent who is asking people to ""stop looking at them as aggressors.""

Dan Milstein, a Ukrainian-born agent who represents the majority of those athletes being targeted in the league, told ESPN this week his clients have become concerned for their safety as they face increasing harassment.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: ALEX OVECHKIN FINDS SYMPATHY FROM CAPITALS GM AMID INVASION

""The discrimination and racism these Russian and Belarusian players are facing right now is remarkable,"" Milstein told the outlet. ""We're being set back 30 years. I have players calling me, parents calling me. They're concerned whether they'll be able to play, whether they'll be safe.""

Milstein has a unique perspective on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Now a U.S. citizen, he was born in Kyiv and arrived in the United States when he was 16 as a political refugee. He now represents 75% of Russian and Belarusian players in the NHL, according to ESPN.

He told the outlet some of his clients have received death threats, adding that he was recently targeted by someone on the street who called him a ""Nazi"" and was urged to ""get back to your country.""

""Clients are being called Nazis,"" Milstein said. ""People are wishing that they are dead. These are human beings. These are hockey players. These are guys contributing to our society, paying millions of dollars in taxes to support the U.S. and Canada and doing all kinds of charity work back home. Stop looking at them as aggressors. Stop being racist.""

Several international sports federations have made calls to ban Russian players from competition following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The NHL released a statement Monday condemning the attacks but expressed its sympathy for Russian players who it says play ""on behalf"" of their clubs and not Russia.

""We also remain concerned about the well-being of the players from Russia who play in the NHL on behalf of their NHL clubs and not on behalf of Russia,"" the statement said. ""We understand they and their families are being placed in an extremely difficult position.""

Milstein echoed that sentiment, saying his clients' biggest concern is their families.

""While some of my clients can speak freely in the safety of being in North America, their family could be scrutinized back home and anything could happen,"" Milstein said. ""I'm a proud American, so I ask, let's come together united. My own childhood home is being bombed as I speak to my friends back home.

""I haven't slept in six days because this is such a difficult time. But people are picking on the wrong crowd. I can speak on behalf of my clients. They want world peace like everybody else. They're not being treated like that.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/russian-belarusian-nhl-players-discrimination-racism-conflict-ukraine-agent,N/A
Tucker: Russia-Ukraine conflict could become a world war,"This is a rush transcript of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on February 24, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.



Russia invaded Ukraine last night as you know. Russian troops completely overwhelmed the country's air defenses in just hours. They moved faster and much more aggressively than anyone, including the U.S. State Department and certainly this show ever anticipated.



The fighting continues as we speak. U.S. officials say they believe Ukraine's capital could fall to Russian forces at any time. The casualty numbers we are getting at this hour seem puzzlingly low, given the scope of the invasion, 137 dead is the number we just have though we should tell you that much of what you hear at the beginning of a conflict like this later turns out to be mistaken. It really is as muddy as they say.



So we will be as careful as we can in telling you what we know.



With that in mind, we want to begin tonight as close as possible to the center of the story. Our Lucas Tomlinson joins us now from Ukraine.



Lucas, what do you see there? What's the state as of right now?



LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Tucker, all is calm here in the Western Ukrainian City of Lviv. It is the cultural capital. It's about six hours west of Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.



Of course, it is three in the morning here. You wouldn't expect a lot of people out tonight. Earlier, the authorities actually came to our live shot position here and said we weren't allowed to show any of the lights.



What we saw on the streets today was people very concerned, people worried. It wasn't just the State Department, Tucker, but actually people on the ground here were not expecting this large scale invasion.



Three lines of attack, north from Crimea, south from Belarus, just two hours from the Capitol and east from Belgorod. And Tucker, the U.S. officials say that the Russians fired over 160 short range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in this country.



Now, as far as reports are concerned, you're right. We have to be careful about what we're hearing. The Ukrainian authorities say that they massacred a Russian air assault that was taking place into an airfield just about 20 minutes outside the capital.



Now, how did we get here, Tucker? Let's go back.



This is a crisis 30 years in the making. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 in the woods of Belarus at a hunting lodge. They didn't even have a computer or typewriter. That's where the end of the Soviet Union took place. The leaders of the Soviet Union, Ukraine and Belarus.



For Vladimir Putin, it was one of the saddest days of his life. His goal has been to put the Soviet Union back together, that 5,000 word essay he penned over the summer in July, he says he read that two days ago.



He thinks the Ukrainians and Russians are one people. That's what he wants to see. He wants to see this come back together. Of course, he also fears NATO expansion.



You know, President Putin is on his fifth U.S. President. He has been President for over 20 years. Back in 1999, when NATO expanded to the Warsaw Pact, countries of Hungary, of Poland, and the Czech Republic, Vladimir Putin -- that really made him angry.



He saw the NATO bomb Serbia three weeks later. He thought, you know, it could be Belgrade now, it could be Moscow next. That's one of the reasons he has been very angry to see NATO expansion. He does not want to see it come to Ukraine.



Of course, the irony of that, Tucker, is if Vladimir Putin is successful in taking Ukraine, he will of course, be bordering a whole lot of NATO nations, but that's one of the reasons he is very concerned.



Also, there was a NATO conference in Bucharest in 2008, where President Bush at the time, he wanted Georgia and Ukraine to become members of NATO. It was actually Angela Merkel, in a communique that put that language in there that says Georgia and Ukraine will become members of NATO.



In fact, Putin wrote about it in the Russian response to Ambassador Sullivan in Moscow. It is one of the reasons Russia claims their security assurances are not being met.



That angered Russia so much that after that communique was written, Tucker, Russian forces invaded Georgia four months later, Ukraine six years later.



Remember Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to the Russians. Vladimir Putin was angry about that, he wanted it back, and of course Catherine the Great said the only way to make my country better is to expand the border.



Certainly, President Putin seems to be adhering to the Tsar or in Catherine the Great's case, a Tsarina -- Tucker.



CARLSON: Lucas Tomlinson from Ukraine for us tonight. Thanks so much for that.



So what is happening in Ukraine, whatever its scale, and it is not totally clear right now, but whatever it is, it is a tragedy, because war always is a tragedy, and the closer you get to it, the more horrifying it seems. It's the ugliest thing that men do -- ever.



Vladimir Putin started this war. So, whatever the context of the decision that he made, he did it. He fired the first shots. He is to blame for what we are seeing tonight in Ukraine.



The question is, once we've established that and it is obvious, how should the United States respond to what he has done?



So, within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night, the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy for partisan political gain.



If you've ever watched the aftermath of a school shooting, you're familiar with how they behave, it's contemptible. But we're going to ignore it tonight because there is too much else going on that actually matters, and the main thing that matters in any crisis is deciding what's most important, creating a hierarchy of concern.



So until last night, the main purpose of our foreign policy was to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine. Obviously, that failed. At some point, we should figure out why. But what's our top goal now? Well, there's several of them.



Here are first three. First and most obviously, avoid a full-scale war with a nuclear armed adversary. And to be fair, very few people in Washington want anything like that. War with Russia is so obviously a bad idea. But that doesn't mean we won't have one.



Wars often breakout accidentally, or more often, incrementally, things escalate, and the next thing you know, you've got Verdun with many thousands dead.



Now that shooting has started in Ukraine, it is entirely possible no matter what they assure you that Americans could wind up getting hurt in Eastern Europe. We should prevent that, but preventing it will require wisdom and farsightedness and emotional control, all of which are never in abundant supply in Washington, and especially now that everyone is justifiably upset.



Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we could still make it worse.



Mark Warner, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee just announced that Russia could be potentially close to triggering what's known as Article V of the NATO Alliance. That's a collective defense principle.



So if Russia were to launch a cyberattack on Ukraine, Warner explained, an attack that affects nearby NATO members like Poland and Lithuania, then possibly every NATO country, including ours, the United States would be obligated to declare war on Russia.



Here he is explaining.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): One of the things that I'm gravely concerned about, is it Russia unleashes its full cyber power against Ukraine. Once you put malware into the wild, in a sense, it knows no geographic boundaries.



So if the Russians decide they're going to try to turn off the power, turn off all the electricity all across Ukraine, very likely, that may turn off the power in Eastern Poland and Eastern Romania that could affect our troops.



If suddenly hospitals are shut down, if those NATO troops, American troops, somehow have a car accident because the stoplights don't work, we are suddenly in an area, hypothetically, an Article V, where one NATO country is attacked, we all have to come to each other's aid.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So Warner is certainly right, that could add -- that hypothetical that he outlined could happen. Any cyberattack on Ukraine could well affect the infrastructure of the Eastern European countries. That would be bad, it would be a crime. The civilized world would deplore it.



But Article V is not a mechanical mechanism. Human beings have to decide to invoke it. And the question is, is what the Senator just described something that is worth risking a nuclear conflict over? And that is something we should pause very deeply to think about in the most sober possible way, and we hope that our leaders are.



But not all of them seem sober right now. Some of them seem reckless and as usual, ignorant. Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for example, spends a lot of time on cable television talking about world affairs, he seems like an expert. And yet by temperament, he is certainly the last person you want anywhere near a nuclear button.



Today Kinzinger informed us that Russia's seizure of the defunct Chernobyl plant might quote, ""trigger Article V."" Okay, it could be interpreted that way. And then what happens? Clearly, Adam Kinzinger hasn't thought about that, not for a moment.



So you see the problem here? The question is not, who is at fault? We can say that Vladimir Putin is at fault for what happened last night. But then what? And that's the larger problem.



Once conflict starts, especially when that conflict is televised, it is really hard to know what happens next. So anyone who thinks the invasion of Ukraine couldn't become a World War either lacks imagination or is lying to you. It certainly could become a world war.



So that's the first goal, not making a terrible thing much, much worse. Here is the second coal, keep the energy flowing, cheap energy. We take it for granted. But it is the basis of all we have. No energy, no civilization.



Unfortunately, a huge percentage of Europe's energy now comes from Russia and Ukraine. The European Union relies on Russia for roughly 40 percent of its natural gas.



In Germany, which is one of the biggest economies in the world, that percentage is over half. Most of its energy in the form of natural gas comes from Russia and Ukraine.



So you don't hear that very often on television. This debate is framed exclusively in moral terms, and those are important. We shouldn't ignore them. But they're not the only terms we should consider.



The fact is that Vladimir Putin has the power to send Europe, and for that matter, potentially the United States into an economic depression. Putin has the power to turn off the lights.



So where did Vladimir Putin get this power? Well, there are a lot of reasons, but a big reason is the climate people gave him this power. Thanks to pressure from zealots like John Kerry, Europe has been shutting down nuclear power plants for years, and that's a very confusing strategy.



If you're worried about climate, nuclear energy is not the problem. Nuclear energy is the solution. It is reliable, it is domestically produced, it emits no carbon. So if you were genuinely worried about temperature rises, global warming, you would embrace nuclear energy.



But our leaders and not just ours globally across the West have done the opposite. Why? Maybe their donors and families are invested in so-called renewable technologies. Who knows? Whatever the reason, because of a series of very specific decisions made over time, the West is now dangerously dependent on Vladimir Putin for energy.



Now, our leaders may act like this is not a big deal. It is definitely a big deal and we ought to make decisions based on that fact.



And finally, a topic no one ever brings up, we must protect the U.S. dollar. America's power derives from its wealth. Rich countries get to do what they want. Poor countries must obey their masters or they get invaded. We just saw that happen. That is the unchanging rule.



In this country, control of the U.S. dollar is the key to our wealth. Our entire financialized debt based economy rests on the unique privilege of issuing the world's reserve currency. If the U.S. dollar is ever replaced, we are in legitimate trouble.



Our debt will come due, our government will go bankrupt, and millions of Americans will become poor immediately.



So this is the main thing we ought to be worried about and it is a greater risk now than ever before. Sanctions are an emotionally satisfying way to punish someone like Vladimir Putin, who clearly does deserve to be punished. No one is really against sanctions. But the question is, do they work?



Clearly, multiple sanctions did not prevent last night's invasion of Ukraine. Let's start there. At the same time, sanctions give Russia and many other countries across the world a strong incentive to dump the U.S. dollar, which is the means by which we enforce sanctions.



So last summer, for example, in a story that most people didn't pay enough attention to, Russia, in response to sanctions completely removed the U.S. dollar, its assets from its Sovereign Wealth Fund, its national wealth fund. The Chinese noticed. They understand exactly how this works, and in their effort to displace the United States, they are strongly in favor of it.



China is trying to become the first major country in the world whose Central Bank issue sovereign digital currency. If that works, and many efforts like it, it would be a huge loss for the United States, an irreplaceable loss that would change this country forever, much more than an invasion of Ukraine.



So we should be watching that, attacks on the primacy of the U.S. dollar globally, every bit as intently as we watch the coverage currently on television of the hot war.



If at the end of this conflict, whenever that is, countries around the world have come to see the Chinese yuan as a stronger, more stable currency than the U.S. dollar, then this country will have lost more than we understand.



Somebody has to be paying attention to this. Let's fervently hope that somebody is.



Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist who has been following this story for a long time. He's on ""Substack."" He joins us tonight.



Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. So what's -- this is obviously taking place as we speak, and it is hard to know the full outlines of it, but give us your reaction to it, if you would.



GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, one of the most striking things is this immediate climate that has arisen where there's a lockstep unified script that everyone is required to follow. And if you don't, if you question it at all, you get accused of being a traitor to the United States and/or an agent of the Kremlin.



And one of the things most remarkable about this is that what you're not allowed to say now, is something that people at the highest levels of the U.S. government have been saying for many years.



For example, the idea that it is incredibly provocative, legitimately so from the perspective of the Russians to expand NATO up to Russian borders is something that if you say now, both to identify the cause of the tensions, but also a way out of this war, to say we won't expand any further including to Ukraine, you get accused of being a Putin spokesman, even though people like the director of the C.I.A., the current one William Burns said back in 2008, warning the Bush administration about expanding NATO on the grounds that it's not just Putin, but everyone in Russia, including his enlightened liberal opponents who view that as a grave threat to Russia National Security.



Of if you say, we believe that Ukraine is of vital national interest to Russia, but not to the United States and therefore the U.S. shouldn't risk war directly or indirectly with Russia, you get accused of being a traitor and yet that was Barack Obama's position for eight years, when asked why he wouldn't flood Ukraine with lethal weapons.



And so, so many of the things that have been long recognized suddenly overnight became taboo.



CARLSON: So you've got to wonder, I mean, in this environment, I think it would be very difficult for the Biden administration, and I think there probably are some people there who agree with you, but to say out loud: Look, we deplore the invasion of Ukraine, I'm speaking for myself here, too, but we are really worried about where this could go and the effects on our country and the world.



And so maybe it doesn't undercut our national interest to say what we've said for generations -- you know, for decades, we're not going to expand NATO to your borders.



What would we lose in that, a sincere your question, do you think?



GREENWALD: That is an important question, because this is an incredibly dangerous war, Tucker. There are two countries with the largest nuclear stockpiles on the planet on opposite sides. And this follows five years of extreme hostilities created in Washington due to Russia-gate and other things that demanded that we not even talk to Russian diplomats, and that we treat them as this grave threat.



It's an incredibly dangerous situation. We should have done everything we could to avert the war and should do everything now to try and defuse it, and so all we have to do, which is the Kremlin's position is promise that NATO will never expand to Ukraine, and have Ukraine say the same thing. Why aren't we doing that?



Maybe that wouldn't work. The Russians say it will, but why haven't we done that until now? And why aren't we doing that now, given how dangerous this war and how horrific this war is to watch it unfold?



CARLSON: Glenn Greenwald, appreciate your coming on tonight. Thanks so much.



GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So whether you agree with that conclusion or that recommendation or not, the way it was formulated seems like the obvious way to think about this. This is bad. How do we make it better? And more to the point, how do we prevent the United States from becoming weaker, and more endangered by what's happening now? That's the only way to think about this.



And if you start to think that way, you begin to wonder what China is getting out of this. Does the invasion of Ukraine embolden China? And what does that mean for the near and long term future.



Elbridge Colby was a DoD official in the last administration. His specialty is thinking about the future of the United States and China. He joins us tonight.



Elbridge Colby, thanks so much for coming on. So from China's perspective, what does this look like?



ELBRIDGE COLBY, FORMER TRUMP DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Well, I think it looks pretty advantageous, Tucker. I mean, Putin is tying the United States down based on the President's remarks, and how the reaction, it looks like any attempt to really prioritize Asia and China, which clearly is where Americans interest need to be prioritized, is very much in jeopardy.



CARLSON: So this is -- just to state it once again, as clearly as possible -- from the Chinese perspective, this is good news.



COLBY: Absolutely. I mean, look, I think their interests are expansive, and to, I think, ultimately dominate their region and impose as you suggested, you know, the one is only one piece of that. That's going to be a whole part of their vision of a preeminent place in the world that we're going to feel very acutely.



And I think you're absolutely right on this point, Tucker, that we need to think soberly, and clearly and rigorously. And frankly, I don't see a lot of that going on right now.



I see a lot of reflexive thinking, a lot of people saying, we're going to be in, you know, three theaters, and everything's going to be the same, we're going to have to triple the defense budget. Look, even if you think that's the right idea, it's going to take a long time for that to happen.



We are already in a position where we need to make tradeoffs and there are things that we absolutely need to do to the Russians. I think you're right about sanctions. You're right, it's their fault. There's also, we can arm the Ukrainians and we need to get the Europeans to step up.



But the fact of the matter is, if we're thinking about Americans interest as you always do, I think those are going to be determined in Asia, which is going to be more than half of global economy. That's the market we're all going to be working for.



And the Russians are a challenge, but we need to put them in the correct position, as you indicated in that priority scheme and that is not first, that's China.



CARLSON: That seems very clear, and I don't know why you're only one of the only people, one of the only veterans who says that out loud. But I'm glad that you do.



Elbridge Colby, thank you very much.



COLBY: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So in Washington, some lawmakers are calling on the administration to send more troops to the region. There appears to be bipartisan support for that. Here's Lindsey Graham.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): There should be a dramatic increase of American presence, along with our NATO allies in NATO nations' border.



Russia, we are sending fighters to Poland. We're sending additional soldiers to the Baltic nations, but our NATO allies also need to do more.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So you have to ask, where exactly would those troops go? What would they do and what would be the purpose of having them there? Again, these are recommendations made by the architects of the policies that got us the invasion of Ukraine last night, so it's fair to ask those questions.



Daniel Davis is asking those questions. He is a retired U.S. Army Colonel. He is a senior fellow at Defense Priorities and we are happy to have him join us tonight.



Colonel Davis, thanks so much for coming on. So let me just ask you quickly the broad question, what should be the American response to what we've seen?



COL. DANIEL DAVIS (RET), U.S. ARMY: Man, you know, the American response now should have been done beforehand. But it can still -- it can still have a chance to work right now, and that is we just need to come to just accept the reality of the situation that Ukraine is never going to come in NATO. It was never going to come in NATO and we recognize it's not going to.



Now once you've come to that first, just bottom line, then you have to say, why would we then want to keep the fiction that the NATO's door is open when we know it's not, when we know for sure that that is Putin's number one red line?



And look, this idea that Putin is saying that he wants to reconstitute the USSR, and it's all about denying freedom to people. That's a smokescreen. He has been unambiguous since 2007, fifteen years of consistently saying, it's NATO expansion to my border in Ukraine, and he said as recently as December, as he has this big buildup. He said, I am deadly serious about this. I don't know why people don't believe me, but I mean this. Now, he has shown that he means it.



All we had to do was say: Okay, we're going to, quote, ""give in on this one point,"" which is something we didn't want to do anyway. It is in our interest not to do that, but we didn't.



And so we gave Zelensky false hope that if he just held out and didn't talk to Putin, that someday he would get that NATO protection. That was a false hope, and now that it has been exposed as such, even in this late hour, we can still say, okay, look, Zelensky, he needs to declare neutrality. He needs to say we're not even going to seek NATO membership.



We need to say it's not going to be extended. But we're going to continue to maintain our Article V obligations throughout NATO. So we're not going to be weakened by this, and it could stop the war because that's probably the one thing that Putin is just not going to give in on, NATO on his border.



CARLSON: Yes, I'm not I'm not sure what we would get out of having Ukraine in NATO anyway. I was always kind of confused. I mean, if you think about it through the lens of America's interests, I never understood why that was necessarily something we'd want, but --



DAVIS: Yes, you know, that's one of the things about NATO expansion is it has to improve NATO for any member to come into it and that is definitely not the case, because you're bringing in instability, and that would be bad for all 30 members.



CARLSON: Colonel Davis, thanks so much for joining us tonight.



DAVIS: Always my pleasure. Thank you.



CARLSON: So quick democracy, check the polls show, and these of course, are taken before the invasion that the vast majority of Americans oppose getting involved in the conflict in Ukraine.



Tulsi Gabbard has watched all this in the beginning. Of course, she is a military veteran currently serving, by the way, a former Member of Congress. She has been denounced as a foreign agent for speaking on behalf of the majority of Americans. She joins us tonight.



Congresswoman, thanks so much for coming on.



TULSI GABBARD, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you.



CARLSON: So what's your reaction to what we've seen in the past 24 hours?



GABBARD: Well, first of all, I do not in any way support Putin's decision to go into Ukraine. It is causing and going to cause an immense amount of suffering for the people there.



CARLSON: Yes.



GABBARD: I've been to Ukraine a few times. I have personal friends who are still in Ukraine. People have nothing to do with politics, everyday Ukrainians, and they're afraid, Tucker, and they're angry. They are angry at Russia. They are angry at America, and they are angry at the failure of leadership that could have prevented this and that is the thing that is most tragic about this heartbreaking situation with this war is that it could have been avoided.



If President Biden and NATO had done exactly what you were just talking about and agreeing, hey, we're going to take NATO off the table for Ukraine, something that both the U.S. and NATO have agreed is not likely to ever happen and something that is a legitimate security concern for Russia that they won't accept having U.S. and NATO troops on their border within Ukraine.



Had the U.S. and NATO leadership done this, this situation could have been prevented. I think the problem here in America is that people who bring this up, people who ask these questions, people who challenge the decisions that the Biden administration has been making in this are smeared and caricaturized as traitors, rather than actually pointing at the truth, which is this administration is not acting in the best interest of the American people. They are turning their backs on the American people.



CARLSON: So now that the current policy has failed, and I don't know anybody who thinks the invasion of Ukraine is a good thing. How volatile a situation is it? I mean people don't seem to want to address that question, but these things tend to escalate in ways you don't anticipate like sideways. Are you worried about that?



GABBARD: I'm extremely concerned about it, and this is what you and I have talked about in the days and weeks leading up to this situation, forecasting exactly what we are seeing playing out today, where you see this back and forth, where you have the leader of Russia and the leader of the United States of America saying: Hey, yes, if they cyberattack, we're going to attack back stronger.



This escalation of a tit-for-tat will only continue to increase and no one -- no one in the Biden administration, the leadership in this country is saying: Where does this go? Where does it end? What does it resolve? And what will it continue to cost the American people?



The most dangerous thing is that we are talking about an escalation of conflict between the two great nuclear armed powers in the world who have nuclear armed missiles at the ready, prepared to launch at a moment's notice.



And so whether this could get to that point intentionally or mistakenly through a miscalculation, as we've seen happen numerous times throughout history, this is the seriousness of the threat that we're facing.



CARLSON: I think that's nicely put. Tulsi Gabbard, great to see you tonight.



GABBARD: Thank you.



CARLSON: This is a FOX News Alert. We're told Russia's military continuing to strike targets across the nation of Ukraine. You're seeing images on your screen of a Russian airstrike at an airport in Ivano-Frankivisk, that's in Western Ukraine.



For perspective on what we are seeing on the screen, we want to talk to someone who lives there within the country. Shlomo Rosilio is a resident of the capital city of Ukraine. He woke to the sounds of explosions Thursday morning. It's now 3:00 AM, by the way, on Friday in Ukraine. He has been helping others evacuate from the country.



He joins us tonight live from that nation. Shlomo, thanks so much for coming on. Where are you exactly in Ukraine?



SHLOMO ROSILIO, KYIV RESIDENT: I am in the Cherkasy region, which is basically the center of Ukraine. I am right now located in a place where it's a little bit shelter, because we got some intel that's going to be bombing. As I've heard, it's already started in Kyiv, and I'm sure it's going to get here too, like last night. So we're just taking precaution.



CARLSON: So the common view in the United States was that the Russians would only go into the eastern part of Ukraine if they did, but it sounds like they've gone far past that. What's your sense of where Russian troops are now in Ukraine?



ROSILIO: I would say they are mostly located near the Lugansk area more, but they are coming in. They are walking in. They are in the area of thereabouts, probably two hours away from Kyiv, already.



As we know, this morning, they took over the Chernobyl Energy Center, which is located not far from Kyiv at all, so that means they're not far. They are there and they are probably all over the place. In some ways, there are pro-Russians running around the cities and lighting the chaos around.



I've heard couple times about messengers that are running around circling on groups and things like this. So people that are asking all kinds of teenagers to come and get paid to create chaos in cities. And just, you know, make all this ready for those soldiers to come in and just take over. That's what I've heard.



CARLSON: Have you seen evidence of the Ukrainian military?



ROSILIO: I have seen evidence of the Ukraine Military, just evidence.



CARLSON: Okay, so are you planning to stay in? Are you concerned for your own safety?



ROSILIO: I am concerned, generally speaking, but I am going to stay until the last person that we decided to take out we are going to take him out and then we're going to leave, absolutely. We have a mission, and that mission needs to be, you know, needs to be completed.



CARLSON: How difficult is it to get out of Ukraine right now?



ROSILIO: I would say on the scale of one to 10, around nine.



CARLSON: Yes.



ROSILIO: And there's a lot of factors to it. The first factor which is very, very difficult right now is to find a driver and to find a vehicle. Most of the people that have vehicles already ran away to the countryside or to all kinds of places and most of the people, they don't have a car, they don't want to be found outside because they are afraid that there is going to be bombing and nobody knows where it's going to come from.



So, I'll give you a very simple example, I wanted to send it to the team but I didn't send it yet, but we had a group of about 70 families stuck in some place, foreign families that we wanted to take outside the border and we are unable to take them.



Eventually, we had to hire some buses, and each bus about two hours' drive cost $10,000.00 in Ukraine. So this is the reality right now and there is no transportation whatsoever. Nothing.



CARLSON: Last question for you, Shlomo, we are reading and I have no idea if it's true, that the Ukrainian President Zelensky has issued an order banning men from young men all the way into their 80s from leaving the country. They don't know the purpose of that, I don't know if it's true. Have you heard that?



ROSILIO: Yes, it is true, and it's not the Ukrainian President. It's the Foreign Minister Affairs, which created that order. And yes, it's still in place. And yes, I've got calls from the border asking me what to do about it. There's all kinds of ways to get around that. But yes, it's still in effect.



CARLSON: We won't ask you to elaborate on those right now. Shlomo, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. Good luck.



ROSILIO: I wanted to mention something. Our mission here in Ukraine is highly and very dangerous, and we would like to ask the people to go onto our website, it's on the screen, I think, or it's going to be on the screen to donate to us and support us. This is one of the most important thing for us. It's Hatzalah Ukraine, and we are working very hard here, and we need the support of the people.



It is very, very important for us. So I would kindly ask if they can put it on the screen. So we can the support of the people, which is extremely important in those tough times.



CARLSON: We appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck.



ROSILIO: Thank you so much. Thank you.



CARLSON: So we want some sense, it is hard when you're talking about countries on the other side of the globe to know exactly what is happening where, maps help. No one is better at explaining those than FOX's Bill Hemmer he joins us now to do that.



BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Nice to see you, Tucker. Good evening.



I just want to show you a few things to give you a sense of what is happening today and what happened eight years ago, 2014 when the Russians went in, they took the southeastern clip here known as Donbas. They also took the peninsula of Crimea as well, that was 2014. Russia invaded time number one.



So what is the Russian Army doing now in the year 2022? Coming in really from three major areas, Tucker, based on some of the Intel we're getting. One is Crimea from the south. Not a lot of resistance we are told. One from the north, another country actually, Belarus, quite substantial resistance there and substantial fighting throughout the day, as well.



Then from the Northeast into the town of Kharkiv. Based on the reporting we're getting, fierce battles fought. Ukrainian Army on one side, Russian Army on the other. Kharkiv, by the way, is the second largest city in the country. It's not a small town, it's got 1.4 million people. The capital city of Kyiv has three million people.



But I want to show you this, Tucker, this is the town of Belgorod, and let me try -- yes, Belgorod. It's on the Russian side of the border and the reason I'm showing this is because just today, February 24th, we got these satellite images from a staging area, a military staging area in the Russian side of the border.



You can see quite clearly what is happening. For the Russian Army, they have got a field hospital here. This denotes a series of tents that are set up. These are military trucks over here and up in the upper corner here are attack helicopters and on the helicopters, Tucker, you can just -- I mean, it's plain as day based on the satellite imaging, you can count, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve -- so whatever they're doing with this staging area, they are using to help support the forces that are going after Kharkiv, that second largest city that I mentioned a moment ago.



It is 3:30 in the morning in Ukraine. So you're about 90 minutes away from the first missile strikes in Ukraine 24 hours ago. So we're coming up into day number two.



Tucker, I think it is very important to watch the capital city. As day breaks there, we move into day number two. President Zelensky, several hours ago, said that Russian forces had penetrated the city. Can't confirm that, but if he is right that would not be a good sign.



So we are, I think at the moment this is the fundamental question. Does the Russian army penetrate the capital city and go after Zelensky, the President, and maybe his family members as well? Or can the Ukrainian military keep him out as we move toward day two? We will find out together very soon -- Tucker.



CARLSON: One of many questions. That seems like one of the biggest. Bill Hemmer, thanks so much for that.



We will have more on Ukraine and from Ukraine in just a moment.



Erik Prince joins us among others.



We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: This is a FOX News Alert. War in Ukraine underway right now. Reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky refuses to leave the capital city. Russian troops apparently within miles of it.



Matthew Williams is a freelance reporter from Australia. He says he did not trust the media coverage of what was happening in Ukraine. He wanted to see for himself. So he went there, a choice that we admire. He joins us now.



Matthew Williams, thanks so much for coming on. How would you describe what you're seeing?



MATTHEW WILLIAMS, FREELANCE REPORTER: Hi, thank you for having me on.



What I am seeing, it is unbelievable. Yesterday morning when the first missiles hit, I was outside. You know, we were there walking down the street not really knowing what was happening and then seeing cruise missiles cruise 50 meters over the top of us. Absolutely unbelievable that it was actually happening.



CARLSON: Of course, you know in any war and it is hard to see the outlines of it when it's in progress, but we're not getting a lot of reports on the response from the Ukrainian Military.



Are there engagements between Russian and Ukrainian forces that you're aware of? Where's the Ukrainian Military? Do you know?



WILLIAMS: Yes, there are heavy engagements all around the border of the Ukrainian and Russian military. As far as the updates, and we are keeping very up to date with the updates, because where I am, we are trying to keep a corridor open, so I can still get out of this country if I need as I'm a solo independent journalist here. I'm still fine, and so I'm trying to maintain and know where it is.



But there is heavy combat, basically all around the border. That said, there has been multiple kills on tanks and helicopters, and fighter jets from the Ukrainians to the Russians, and vice versa, but a lot of the footage coming out, there has been heavy, heavy contact all around.



CARLSON: I have to ask you, there are not a lot of English speaking reporters who go unilaterally into conflicts like this. How did you decide to do this and why?



WILLIAMS: Well, Tucker, I am a veteran. I spent seven years in the Australian Army, in the infantry, I was a corporal and I served in Afghanistan. And I'm very disappointed in a lot of the Western media and the coverage of it.



I was kicked out of the Army due to cancer. I was discharged, and I wanted to see what was happening. I'm not a journalist, I'm not qualified for anything. I packed up my gear and my camera, flew over here and made my way down.



I spent my time in Kharkiv, the city, which is under siege at the moment, and down onto the frontlines in Donbas to see what was happening, and I've been reporting that in long form on my Instagram and YouTube, outside of any media, outside of anything, just to show people what is actually happening.



The language barrier, of course, has been difficult, but I'm doing the best that I can.



CARLSON: Sorry, I'm not sure if I heard you correctly. You said you were kicked out of the Australian military for cancer.



WILLIAMS: Not kicked out. Those are wrong words, I was medically separated. I was separated under medical terms due to a brain cancer that I got during my service.



CARLSON: Okay. Well, I appreciate it. It's a remarkable story, and I hope that you'll join us again, for as long as you're in Ukraine.



WILLIAMS: Thank you.



CARLSON: Matthew Williams, thank you.



WILLIAMS: Cheers.



CARLSON: So according to news accounts, the President, Joe Biden has reportedly been given options to launch a cyberattack against Russia, an attack that could disable for example, domestic transportation. I can understand the impulse. Is it a wise idea for our interests? That's worth considering as well.



Joe Kent is running for Congress in Washington State. He is retired Green Beret. He joins us tonight.



Joe Kent, thanks so much for coming on. So keeping in mind, as I know that you do, first and foremost, America's interest in all of this. What do you think of wise response is?



I'm afraid we have lost Joe Kent, but we will come back.



Over all of this, looms the threat and it is real that American troops could potentially be drawn into this conflict. Today, Joe Biden said he is considering sending U.S. soldiers to Germany and Poland, in fact, he plans to. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO. On Tuesday, in response to Russia's aggressive action, including his troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I've authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO's eastern flank allies.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Erik Prince, a former Navy SEAL, the founder of Blackwater has seen more wars in more countries over more years than maybe any living American. We're happy to have him join us tonight.



Erik Prince, thanks so much for coming on.



ERIK PRINCE, FOUNDER, BLACKWATER: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So the concern again, I don't think anybody approves of what Putin did yesterday. I certainly don't. But the concern is that this could move in directions, we don't anticipate and end up ensnaring the United States to a greater degree than we'd like. Are you worried about that?



PRINCE: Absolutely. This is -- the permutations that can come from this are awful. What should have happened, right, effective executive leadership comes with carrot and it comes with a stick.



The carrot should have been of course, Ukraine does not need to be part of NATO. It doesn't benefit the United States and it doesn't really benefit NATO, and I can understand what the Russians need to be concerned about another NATO member moving farther east. Okay, so fine. Offer them that, but also offer the stick, okay.



What Franklin Roosevelt did before World War Two is he provided Lend Lease and planes and aircraft to the Brits to give them additional equipment. This year, already, the U.S. Air Force has announced 200 -- more than 200 combat aircraft are going to be retired, literally flown from an active combat squadron to the desert and parked okay, for a value of zero.



More than 50 F-15s, still one of the best air superiority fighters in the world, F-16s, perfect for ground attack, and for suppressing enemy air defense, and more than 40 A-10s, okay, literally the best tank killing aircraft designed from nose to tail to kill Russian tanks, all of those aircraft could have been provided to the Ukrainians on a Lend Lease program, just like American pilots showed up in World War One in France to help France fight the Germans, just like American pilots showed up in Britain to help fight the battle of Britain, just like American pilots showed up to fight the Japanese over China in the Flying Tigers.



That same model could have followed in trust me if 140X American combat aircraft showed up by well-flown aggressive carnivore pilots, believe me, Putin would not have invaded because that is the kind of deterrence he was not expecting, because he needs air superiority. That's why he's moved troops into the airport, just west of Kyiv to try to seize the capital. That kind of model is a failure of imagination by the administration.



I provided that kind of thought, a concept to the administration already in early December, and they just don't want to think outside the box. It's really frustrating, and so now, the permutations of what happens in this war, we certainly don't want to send troops, but for heaven's sakes, it should have been stopped before it ever started.



CARLSON: Yes. What a shame. So many of those.



Erik Prince, appreciate coming on tonight. Thank you.



PRINCE: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So cyberattacks, and not just from one side are suddenly part of the story. We're going to ask retired Green Beret, Joe Kent about that. He is back with us after a technical snafu. Joe Kent, great to see you.



So what do you think a wise response to this invasion from the United States would be at this point?



JOE KENT (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FOR WASHINGTON STATE: Well, Tucker, it's not opening up a new front and that front would be a cyberattack. I know there are some people in the Biden administration, there are lawmakers and there are hawks, offering up our cyber capabilities. And we do have cyber capabilities.



However, opening up a new front and directly attacking Russia with a cyberattack would be viewed as an act of aggression, and just plunge us further into this conflict.



What we should be looking for is every single opportunity that we have to dialogue with Putin and offer him an off ramp, in particular, taking NATO off the table, as opposed to beating the war drums even more, and also our cyber capabilities, considering how much infiltration there is in our own cyber network coming from China is extremely unwise at this juncture.



CARLSON: So Mark Warner, who is the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee described a Russian cyberattack against Ukraine and potentially NATO allies like Lithuania and Poland as an act of war.



I think that is commonly acknowledged that a cyberattack that takes infrastructure offline or shuts down hospitals, that is an act of war, is that commonly defined? I think?



KENT: Absolutely. In this day and age, a cyberattack is most certainly an act of war. So we should be very cautious before we even recklessly discuss putting that out there. I think we should be very cautious with that. And again, looking for ways to de-escalate and not continue this march towards a total war in Europe.



CARLSON: Yes. You can be upset and wise at the same time. That is possible.



Joe Kent, great to see you tonight. Thank you.



KENT: Thank you.



CARLSON: So gas prices are going up, energy prices across the board. That means the price of everything. President Biden said today that sanctions against Russia will guarantee you're going to pay more for gas. Here's what he said.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BIDEN: I know this is hard, and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me, but this aggression cannot go on unanswered.



If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies we stand up for freedom. This is who we are.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Yes, so if you're telling us that domestic energy production is quote, ""critical to you,"" but you've done more than any administration in our lifetimes to shut down domestic energy production, maybe you're lying.



Will they change their tune on that? Reopen the pipelines? Start the drilling?



Ned Ryun is CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight. Ned Ryun, thanks so much for coming on.



NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Absolutely.



CARLSON: So will there be enough pressure on the administration to take its boot off the throat of domestic energy production that maybe there is an effect on gas prices?



RYUN: No, absolutely not. The Biden administration has declared war on fossil fuels because the Democratic Party has basically been captured by the infantile left that is determined and is convinced -- and determined to see that the hoax of manmade global warming continues on as one of their main priorities.



I mean, this is really an important National Security issue, Tucker, that Trump understood. He wanted to make us energy independent, not only because of lower prices for consumers and thousands of American jobs, but he realized that the National Security issue, not only for our own security, but also to use as a powerful negotiating tool against Putin.



I remember very clearly in the summer of 2017, his speech to the Three Seas Initiative in which he wanted to use American energy exports to undermine Putin's energy leverage over the rest of Europe. I mean, this is something -- it is pretty staggering that we have basically conceded a very powerful negotiating tool with our energy and basically done it without even a fight.



And so, I think this is one of the things that Americans are going to be slapped in the face when they realize this confluence of terrible energy policy from the by the administration, meeting with this whole Russian invasion of Ukraine, the energy costs are going to go through the ceiling, but it is of our own making.



CARLSON: And energy is your power. I mean, it's pretty simple.



RYUN: That's right.



CARLSON: Right. Yes, I know, it is weird how we don't recognize that. Ned Ryun, appreciate you coming on.



RYUN: I know.



CARLSON: Thank you.



RYUN: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So we've been told that sanctions, they told us for years would deter Russian aggression. Today, the President acknowledged the obvious that they didn't.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



QUESTION: The statement that he gave last night -- the threat that he gave the West will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history? Is he threatening a nuclear strike?



BIDEN: I have no idea what he is threatening. I know what he has done.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Clint Ehrlich is a Russia policy researcher, one of the wisest. He joins us, Clint, thanks so much for coming on. You'll notice they're deflecting blame immediately. Anyone who is concerned about becoming enmeshed in Eastern Europe is responsible for the invasion of Ukraine, you've got it.



But in real life, isn't it time maybe to think through the policies that failed to prevent this? Are we going to do that, do you believe?



CLINT EHRLICH, RUSSIA POLICY RESEARCHER: You'd think that we would do that, but it seems like if we talk about the policies that led us here, we're being labeled as traitors to America, that they are determined to repeat the same course of action that has led Ukraine to the slaughter.



And so I think that if these people are really concerned about Ukraine and the suffering that we are all seeing on television, then they should take responsibility for the choices that they've made that have brought the world not just to the precipice of a conflict in Ukraine, but frankly, to the precipice of a World War.



CARLSON: Well, that's -- thank you for noting the obvious, and I know that there are a lot of them, but just give us the top one or two policies that we should maybe rethink if we don't want this to become something even worse than it is.



EHRLICH: Well, there are so many. The immediate one right now is this claim that we should conduct cyberattacks against Russia. If we do that, Russia will retaliate. They will retaliate against our critical infrastructure and American civilians could die.



And so then, we're thrust into a situation where we have to decide, will we retaliate kinetically against Russia, it's just, Tucker, it is impossible to understate the severity of what these people are flirting with. They're flirting with open conflict with Russia, and they're not taking responsibility for it.



CARLSON: Yes, I think you're right. Hope you're wrong. I don't think you are. Clint Ehrlich, great to see you tonight.



EHRLICH: My pleasure. Thank you, Tucker.



CARLSON: Thanks. We're going to take a quick break. As you know, the war is now underway in Ukraine. And of course, we have been covering it.



Doug Macgregor and Brit Hume after the break.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: So this is still unfolding. It is still not clear what the next stage of the invasion will be and what Europe will look like when it's over. Doug Macgregor knows a lot about Europe. He is a retired Army Colonel. He joins us tonight.



Doug, what do you think happens next?



COL. DOUGLAS MACGREGOR (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, this is an inherently limited operation. The Russian Army is a little bit over 400,000 smaller than the United States Army. The Russian economy is smaller than the economy of South Korea. They can't sustain these operations for very long.



Putin has allegedly already sent an ultimatum to President Zelensky. I can't confirm it, but the rumors are strong and I suspect he has, telling him that if he is willing to suspend any further interest in expanding to NATO, Putin will control the ground east of the Dnieper River along with Crimea and so forth, and our friend, Zelensky can have what remains, but he hasn't answered.



If he doesn't, then Putin is stuck with the requirement to cross the river and head towards the Polish border, which is something I think he privately would probably want to avoid.



NATO is fragmenting along cultural historical lines, particularly with the resurgence of the Russo-German relationship, which is very strong, and has been for hundreds of years. And then finally, our countermeasures are ineffective, completely ineffective.



CARLSON: That seems sadly true. I appreciate your coming on tonight. Doug Macgregor, thank you.



MACGREGOR: Sure.



CARLSON: Brit Hume wraps it up for us tonight. Brit, I know you are set about this. I think most people are watching it.



BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:* Bad day.



CARLSON: Bad day. I agree with that completely. What happens next?



HUME: Well, let me just make a couple of points. First, I don't think that the issue of Ukraine joining NATO is what this is about, and I don't think for a minute that some public forswearing of NATO including Ukraine would change anything.



Putin wanted Ukraine, wants Ukraine, and he's now trying to get it.



CARLSON: Right.



HUME: And I don't think that, you know, who speaks Russian where or any of that is really what this is all about. It sticks in his craw that Ukraine which has got a lot of resources, big agricultural producer, natural resources, sticks in his craw that that was lost when the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed. That's point one.



Point two is, there are a couple of things we could be doing and may have to do. One of them is obviously as other guests have mentioned, we need to unleash our energy sector.



Biden has put shackles on it. He shut down pipelines. He has cut off drilling and so on. We need to have that flowing full speed for two reasons. One is to supply our own energy sector, our own economy well, and also to give us the chance to shore up Europe's energy supplies if there's a cut off from Russia. Russia pumps out natural gas and now, the Nord Stream Pipeline has been stopped for now.



But we are exporting liquefied natural gas there now, we could do a lot more of that, and that would help Europe and strengthen Europe, so those are just two things we can do.



CARLSON: God, I hope someone is listening to you because you're right.



HUME: Two things we could do that would be peaceful means.



CARLSON: Amen. Brit Hume, thank you for that.



HUME : You bet.



CARLSON: That's it for us. We will be back tomorrow.

Tucker: How will this conflict affect you?,"This is a rush transcript of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on February 22, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.



Since the day that Donald Trump became President, Democrats in Washington have told you, you have a patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin. It's not a suggestion, it is a mandate, anything less than hatred for Putin is treason.



Many Americans have obeyed this directive. They now dutifully hate Vladimir Putin, maybe you're one of them. Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy. It's the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it.



Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe. Before that happens, it might be worth asking yourself since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle class job in my town to Russia?



Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs?



These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that. So why does permanent Washington hate him so much?



If you've been watching the news, you know that Putin is having a border dispute with a nation called Ukraine. Now the main thing to know about Ukraine for our purposes, is that its leaders once sent millions of dollars to Joe Biden's family. Not surprisingly, Ukraine is now one of Biden's favorite countries.



Biden has pledged to defend Ukraine's borders even as he opens our borders to the world. That's how it works. Invading America is called equity, invading Ukraine is a war crime.



So with every day we move closer to some kind of conflict with Russia, a conflict that could easily spin out of control given that the people running us have no fine motor skills.



The administration assures us this has nothing at all to do with repaying Joe Biden's personal debts to Ukrainian oligarchs. Not at all. It's completely and totally unrelated. The point here is to defend democracy, not that Ukraine is a democracy, it is not a democracy.



Ukraine's President has arrested his main political opponent. He has shut down newspapers and television stations that have dared to criticize him.



So in American terms, you would call Ukraine a tyranny. But Joe Biden likes Ukraine so Putin bad, war good. How will this conflict affect you? Well, it will affect you quite a bit, actually.



Energy prices in the United States are about to go way up and that means that everything you buy will become much more expensive, from the food you eat to the car you drive, to tickets you need to take your family on vacation this summer, assuming you can still afford vacation by then.



You're about to become measurably poor. That's not a guess. Joe Biden has admitted this.



On the other hand, you're going to win an important moral victory against dastardly old Vladimir Putin, who is much, much worse than Justin Trudeau. Just so you know.



So you can feel good about that, because -- because ...



Let's see, come to think of it. Why would you feel good about that? It seems like a pretty terrible deal for you, and for the United States. Hunter Biden gets a million dollars a year from Ukraine, but you can no longer afford to go out to dinner. That's not a bargain. So what are we missing here?



What we're missing is the big picture. And that's why Joe Biden has dispatched Kamala Harris to explain that picture to us. Kamala Harris's old job was to open America's borders. She did that.



Her new job is to keep Ukraine's borders closed. Kamala Harris was in Europe the other day to explain the whole thing. She began with a history lesson, letting the European peoples know about the recent past, which she assumes they've forgotten since so few of them speak English.



She opened with a traditional salutation. ""Listen, guys,"" because that's the way real historians and states people talk. Watch Kamala educate.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I mean, listen, guys, we're talking about the potential for war in Europe. I mean, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about.



Spent over 70 years, and through those 70 years, as I mentioned yesterday, there has been peace and security. We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Listen, guys, you may be Europeans who live in Europe, but you don't fully understand the ramifications of war in Europe. That's your problem. The thing about Europe you've had peace and security for more than 70 years. Kamala Harris just told the Europeans that, and that, by the way is true if you don't count the breakup of Yugoslavia, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the 1990s or the Soviet occupation of half of the landmass which amounted to the enslavement of hundreds of millions.



But apart from that Mrs. Lincoln, it's all been peace and security in Europe, until now. The Soviets are fine. Vladimir Putin is bad.



What do we do about that? Kamala Harris explained that, too. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



HARRIS: And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because remember also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.



And within the context, then, of the fact that that window is still opening -- still open -- although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open. The deterrence effect, we believe, has merit.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Got that? Take a breath and let it sink in. Here it is, again, quote: ""We have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because remember, also, we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment within the context then of the fact that the window is still opening -- still open --- although it is absolutely narrowing, but within the context of a diplomatic path still being open, the deterrence effect we believe, has merit.""



Well, of course it has merit. The only question is: What the hell are you talking about? And the answer is Kamala Harris has no real idea what she's talking about. She can't even point to the direction of what she is talking about. Her mouth opens and predigested chunks of language come tumbling out in no particular order. It's soothing to listen to until you try to understand what it means.



As Kamala Harris told us just last month, quote, ""It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day."" To which we'd respond. That's right, Miss Vice President Person, today is the first day of the rest of your life. Learn it, love it, live it. And while you're at it, Eat, Pray, Love.



You can just imagine Vladimir Putin's reaction to all this when an aide drops a translated transcript of Kamala Harris's remarks on his desk. The Slavic mind is a hall of mirrors. It sees traps at every intersection. Clearly, Kamala Harris must be setting some sort of trap for the Russians here. Her words don't make sense, but she can't possibly be dim and childish.



America is a superpower. It would never put a senile man and an imbecile in charge of the country. On the other hand, maybe so.



And by the way, it's not just our country. A few weeks ago, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with his British counterpart, Liz Truss. Lavrov asked Truss if her country recognized Russian sovereignty over Rostov and Verona's both of which are actually parts of Russia.



So it was a trick question. But Liz Truss, who used to work in sales, had no idea. So she replied that Great Britain would never recognize these regions as Russian, despite the fact they already are Russian.



So Liz Truss has no idea what she's talking about, either. But here's the thing. She wasn't embarrassed about that. None of them are embarrassed about that.



John Bolton knows a lot. On the other hand, he spent decades weakening America with terrible foreign policy ideas, and getting a lot of decent people killed for no good reason at all. So you'd think at this point, if justice were real, John Bolton would be living in isolation and shame somewhere spending his days in atonement, that's what you would do, but that's not what he's doing? No.



Here is John Bolton on MSNBC demanding yet another war, this one with the nuclear armed power. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC HOST: Do you think that U.S. forces should actually go in to defend Ukraine?



JOHN BOLTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, I think it's probably too late for that now. But I would say this, the red line between being a treaty ally of the United States and not being one is significant, but the issue as in all issues like this, is would a Russian invasion and takeover of Ukraine adversely affect American National Security and that of its NATO allies? The answer to that is absolutely yes.



We did not act appropriately early. I think we should have had more American forces in Ukraine not to fight the Russians, but to train with the Ukrainians and to show those Russian generals looking across the border and seeing American flags, I wonder what that means? Biden took that off the table, saying there would be no American forces involved, and he got nothing for it.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So the only problem with Joe Biden's Ukraine policy says John Bolton is that it is too weak. Your kids aren't fighting there right now. Hunkered down in February, shooting at Putin. Let's try a Winter War in Russia. No one has done it before, but we have high hopes.



Alexander Vindman is in fact demanding it. Unlike the British Foreign Secretary, Alexander Vindman knows quite a bit about Ukraine. In fact, he was born there. Alexander Vindman believes you have a moral obligation to defend his homeland, and if you don't, you're a murderer.



Watch him once again, on MSNBC.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET), U.S. ARMY: I think these folks, these right-wing pundits, and the G.O.P. that supports them, really, frankly, have blood on their hands because they're encouraging and enticing this kind of opportunism from Putin, and it is not what -- it's not just kind of plain rhetoric like you could say something without consequences, like too often happens in the United States. This has real consequences and people are going to die because of this.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Yes, they're going to die. So your job is to take up arms in defense of Alexander Vindman's home country or else you're evil, you have blood on your hands, and that's effectively our policy. Okay, Alexander Vindman, you got us. It is a compelling argument. We're in.



What's this going to cost us to defend the country you were born in?



Well, in fact, Joe Biden addressed that question today. Defending freedom will have cost for us here at home, Biden said. We need to be honest about it. Really?



Biden went on to outline what he called the pain of our sanctions. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BIDEN: We are implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VTB and their military bank. We're implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian's sovereign debt. That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the west and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets.



Starting tomorrow, and continuing in the days ahead, we will also impose sanctions on Russian elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well.



Because of Russia's actions, we've worked with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2, will not, as I promised, will not move forward.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So let's put aside the question of why you would ever want to shut down any energy pipeline anywhere ever, especially now crude oil is nearing $100.00 a barrel, it's the highest price since 2014. That's not a small thing, because you need energy to live. It's not negotiable.



So how does having less energy help the United States? Joe Biden didn't even hint at an answer to that, he didn't answer any questions, he ran away the second he had finished reading the script.



Back in real life, every person knows nothing will tank our economy faster than cutting off the supply of fossil fuels because despite what you may have heard from noted energy experts like Sandy Cortez, a country of 340 million people can't run on windmills and solar panels. And even if we had enough of those, which we don't, we don't have the transmission lines to get that power to your house, and we won't for a long time. So that's all a lie.



But don't worry, says Kamala Harris, the administration has ways of fixing the spike in energy prices. We've got it under control, because it turns out, Kamala Harris is secretly in charge of global energy markets.



No, just kidding. Harris has no idea what a barrel of oil costs. She doesn't know how natural gas is measured. What she knows about is diversity, and that's pretty much it, though, she does sense that everything is about to get a lot more expensive for you, and so to warn you, she mentioned it today.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



QUESTION: The President has already said Americans will be facing some economic fallout or some hardships. Can you explain to Americans what exactly will they face if this happened?



HARRIS: Sure, as the President talked about in his speech, we are aware that, again, when America stands for principles, and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost and in this situation, that may relate to energy costs, for example.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So what are the principles we're defending here? We're defending a regime that has arrested their main rival and shut down opposition media. What principle is at stake here apart from rewarding the Biden family's patrons?



But at least she's honest enough to say, what's happening in Eastern Europe, quote, ""may relate to energy costs."" That's a euphemism for good luck filling your truck this August.



Does that bother Kamala Harris? Maybe it does in the short term. Voters aren't going to like it in November, their party will be punished. But they're doing it anyway. They're shutting down domestic energy pipelines here. They're picking a fight with Europe's biggest gas supplier. So maybe there's something bigger at work here. Maybe they're thinking long term.



Maybe they're not against rising oil and gas prices, maybe, they are for them. Maybe expensive energy would be good for the many renewable deals their friends and donors are invested in.



We don't know the answer. We do know that all of us are about to suffer. So we hope that hating Vladimir Putin was worth it.



Tulsi Gabbard is one of the few people in the Democratic Party who saw this coming and was excoriated for it. She's a former Congresswoman from Hawaii. She joins us tonight.



Congresswoman, thanks so much for coming on. So I'm just trying to think because I think it's a fair question as an American, what's in this for me and my neighbors and the rest of us? And all I'm getting is that we can feel morally satisfied because we hate Putin. Is there something that I'm missing?



TULSI GABBARD, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: No, I don't think you're missing anything. The reality is that these sanctions don't work whether they were put in before or now or later, these sanctions don't work.



What we do know is that they will increase suffering and hardship for the American people and this is the whole problem with the Biden administration. They are so focused on, how do we punish Putin that they don't care and are not focused on what is actually in the best interests of the American people.



So when Biden stands there and looks directly into the camera and says, you know, defending freedom will cost us, what he really should be saying is looking directly into the American people's eyes and saying, this will cost you, because these sanctions are not going to cost him or Kamala Harris are the power elite in this country, even the power elite in Russia, it is the people who will suffer, the American people, the Russian people, people here at home working hard every single day, facing those drastically increasing prices at the gas pump, facing increasing costs at the supermarket, impacting our supply chain.



The hardships that people are dealing with every day now with Biden's sanctions plan, we're only going to see that continuing to get worse. And it doesn't end there, Tucker, this is the problem is, you think Russia is not going to respond? You think Putin is not going to respond? He will respond. And it's likely he'll retaliate using cyberattacks on our financial systems, our communication systems, on our basic infrastructure.



Biden will then be forced to respond; Putin will then be forced respond. So we end up in this endless tit-for-tat that leads us where? To this looming threatened and likelihood of this thing going nuclear.



And, again, this is the reality that we all need to understand is true, is that whether it's it is intentional or unintentional, when you have two great nuclear armed countries at this point of escalation, and then, if there is a nuclear attack, the power elite, these people are going to go hide in their bunkers, they'll have their shelter, they'll have their food and water and everything that they need.



You and I and the American people, we will be left out to deal with the consequences to suffer and deal with that destruction and death that will come as a result.



CARLSON: And yet we're doing this for principle. The people in charge who don't care at all about our founding documents, who violate their spirit and letter every day are telling us that essential American principles is at stake. Do you have any idea what that principle might be?



GABBARD: Therein lies the hypocrisy, Tucker, is they're saying we're doing this in the defense of freedom, in the defense of democracy, but these are the very same people who are working to undermine our own freedoms and our own democracy right here at home.



I have a hard time seeing how they actually say these things with a straight face to the American people, when they clearly don't care about these principles, right here at home. They don't care about defending them, they don't care about the wellbeing of the American people.



CARLSON: I think that's all very clear. And I appreciate your saying it as clearly as you did.



Tulsi Gabbard joining us, thank you very much.



GABBARD: Thank you.



CARLSON: It's interesting when people tell you who you're required to be mad at, you've got a right to think for yourself, you should be mad at the people who are making your life worse, for preventing you from saying what you think is true, who are calling you a racist for no justification, only to hurt you, who are destroying your children's education, who are allowing your country to become polluted and overrun and filled with drugs and the homeless. Maybe should be mad at them.



Well to Canada now we go, speaking of failed democracies, Justin Trudeau's supporters have just voted to extend martial law in Canada. Some of his supporters are comparing the trucker horns to Nazi slogans.



Honk your horn, you're a Nazi.



Then the Mayor of New Orleans was just caught without a mask after re- imposing a massive mandate across the city, there are 115 stories like this, we brought to you but we can't get enough, we'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: You'll remember that Justin Trudeau declared martial law in Canada because truck drivers had gathered in Ottawa, the capital city to protest the tyranny he had imposed on them as crushing of human rights, but he swiftly dispatched with the protesters. He had his forces beat several of them, they run over an old woman with a horse, and then they bragged about it.



So Trudeau was able to clear all the trucks, but last night his allies extended martial law. A member of his party argued that a permanent state of emergency is absolutely necessary to fight the rise of fascism in Canada, which suddenly is a huge problem there apparently.



She explained that honk-honk, the honking by truckers is actually code for a Nazi salute. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



YA'ARA SAKS, CANADIAN LIBERAL MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT: How many guns need to be seized? How much vitriol do we have to see of honk-honk, which is an acronym for ""Hail Hitler,"" do we need to see by these protesters on social media?



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Well, I'm not going to comment on that. We've asked Candace Owens to do it instead. She's our friend and the host of ""Candace."" We're happy to have her join us tonight.



Candace Owens. Thanks so much.



I'm going to stop right there and just hand it to you.



CANDACE OWENS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: What can I say? Have you ever been stuck in traffic? It's very clear that when people honk their horns, what they are trying to do is salute Adolf Hitler. I think that's exactly what's going on.



I mean, this is so pointedly ridiculous. Let me give you a foreign policy update in terms of what we've got going on in this country. To our north, we've got essentially somebody who's declared himself to be a dictator for all intents and purposes. Don't worry, he said it's only short term. I'm sure it's short term like two weeks to slow the spread of the honking of the Hitler supporters, right?



To our south, we have an invasion happening. You know, people walking over our border unchecked has been going on. And yet meanwhile, the mainstream media narrative keeps insisting that we need to pay attention to Russia, right? And if you try to focus and say: No, we've got some real problems in the West, you have people in Canada. I spoke with one of these organizers today.



You know, they're getting arrested, not only are they getting arrested, completely nonviolent protest, zero bail being offered to them, right, that they're not allowing some of these people, the main leaders out of prison, and they are really trumped up charges that really mean absolutely nothing, except you've messed with the state and now you're going to face the consequences, something that you might see, by the way, under the reign of somebody like I don't know, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, all these things that they keep calling us is exactly what they're guilty of.



God forbid, you ask people in our mainstream media to cover what is going on in Canada, they're having their bank accounts shut down, not just the organizers, by the way, people that gave them pizza, brought them food, brought them a cup of coffee. You have restaurants nearby in Ottawa, who are having police knock on their doors, and they're being served papers. And they're being told: Hey, your bank accounts are now going to be shut down pending further notice.



That young man that I was speaking with today told me that they can't feed their families, they can't go out and buy anything. Everything is completely frozen until their dictator, Justin Trudeau, decides that he is going to do something about this.



And this is not going to end by the way. Exactly what they want you to focus on is Russia, though, right? Russia. It is just coming back, the Soviet Union is coming back. Communism is coming back. And they're trying to tell us to ignore what's happening here in the West?



I mean, it's absolutely mind boggling what's taking place. People need to stay focused and keep talking about what's happening at home, because I believe that the threat that's happening domestically is way more significant.



CARLSON: So you've got nonviolent protesters being held without bail. I'm not much of a dot connector, but I feel like there's a familiar template for that.



OWENS: Yes, there absolutely is. And just again, imagine they're shutting down their bank accounts. You understand the threat that we are facing when they can reach in and they can say: Guess what, Tucker? You have no more access to your cash because you questioned the state.



By the way, once upon a time when were we told this was a small fringe protest, right? I mean, everything that they have tried has implicated to me that they're running out of things to do, right. They tried to smear these people off the bat. Nazis. Remember, they absurdly said, they're waving Confederate flags. Like why are Canadians waving Confederate flags, which is completely irrelevant to Canadian history, it doesn't even make sense.



They tried Operation January 6, as I like to call it, it didn't work. People are waking up and understanding the tyranny, and I think more and more, the state is going, we don't have control of the narrative anymore. No one is believing us anymore.



So they're doing their usual theatrics, trying to drop Hitler's name to pretend that these people are anything more than hard working individuals that are absolutely sick of the tyranny, which is what's happening in America as well.



We are being disillusioned with our government. We're on a pursuit of truth. And you're going to see that they're going to increase their iron grip, because they realize they're losing control.



CARLSON: Now, I'm not sure what that has to do with Eastern Ukraine, but I appreciate you. You're pretty good, Candace Owens.



OWENS: This is what they want us to focus on.



CARLSON: The biggest problem is the ones we ignore.



OWENS: Russia, look over there.



CARLSON: Great to see you tonight. Thanks a lot.



OWENS: Thank you.



CARLSON: So LaToya Cantrell is the new Mayor of New Orleans, one of our greatest cities, which needs a lot of help. She's not helping. She just reinstated the city's indoor mask mandate that's in effect through Mardi Gras. That would be March 1st, next week.



So according to LaToya Cantrell, the mandate is necessary because these are just not normal times.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MAYOR LATOYA CANTRELL, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: It does give us some sense of a normal, bringing back some normalcy. But at the same time, it's very important for everyone to recognize and realize that we are not under normal times.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Yes, so wear your obedience mask. Well, if you happened to attend the mayor's Mardi Gras Ball last Friday night, you know, it was actually a pretty normal time for LaToya Cantrell. She was letting the good times roll.



As you can see here, she is dancing, carefree, her face, butt naked, the whole time.



So the people in power don't follow their own rules, a lot of them don't pay taxes to the government they run. But nobody cares. Meanwhile, the C.D.C. has just admitted they're not releasing any data on COVID hospitalizations and booster shots because that might be misinterpreted by you. Okay.



Brit Hume is FOX News's senior political analyst. We're happy to have him join us tonight. So we've done so many of these stories, Brit. Do you think people care? Should they care?



BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I think these politicians who issue mask mandates and then go out in public with no mask on. That's a problem. People see that. It's obvious hypocrisy. There's been tons of it. People are attuned to it.



And I think that you have to put that down as an almost incomparable political blunder.



CARLSON: Yet these people keep doing it again and again. And it's just like -- and you're always reading a politician, politicians who don't pay their taxes. I think -- you pay yours, right? I pay mine. We have to.



HUME: Boy, do I ever.



CARLSON: Do you ever. But a lot of them don't. I mean, a lot of them don't.



HUME: Yes, I know. This episode has revealed a lot to a lot of people about how these politicians behave, how arrogant they are, how entitled they are and how entitled they feel.



And then of course, you turn to the matter of the C.D.C. that you just mentioned.



CARLSON: Yes.



HUME: That's a wonderful example. There are other things about hypocrisy.



CARLSON: Right.



HUME: The C.D.C. think it is about two other things about. It's about incompetence, because the one thing you know about agencies like the CDC is they gather a lot of data and do a poor job of getting it organized, checked, collated, and issued in a way that's meaningful.



CARLSON: Yes.



HUME: On top of that, though, we found out in this episode that they were concerned about data, particularly related to 18 to 49-year-olds, I think that was the age group and the effect of the vaccine on them, and the data made it look as if the vaccines really weren't effective, right? Because obviously, these are people who are the least likely -- not the very least likely, but among the least likely to be affected by COVID, anyway.



CARLSON: Yes.



HUME: So what they did was, they withheld the data in the hope that it wouldn't -- that getting it out there, they are worried about it discouraging people from getting shots.



Now remember, Fauci at the beginning on masks, masks, he said, didn't really afford any protection, you shouldn't get them, right? Then he later would say, well, you should get them and he became an ardent advocate of masks, and the whole idea of the first go round was, he didn't want people to go out and buy all the masks so that the healthcare workers who needed them, so desperately wouldn't have them.



And then, of course, he kept moving the goalposts later on, on what level of vaccination in the country would give us herd immunity and he kept doing that, changing it. Right? The reason for that was, he wanted to continue the pressure on people to get vaccinated.



Now, this is the use of information not to inform people, but to manipulate them.



CARLSON: Yes.



HUME: And that has been the fact throughout all this, and it suggests one further thing. These politicians and these other leaders, healthcare officials, and the rest of them, they don't trust the public at all. They don't think the public can be trusted with the information to make the right decisions. That's where we are, and we've seen that throughout this whole pandemic.



CARLSON: But trust is reciprocal. And, you know, if you behave that way, people will not trust you ever again.



HUME: Exactly, right. And that's where we are. I mean, the loss of trust in these public health officials is just extraordinary. You see it in the polling, you see it everywhere. And that's the fruits of this business of being willing to mislead to tell the so-called noble lies that are supposed to have some better purpose, and maybe they do, but look at where it has brought these health officials.



CARLSON: It's upsetting. I mean, I've never trusted politicians, but the core American institutions like the C.D.C. or the F.B.I., like you need to trust them.



HUME: Yes, and we always have.



CARLSON: Yes, I always have. I don't anymore.



Brit Hume, thank you.



HUME: You bet.



CARLSON: Well, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick has been thinking a lot about how to stop public universities in his state from encouraging racial discrimination. His proposal would mean ending tenure for any professor pushing racism.



He joins us next to explain.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well, it's easy to make fun of Canada where apparently honking your horn is now some kind of Nazi salute. They've got a massive Nazi problem in Canada.



But then if you live in this country, maybe you don't mock so much because Seattle, which is a city in our country has just ended a law that required people to wear helmets while riding bikes. Now, that's good. There shouldn't be a law about that, do it if you want. It's the reason they ended that law that Jason Rantz will explain to us tonight.



Jason is our man the Pacific Northwest. He's got the story for us. Hey, Jason.



JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Hey, welcome to another edition of everything is racist. This time, it is bicycle helmet laws that are racist because Black bicyclists were given tickets at a disproportionate rate than White bicyclists.



Now, this claim is originally based on a non-peer reviewed report by a woke PhD student over at the University of Washington. This was an attempt to tie bicycle infractions to instances of racist policing.



So across the City of Seattle and King County as a whole, it's a $30.00 ticket if you're not wearing a helmet while riding your bike, but after the first couple of years, it pretty much wasn't enforced. And yet the King County Board of Health decided to look into the ticket distribution as part of their commitment to what they define as equity because they were inspired by the BLM Movement.



So this report says Black bicyclists are ticketed nearly four times more than White bicyclists for not wearing a helmet. But the data represents under 300 total tickets to Black cyclists given out over 13 years, and some of the people who were ticketed were homeless, most likely riding stolen bikes, which likely caught the attention of the cop at the moment that they gave out this ticket.



Nevertheless, it was enough for the whole King County Board of Health by a vote of 11 to two to repeal the law because they say the research that I just cited shows that quote, ""Racist and discriminatory enforcement came as a result of that, except the research doesn't actually show that it disproportionately targeted anybody.



It doesn't say why the numbers are what they are, it also doesn't say that Whites aren't wearing helmets, but getting a pass for it. They make up the majority of the tickets. All the data shows is that Black bicyclists in Seattle just happen to not wear helmets as much as the White bicyclists. That's all it shows.



Whites were ticketed, by the way 10 times more often than Asian riders. So if this was intended to be some sort of racist law, it wasn't very good at it.



To your point, go ahead and oppose this law for legitimate reasons wanting to focus on personal responsibility, I think that is a legitimate argument. But the logic here is absurd. So apply it in this way. The majority of gang members in the State of Washington are Black and Latino, so that means arrests associated with gang violence will disproportionately impact Blacks and Latinos.



So should we get rid of enforcement? Should we stop going after the drive- by shooters because of that? No, of course not. It is absurd.



CARLSON: But New York City -- that PhD student should do a study on why all the self-hatred in the Pacific Northwest? There is a bottomless well of it. It would be interesting to know what that's about.



RANTZ: No kidding.



CARLSON: Jason Rantz, great to see you tonight. Thank you.



RANTZ: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: So the purpose of granting tenure to university professors was to encourage free speech and independent thought. Has it worked? No, it hasn't. Dissent is crushed.



So Dan Patrick is the Lieutenant Governor of the Great State of Texas and he has thought about this problem a lot and believes he has a solution. The Lieutenant Governor of Texas joins us tonight.



Thank you for coming on. Appreciate it.



So tenure, do you think it's fulfilled its purpose?



LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK (R-TX): So about a week ago, the Faculty Council at the University of Texas, they said that they're going to teach critical race theory, and then they followed up with something that really got my attention that got my attention. But then they said, the faculty council takes the position in this resolution, that the council authority shall never, ever have any intrusion from anyone outside, including the legislature or the Board of Regents.



In other words, you can't tell us anything about how we perform our job, what we teach the students or what we say. And I thought, just who are these people that think that somehow academic freedom, which we support gives them the ability to be unaccountable to anyone, including the taxpayers, including their Board of Regents, they want to be able to say anything to anyone.



And Tucker, we've talked about critical race theory a lot, but people still sometimes don't understand the difference and we want race to be talked about as Republicans, myself as Lieutenant Governor, I want slavery to be examined. I want racism in America to be examined through the years, whether it's in the business sector, or the private sector, in sports.



But critical race theory doesn't teach that, it teaches that because you're White, you're a racist and because you're a person of color, you're a victim and they want to teach through critical race theory, that we are a nation that's racist, and everything is based on racism, and that's what critical race theory is and that's what we cannot allow our professors to teach the young men and women to come to university. We banned in Texas in K through 12 this year.



CARLSON: It's a racial attack. It's attacking people based on color of their skin.



PATRICK: Yes.



CARLSON: Why don't you just fire anybody who pushes racial attacks in a publicly funded university, and they can do something useful, like drive delivery vans?



PATRICK: Yes, so there's something called tenure, and once you get tenure, it comes every six years, no matter what you do, no matter how bad you are, no matter what you do, they can't fire you. I mean, there's some cause. But it never happens. So once they get tenure, they can say and do anything in the classroom they want.



Remember, these are people making a lot of money. Most of them on average, they only teach two or three classes a week or a semester. They don't work really hard. But it's almost impossible to fire them. So what I proposed is this.



We're going to end tenure. No more tenure for the new hires. And for all the tenured professors now that are reviewed every six years, they'll be reviewed every year and one of the reasons for calls that you could be fired is if you teach critical race theory.



We have to stop this attack on White America and Black America and Brown America. This is the most divisive thing we have seen in my lifetime.



And Tucker, I'm old enough to be around what I remember as a kid, colored fountains and white fountains, those were terrible times in our society, and we must teach a new generation of young people about that.



But we don't walk in to a classroom and we don't want a professor to say oh, by the way, you're White, you're a racist. That's the way you were born. It's normal. That's who you are. And you, you're of color. You're a victim, whatever you get, you depend on that guy.



That's not America and that is not what we stand for.



CARLSON: Yes, these are the least impressive, most poisonous people in our society and they're the ones with guaranteed jobs. Yes, I don't so.



PATRICK: No one gets a guaranteed job in America. No one gets a guaranteed job including us.



CARLSON: Especially not poison peddlers who are pushing race discrimination on children, they should be fired.



PATRICK: Right.



CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on. Godspeed in this effort. Thank you.



PATRICK: Thank you, Tucker.



CARLSON: Dan Patrick, the Lieutenant Governor, thanks.



So politicians and their friends in the media continue to hyperventilate, push hysteria about Russia and Ukraine, which we will restate is not a democracy.



Victor Davis Hanson has been watching all of it and joins us in a moment to help us make sense of it. We will be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well, just a day after declaring himself King of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced that he is going to sanction Russia in the name of protecting democracy in Ukraine, which is not a democracy.



Joe Biden has also announced sanctions to save democracy. What is going on here? Can anybody speak in an honest declarative sentence?



Well, one man we know can, his name is Victor Davis Hanson. He is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. We're always grateful to have him join us. Professor, thanks so much for coming on.



Well, if you would make some sense of this, please?



VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you for having me.



Yes, I think, you know, when we look at 20 years of Putin's role, we know that he has a desire to restore the borders of the Soviet Union, but it's very hard for him because he's got a hundred million fewer people and he has lost about 25 or 30 percent of his territory, some of it very rich.



So why did he in 2008 go in to Georgia? Why in 2014 did he go into western Ukraine in Crimea and why now he may go in, excuse me, eastern Ukraine, he may go into western Ukraine now?



So I think it's better, since that's a constant to look at us, us being the West, and particularly the United States. When the United States pumps oil and the West is not dependent on oil and the price is moderate worldwide, Putin doesn't have a lot of cash and we are not desperate for oil, we're not doing what we're doing now begging him to pump oil.



But when you start to restrict it, as we did in 2014, as we didn't have it in 2008 and we went down by almost three million barrels in one year, then we're vulnerable. And that raises flags, and Putin gets you know, he gets an appetite.



Second thing is when NATO -- remember Tucker, it's got a billion people, it's got an economy, a GDP eight times larger than Russia, when it meets its defense commitments and most people pay the two percent and Turkey and Germany, which are the two largest countries in NATO, like the United States better than they do Russia, and they pull more akin to Russia now than they do us, then Putin seems to stay where he is.



And finally, and most importantly, when the United States is confident, and the United States talks softly, but it has capability rather than loudly with a twig, Putin is deterred.



So if you're Barack Obama, and you that Russians can't do anything, and they're incompetent, but at the same time, you invite him into the Middle East or you beg him to behave during your re-election effort, or you're Joe Biden, and you call him a killer, or you call him a bully, but then you beg him to say, oh, put 16 entities off your hacking list for us, or you skedaddle from Afghanistan, then you've got problems, and that's where we are.



So we know what Putin is. We know what he does. But we are very erratic and we don't follow a proven protocol that would convince Putin and his advisers in a cost to benefit analysis, stay within your borders, because we don't have a lot of oil, petro dollars. They're pretty confident the world price is stable. NATO seems to have it together.



The United States is very careful, sober, judicious, but it's got enormous confidence and power, and yet, we violated all of those and no more so than the last year.



CARLSON: It just seems like it's going to be difficult to talk back from this ledge of principle that the Biden administration has constructed. I'm not sure what the principal is, do you know in our 25 seconds we have left?



HANSON: I think the principle is a word that -- I'm a realist, so I think the principle is just simply pump three more million barrels of oil very quickly, get on more on the market, get Federal leasing, stop demonizing him and start showing strength.



Get Germany and Turkey back as real members of NATO, and don't call him a killer unless you can back it up and we're not going to back it up. So that's what caused peace, 20 years, he has only done this three years.



CARLSON: That's an entirely fair principle worth defending. Victor Davis Hanson for us tonight, great to see you.



HANSON: Yes.



CARLSON: Thank you.



HANSON: Thank you.



CARLSON: We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well, we are out of time sadly. We'll be back tomorrow night and every week night, 8:00 PM. The show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.



Have the best night with the ones you love.



Here is the Great Sean Hannity.

Tucker reveals how US conflict with Russia benefits China,"This is a rush transcript from ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" January 24, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.



When permanent Washington pushes for war with Russia, who benefits? We don't ask that question enough. The United States certainly doesn't benefit, that's obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a second. It's so glaringly obvious, in fact that the people pushing this war immediately denounced you as a traitor, if you point that out. They are betraying our country's interest, but somehow you're the one who's disloyal.



Ukraine's borders are sacred. Our borders are racist. Shut up, Putin stooge.



But wait a second, why is it disloyal to side with Russia, but loyal to side with Ukraine? They're both foreign countries that don't care anything about the United States. Kind of strange.



It's all an absurd performance, but it's all they've got in the end. The fact is, Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to the United States. No rational person could defend a war with Russia over Ukraine. Nobody thinks a war like that would make America safer or stronger and more prosperous.



Have you taken a look at our economy, recently? Dangerous levels of inflation, a workforce in disarray, wildly chaotic swings in financial markets, in case you haven't noticed. Will joining a conflict in Eastern Europe fix any of that? Come on? Of course not. It'll make it worse.



If the neocons aren't restrained, and soon, Americans are going to be a lot poorer. So why are they doing this? That's a complex question. Hubris, stupidity, the damaged psychological makeup of our leaders, massive lobbying campaigns by Ukrainian politicians and American defense contractors -- all of those factors play a role in this. No tragedy has a single cause.



But what's not at all complicated is who benefits from our conflict with Russia. China benefits. Period. The Chinese government is the only certain winner here. We can give you many examples to illustrate this, but consider the latest economic sanctions the White House has proposed against Russia.



The Biden administration may use something called the Foreign Direct Product Rule to cut off Russia's supply of semiconductors made with American technology. This would, in the hopeful assessment of ""The Washington Post,"" quote, ""Potentially deprive Russian citizens of some smartphones, tablets, and video game consoles."" So depriving Russian citizens is good we are told because Russian citizens are bad. Okay.



But what are the long term effects on us? Russians are still going to have smartphones. They always get their components somewhere else, meaning from China. The Chinese have already pledged to help and they have every incentive to make good on that promise.



In other words, the Biden administration will have succeeded in continuing to drive our two main global rivals closer to a permanent alliance with one another. How does that help America? Well, it doesn't.



Over time, it's dangerous and not just militarily. The only reason the U.S. government can enforce international sanctions is because the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency. Russia and China don't like this, obviously.



So let's say they've convinced other global powers that the U.S. government was abusing its monopoly on monetary control. If they do it to us, they might do it to you, they would say, and then other countries decided to drop the U.S. dollar in favor of a new currency. Where would that leave us?



Well, suddenly, the United States would no longer be able to run an economy based on debt. We will be impoverished immediately overnight.



Has no one in Washington thought of this? Apparently not. Imposing tough new sanctions every few months feeds their moral vanity. It makes them feel like good people. What fools they are.



Both parties, by the way, participated in this. Preening about sanctions on television is a lot easier than improving the lives of people in your own country. So, that's what they do.



Here is Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa telling you that protecting Ukraine's sacred borders is much more important than, say, saving Americans in Des Moines from overdosing on drugs. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): So we do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia now. We need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine should they invade.



Certainly, we need to make sure that any defensive aid is in the hands of the Ukrainians, as well as, as much lethal aid as we can provide at this time.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Those are our leaders, totally ignorant, just reading the script. It would be nice to hear someone in the Press Corps -- because it is their job -- ask the obvious follow up, which would be why exactly Senator Ernst, do you believe it is so vital to send more lethal aid to Ukraine and to quote, ""go ahead and impose more sanctions on Russia,"" why? How would she answer that question?



We'll never know how she would answer because no one in the media would ever ask her. Reporters are the most bovine of the herd animals. If the other kids say it's a good idea they assume that it is. Journalists feel that way about everything, but especially about armed conflict.



The longest war in American history just ended this fall when we left Afghanistan. The new consensus in Washington is we need another war, now. That view is especially prevalent in TV news.



Watch this teleprompter jockey try to push our Russia hating Secretary of State into hating Russia even more.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We are proceeding on both paths at the same time, we'll be ready either way. The choice is Vladimir Putin's.



MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS HOST: But what are you negotiating? If Russia is demands are nonstarters, I mean, President Biden has already said Ukraine is not going to join NATO anytime soon. You've made this offer of reciprocal military exercises, what's left to talk about?



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: ""What's left to talk about?"" Too much diplomacy, Mr. Secretary, not enough killing. That's our position. Apparently.



Max Boot of ""The Washington Post"" fervently agrees with this. At this point, every project in Max Boot's life has collapsed into disaster from his personal affairs to the war in Iraq, which he promoted endlessly. Having come to middle age, Max Boot is unequivocally a failure. But he is looking for one last war to redeem it all. He is thinking conflict with nuclear armed Russia could be that war. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: We should be arming the Ukrainians like crazy. We should be preparing for a guerrilla warfare if the Russians go in, and I think the most important thing we can do right now is to lay out a menu of sanctions so that Putin knows exactly what's going to happen to him if he goes over the line, because right now, with these vague threats, he can be left with the feeling well, maybe the U.S. and the Europeans, maybe we're not really going to do anything.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Again, you have to ask yourself, why is it more quote, ""patriotic"" to take one country's side than the other country's side? We have no obligation to defend any country, either one of these countries. Neither one is American, neither one has the same interest as we do. Why is it wrong to support one and not the other?



What's wrong is to support either one of them. Their interests are not the same as ours. They're very different. Max Boot doesn't care. Arm the Ukrainians. Prepare for guerrilla warfare.



Only a man completely insulated from the consequences of his bloodlust could talk like that. There will always be another think tank job for Max Boot and people like Max Boot.



But what's POLITICO's excuse? The factually liberal political blog has been pushing for war in Ukraine for months now. Why? What's in it for them? Well, let's see.



A few days ago, POLITICO published this terrifying headline, quote, ""Psaki: Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine."" The piece goes on to promise that, quote, ""Experts and policymakers are now preparing for a range of escalatory measures."" Well, that sounds scary. We better send billions more in military hardware to Ukraine right away.



Beneath the headline, you learn why POLITICO is interested because the story is quote, ""Presented by Lockheed Martin."" Aha. In other words, defense contractors think it is high time to spend much more on defense contracting in Ukraine. POLITICO is happy to make their case in exchange for money.



Over at ""The Washington Post,"" you may have seen this op-ed with this headline, quote: ""Biden must show that the United States stands ready to support Ukraine militarily if necessary."" Now, that piece was written by a man called Michael Vickers. Who is Michael Vickers? Well, among other things, Michael Vickers sits on the Board of the weapons contractor, BAE Systems. And that would seem relevant, because war with Russia would be potentially in any case, highly profitable for BAE Systems.



But somehow ""The Washington Post"" didn't bother to tell readers about this. It remained undisclosed. So how does this look from across the world? Well, the Chinese must be watching this happen with their jaws open completely delighted. They can't believe their good fortune. They watch as the entire political leadership class of the United States runs at full speed in the wrong direction, away from Asia, which is so clearly the future and toward the murky past on the fringes of Eastern Europe -- Ukraine, Russia.



And the Chinese must be wondering, how could these people be so stupid and so self-destructive?



Elbridge Colby has been warning about this for a very long time. He's a former Trump administration DoD official, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Elbridge, thanks so much for coming on.



It does seem clear if you take three steps back and tune out the noise about our sacred alliance with Ukraine, not clear where that comes from. But step away and look at the world. It's pretty obvious the people running things are looking in the wrong direction.



ELBRIDGE COLBY, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Absolutely, Tucker, and great to be with you. I mean, China is by far the biggest challenge to American interests in the way that you're talking about it at home, which is really going to affect our economy, our lives, our prosperity, and our freedoms.



And look, the future of the world is going to be settled in Asia. It is going to be over 50 percent of global GDP. Europe is moving down to 10 percent and so, I think you're right. I mean, the Ukraine situation may concern us to some degree, but it's far, far from the most significant thing and the fundamental reality is we have to make choices.



You talked about the currency, but it's just as true in the military context.



CARLSON: Yes, I'm just a little bit mesmerized by this question that it is patriotic to support Ukraine. I mean, just speaking for myself, I have no allegiance to either one. I don't have a deep interest actually in either one. No connection whatsoever. Don't speak the language, never been there.



But why is it axiomatic that supporting Ukraine is your duty as an American citizen? Where does that come from? Do you know?



COLBY: Well, it's not axiomatic. I mean, I think it's been, you know, a problem or a product of the last generation of hubris, the neoconservative dominance, and essentially getting disconnected from regular Americans' interest.



Look, I think it is really important for us to be strong in the world, and to, you know, defend our interests. But we've got to be clear about those and really connect, you know, very directly to Americans' interests. And again, that's really about Asia. It is where the future of the world is going to be determined and Eastern Europe, particularly, you know, Ukraine is not -- it's not critical to that, and it's actually distracting us.



So I think it's a product of the hubris and people kind of drinking the Kool-Aid and acting as if there are no constraints, and they are kind of paying the price with other people's lives and money, frankly.



CARLSON: Just for context for our viewers who may not be familiar with the fantastic book you just wrote. You are not an isolationist. You think the United States has an important role to play in the world. You're not saying withdraw from everything.



I don't mean to speak for you, I just want to be clear. You are saying, no, we're just not looking in the right place.



COLBY: Yes, I mean, actually, my instincts, honestly, are non- interventionists. There is probably one narrow war I've supported in my adult lifetime, which is the original mission against the Taliban and al- Qaeda in Afghanistan. That is where my instincts are.



But I think the reality, you know, looking at the world clear-eyed and really connecting it to Americans' interests has to lead you to say we can't leave the world economy to China's tender mercies. And it's not just Xi Jinping, it's the size of the Chinese economy, the size of the military they are building, and the very clear sense that we are getting and you've reported on abundantly, which is what it's going to mean for our prosperity and our liberties.



We're all going to be working for China if we allow that to happen, and I think the effect of what the Biden administration is doing by even talking about 10,000 to maybe even 50,000 soldiers additionally towards Eastern Europe, I mean, that's a one-to-one trade off. That is a catastrophic potential mistake if it's true, but it seems like that's the vibe and these -- you know, a lot of the people in the elite of the administration, the senior ranks in the administration, they really believe it.



And I mean, I don't even question their integrity necessarily, but I do question their judgment.



CARLSON: Nicely put. Elbridge Colby, great to see you tonight. Thank you.



COLBY: Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: Well, because media creations never die, they live forever, the creepy porn lawyer was back in Court today. He is accused of cheating his old friend and client, Stormy Daniels out of a ton of money. FOX's Trace Gallagher, of course has that story for us -- Trace.



TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker.



Federal prosecutors reminded the court today that CPL is accused of stealing $300,000.00 from the woman who made him famous. Remember, the only reason CPL was invited on CNN and MSNBC every night to bash then President Trump is because he represented porn star, Stormy Daniels who wrote a book about her dealings with Donald Trump.



The problem is that while CPL was getting famous, even talking about his own potential presidential run, his law firm was broke and he could no longer afford to pay for his high end cars, luxury vacations in Southern California beach houses, so he allegedly began stealing money from his clients, including Stormy Daniels.



Prosecutors say he forged the porn star's signature on a document that redirected her book advance into his bank account. Defense attorneys say the case is nothing more than a contract dispute and it is notable that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was also in court today.



Cohen, you'll recall, pled guilty to violating campaign finance laws by paying Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged affair with Trump back in 2006. On his way into court today, CPL said this about Cohen. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MICHAEL AVENATTI, FORMER ATTORNEY: I heard about this book that he's got or some podcast Mea Culpa. He should have called it Mea Culprit.



Guy is an absolute dirt bag, dumber than a box of rocks.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



GALLAGHER: CPL was already convicted of defrauding Nike, he has yet to begin serving his two and a half year sentence for that. But he is now suing the Federal Bureau of Prisons saying that while he was in custody awaiting trial, he was mistreated, including only being allowed one book, Trump's ""The Art of the Deal."" -- Tucker.



CARLSON: He's got chutzpah. You've got to give it to him. Convicted felon. CPL. Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you.



A quick programming note, the Season 1 finale of our documentary series, ""Tucker Carlson Originals"" is out this week. It's called ""Hungary versus Soros: The Fight for Civilization."" Absolutely, Soros was highly distressed that we made this, called us names, made threats. But George Soros is a huge and significant player in world affairs. He doesn't want you to talk about him. We have the right to and we did.



You can watch the exclusive preview right now. You can get 30 days free of FOX Nation by going to tuckercarlson.com.



Well, a group of censored physicians and scientists convened in Washington today to have an honest conversation about the coronavirus and how to treat it. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin hosted that panel. He joins us next with what he learned.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well today, Joe Biden mistaking himself for an emperor informed reporters, we don't want to hear any shouted questions on Ukraine, so FOX's Peter Doocy trying to be polite, tried to ask him a question about inflation instead and here's what happened next.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Do you think inflation is a political liability ahead of the midterms?



JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's a great asset. More inflation. What a stupid son of a [bleep].



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: What a nasty old man. Our Peter Doocy went on TV shortly after that, took it in stride. He's no Jim Acosta, he said, quote, nobody has fact checked Joe Biden yet and said it's not true. Biden, for his part doesn't even remember saying it.



Thousands of Americans gathered in the nation's capital over the weekend protest against vaccine mandates. Here's what it looked like.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For 20 plus months we serve in the community, and now, we are asking you to join ranks with the red line and fight these mandates with us.



DR. PETER MCCULLOUGH, PROTEST AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES ATTENDEE: You have the freedom to determine what happens to your body. That is your sole possession. In many ways, it's the only thing you really have.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Or used to have. That was Dr. Peter McCullough. He was one of several physicians who spoke today at a Senate panel called ""COVID-19: A Second Opinion,"" something we've needed for an awfully long time. Dr. Robert Malone, one of the people who worked on mRNA technology very early also spoke. Here's what he said.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



DR. ROBERT MALONE, MRNA EXPERT: These vaccines are designed for the original Wuhan strain, but are mismatched for omicron. They do not prevent infection, viral replication, or spread to others. In other words, the vaccines are leaky. They have poor durability. And even if every man, woman, and child in the United States were vaccinated with these products, they cannot achieve herd immunity.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Right. So that's not an opinion. The numbers are very clear about that. Why is no one saying that? Why is anyone who does say it censored? What the hell is going on here?



Senator Ron Johnson serves Wisconsin. He is one of the very few people in the entire U.S. Congress who is willing to ask that question. He organized these COVID panel. He joins us tonight.



Senator, thank you for coming on and for doing what you did today. What stuck out? What did you learn today?



SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, you know, I actually sought out a second opinion, very early in the pandemic. So I've been connected to this global network of eminently qualified doctors and medical researchers and scientists that have just had a different opinion on coronavirus, on the disease, on the vaccines, on our response. And I'm hoping what the American public learn, those that watched it is that these eminently qualified individuals have a different approach, a different opinion that is not as divisive, isn't as insane as our approach has been, and quite honestly isn't as deadly.



Anybody that looks at our response, you know, driven -- mismanaged by Anthony Fauci, has got a look at the fact 889,000 Americans are dead. We rank 22nd in terms of deaths per million, over 2,600. Sweden, is I think, in the 70s at 1,500.



So the fact of the matter is, we should have been exploring and researching early treatment, and I certainly learned from doctors who've been treating, having the courage and compassion to treat COVID that it's an entirely treatable disease, probably hundreds thousands of people lost their lives that didn't have to.



But I also hope that the people start looking at, if you're going to get a second opinion, go to a doctor who actually has the courage and compassion to treat COVID as opposed to those that sit in their ivory towers or in their bureaucratic offices, never see a patient but just make all these pronouncements say they are science as they ignore science.



CARLSON: May I ask you this -- it may need a longer answer than the minute we have, but have you reached a conclusion on why from the very beginning they have discouraged treatment of the disease and basically told people wait until you're almost dead to show up at the hospitals? Is there an explanation for that?



JOHNSON: I have my suspicions. I mean, if you take a look at the money approach, one of the things revealed is the only drugs that the health agencies have recommended are -- they start at about 500 bucks a pop, going up to about 3,500. All novel drugs produced by the pharma companies, whereas the ones that they've trashed that have decade's worth of very good safety profiles, they have completely ignored, but these things are often pennies a dose. You go figure that.



CARLSON: It's unbelievable. Senator Ron Johnson, a brave voice on this question. Thank you



JOHNSON: Thanks for having me on.



CARLSON: Well, here's one of the sadder stories. I wish we did more of these, Scott Duncan is a fighter pilot. He's Lieutenant Colonel the United States Marine Corps. He has filed a religious exemption to the military's vaccine mandate, and it has not been approved. Right now, it's on appeal.



So far, the U.S. military has issued just two religious exemptions total. If Mr. Duncan's appeal does not succeed, he will be discharged from the military. The military will lose hundreds of experienced pilots due to this mandate.



Lieutenant Colonel Scott Duncan joins us tonight.



Lieutenant Colonel, thanks so much for coming on. And I think of the experienced pilots that the U.S. military, the Marine Corps, this country stands to lose, you've got to be, you know, in the top quartile for experience. I think you've flown over 300 combat missions over 200 carrier landings. You know, you've got to kind of wonder who at the military is prioritizing a vaccine over that kind of experience defending the country. What's your conclusion?



LT. COL. SCOTT DUNCAN, U.S. MARINE CORPS: Well, thank you, sir. Yes, thank you, sir, for the opportunity to join you tonight, specifically to be able to convey our personal experiences and just understand that as an active duty service member, these views are not held by the United States Marine Corps or the Department of Defense.



But, we do believe that yes, we have a reasonable argument. We've asked our leadership immediately, as well as our congressional leadership to inquire as to really the cost benefit analysis of losing several hundred very qualified aviators. The average timing grade for those aviators is 14 years. And also to just consider the second and third order effects and consequences of what they had to offer.



I'm not unique in my situation. There are many incredibly qualified individuals with a tremendous amount of experience and we believe that that can be a detriment to national defense in the event we separate that many aviators.



CARLSON: Yes, I mean, you could make a lot more flying corporate or for the airlines than you're making now, you and all the rest of these guys. So you've got to think you're doing this for a reason, a noble reason.



Let me ask you about the grounds of the exemption that you're requesting. It's a religious exemption.



DUNCAN: Yes, sir.



CARLSON: How would you characterize your -- the problems that you have with the vaccine?



DUNCAN: Well, the problems we had personally with the vaccine, and we understand there is a reasonable disagreement. We do disagree with the pedigree and the technology maturation over time. That's one issue. The other is just a conviction by the Holy Spirit and I believe we are led in that fashion and we do not have any peace about the vaccine itself.



And we also believe that we have an inherent right to our own body. We believe that that is a right that is conferred on us from a Maker and Creator, and that that is the foundation of the Constitution which we defend. So those were all the basis primarily of the religious accommodation that has been both requested, denied, and then subsequently appealed.



CARLSON: I mean -- I just -- I cannot resist asking you, flown over 300 combat missions. I assume you thought when you were flying those and risking your life and landing on carriers at night, the most dangerous thing any human being can do that you were defending the U.S. Constitution, in other words, you're right to have your own religious views. Didn't you think that?



DUNCAN: Yes, sir. No, and we absolutely -- I mean, we believe everything we've done up-to-date in honorable service, as well as what we're doing now is consistent with those views. That view is just not shared by some leadership within the Department of Defense and so we believe this is a very reasonable and above reproach way to express our concerns.



CARLSON: Yes, that's just there -- you're so restrained and gentlemanly, and I appreciate that. But underneath it all, it is one of the sadder stories ever. So we're certainly rooting for you. Thank you very much for coming on tonight.



DUNCAN: Thank you for having me, sir.



CARLSON: Of course. People are dying across the country from violent crime. That crime is a result of policy decisions that Democratic leaders made.



CNN is -- because it serves the Democratic Party -- downplaying and dismissing those deaths. It's an amazing thing to watch and we have the tape and the stats.



We'll be right back.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: One of the great mysteries of our age as the transgender ideology erases the very notion of a woman, women and girls are not a category in longer -- is where are the self-described defenders of women and girls? The feminist movement. They've been silent because they've been taking money to shut up.



Kara Dansky will not be quiet. She is a lifelong feminist liberal who used to work at the ACLU who stubbornly continues to believe in the truth in human biology. She has been relentlessly attacked for that. She is a very brave person and very articulate.



We sat down with her for a long interview on ""Tucker Carlson Today."" Absolutely worth watching. Here's part of it.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: You said that this is an assault on language. That's one of the first things you said. What is -- what do you mean by that?



KARA DANSKY, FEMINIST: So let's take for example, pregnant people. We're seeing a lot of people including members of the United States Congress using language like pregnant people.



Now, every human being knows that only women can get pregnant. But for some reason, we're seeing a shift in language where people are required, socially coerced to say things like pregnant people.



Now, I'm concerned because I think it's very easy for conservatives to brush that off as lunatic leftism. And to be clear, it is insane to refer to pregnant people. It's absolutely ridiculous. And we can and should mock it mercilessly, but it would be a mistake to just dismiss it as lunacy on the left.



CARLSON: Yes. Yes, only the left understands the importance of language. I've always thought this. Sorry, I'm interrupting you. Please go on, I agree.



DANSKY: That's okay. So, it would be a mistake to dismiss it as leftist lunacy because it is a very deliberate move to persuade and manipulate Americans to dissociate our minds with the material reality of our physical bodies.



If we can persuade Americans that people get pregnant, then we have separated pregnancy from femaleness.



CARLSON: And there are a lot of radical elements in American politics. I don't want to single anyone out, but the transgender activists have got to be near the top of the radical list, just for their willingness to get right in people's faces, call their employers. There have been threats of physical violence.



DANSKY: Well, think about that in the terms of arguments that we're dealing with a marginalized community. Really? A marginalized community can get people fired? Persuade an entire industry, the journalistic -- you know, journalism to cave on journalistic integrity by being completely disingenuous.



""Washington Post,"" and ""New York Times,"" MSNBC, they are completely disingenuous when they report on this. ""Washington Post"" democracy dies in darkness. Really? They are completely disingenuous, and they're reporting on this because an industry persuaded them to do it. Marginalized community? You've got the entire -- you've got the -- you've got the President issuing an executive order the first day upon taking office to redefine sex, to include gender identity throughout Federal administrative law. Marginalized? I don't think so.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Probably fair to say Kara Dansky doesn't have any friends who watch FOX News. She may not have any friends at all, after they see this interview, but she did it anyway because she thinks this subject is that important. It's not just some crazy thing the left is doing. It's the wholesale transformation of our civilization, and we think she's right.



You can watch that whole conversation with Kara Dansky on FOX Nation. You can get it for free at tuckercarlson.com.



So violent crime in major cities is completely out of control. Thousands are dying -- Americans dying. This weekend in Chicago, for example, an eight-year-old girl was murdered. Here's a local news report telling what happened.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eight-year-old Melissa Ortega dead after being struck by stray gunfire according to police. Witnesses say her mom was seen covered in blood outside this Fifth Third Bank along West 26th Street.



Detectives say the offenders were dropped off to the area and confronted a 26-year-old man as he was walking out of a store. The man was shot in the lower back. Bullets also struck this Honda Odyssey shattering the rear windshield glass. According to detectives, another eight-year-old girl was inside at the time, fortunately, unharmed.



At least five kids under the age of 18 have been shot and killed here in Chicago so far this year.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: But it's not just Chicago, it's nationwide. Ten of this country's biggest cities have set all-time homicide records last year, all-time including the dangerous 70s. It is worse now than it's ever been ever in American history.



But at CNN, that's not a problem at all. It was caused by their patrons of the Democratic Party. So of course, they're angry at FOX News for bringing it up. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there is a crime problem, but the way it's described on FOX, you'd be afraid to leave your house.



OLIVER DARCY, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: I kind of think of it as an Instagram filter, Brian. You know, you start with a real image and then you take the filter and you pump it up a thousand percent, and what you're left with is distorted, it no longer reflects reality.



CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The goal of this kind of coverage is to freak people out to cause them to live in fear. Ironically, a lot of the fear mongering is about the things that are not actually mortal threats, and then there is ignoring the things that are mortal threats. You know, COVID isn't real and climate change isn't real. I would argue that to me anyway, those things are a little bit scary or have been scarier at various points in the past couple of years.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: The dumbest person on television, the mask and vax lady who wants you to fear climate change is calling others fear mongers. It's all kind of hilarious, but also sort of awful, too, in that it's too dishonest.



Candace Owens is not dishonest. She is brutally honest. She's the host of ""Candace."" We're always grateful to have her on the show. Candace, thanks so much for coming on, so talking about crime, about people dying by the thousands is now immoral?



CANDACE OWENS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It's like watching CNN offer commentary on CNN. I mean, it's ridiculous. Barring the fact that it is CNN and literally nobody is watching and the viewership is abysmal and almost negligible. The commentary here is awful enough that we should talk about it, because it really speaks to what I've been talking about for the last three years, especially to black America.



You know, liberals show up with their science, then this is an extracurricular activity. Black Lives Matter, defund the police, let's get rid of everything in these inner cities, and let us just let criminals run free.



I always said black America, you're going to be the one left picking up the pieces. It is going to be your neighborhoods that are destroyed, it's going to be your children that cannot walk to school without fear, that there is going to be a gang member on the corner that may shoot them. It's going to be your babies that are sitting in cars, and may be shot by a stray bullet.



We have seen this story over and over and over again, where we have the liberals that are saying, oh, it's not as big of a deal, 25 percent more, who cares? I know there is 25 percent more crime. We're way more focused on climate change. I mean, does that not reek of elitism? Do you really think and I really do challenge these people to go door to door in Chicago and knock on people's door and explain to them that climate change is more of a threat.



Climate change, Tucker, by the way, depending on what generation you're from, you know how that always pans out. My generation, it was global warming. The ice caps are going to melt. That didn't happen. The generation before, it was global cooling, they told everybody, it's going to get so cold that everything's going to freeze over. That didn't happen.



You have a generation that thought that there was going to be acid rain, you know, these IPCC mouths. They keep predicting that never happened. Let's focus on that and not the individuals that are quite literally being slaughtered in the streets, everyday Americans, and they are suffering because of the very policies and the people that we're looking at on this panel.



CARLSON: Well, that's totally right. And what's interesting is, these are people who see everything through a partisan lens. So I've often heard liberals say, well, corona is killing mostly right-wing Republicans, so that's fine.



This violence surge is overwhelmingly killing the Democratic base, and speaking for myself, that's not fine. I don't care who they vote for. They're Americans, they're dying. And you would think that the people representing their party would maybe care more than I do, but they care much less. It's so weird.



OWENS: It is weird, and that's why when you're looking at the polls, you're seeing that you're not the only one that's paying attention. You saw this in the President's press conference, they asked Biden flat out, I'm speaking to black Americans on the ground, they're turning away from you. The polls are showing that black Americans are looking in the street, they're seeing these clinics.



You can go shoot dope on the streets of New York City and come out. Good luck if your kid is walking by and this guy is high on methamphetamine and opioid, it doesn't matter, because the Democrats are trying to make these cities more livable for the drug dealers and the criminals, not people that are actually paying taxes and trying to make a decent living.



So yes, they are going to suffer at the polls, and there is no way that they can move the goalposts that is going to change that fact come November.



CARLSON: Yes, you've got to be on the side of decent people who are trying hard, you know, no matter who they vote for, and these people are not on the side of decent people who are trying hard, they are on the side of deviance and the violent and totally anti-social elements. It's really bad, I would say.



Candace Owens, great to see you. Thank you.



OWENS: Absolutely. Thank you.



CARLSON: So parents across the country, not even political people, just people who love their kids are standing up against school districts who are trying to destroy their kids. We have shocking details about one Denver school that is talking to kindergarteners about BLM and transgender ideology. And somehow the school is still open, has not yet been shut down.



We fervently hope it will be, but we've got details, next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well, a new bill just passed the State Senate in Mississippi that would ban public schools from teaching racism. In other words from teaching that any one race is superior to or inferior to any other. You'd think the other 49 states would have similar laws on the book because of course you would never teach racial superiority in school. That's crazy antithetical to everything the country stands for, so you'd think everyone in Mississippi would be thrilled by this. But no, Democrats in the statehouse are so angry they walked out to protest the legislation, which really does tell you everything about where we are right now.



Meanwhile, in Denver, Colorado, an elementary school has announced a plan to quote ""engage kindergartner and first grade students in a BLM week of action."" Right, BLM, of course, the group that's against the nuclear family.



The week will include quote, ""transgender affirming principles,"" the goal is, quote, ""The disruption of Western nuclear family dynamics."" How can this continue? Why is the school still open? Good question.



Horace Cooper is the co-chair of Project 21. He joins us tonight. Horace, thanks so much for coming on.



First to the bill of Mississippi. Unless, I am misreading it, I think it was very straightforward. You're not allowed to teach that one race is better or worse than any other. That's kind of a foundational principle. I thought in America, all decent people believe that. I certainly do. Who could be against that?



HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Well, America came together with what is called the Civil Rights movement for precisely this principle, that all Americans are going to be equal and treated as such under the law the way that our founders actually intended with our Constitution.



The irony to me is that my grandparents and your grandparents and the grandparents of a generation understood this concept, and now we get to us, and suddenly, there are people that actually want not Jim Crow 2.0, they want Jim Crow. Government is going to prefer some groups over other groups precisely because of their race. This is a terrible setback.



And the very month that we set aside to celebrate Martin Luther King, we should really be saddened by this effort on the part of those legislators.



CARLSON: Yes, because it just ends at Rwanda, like how is this going to -- how is this going to wind up? What's the end stage? There's nothing good at all.



I have to ask, if a school is teaching kindergarten and first graders the BLM principles, the nuclear family must be disbanded. Why is the school still open? That's so poisonous. It's so evil, then why isn't there a concerted effort to shut the school down like immediately?



COOPER: Well, you know, this is remarkable what I've been witnessing, so many of the bedrock institutions of America are being literally challenged by actions of progressives. You can say that some on the right have been anti-public education. But there's been no poison, no poison like this.



In the law, there's a term called chilling effect, when things are said or done that cause people not to feel comfortable acting in certain ways. Well, tonight, I'm going to tell you, there's a thrilling effect when the government promises to investigate people who criticize CRT, when all of Big Tech sides with proponents of racial segregation, and then they disavow or shadow ban those who advocate equality. It's the thrilling effect that's in place now.



CARLSON: Telling children the nuclear family must be -- that has to be a red line. You can't put up with that. And I hope that they won't. Horace Cooper, thank you.



COOPER: Thank you.



CARLSON: So here is a very weird story. A group of monkeys being transported to a lab linked to the C.D.C. got away after the truck crashed, several escaped. They were caught and killed. What is the story about exactly? What kind of research was being done on these monkeys? What is this?



We have details straight ahead.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Here's a weird story. On Friday night, a truck carrying a hundred lab monkeys crashed in Pennsylvania, a number of them escaped, three of them. C.D.C. showed up immediately with other authorities, captured them and killed them immediately. Why? What is the story about?



Well, our friend, Trace Gallagher is back. He is on this story for us. Hey, Trace.



GALLAGHER: Hey, Tucker. These were 100 cynomolgus macaques, these are monkeys used in medical studies flown into the U.S. from Eastern Africa. As you said, they were put on a truck headed for an unknown research lab. The truck crashed in rural Pennsylvania and crates full of monkeys spilled onto a road.



Three of the monkeys got loose and State Troopers quickly notified residents not to look for them saying quoting here, ""It is hard to say how they would react to a human approaching them."" But finding the monkeys was clearly an all hands on deck situation because State Troopers, the C.D.C., the Health Department and Pennsylvania Game Commission were all involved, which made one resident very curious.



He said, quoting here, ""We've got bears, we have coyotes, we have deer, you know all the time. A little three pound monkey doesn't scare me. But why are they so concerned about it is what concerns me."" Another resident who saw the crash says she went to help the truck driver who told her he was hauling cats. She looked into a cage saying, ""Hey kitty, kitty,"" when a monkey popped up.



The woman was then told by the C.D.C. to monitor herself for any cold-like symptoms. The C.D.C. also told her the monkeys would be monitored for 31 days, but when the missing monkeys were found, they were not monitored. They were killed. Though the C.D.C. has not said why and the C.D.C. has not said what the lab they were heading to is actually researching. Though the C.D.C. did tell us the monkeys could transmit deadly viruses. A lot of questions in this, getting very few answers -- Tucker.



CARLSON: Why they are so concerned is what so concerns me, it's just so nicely put. Thank you. Thank you for that story, Trace Gallagher.



GALLAGHER: You bet.



CARLSON: And they are fascinating. All right, so head on over to ""Tucker Carlson Today"" featuring our interview with Kara Dansky. That's online. We highly recommend it.



We are out of time, this evening, sadly. But the Great Sean Hannity takes over next for 9:00 PM. Hey Sean.



SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You leave me in a state of fear over the mystery of the monkeys. I appreciate that.



CARLSON: Weird.



HANNITY: Thank you very much.



CARLSON: Good night.



HANNITY: It's a fascinating story. Why did they kill them? It didn't make sense. All right, Tucker, thank you.



CARLSON: Yes.

Defense Secretary Austin says US would enter conflict if Russia attacks Estonia,"In the event that Russia launches an attack or invasion against Estonia, the United States will enter the conflict, according to the head of the Department of the Defense.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III spoke Thursday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. The conference focused heavily on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is approaching its year anniversary.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: BELARUS WILL JOIN FIGHT IF EVEN 'ONE SOLDIER' ATTACKS TERRITORY, PRESIDENT SAYS

Austin was asked by a reporter how the country could be confident they'd have the backing of U.S. military might in the event of a Russian invasion.

""You know, I'll just point to what our president, President Biden, has said a number of times and what I've also said. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. And we take that very seriously and will live up to our commitments,"" Austin told the press.

RUSSIA WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST PROVIDING ARMS TO UKRAINE: 'WILL LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF THIS CRISIS'

Article 5 of NATO’s Washington Treaty is known as ""the principle of collective defence."" It obliges all member countries to come to the aid of another member whose sovereignty or territorial integrity might be under threat .

NATO defines it as being ""at the very heart of NATO’s founding treaty.""

FORMER PUTIN SPEECHWRITER, OTHERS ADDED TO RUSSIA'S 'FOREIGN AGENT' REGISTRY

The defense secretary explained that the US military has maintained a comprehensive presence within the Baltics since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""We also set up, you know, back at Madrid, our president made the decision to rotate forces in and out of the Baltics on a consistent basis in a heel-to-toe fashion so that we had the, you know, consistent presence. We've lived up to that. We'll continue to live up to it,"" Austin said.

Austin touted this level of military presence as a promise kept, stating that similar promises of military support would be kept if necessary.

""And the final thing I would just point out to you is that prior to Russia's invasion, you know, I met with your minister of defense and I told him that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would deploy forces to Estonia the next day. And we did. We were the first to be here and we meant every word we said. And we'll live up to our commitments going forward. So we are committed to to Article 5. And you can bet on it.""

Maine voters' push for public utilities could create ballot conflict,"A group that wants to prevent the creation of a publicly-owned power company in Maine has submitted signatures to the state calling for a referendum to halt the project.

The group is called No Blank Checks and it's supported by the parent company of Central Maine Power, which is the largest utility in the state. The group's petition calls for a ballot question that could require consumer-owned utilities to receive voter approval before taking on more than $1 billion in government debt.

JUDGE DECLINES NEW ENGLAND CLEAN ENERGY CONNECTS' REQUEST TO RESUME CONSTRUCTION ON $1 BILLION POWER LINE

The request for a ballot question sets up a scenario in which there could be dueling referendum questions on the subject in November, the Portland Press Herald reported. A competing group, Our Power, wants to force Central Maine Power and its parent company to sell their assets to a new consumer-owned nonprofit utility. Our Power submitted signatures for its own referendum in the fall and they have already been certified.

Prom night conflict pits Muslim students vs. education officials,"The sun has set on students’ request to change the date of their prom.

Students at an elite New York City high school petitioned to change the date of their senior prom – scheduled for June 3 – because it conflicts with the Muslim observance of Ramadan, but the school has denied the request, the New York Post reported.



“I think it’s kind of unfair because there’s a major population of Muslims at Brooklyn Tech,” Pikeeza Shabbir said.

The annual holy month for Muslims requires that observers consume no food or drink from sunrise to sunset. The Brooklyn Technical High School senior prom starts at 7 p.m. -- while the sun is still out.

The dance was planned months in advance, New York education officials told CBS2, so it will not be rescheduled. Dinner is expected to be served after sunset, at 9 p.m.

Still, Muslim students said eating after sundown is not the only issue; they say there are other religious rules that come into play.

“You’re not supposed to listen to music during Ramadan, so it’s not really allowed,” Shabbir said.

More than 250 students have signed a Change.org petition that argues some of the school’s Muslim students would be unable to attend because of the scheduling with the annual holy month that requires Muslims to fast during the day.

The petition states:



“In 2017, Ramadan is expected to begin on the night of either May 26th or 27th. Brooklyn Tech's Senior Prom is scheduled for June 3rd, a week into Ramadan. The start of this entails many responsibilities to the participants and with Tech's Muslim population being so vast, it is clear the scheduled date will heavily affect the attendance of this significant event of our high school experience.

A change to the date, even a week and a half earlier, would allow so many more people to partake. If no action is taken, Senior Prom truly wouldn't be open to every senior who wants to go.”

The dates for Ramadan are different every year because the holiday is based on a lunar calendar.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/prom-night-conflict-pits-muslim-students-vs-education-officials,N/A
Vaccine mandates create conflict with defiant workers,"Josh ""Chevy"" Chevalier is a third-generation shipbuilder who hasn't missed a day of work during the pandemic in his job as a welder constructing Navy warships on the Maine coast.

But he's ready to walk away from his job because of an impending mandate from President Joe Biden that federal contractors and all U.S. businesses with 100 or more workers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

""People are fighting for their constitutional rights — the way they think their life should be,"" said Chevalier, one of hundreds of employees at Bath Iron Works threatening to leave.

DR. SAPHIER: CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ENOUGH BY LOCKDOWNS. THINK TWICE BEFORE MANDATING A VACCINE FOR KIDS

Chevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms.

The Biden administration, public health officials and many business leaders agree that vaccine requirements are legal, prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide.

The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates.

But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation.

INGRAHAM: BIDEN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CHERISHED FREEDOMS

The refusers come from all types of occupations — defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. In Seattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement.

Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won’t stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired.

Nick Rolovich, the football coach at Washington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing.

The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workers require all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned.

CDC MASK GUIDELINES UNDER REVIEW AS COVID NUMBERS FALL, COLD SEASON BEGINS

Individuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn’t require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring.

Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon’s founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people ""who just want to work and don’t want to get into politics in the office."" More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said.

Some states, including Texas, Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, ""in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you’re making in terms of these injections.""

Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing.

She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease.

FLORIDA FIRE CHIEF: I WAS FIRED FOR REFUSING TO ENFORCE ‘UNLAWFUL’ VACCINE MANDATE

""My family and I, we had a long talk, and I basically don’t want to compromise my values any more,"" said Alfieri-Collins, who hopes to become a nurse practitioner and pursue her own holistic practice.

""I am very sad because I am the type of nurse that loves my patients and my patients love me,"" she said.

Anthony Polenski, director of strategic partnerships for tech recruiting company Jobfuture.ai, said he’s seeing candidates who want to know, ""Will this company force me to take a jab?"" Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate.

""They don’t want their vaccination status attached to their employment,"" he said.

At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members.

On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate.

Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who’ve contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Such infections are rare and vaccinated people who get COVID-19 usually have mild symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalized or die.

The 53-year-old is still deciding whether to get the shot.

""I’m still up in the air,"" he said. ""But I’ve got a huge decision to make.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/vaccine-mandates-create-conflict-defiant-workers,N/A
"A look at Syria's conflict, as mutual enemies close in on IS","The Islamic State group is in retreat across Syria and Iraq, and the contours of a new conflict among the array of parties battling it are already starting to appear.

The U.S. military shot down a Syrian government warplane on Sunday, saying it had targeted an American-allied Kurdish force that is battling the extremists in their de facto capital, Raqqa. That led Russia, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, to warn that it would target U.S.-led coalition planes flying west of the Euphrates River.

Another front is shaping up on the ground below, with Assad's forces, which are also battling the Islamic State group, reaching the Iraqi border in the distant east. There they appear set to link up with Iranian-backed militias, establishing a vital land corridor from Damascus to Tehran.

The latest events are unfolding in Syria's remote east, far from the main battles of the civil war, which is still raging despite a largely ignored ""de-escalation"" plan brokered by Russia, Iran and Turkey.

Here's a look at where things stand for the conflict's main players.

___

PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD

He has survived six years of war and largely defeated the uprising against his family's four-decade rule. Now in control of Syria's five largest cities, Assad is eyeing Deir el-Zour in the east, which has been besieged by IS since 2014.

Retaking Deir el-Zour would help Assad secure access to natural gas and mineral resources, and open a potentially lucrative corridor to nearby Iraq. But the drive toward the border has already brought him into conflict with U.S.-backed opposition forces to the south and east.

___

IRAN

No country has invested more in Assad's survival than Iran, which has sponsored thousands of pro-government militiamen from across the region and injected billions of dollars to keep the economy from collapsing.

Now it appears bent on helping Assad retake the east. On Sunday, Iran lobbed ballistic missiles at IS targets in eastern Syria, the first such attack it has carried out anywhere since at least 2001.

Iran cast the strike as a response to Islamic State attacks in Tehran earlier this month that killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 50. But the Revolutionary Guard said it was sending a broader message to its archrival Saudi Arabia and the United States.

RUSSIA

Russia has been waging an air campaign in support of Assad since 2015, targeting both the Islamic State group and mainstream rebels. Moscow recently claimed to have killed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but that hasn't been confirmed.

For most of the last two years the U.S. and Russia have coordinated their different campaigns in the crowded skies over Syria, but as their allied forces converge in the east that could prove more difficult.

Russia said Monday it was suspending its cooperative mechanism with the U.S. in response to the downing of the Syrian warplane and threatened to shoot down enemy aircraft over Syrian government-held territory in the west.

It could be bluster. Russia suspended the same mechanisms in April after the U.S. struck a Syrian military base in response to a chemical attack, but resumed its participation weeks later.

UNITED STATES

The U.S.-led coalition is providing close air support to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as they fight to retake Raqqa, the capital of the IS group's self-styled caliphate, where the 2015 Paris attacks and other foreign plots have been hatched.

The U.S. also has special operations forces and advisers embedded with the SDF, raising the stakes in the fight for the northern city.

In addition to downing the Syrian jet near Raqqa, the U.S. has also fired on Syrian government forces in the east on three occasions in just the last month. There, Washington backs Syrian opposition forces trained in Jordan.

After the three encounters, Assad's forces wheeled around and seized territory to the north all the way to the Iraqi border, leaving U.S. forces and their allies largely isolated in the southeast and cutting off their path to the Islamic State group.

___

SYRIA'S KURDS

In recent years the SDF has driven IS from much of northern Syria and emerged as the most effective U.S. ally battling the group in Syria.

But its progress has alarmed NATO member Turkey, which views the main Kurdish militia in the group as an extension of the rebels that have waged a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey.

Turkey and the Kurdish fighters have come to blows on a few occasions in recent months, leading U.S. forces to establish a buffer between them.

___

OPPOSITION FORCES

The Syrian opposition, which once dreamed of sweeping into Damascus and toppling Assad, is now largely confined to scattered enclaves in the northwest and south of the country. Peace efforts have stalled, and even the limited ""de-escalation"" agreement has been repeatedly violated.

Beset by internal divisions, with some of the most powerful rebel groups allied with al-Qaida, it's unclear what role the rebels will play as the conflict enters a post-Islamic State phase. Perhaps now, more than ever, Syria's fate appears to be in the hands of competing foreign powers, none of which show any sign of backing down.

AP Explains: Russia's conflict with Ukraine,"next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

Russian border guards opened fire on three Ukrainian vessels in the Kerch Strait near the Russia-occupied Crimean peninsula, raising the prospect of a full-scale military confrontation between the two neighbors. The incident comes on the back of a four-and-a-half year long proxy conflict in eastern Ukraine.

A look at the roots of the conflict and its possible developments:

MILITARY ESCALATION

Tensions have been rising in the Kerch Strait, which links the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, for a few weeks now. Shortly after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel travelling from Crimea in March, Russia increased its military presence in the area and started inspecting all vessels traveling to or from Ukrainian ports, causing days-long delays and disrupting trade. Ukraine has protested the checks, calling them an ""economic blockade."" The European Union earlier this month expressed concern.

___

UKRAINE'S CHOICE: RUSSIA vs. THE WEST

The roots of the current conflict lie in autumn 2013 when the Ukrainian government was due to sign a deal supposed to open European Union markets for Ukrainian goods and put the country on a pathway to possible EU membership. That endangered Ukraine's ties with Russia, its closest neighbor and major trading partner.

The Kremlin vehemently opposed the deal, fearing an uncontrolled flow of goods through what was then virtually an open border. Despite his close ties to Russia, President Viktor Yanukovych publicly pledged to sign the deal — only to walk out on it at the last moment. Massive street protests followed, decrying Yanukovych for what was seen as an attempt to deny Ukrainians a European future. Riot police tried to disperse protesters, triggering clashes that saw 130 people killed in sniper fire. Yanukovych fled the capital to Crimea and was eventually whisked away by Russian special forces to southern Russia. An interim government, made up of the protest leaders, stepped in.

___

CRIMEAN ANNEXATION

In February 2014, Russian officials began arriving in the Crimean peninsula shortly after the pro-Western government took power in Kiev, fanning fears of an onslaught on the Russian heritage in parts of Ukraine including Crimea. Troops without insignia soon appeared in Crimea, occupying crucial infrastructure including Ukrainian military bases. The Kremlin rejected reports that it had dispatched troops to the peninsula, and it was only years later that President Vladimir Putin publicly admitted that these were in fact Russian troops.

In spring 2014, Ukrainian troops largely did not put up resistance and retreated.

Would-be separatist commander and Russian officer Igor Girkin later recounted how he and other Russian officers forced the hand of local lawmakers to pass a motion calling for a referendum to secede and join Russia. An overwhelming majority of votes cast on March 16, 2014, supported the motion. Two days later, Moscow signed a declaration with self-proclaimed Crimean officials, sealing the annexation. Neither the vote nor the annexation was recognized by the United Nations.

___

WAR IN EASTERN UKRAINE

Emboldened by the annexation of Crimea, local activists, propped by Russian operatives like Girkin, began taking over towns and villages in the east and taking down Ukrainian flags. Separatist leaders in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk held contested votes in May 2014 supporting a motion to break away from Ukraine.

Sporadic outbursts of violence and clashes between Ukrainian troops and the separatists spilled over into a full-blown war in May 2014, when Ukraine launched an airstrike on Donetsk airport which was overrun by Russian Chechen fighters.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has since killed more than 10,000 people and displaced over 1 million. Large swathes of this area remain under separatist control.

The Kremlin never admitted its role in the war, portraying it as a civil conflict. But overwhelming evidence suggests that Russia has been sending a sizeable number of troops and advisers as well as weapons to the rebels, helping to tip the conflict in their favor. Media including The Associated Press reported a massive stream of heavy weaponry and tanks crossing in from Russia.

Ukraine signed peace accords with the separatists in 2015, calling for a cease-fire and political settlement in the east. While it helped to decrease the intensity of fighting, the accords did nothing to resolve the region's political stalemate.

___

CHURCH CONFLICT

In the latest manifestation of Ukraine's resolve to break off with Russia once and for all, Kiev has stepped up its efforts to seek independence for its Orthodox church. The church in Ukraine has been tied to the Moscow Patriarchate for hundreds of years, although many parishes have split off over the past two decades to form schismatic churches. Calls for independence have increased since the conflict began.

The Istanbul-based patriarchate, whose head Bartholomew I is considered the ""first among equals"" of Orthodox church leaders, in October made the first step toward recognizing the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The move was decried by the Russian Orthodox Church as well as the Kremlin.

___

WHAT'S NEXT?

While Sunday's incident — which some call the first overt military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine — raises the spectrum of a full-blown conflict, it is not likely that either side would want an all-out-confrontation. By opening fire on the Ukrainian vessels, Moscow reinforced its messaged that Crimea is Russian for good and that Moscow will not allow anyone to question that.

In Ukraine, President Petro Poroshenko is likely to benefit from the martial law that he is proposing to impose. Poroshenko's approval ratings have been in a free fall, and delaying the March presidential elections and playing up the Russian threat could help him get re-elected if the vote is held at a later date.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/ap-explains-russias-conflict-with-ukraine,N/A
"Armenia, Azerbaijan fighting kills dozens as tensions mount in decades-old conflict","Armenian and Azerbaijani forces accused each other of attacks on their territory on Tuesday, as fighting over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh continued for a third straight day after a decades-old conflict reignited.

Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Armenian forces shelled the Dashkesan region in Azerbaijan, while Armenian officials said Azeri forces opened fire on a military unit in the town of Vardenis, west of Nagorno-Karabakh, setting a bus on fire and killing one civilian.

Armenia's Foreign Ministry in a statement “completely” denied reports of shelling the Dashkesan region and said that with those reports Azerbaijan was laying the groundwork for “expanding the geography of hostilities, including the aggression against the Republic of Armenia.""

ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN CLASHES: US, OTHERS MUST INTERVENE AS CONFLICT ESCALATES, EXPERTS SAY

Two days of fighting have killed dozens and left scores wounded. The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Ministry reported 84 servicemen killed so far. Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, said Tuesday that 10 civilians were killed on its side and dozens sustained injuries. He didn't offer any details on the losses among the country's military.

The heavy fighting broke out Sunday in the region, which lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by the Armenian government since 1994 at the end of a separatist war.

Nagorno-Karabakh — a region in the Caucasus Mountains about 4,400 square kilometers (1,700 square miles) or about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware — is 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Armenian border. Soldiers backed by Armenia also occupy some Azerbaijani territory outside the region.

The fighting prompted calls to end the hostilities from around the world.

AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA FIGHT OVER DISPUTED REGION AS TANKS DESTROYED, HELICOPTERS SHOT DOWN

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pushed for an immediate cease-fire in phone calls with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, her office said Tuesday.

Merkel underlined the urgency of “an immediate cease-fire and a return to the negotiating table,” spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.

She told the two leaders that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe offers an appropriate forum for talks and that the two countries’ neighbors “should contribute to the peaceful solution,” Seibert said.

Turkey is supporting Azerbaijan in the conflict, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling on Armenia to immediately withdraw from the separatist region.

“The solution to the problem is simple and there is only one solution: Armenia has to withdraw from the territories it has occupied. If this doesn’t happen, this problem cannot be resolved,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters on Tuesday following a visit to Azerbaijan’s Embassy in Ankara.

The minister said the international community must defend Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity in the same way it defended the integrity of Ukraine and Georgia.

“They must not consider Azerbaijan and Armenia on an equal footing,” Cavusoglu said. “They are holding Azerbaijan, whose territories have been occupied, on an equal footing with Armenia. This is a wrong and unjust approach.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-continue-as-tensions-mount-in-decades-old-conflict,N/A
"Azerbaijan-Armenia fighting leaves 99 dead, Putin looks to 'de-escalate' conflict","Russian President Vladimir Putin is eyeing the consequences of another conflict between two former Soviet Union nations after 99 soldiers were killed in fighting that erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces Tuesday.

The Armenian Defense Ministry said at least 49 soldiers were killed in a shelling attack by Azerbaijani troops just after midnight. Azerbaijan, meanwhile, said that 50 of its service members died in a ""large-scale provocation.""

Fighting has continued off and on throughout the day despite calls for a cease-fire by Russia, which, according to the Kremlin’s press secretary, exerts significant influence in the region.

""It is difficult to overestimate the role of the Russian Federation, the role of Putin personally,"" Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters. ""The president naturally is making every effort to help de-escalate tensions at the border.""

Russia's foreign ministry claimed to have brokered a cease-fire Tuesday morning, though reports later suggested the truce had fallen through.

The Armenian defense ministry said fighting had fizzled out in some areas but that Azerbaijani forces were still attempting to advance into its eastern territory.

Civilian infrastructure was also said to have been damaged in the attacks but casualty figures among civilians in Armenia remain unknown.

Azerbaijan claimed the attacks were in response to ""large-scale provocations"" by the Armenian military after its troops allegedly planted mines and fired upon its soldiers.

The Tuesday conflict stems from decades of aggression over a contested mountainous territory in the South Caucasus known as Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but has been under the control of Armenia-backed forces since 1994.

Russia deployed some 2,000 peacekeeping troops to the region in 2020 as a six-week war killed more than 6,600 people after Azerbaijan reclaimed large areas of the Nagorno-Karabakh and ended only after Moscow facilitated a peace deal.

"China could win military conflict in Indo-Pacific region even 'before America can respond', think tank warns","A new study by a think tank warns the U.S. has lost its military supremacy in the Indo-Pacific region, with China being able to launch and win a military conflict even before American forces are able to respond.

The University of Sydney's United States Study Center released a study on Friday detailing the profound changes it claims is happening in the region, paving way for China to exert more influence.

CHINESE DIPLOMAT WARNS BEIJING ‘WILL NOT SIT ON ITS HANDS’; MILITARY RUNS DRILLS NEAR HONG KONG BORDER

The report, titled “Averting Crisis: American strategy, military spending and collective defence in the Indo-Pacific,” claims that “America no longer enjoys military primacy in the Indo-Pacific and its capacity to uphold a favorable balance of power is increasingly uncertain.”

“America no longer enjoys military primacy in the Indo-Pacific and its capacity to uphold a favorable balance of power is increasingly uncertain.” — The University of Sydney's United States Study Center

The researchers found that although the U.S. military is still perceived as a force to be reckoned with globally, the “combined effect of ongoing wars in the Middle East, budget austerity, underinvestment in advanced military capabilities and the scale of America's liberal order-building agenda has left the U.S. armed forces ill-prepared for great power competition in the Indo-Pacific.”

More alarmingly, the report warns that China would be able to use the U.S. military’s lack of reach in the region to launch a military attack against America’s regional allies and achieve victory even before the U.S. responds, Newsweek reported.

“Having studied the American way of war — premised on power projection and all-domain military dominance — China has deployed a formidable array of precision missiles and other counter-intervention systems to undercut America's military primacy,” the report said.

“By making it difficult for US forces to operate within range of these weapons, Beijing could quickly use limited force to achieve a fait accompli victory — particularly around Taiwan, the Japanese archipelago or maritime Southeast Asia — before America can respond, sowing doubt about Washington's security guarantees in the process.”

The report comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. While the two countries have repeatedly clashed over trade, with President Trump criticizing the Chinese government over policies that he claims hurt the American economy, the U.S. military cautioned China earlier this year over the islands claimed by China in the disputed South China Sea.

Two U.S. warships sailed near islands claimed by China back in May, while two American nuclear-capable B-52H flew over the South China Sea at least twice in March.

The South China Sea has been the site of ongoing tension, primarily between the U.S. and China, which claims nearly all of the strategic waters despite competing claims from other Southeast Asian nations.

But as the U.S. and China engage in more symbolic military moves, the Friday’s study claims the Chinese military could launch a “limited war” to retake Taiwan or fully take control of the disputed islands using not only conventional capabilities but cyber and political weapons as well.

China will impede vital US strategy to stop Ukraine-Russia conflict: Former defense official,"Any economic sanctions NATO imposes against Russia will have minimal impact since China would provide relief in an effort to embarrass the U.S., a former defense official told Fox News Digital.

Diplomatic discussions stalled this week after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken provided a handwritten response to Russian demands. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that the response offered ""little ground for optimism"" but acknowledged ""prospects for continuing dialogue.""

The U.S. has threatened to hit Russia with sanctions – both on the state itself and against individuals, including President Vladimir Putin – should it proceed to invade Ukraine.

But Robert L. Wilkie, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness during the Trump administration and Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that any such economic punishments would not provide the kind of impact American officials believe it will due to Russia's strong bond with China.

""A lot of the talk about economic sanctions is really a pie in the sky because China is now Russia’s banker,"" Wilkie argued. ""Xi Jinping will back Putin if sanctions from the West come.""

NATO ALLIES SEND DEADLY WEAPONS, MUNITIONS TO UKRAINE WHILE GERMANY SENDS 5K HELMETS

""That’s a safety net he probably didn’t have 10, 15 years ago, and China probably wasn’t capable of buttressing the Russian state as it is now,"" he added.

U.S. sanctions on Russia - which might include cutting off Moscow's access to SWIFT and related world banking funds - might simply push Russia to instead increase sales of oil and gas to China: Russia in 2020 accounted for 15.5% of China's imported crude oil, according to Worlds Top Exports. That currently makes Russia the second-biggest oil and gas exporter to China.

""[China] would start buying a lot more energy from Russia,"" Wilkie explained. ""If we went to move on the SWIFT loan system that gives Russia access to western capital, China would pick up the slack with that.""

""Even if the Germans were to do an about-face on the Nord Stream 2, China would pick up the slack - they need the energy as much if not more than Europe does. That's how I would see that playing out,"" he said.

Xi just this week said that China's ambitions of hitting low-carbon goals should not come at the expense of ""normal life,"" claiming that such energy cuts might risk food and other everyday securities. Xi told party leaders late on Monday that China needed to ""overcome the notion of rapid success,"" The Guardian reported.

BIDEN'S WEAKNESS WITH RUSSIA RISKS WAR IN UKRAINE - AND ELSEWHERE

""We must stick to the overall planning and ensure energy security, industrial supply chain security and food security at the same time as cutting carbon emissions,"" Xi said, indicating the reliance on gas and oil will not go away - providing Russia its much-needed backdoor.

The dynamic between Russia and China has evolved considerably over the past 50 years: They remained tenuous allies at best following World War II, and tensions between the two nations reached a boiling point during the Nixon administration, which then-President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger exploited to bust up the union.

But that ""ancient animosity"" has been ""buried,"" according to Wilkie, with Putin now the ""junior partner in the arrangement"" due to China’s economic might.

""China is willing to help anyone as long as that diminishes the United States in the eyes of the world,"" Wilkie said.

LOOMING UKRAINE EMBASSY EXIT CARRIES AFGHANISTAN PARALLELS, EXPERTS WARN

Wilkie argued that the U.S. did not take the steps necessary to bring Russia into the western fold following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the same way it did with Germany and Japan after World War II. Officials instead did a ""victory dance"" for two decades, creating a very bitter attitude that allowed Putin to push forth a very aggressive agenda to overhaul the military and state.

Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping hold regular calls now, with the most recent meeting occurring on Dec. 15 last year looking for ""mutual support"" in their conflicts with west, according to The New York Times.

That dynamic may even impact Putin’s plans for invasion: Recent intelligence suggests that Russia may take military action by mid-February, but some have pushed back on those suggestions in the belief that Putin would not want to upset China by doing so during the Beijing Winter Olympics.

"China claims it's 'impartial' on Ukraine conflict, dismisses 'disinformation' about sending Russians aid","China asserted Tuesday that it was completely ""impartial"" over the conflict in Ukraine and dismissed so-called ""disinformation"" from the U.S. government, suggesting that China agreed to send military equipment to Russian troops.

China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who hasn’t openly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching an invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago and has called the conflict the ""Ukraine issue"" instead of war – made the remarks to reporters during his daily press conference.

""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, impartial and constructive,"" Zhao said, according to a translation by The Associated Press. ""We have a clear goal, that is to promote the de-escalation of the situation and end the conflict as soon as possible.""

KYIV TO WELCOME 3 EUROPEAN PRIME MINISTERS BEFORE 35-HOUR CURFEW TAKES EFFECT: LIVE UPDATES

According to the transcript of his remarks shared to the Chinese foreign affairs website, Zhao said, ""China’s position and statement on the Ukraine issue is completely objective, just and constructive. We have a clear goal, that is, to deescalate the situation and put an end to the conflict as soon as possible. We believe China’s position will receive understanding and support from more and more countries.""

Though the two translations differed slightly, the message was the same. Zhao criticized the U.S. by nodding to China's contention that Russia was provoked by NATO's expansion and threats to its security.

""What the U.S. should do is to deeply reflect on the role it has played in the development and evolving of the Ukraine crisis, and do something practical to ease the tension in Ukraine,"" he said.

Zhao's comments came a day after U.S. adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome over the Biden administration's increasingly concerns that China is using the Ukraine war to advance Beijing’s long-term interest in its competition with the United States.

Speaking to CNN Monday, before the seven-hour face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Sullivan said the U.S. is ""communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them.""

The Kremlin has denied reports it requested Chinese military equipment for use in the war.

Zhao on Tuesday said China opposed the use of sanctions from the West, currently pummeling the Russia economy. He again dismissed reports that China agreed to send aid to Russia as ""disinformation.""

He also said a third batch of humanitarian aid sent by China for Ukraine arrived in Poland on Monday.

""China is committed to facilitating dialogue for peace, and believes that the international community should jointly support the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine for early substantive outcomes, so as to deescalate the situation as soon as possible,"" Zhao said. ""All parties should exercise maximum restraint, protect civilians and prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. China has provided emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and will continue to make its efforts to that end. China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread disinformation and distort and smear China’s position.""

Zhao repeatedly dodged reporter follow-up questions about Russia’s alleged request for aid. He also condemned U.S. statements about Taiwan and reissued warnings of consequences for any nation that intervenes in Taiwan, claiming the move would attack ""China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

China’s relationship with Taiwan has come into focus against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the island bolstering its own defenses since the war started in case of aggression from the mainland.

Taiwan said it planned to double its yearly missile-production capacity this year. China has taken a more aggressive stance against the Democratic island nation, sending a record number of fighter jets into Taiwan’s air defense zone late last year. And last month, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, nine Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone, prompting a broadcast warning from the island nation.

On Tuesday, the European Union ambassador to China, Nicolas Chapuis, appealed to China to support Ukraine and ""help Europe to stop the war.""

""There can be no so-called neutrality,"" Chapuis said during a roundtable discussion hosted by the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based thinktank. ""We really call upon all our Chinese friends to name the aggressor and to stand by the victim.""

""We have been playing a constructive part in promoting peace talks,"" he said. ""The top priority at the moment is for all parties to exercise restraint, cool the situation down instead of adding fuel to the fire, and work for diplomatic settlement rather than further escalate the situation.""

"Coronavirus may add to 'enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict' around world, UN secretary-general warns","The coronavirus epidemic, and its global economic impact, could lead to “enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,” the United Nations chief, considered by many to be the world’s top diplomat, warned Tuesday.

At the launch of a report on the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world faces the most challenging crisis since World War II, confronting a pandemic threatening people in every country, one that will bring a recession “that probably has no parallel in the recent past.”

Guterres called for a much stronger and more effective global response to the coronavirus pandemic and to the social and economic devastation that COVID-19 is causing.

He stressed that this will only be possible “if everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake.”

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

“We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people’s lives,” the report said. “But this is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core.”

The secretary-general told reporters: “The magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis — large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive, with country and international responses being guided by the World Health Organization.”

He stressed, “We are still very far from where we need to be to effectively fight the COVID-19 worldwide and to be able to tackle the negative impacts on the global economy and the global societies.”

First, he said, many countries are not respecting WHO guidelines, with each tending to go its own way in dealing with the pandemic.

“Let us remember that we are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world,” he said. “It is essential that developed countries immediately assist those less developed to bolster their health systems and their response capacity to stop transmission.”

Secondly, he said, while $5 trillion has been mobilized, most of that money was by the developed world — including $2 trillion in the United States — to support their own economies from the consequences of the pandemic.

“We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences in their populations, in the people that lost their jobs, the small companies that are operating and risk to disappear, those that live with the informal economy that now have no chance to survive,” he said. “Massive support to the developing world is still required.”

The report also cites International Labor Organization estimates for 2020 that between 5 million and 25 million jobs will be lost, with a corresponding loss of between $860 million and $3.4 trillion in labor income. It also cited an estimate by the U.N. trade and development organization UNCTAD of a 30-40 percent “downward pressure” on global foreign direct investment flows this year.

Guterres announced the establishment of a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to support efforts in low- and middle-income countries, with the aim of swiftly enabling governments to tackle the crisis and promote recovery.

He expressed hope that there will be “a positive response” from the international community to help vulnerable people including the tens of millions of refugees and internally displaced people, those in the slums of big cities in the global south, and poor people in middle-income countries who are more numerous than in the least developed countries.

The secretary-general said developed countries must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the IMF to issue special drawing rights and enabling other international financial institutions to rapidly inject resources into countries that need them.

Guterres said he strongly supports an idea from political powers in Europe at last week’s summit of the Group of 20 major industrialized nations that there should be a G20 initiative to help Africa.

“But, again, we must act quickly to make it happen,” he said. “If not, the African continent will have enormous difficulties in facing this challenge.”

Does China’s purported green energy push signal a coming conflict with the US?,"Beijing is only attempting to appear as though it's concerned about climate change to appease the West — all while China is using more domestic coal as a way to strengthen energy independence in case of a future conflict, according to a policy analyst.

""The Biden administration and frankly, too many policymakers in Washington, D.C., continue to see China as a partner,"" Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Fox News.

""I find [it] utterly remarkable that Chairman Xi [Jinping] of China and the Chinese Communist Party gives a tinker's damn about the planet's climate or climate change,"" DeVore continued.

Jinping promised not building more coal-powered power plants abroad in 2021. But that same year, the country began building over half of the world’s new coal-based power plants, all within China, according to The Wilson Center.

Since the country doesn't have any other significant energy sources, China's reliance on coal allows Beijing to avoid depending on foreign sources, DeVore told Fox News. That also means China's recent increased investment in coal-powered industries helps protect its energy independence in case of conflict.

""It's not at all about green energy,"" Devore said. ""It's about making the Chinese economy resilient in the event of a conflict with America.""

China hit a coal production record in November — the same month President Biden and Xi discussed climate goals — and 2023 production is expected to expand further, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. About 55% of China's energy comes from coal compared to 11% in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""If you look at the amount of electric vehicles being sold in China, you look at their high-speed electric rail, et cetera, they're going all in,"" DeVore told Fox News. ""Those electric vehicles in China are coal-fired cars. That's where the energy comes from to charge the cars in China. Coal, Chinese coal.""

""If you thought that carbon dioxide emissions were a problem and the planet was warming, then you'd have to ask yourself, ‘why is it that the Chinese are converting so much of their coal into fuel right now,'"" DeVore added.

China has been increasing investment in its coal-to-liquids industry, which enables coal to be turned into cheap fuel for pedestrian and military use, according to DeVore. But that process makes more carbon dioxide emissions than traditional oil refining methods.

WHAT IS THE NATIONAL POWER GRID AND HOW RESILIENT IS IT?

Other Chinese green energy products have also sparked concerns from federal agencies.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized shipments of Chinese-made solar equipment last year because the products were from Xinjiang, where the U.S. has banned purchases over concerns of slave labor.

Regardless, climate change should not be the priority of U.S.-Chinese foreign policy, according to DeVore.

""America's number one priority is maintaining our ability to deter the People's Republic of China from aggression on its neighbors,"" he said. ""This would include the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, the nations of the Indo-Pacific.""

""These are nations that are now seriously threatened by a country that has increasingly grown aggressive and belligerent and has made no secret of its designs on its neighbors,"" DeVore told Fox News.

Former USS Cole Commander on Syria: Don’t get engaged in conflict,"As the likelihood of a military strike on Syria increases in response to last week's alleged chemical weapons attack, a former USS Cole commander says the U.S. should not get involved.

Kirk Lippold was the commanding officer of the USS Cole when it came under attack by Al Qaeda in the port of Aden, Yemen in 2001. He spoke to Defcon 3’s KT McFarland on Foxnews.com LIVE.

“I think the first option we need to look at, KT, is to not get engaged in this conflict,” Commander Lippold explained. “While chemical weapons use is a moral outrage, that doesn’t define that our national security is in fact threatened to the point that we should take military action and get involved.”

The retired Navy commander said he is concerned that the White House’s objective isn’t clear. “We haven’t defined what the objectives are going to be in this conflict,” said Lippold.

Instead of moving ahead with attacks against the embattled Assad regime in Syria, Lippold says the U.S. military needs to wait.

“We clearly have not been presented with the proof as the American people that the Assad regime has in fact launched those weapons,” said Lippold. “We need to see what the proof is so that we are not having a repeat like Iraq.”

Questions remain whether the U.S. has the legal backing to conduct these air attacks. “We have no standing under international law to conduct these strikes right now,” said Lippold.

If the United States went ahead with a military campaign against Syria, the former commander believes that “the key you want to do if you want to punish the Assad regime is not to remove them from power, but in fact take out some of their enablers in their country that allow them to conduct these attacks.”

'Frozen Conflict': A look back at 2022's key moments in Ukraine's fight with Russia,"While much of the world celebrates Christmas and rings in a new year, Ukrainians will be marking the passing the grim milestone of having reached the 10-month mark in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Russian missile strikes are hammering Ukrainian infrastructure, leaving civilians without heat, electricity and drinking water, amid freezing temperatures,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital. ""Putin's goal is to dislodge Ukrainians psychologically and abandon the fight.""

Koffler's comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine is set to hit the 10-month mark and promises to spill over well into 2023, a sort of stalemate many analysts failed to see coming when Russian forces crossed the border and spilled into Ukraine.

Expectations of a swift victory were likely shared by Russian President Vladimir Putin when he launched what he coined a ""special military operation in Ukraine"" on Feb. 24, a plan designed to bring a quick win that would usher in a new phase of Russian dominance in the region.

BIDEN TO DELIVER PATRIOT MISSILES TO UKRAINE AS ZELENSKYY VISITS WASHINGTON

""Putin expected to subdue Ukraine within days, maximum weeks, force [Ukranian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to capitulate or flee and install a new government that is pro-Russian, or at minimum not pro-Western — a new regime that would abandon plans to join NATO,"" Koffler said.

However, such a quick victory for Putin has failed to materialize, setting the stage for a continuation of the war into 2023. As the world waits to see how the war unfolds in the new year, here is a look back at some of the key moments of the conflict in 2022.

Russia builds up forces on its border with Ukraine

As the world celebrated the calendar flipping to 2022, Russia was continuing its months-long build up of forces in Ukraine. By January, military analysts in Ukraine were estimating that Russia had amassed a force of close to 100,000 troops on the border, having ended the year by pushing for a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, a proposal that was rejected by both Ukraine and members of the alliance.

Russian troops began spilling into allied Belarus, also on the border of Ukraine, to conduct military exercises. The continued build up sparked international condemnation from the West, with the U.S. sending $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine and President Biden warning of consequences for Russia in the event of an invasion.

PENTAGON: RUSSIA BUILDUP ON UKRAINE BORDER IS LARGEST SINCE COLD WAR, CONFLICT WOULD BE 'HORRIFIC'

""Russia will be held accountable if it invades,"" Biden said in a January press conference.

However, Russia's military buildup continued, reaching nearly 200,000 troops at Ukraine's border as the eventual invasion neared.

""Russia accumulated, over the course of approximately two months, a build up of 190 000 troops, including military hardware, logistics, supplies,"" Koffler said.

Initial invasion of Ukraine

On Feb. 21, Putin announced Russian recognition of two eastern Ukrainian breakaway regions in Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The move brought the first round of NATO sanctions against Russia and growing concern that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent.

Undeterred by Western threats, Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine three days later and sent in many of his troops on a mission for the ""demilitarisation and denazification"" of Ukraine.

Within minutes of Putin's announced invasion, explosions could be heard in major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa. Reports quickly circulated that Russian troops had landed in the crucial coastal city of Mariupol, while observers closely followed large units of Russian forces making a beeline for the capital.

Heavy fighting broke out across the country and eventually spilled into Kyiv, while the Russian air force continued its bombardment of major cities and key infrastructure across the country. Many analysts expected the outmatched Ukrainian military to quickly fold under the pressure, but the country's resistance to the invasion proved more fierce than what had been predicted.

""Putin’s plan failed,"" Koffler said. ""Ukrainians displayed an unparalleled will to fight against a much more powerful opponent. Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy chose to stay and fight with his people instead of accepting the West’s offers to evacuate him. What was supposed to be a 5-7 day blitzkrieg turned into a 10-month-long bloodbath, with no end in sight.""

Billions worth of Western money and weapons continued to flow into Ukraine, giving their seemingly outmatched forces a chance to fend off the offensive. By April, Russian forces in the north began a retreat and reorganization of forces, while Ukraine maintained control of its capital.

""A charismatic Ukrainian leader was able to secure billions of dollars in Western security assistance, including sophisticated weaponry, that allowed Ukraine, not only to defend many of its positions but also to re-capture some of the territories occupied by the Russians,"" Koffler said. ""Ukrainian forces also benefited from superior training, real time intelligence, and other types of support provided by the U.S. and NATO.""

Putin's new strategy

Having failed to quickly end the war, Russia reorganized its forces and shifted its focus to the southern and eastern portions of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were put on the defensive across multiple fronts as the Russians secured key cities and infrastructure and amassed heavy forces with an eye towards maintaining an occupation of areas in Kherson and Donbas.

""Putin replaced multiple commanders and changed his strategy,"" Koffler said. ""He concentrated his forces on Eastern Ukraine, having annexed four regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - clearing doctrinal path to the employment of nuclear weapons, in the event that Russian forces were unable to prevail conventionally.""

UKRAINIAN FORCES RETREATING FROM EASTERN CITY SIEVIERODONETSK TO AVOID BEING ENCIRCLED BY RUSSIANS

Heavy fighting continued in the east and south throughout the spring and deep into the summer, while Putin shifted gears toward targeting critical infrastructure in a bid to weaken the will of Ukraine's civilian population.

""Moscow also launched ‘Strategic Operation to Defeat Critical Infrastructure of the Adversary,’ a war fighting doctrine, developed on Putin’s orders a decade ago as part of the plan to restore control over post-Soviet states, which Russia views as part or its strategic security perimeter - Putin’s version of the Monroe Doctrine,"" Koffler said.

Russia turned another Western adversary, Iran, to help sustain the new strategy, with the Kremlin purchasing hundreds of ""kamikaze drones"" and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from Tehran that have been used to target Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.

The cooperation in Ukraine has seemingly deepened ties between Iran and Russia, with Tehran going so far as to send military advisers to Crimea to train Russian forces on the use of the UAVs.

However, bolstered by continued U.S. and allied security assistance, Ukraine showed little sign that it was willing to give up on the regions, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowing to retake the territories currently occupied by Russian forces, including the long-held Crimean Peninsula.

""Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up,"" Zelenskyy said during an August address.

Ukrainian forces launch massive counteroffensive

Zelenskyy showed he intended to make good on that promise by the end of August, launching a Ukrainian counteroffensive that suddenly put Russian forces on the defensive for the first time in months.

RUSSIAN TROOPS PULL BACK AS UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS RETAKE KEY AREAS IN KHARKIV

Ukrainian forces attacked long-held Russian positions across the south and eastern regions of Ukraine with fierce flighting that eventually led to Ukraine regaining control of large areas it had lost in the months before.

""Zelenskyy mounted a blistering counter-offensive, in which Ukrainian forces recaptured approximately 5% of the 20% of Ukraine’s territory occupied by the Russians,"" Koffler said.

The offensive also worked to reignite international support for Ukraine, ushering in a renewed round of security assistance to assist Ukrainian forces in maintaining the offensive.

""He continued to galvanize the West to help his country defeat the Russian occupiers,"" Koffler said of the Ukrainian leader.

The Ukrainians had also once again dealt a large blow to Putin's war plan, forcing the Russian leader to bring more new troops to the fight as heavy Russian casualties mounted.

""Putin drafted an additional 318,000 troops, having invoked a partial mobilization, the first since World War II,"" Koffler said.

The offensive also forced Putin to admit that the conflict could be a protracted one, which would require the government to increase its funding for the effort.

WITH RUSSIA'S RETREAT FROM KHERSON, RUSSIA AND UKRAINE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE PEACE

""Putin publicly acknowledged that Russia is in it for the long haul, having raised Russia’s defense budget for 2023 to $84 billion, a 40% increase,"" Koffler said. ""Military age Russian men are fleeing by the thousands to escape mobilization.""

Meanwhile, crippling international sanctions proved to be an obstacle to Russia's aims, limiting Putin's ability to resupply his forces with gear and munitions while applying pressure on him politically.

""The West placed draconian sanctions on Russia, Russian businesses, oligarchs and even Putin’s family,"" Koffler said. ""The U.S. and European governments placed price caps on Russian oil, to hamper Putin’s ability to finance his war on Ukraine.""

The road ahead

As Zelenskyy made his historic trip to the White House to meet with Biden this week, the future of the war in Ukraine remains as uncertain as ever. While the Ukrainian leader appealed for greater assistance, the U.S. is seeking to balance its continued support with Ukraine while attempting to avoid risking further escalation with Putin.

""Putin feels cornered - he cannot accept defeat,"" Koffler said. ""It would mean not only loss of face for an arrogant West-bashing former spy operative, but most importantly, an anti-Russian neighbor, with which his country shares 1,400 miles border - which likely will host NATO forces, Russia’s top perceived adversary.""

UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY VISITS FRONTLINE AS PUTIN CONCEDES SITUATION 'EXTREMELY DIFFICULT' IN ANNEXED REGIONS

Zelenskyy's trip came as Biden announced an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance in Ukraine, which will for the first time will include Patriot missile systems Kyiv has long coveted. It also comes as Congress appears poised to sign off on an additional $45 billion in aid for Ukraine, a development Koffler believes will make it hard for Russia to achieve its war aims.

""Putin cannot win either so long as NATO continues to ramp up its supplies of long range missiles to Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""He is probably mulling two options: 1) a protracted war of attrition - which suites his definition of victory because so long as there’s an active conflict in Ukraine, it cannot become part of NATO - Putin's red line; 2) Russia’s escalate-to-de-escalate nuclear strategy to shock Ukraine into submission and to disorient the West, at least temporarily and abandon support for Kyiv.""

During Zelenskyy's address to a joint meeting of Congress Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader stressed the importance of supporting Ukraine now, arguing that Russia's aggression could eventually threaten NATO allies or even the U.S. homeland.

""The struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live,"" Zelenskyy said. ""This battle cannot be frozen or postponed, it cannot be ignored hoping that [an] ocean or something else will provide protection.""

He also pointed to Russia's renewed partnership with Iran, warning the two ""terrorist"" countries cooperation threatens the rest of the world.

""When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks and allies in the genocidal policy with Iran,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Iran has become a critical threat to our infrastructure. The terrorists have found each other.""

As the war continues into 2023, Koffler does not see an end to the stalemate in sight, instead characterizing the war as a ""frozen conflict.""

""There’s no military path to victory either by Ukraine or by Russia in this conflict."" Koffler said. ""Ukraine cannot win because it doesn’t have nuclear weapons and Russia does.""

PUTIN LANDS IN BELARUS TO PRESSURE ALLY TO JOIN THE OFFENSIVE IN UKRAINE WAR

However, Koffler noted that despite Russia's view that Ukraine is a critical buffer between itself and NATO, a path to victory for Russia will also remain elusive.

""Moscow cannot win this war, militarily so long as the U.S. and Europe continue to supply lethal military hardware to Ukraine,"" Koffler said. ""But if NATO deployed forces into the theater - the only way to defeat Russia, conventionally — Putin will authorize a tactical nuclear strike in Ukraine. Biden knows this, this is why he announced in the beginning of this was that the U.S. will not deploy troops to fight on Ukraine’s behalf.""

Koffler also expressed pessimism at the chances the sides could reach a diplomatic solution to end the conflict, arguing that the terms of such a solution would likely be unacceptable to both sides.

""This is rapidly turning into Afghanistan 2.0,"" Koffler said. ""My assessment is that 2-5 years from now, there will still be fighting on the ground in Ukraine. Even if some sort of a deal is brokered eventually — which I see no chance of right now — it will not bring ultimate peace because neither side trusts the other.

""The U.S. national security apparatus believes Putin would attack a NATO country if he is allowed to win in Ukraine— a nonsensical conclusion, given that the Russian military is failing to secure a clear military victory in Ukraine,"" she continued. ""And Putin will never trust Washington - he knows that its goal is to remove him from power and to orchestrate Russia’s collapse.""

However, Zelenskyy stressed the opposite in his speech, arguing that helping Ukraine achieve victory over Russia is a critical element to the defense of democracy around the world.

""Your money is not charity,"" he said. ""It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/frozen-conflict-look-back-2022s-key-moments-ukraines-fight-russia,N/A
Israel conflict: How has Hamas grown a rocket arsenal?,"In this fourth war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers, the Islamic militant group has fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel, some hitting deeper in Israeli territory and with greater accuracy than ever before.

The unprecedented barrages reaching as far north as the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv, coupled with drone launches and even an attempted submarine attack, have put on vivid display a homegrown arsenal that has only expanded despite the chokehold of a 14-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade.

""The magnitude of (Hamas) bombing is much bigger and the precision is much better in this conflict,"" said Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City. ""It’s shocking what they’ve been able to do under siege.""

Israel has argued that the blockade — which has caused severe hardship for more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza — is essential for preventing a Hamas arms build-up and cannot be lifted.

Here’s a look at how, under intense surveillance and tight restrictions, Hamas managed to amass its cache.

__

FROM CRUDE BOMBS TO LONG-RANGE ROCKETS

Since the founding of Hamas in 1987, the group's secretive military wing — which operates alongside a more visible political organization — evolved from a small militia into what Israel describes as a ""semi-organized military.""

In its early days, the group carried out deadly shootings and kidnappings of Israelis. It killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, which erupted in late 2000.

As violence spread, the group started producing rudimentary ""Qassam"" rockets. Powered partly by molten sugar, the projectiles reached just a few miles, flew wildly and caused little damage, often landing inside Gaza.

After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Hamas assembled a secret supply line from longtime patrons Iran and Syria, according to Israel's military. Longer-range rockets, powerful explosives, metal and machinery flooded Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Experts say the rockets were shipped to Sudan, trucked across Egypt’s vast desert and smuggled through a warren of narrow tunnels beneath the Sinai Peninsula.

In 2007, when Hamas fighters pushed the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza and took over governing the coastal strip, Israel and Egypt imposed their tight blockade.

According to the Israeli military, the smuggling continued, gaining steam after Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist leader and Hamas ally, was elected president of Egypt in 2012 before being overthrown by the Egyptian army.

Gaza militants stocked up on foreign-made rockets with enhanced ranges, like Katyushas and the Iranian-supplied Fajr-5, which were used during the 2008 and 2012 wars.

A HOMEGROWN INDUSTRY

After Morsi's overthrow, Egypt cracked down on and shut hundreds of smuggling tunnels. In response, Gaza’s local weapons industry picked up.

""The Iranian narrative is that they kick-started all the missile production in Gaza and gave them the technical and knowledge base, but now the Palestinians are self-sufficient, said Fabian Hinz, an independent security analyst focusing on missiles in the Middle East. ""Today, most of the rockets we’re seeing are domestically built, often with creative techniques.""

In a September documentary aired by the Al-Jazeera satellite news network, rare footage showed Hamas militants reassembling Iranian rockets with ranges of up to 50 miles and warheads packed with 385 pounds of explosives. Hamas militants opened unexploded Israeli missiles from previous strikes to extract explosive materials. They even salvaged old water pipes to repurpose as missile bodies.

To produce rockets, Hamas chemists and engineers mix propellant from fertilizer, oxidizer and other ingredients in makeshift factories. Key contraband is still believed to be smuggled into Gaza in a handful of tunnels that remain in operation.

Hamas has publicly praised Iran for its assistance, which experts say now primarily takes the form of blueprints, engineering know-how, motor tests and other technical expertise. The State Department reports that Iran provides $100 million a year to Palestinian armed groups.

THE ARSENAL ON DISPLAY

The Israeli military estimates that before the current round of fighting, Hamas had an arsenal of 7,000 rockets of varying ranges that can cover nearly all of Israel, as well as 300 anti-tank and 100 anti-aircraft missiles. It also has acquired dozens of unmanned aerial vehicles and has an army of some 30,000 militants, including 400 naval commandos.

In this latest war, Hamas has unveiled new weapons like attack drones, unmanned submarine drones dispatched into the sea and an unguided rocket called ""Ayyash"" with a 155-mile range. Israel claims those new systems have been thwarted or failed to make direct strikes.

The Israeli military says its current operation has dealt a tough blow to Hamas' weapons research, storage and production facilities. But Israeli officials acknowledge they have been unable to halt the constant barrages of rocket fire.

Unlike guided missiles, the rockets are imprecise and the vast majority have been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system. But by continuing to frustrate Israel's superior firepower, Hamas may have made its main point.

""Hamas is not aiming for the military destruction of Israel. Ultimately, the rockets are meant to build leverage and rewrite the rules of the game,"" Hinz said. ""It’s psychological.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-has-hamas-created-a-rocket-arsenal-israel,N/A

"Iraqi Kurds still love US despite its opposition to Kurdish independence, says Kurdish leader","U.S. opposition to an independence referendum by Iraqi Kurds will not break a long-standing alliance between the stateless community and the United States, the Kurdish prime minister says.

While Washington opposed the September 2017 referendum for independence, Kurdish Prime Minister Nechiravan Barzani insisted that the people of Kurdistan still see America as their No. 1 partner and have hope the U.S. will come to endorse their ongoing dream of independence.

“There was disappointment among the Kurdish people; the people of Kurdistan have had high expectations from the United States and they believe that the values the U.S. cherishes, we also cherish,” Barzani told Fox News in an exclusive interview last week in his office.

“But the people of Kurdistan, they still love the United States,” he said. “Kurds consider themselves a friend and partner to the United States. We want this to continue long term.”

The U.S., joined by most of the international community, backed the Baghdad Central Government in opposing the referendum over fears the push toward independence would have potentially “catastrophic consequences” on the fight against ISIS and on the region as a whole, given that neighbors Iran and Turkey worry that their own significant Kurdish populations would attempt to carve out land for themselves.

Barzani noted that his people’s disappointment stemmed not only from the U.S. policy to oppose their freedom quest, but what happened next.

After the Kurds refused Baghdad’s insistence that the vote be canceled as unconstitutional and an antagonizing act aimed at weakening the Iraqi government, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered the army to retake “disputed territories” -- which the Kurdish Peshmerga had been guarding since the ISIS invasion. Iran-backed fighters known as the Popular Mobilization Units assisted the effort.

Most notably, violent tensions arose around the strategic oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Several casualties were reported on both the Peshmerga and Iraqi sides as a result of the Oct. 16 clashes, which ended when the Peshmerga withdrew.

“Over 1,846 Peshmerga soldiers have sacrificed their lives and more than 10,000 were wounded fighting ISIS,” Barzani said. “ISIS was a threat not only to Kurdistan, but to Europe, the U.S., to humanity. Therefore, the Kurdish people were expecting that when a threat comes in, the U.S. would stand by them. They were not expecting that American tanks given to the Iraq government would be used against them by the Popular Mobilization Units.”

Iraqi officials have denied that the Iranian-backed forces have possession over any U.S.-issued tanks or weaponry or that they were used against the Kurds.

Barzani also contended that it was never his government’s intention to “control” or grab Kirkuk or the disputed territories from the Iraqi government. He said the Peshmerga forces went there in 2014 as the ISIS threat loomed at the behest of Abadi’s predecessor, Nouri al-Malaki.

“The fact is neither Baghdad nor Erbil had full control over these areas,” Barzani said, stressing that the issues should have been “addressed in accordance with the constitution” and not by military pressure.

The prime minister said Iraq’s military action in response to the referendum, which included shutting down the region’s two international airports, was never anticipated.

“What we saw was a very peaceful experience of people to express their right to self-determination by putting their finger in the ink and voting, while the reaction from Baghdad was to use force,” Barzani said. “We have made it clear we want to address all these issues through dialogue with Baghdad, but they have not yet shown their readiness for this.”

Barzani – who is currently at the helm of the autonomous region after his uncle Masoud Barzani stepped down as president in the weeks after the referendum – welcomed a deeper involvement by the U.S. to resolve the issue, but maintained that they have no regrets about holding the referendum.

“I don’t believe anyone here, any political party, thinks they made a mistake or they did something wrong. What we have seen was a democratic process,” he said. “It was an expression of will, not less, not more.”

The long-awaited Sept. 25 vote – of which more than 92 percent of some 8 million Iraqi Kurds voted “yes” to part ways with the Baghdad government – was non-binding in that unilateral succession would not immediately take place. Iraqi Kurds hoped it would prompt negotiations for eventual separation.

While it remains to be seen when and how Kurdish aspirations for an independent state will now move forward – some analysts suggest it is in tatters and U.S. officials have doubled down on the long-held policy to “support a federal, prosperous, unified and democratic Iraq” – Barzani said they remain committed to the process and are still hopeful for American backing.

“We have to look at Iraq very realistically,” he said. “For those who talk about a strong, centralized Iraq we have seen that doesn’t work. The most important point for Iraq and what the international community wants to see in Iraq is stability, which means we should find a model that all communities in Iraq can agree upon and can be sustained.”

He added, “Our position after the referendum is to address our problems with Baghdad on the basis of the constitution. But our right to self-determination will remain as it is. This is a new era and we hope the American people will come to support our cause.”",https://www.foxnews.com/world/iraqi-kurds-still-love-us-despite-its-opposition-to-kurdish-independence-says-kurdish-leader,N/A

The paper, citing health officials in Gaza, reported that at least 212 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, including 61 children. The U.N. said at least 800,000 lack access to safe drinking water, the report said.

President Joe Biden expressed support for a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers in a call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, but stopped short of demanding an immediate stop to the eight days of Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket barrages that have killed more than 200 people, most of them Palestinian.

Biden’s carefully worded statement, in a White House readout of his second known call to Netanyahu in three days as the attacks pounded on, came with the administration under pressure to respond more forcefully despite its determination to wrench the U.S. foreign policy focus away from Middle East conflicts.

Jamaican anti-corruption agency investigating the country's prime minister for potential conflict of interest,"Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness is under scrutiny after an anti-corruption agency issued a lengthy report that suggests a potential conflict of interest involving him and contracts awarded to a construction company, some of which were not reported.

The report also was shared with the speaker of Jamaica’s House of Representatives, who is a member of Holness’ Jamaica Labor Party.

Holness released a statement noting that the matter occurred nearly two decades ago, and that ""at no time have I ever exercised influence on any process for the award of contracts. I strongly disagree with the findings of the Integrity Commission regarding conflict of interest based on mere association.""

He also noted that it’s a longstanding practice for members of Parliament to recommend local contractors to undertake works in their constituencies, and added that he has referred the commission’s report to his lawyers.

The commission’s investigation focused on 10 contracts awarded to a construction company from 2007 to 2009, when Holness was minister of education. Only five of those were reported to the Office of the Contractor General as required by law, according to the report.

The contracts totaled nearly $142,000 and were for work ranging from roof repairs to renovation of a teachers’ cottage.

The commission found that the prime minister has known two directors and shareholders of Westcon Construction Limited for more than 20 years. Holness said one of them that he knows personally is a former employee in his constituency and personal business, and the other is known to him casually and was hired to do land surveying work, according to the report.

Officials with the construction company could not be immediately reached for comment.

The investigation began after a local TV news program in May 2016 questioned the contracts and the relationship between Holness and the construction company officials.

Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness will not face corruption charges in conflict of interest case,"A top prosecutor in Jamaica has ruled that Prime Minister Andrew Holness won’t face charges over possible conflict of interest in contracts awarded to a construction company in 2007-2009 while he was education minister.

Jamaica’s director of public corruption issued the ruling Thursday after reviewing a report on the case by the country’s Integrity Commission.

The commission investigated the case after a news report in 2016 raised questions about close ties between Holness and principals of a company hired for several roof repairs at schools and other projects.

"Mexico now considered second deadliest conflict zone after Syria, study says","Mexico is the second-most deadly conflict zone on the globe, according to a new study.

The country has surpassed both Iraq and Afghanistan to become the world’s most violent country after Syria, the study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) says.

Nearly 23,000 people were killed in Mexico in 2016 as the turf wars among drug cartels continued. Around 17,000 were killed in Afghanistan and 16,000 in Iraq during the same time period.

DRUG CARTELS REUSING MEXICAN TUNNELS ALREADY DISCOVERED BUT LEFT UNFILLED

Researchers pointed out that Mexico's level of violence is especially shocking because the conflict in the country is “marked by the absence of artillery, tanks or combat aviation,” IISS director general John Chipman said while discussing the survey in London on Tuesday. Instead, Chipman said, almost all of the Mexican deaths were the result of small arms.

The highest numbers of deaths were reported in the states of Sinaloa and Guerrero, known for fighting “among competing, increasingly fragmented cartels,” he said. Violence frequently occurs as gangs attempt to clear locations of rivals so that they can gain control of select drug trafficking routes or markets.

JOURNALISTS IN MEXICO KILLED IN RECORD NUMBERS – ALONG WITH FREEDOM OF SPEECH

Overall, Syria remained the most violent place on earth with around 50,000 deaths in 2016, according to the study cited by Bloomberg. The conflict in Syria has left around 290,000 people dead since it started in 2011.

Violence dropped significantly in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the study, with the amount of people killed falling more than a third from the year before.

Worldwide, the number of people who died in armed battles dropped to 157,000 in 2016 from 167,000 in 2015. But those numbers are still high compared to the previous decade. According to the survey the number of civilians displaced by wars continue to increase, too.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexico-now-considered-second-deadliest-conflict-zone-after-syria-study-says,N/A
Military experts provide frank assessment of US shortcomings in potential China conflict,"The U.S. would face few but significant hurdles if the military were to confront China following a Taiwan invasion, military experts told Fox News Digital.

""Unfortunately, talking broadly and in overall terms, the Chinese have dramatically increased their air, sea, space, cyber and missile capabilities in the last couple of decades,"" said James Anderson, acting undersecretary of defense for policy under President Trump.

""In some of the scenarios that could happen, we might well be at a competitive disadvantage initially because they have home-field advantage in terms of their capacity to quickly mobilize local forces, and that's really important to the PRC.""

Four-star Air Force Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo last week that he believes that the U.S. and China ""will fight in 2025,"" adding, ""I hope I am wrong."" He pointed to the upcoming elections in the U.S. and Taiwan, which he believed could provide a distraction and allow China to make a move on the island.

US MISSILE BURSTS CHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA

The general said ""a fortified, ready, integrated and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain"" needs to be established to prepare for the looming fight.

And CIA Director William Burns reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be ready for action no later than 2027.

Anderson, along with Heino Klinck, senior adviser to the National Bureau of Asian Research, stressed that it is difficult to predict how a conflict might play out because ""it would be very scenario dependent.""

""There are areas in which they have dominance, and there are also areas in which we have dominance, so it's not exactly an apples and oranges type of comparison,"" Klinck, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said, highlighting the ""tyranny of distance"" as the greatest concern for the U.S. military.

""China certainly has geographic advantages just based on the fact that it's only 100 miles from Taiwan, so that's something that requires advanced logistical planning,"" he added.

China, in a localized conflict, would have shorter supply lines compared to the U.S., even with partners and military bases in the region creating a baseline from which to operate. And it could more easily support its naval forces with land-based missile systems.

Anderson also highlighted that the U.S. would likely run out of its sophisticated, conventional missiles ""in probably a matter of days."" U.S. officials announced in October 2022 that they could not maintain the same pace of supply for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion because of the risk posed by reduced stockpiles of high-end munitions.

CHINESE SPY BALLOON MAY HAVE GATHERED ‘UNSEEN’ INFORMATION, EXPERTS SAY

""In essence, we have depleted our own reserves of munitions in order to supply the Ukrainians,"" Klinck said. ""It’s demonstrated the fragility of our defense industrial base. And the fact that we have reportedly pulled munitions out of Israel and are planning on pulling certain types of equipment out of South Korea should demonstrate and convey the seriousness of this issue.""

The ""tyranny of distance"" would cause the greater problem, and Anderson highlighted that it might take at least two weeks for the U.S. to fully supply both manpower and weapons to the region to maintain any kind of sustained, intensified action against China.

""There are ways to overcome that,"" Anderson stressed. ""For example, we can and should do a much better job of stockpiling sufficient quantities of munitions in the region and protecting them, but, right now, that's our biggest disadvantage.""

Anderson did highlight that, despite these shortcomings, the U.S. has one significant and overwhelming advantage over China: The last conflict in which Beijing deployed its forces was in the 1979 border war with Vietnam, and it has no extensive military or actual combat experience since then compared to its American counterparts.

THESE 5 CHINA INTELLIGENCE FAILURES ARE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CHINESE SPY BALLOON

""The fact is they have no experience conducting a major amphibious assault on the scale that would be required to take the island of Taiwan,"" Anderson added. ""Yes, they did attack various outlying islands of Taiwan during multiple crises in the 1950s, but those were very small-scale operations.""

He added that large-scale amphibious operations are ""the most difficult combat operations to execute.""

""There are no good parallels, and … from our perspective, the fact that the Chinese don’t have a good parallel is good news because this is a competitive disadvantage for them.""

Klinck stressed that the lack of parallels is not necessarily a good thing, simply because the U.S. cannot predict how China would approach the problem.

""The fact that they have geography on their side, the fact that the Chinese economy and businesses are integrated into Chinese war plans as well. So, for instance, the Chinese have, in fact, exercised with commercial roll-on, roll-off vessels with commercial airliners,"" Klinck noted.

""There's a variety of lift assets the Chinese could bring to play that Western militaries may not necessarily depend on.""

Myanmar says 22 people killed this month as fresh fighting flares in strife-torn Kachin state,"Myanmar says fighting between government troops and ethnic rebels in the northeastern, strife-torn state of Kachin has left at least 22 people dead this month.

The clashes in Kachin come despite efforts by President Thein Sein's government to forge a nationwide cease-fire agreement with all armed ethnic groups — a deadline that has repeatedly been pushed back because of ongoing clashes.

The state-run Kyemon daily reported Sunday that the latest violence erupted on April 4 after members of the Kachin Independence Army ambushed an army column in the Man Wein Gyi region.

It said the ""mopping up"" operation that followed resulted in the capture of a rebel camp.

"No longer driven by conflict, Colombians vote for president","next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

For decades, Colombians voted with an eye on the bloody conflict with leftist rebels that dominated their country and politics.

But on Sunday they will cast their ballots in the first presidential election since the signing of a peace accord with the nation's biggest rebel group to end the conflict and will be weighing issues like corruption, inequality, crime and relations with their crisis-plagued neighbor Venezuela.

The two leading candidates have presented dramatically different visions for both Colombia's economic model and the future of its divisive peace process in a polarizing campaign driven by a wave of anti-establishment sentiment.

Leading the polls is conservative former senator Ivan Duque, the protege of influential former President Alvaro Uribe, the leading critic of the peace deal, but surveys suggest he is unlikely to get the more than 50 percent of votes required to avoid a June runoff. He's being chased by Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla and ex-Bogota mayor, whose rise has triggered concerns he would push Colombia dangerously toward the left and rattle markets.

At least two other candidates trail within reach of obtaining the coveted second spot.

""If he wins, he has an opportunity to bridge some of these divides in Colombia,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, referring to front-runner Duque. ""But the big unknown is what Uribe's role will be.""

The campaign has sparked fears on both the left and right of Colombia's political spectrum, with Duque's critics cautioning that his presidency would be tantamount to a constitutionally-barred third term for Uribe. Though hugely popular among Colombians for improving security and weakening illegal armed groups, Uribe also presided over grave human rights violations by the military.

Meanwhile, Petro and his populist platform have drawn comparisons from fearmongering critics to the late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who Petro once admired. He brought Chavez to Colombia in 1994 shortly after the Venezuelan paratrooper was released from jail, where he was sent for staging a military coup, and the relationship between the two has dogged Petro throughout his campaign.

Petro says Venezuela's economic model doesn't work and calls himself a ""strong adversary"" of the neighboring country's current president, Nicolas Maduro.

He is proposing an overhaul of Colombia's economic model to free it from its dependence on oil exports and instead boost agricultural production through land reform. His campaign says he'd dramatically increase taxes on unproductive lands to encourage landholders to sell them to the state.

Hollman Morris, a Colombian journalist who has been supporting Petro's campaign, said Petro's trajectory from leftist militant to congressman and mayor of Bogota, and now possibly to the presidency as an important sign of Colombia's political evolution as voters show they are willing to move beyond long-held fears of leftist contenders.

""We think Colombia has reached an important level of maturation,"" Morris said at Petro's campaign headquarters. ""But also, Colombia has begun to realize the decline of its traditional political class, which is totally involved in corruption.""

In the final days before the vote, Petro accused officials of failing to address a voting software glitch that he said could lead to fraud.

That led to an outcry among his competitors and a rare intrusion in the campaign from outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos, who said ""leftist extremists are the same as right-wing extremists: they invent frauds where they don't exist.""

Aside from the economy, both Petro and Duque differ on the peace accord, which has been slow to implement and remains controversial among many Colombians who believe it granted overly generous terms to demobilized guerrillas. Petro supports the accord while Duque has said it needs ""correcting.""

With Colombia's political polls notoriously off, there's still room for an upset with candidates like former Medellin mayor Sergio Fajardo and former Vice President German Vargas Lleras trailing close behind.

Fajardo, who is credited with Medellin's transformation from a hotbed of crime into a growing tourist destination, has run on a platform of rooting out corruption and boosting social programs. Vargas Lleras is pledging to create more than 1 million new jobs.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/no-longer-driven-by-conflict-colombians-vote-for-president,N/A
Peace talks begin in South Africa to end Ethiopia's Tigray conflict,"Peace talks to end Ethiopia's devastating Tigray conflict have begun in South Africa, a South African government spokesman said Tuesday. It is the highest-level effort yet to end two years of fighting that has killed perhaps hundreds of thousands of people.

The spokesman for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Vincent Magwenya, said the African Union-led talks that started Tuesday are expected to continue until Sunday. Delegations from the Ethiopian government and Tigray authorities arrived in South Africa this week. There was no immediate comment from either side.

""Such talks are in line with South Africa’s foreign policy objectives of a secure and conflict-free continent,"" Magwenya said.

Former Nigerian president and AU envoy Olesegun Obasanjo, former South African deputy president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta are facilitating the talks with the encouragement of the United States, whose special envoy Mike Hammer picked up the Tigray delegation in a U.S. military aircraft on Sunday.

The conflict has sharply changed the fortunes of Ethiopia's Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who went to war with his country's northern Tigray region less than a year after receiving the award for making peace with neighboring Eritrea. Eritrea's government has long seen the Tigray leaders, who led Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy came to power, as enemies.

ETHIOPIA'S TIGRAY FORCES SAY ERITREANS ESCALATING MILITARY OFFENSIVE

The peace talks — led by Ethiopia's national security adviser Redwan Hussein and by Tigray forces spokesman Getachew Reda and Gen. Tsadkan Gebretensae — begin as Ethiopian and allied forces from Eritrea have taken over some urban areas in Tigray in the past few days.

Those include the towns of Axum, Adwa and now Adigrat, according to a humanitarian source who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.

The Tigray region of more than 5 million people is again cut off from the world by renewed fighting that began in late August following months of a lull in the conflict that allowed combatants — including two of the African continent's largest militaries — to regroup.

ETHIOPIA FORMS BODY TO NEGOTIATE WITH TIGRAY REBELS AMID DEADLY CIVIL WAR

All combatants have committed abuses, according to United Nations human rights investigators who recently singled out the Ethiopian government as using ""starvation of civilians"" as a weapon of war. Babies in Tigray are dying in their first month of life at four times the rate before the war cut off access to most medical care, according to a yet-unpublished study shared by its authors with The Associated Press this month.

Relief convoy movements have ""remained on complete standstill"" since Aug. 24, the U.N. said this week. ""Please, government, please (Tigray authorities), for the sake of your own people, come to a positive conclusion or at least open up a channel of peace,"" U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Tuesday while visiting neighboring Kenya.

The war since exploding in November 2020 has also spilled over into Ethiopia's neighboring Amhara and Afar regions, putting hundreds of thousands of people there in peril. Meanwhile, the economy of Ethiopia, once one of the fastest-growing in Africa, has suffered.

Peace talks regarding Ethiopia's Tigray conflict extended into this week,"Peace talks between warring sides on Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict have been extended into this week, while the country’s prime minister complained in comments broadcast Monday about ""lots of intervention from left and right"" in the process.

An official familiar with the arrangements for the talks confirmed that discussions continued in South Africa between Ethiopia’s federal government and representatives from the northern Tigray region. The first formal peace talks began last week.

The African Union-led talks seek a cessation of hostilities in a war that the United States asserts has killed up to hundreds of thousands of people, an estimate made by some academics and health workers.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, speaking to the China Global Television Network, said ""we’re working towards peace"" and asserted that Ethiopians can solve matters by themselves. ""Of course, if there are lots of intervention from left and right, it’s very difficult,"" he added. He also said Ethiopian forces were in control of the Tigray towns of Shire, Axum and Adwa.

PEACE TALKS BEGIN IN SOUTH AFRICA TO END ETHIOPIA'S TIGRAY CONFLICT

Neighboring Eritrea, whose forces are fighting alongside Ethiopian ones, is not a party to the peace talks, and it is not clear whether the deeply repressive country will respect any agreement reached. Witnesses have told the AP that Eritreans were killing civilians even after the talks began.

ETHIOPIA'S TIGRAY FORCES SAY ERITREANS ESCALATING MILITARY OFFENSIVE

The fighting, which resumed in August after a monthslong lull, has been marked by guerrilla-style warfare by Tigray forces and drone strikes by Ethiopian ones that witnesses have said have killed civilians.

According to analysis of satellite imagery taken by Planet Labs PBC of Ethiopia’s Bahir Dar airport south of the Tigray region on Oct. 21, by armaments expert Wim Zwijnenburg of the Dutch peace organization PAX and by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the wingspan, length, shape and other identifying details of two smaller aircraft visible are consistent with those of the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone.

The United Nations-backed International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia has found evidence of the government using drones in the conflict ""in an arbitrary and indiscriminate manner,"" commission members told journalists last week.

The commissioners said they have not done a comprehensive analysis of where Ethiopia is obtaining the drones, but they said they had confirmed the drone used in a strike that killed people in a displacement camp early this year came from Turkey.

"Putin accuses the West of backing threats of 'nuclear war,' provoking Ukraine conflict","Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the West in his Victory Day speech Monday at the Kremlin, claiming that the U.S. and other countries had propped up a ""threat"" on Russia's borders and had even supported threats of nuclear war against his country.

""Russia has always stood up for an international system of equality,"" Putin said, according to a translation from the German outlet Deutsche-Welle. ""We have always tried to find compromise solutions… Other countries had completely different plans.""

""They have tried to attack our historical territories like the Crimea. They have threatened to use nuclear war, and the West has supported these military actions carried out in our neighborhood and that is why it was a threat we couldn't accept,"" the Russian president added. He claimed there was a ""threat to our border.""

""We have seen the military infrastructure developed,"" Putin claimed, mentioning ""more and more international military advisors coming into the country. The country was provided with modern weapons. There was a threat that was growing day by day.""

RUSSIAN SPACE AGENCY CHIEF BOASTS NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, CLAIMS NATO WOULD LOSE ‘IN 30 MINUTES’

Putin condemned the U.S. by name. ""The United States of America, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union,… has humiliated not only the whole world, but also their satellite states.""

""They have tried to denigrate the memory of the Second World War,"" he charged.

Putin also claimed that ""the enemies of our country have tried to use international terrorism against us,"" likely referring to the increased sanctions against Russia and the seizure of Russian oligarchs' assets abroad.

Putin said those living today are ""the successor generation"" to the generation that fought World War II. ""Those who won a victory over fascism in the Second World War are a symbol for us,"" he said.

""Today in the Donbas, the militia and our forces stand up in order to defend our territory,"" Putin said. ""We have many people we should remember, and they are now supporting us in the Donbas. You are fighting for your homeland, for the future of our homeland.""

ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER CONDEMNS RUSSIA'S LAVROV FOR ‘UNFORGIVABLE’ HOLOCAUST REMARKS

Evoking the history of Russia's victory over Nazi Germany on May 9, 1945, Putin repeatedly tied the current government of Ukraine – which is headed by the Jewish President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – to the Nazis.

""We are dealing with Nazis,"" he said when mentioning the ostensible threat of Ukraine. ""We are going to punish the Nazis,"" he vowed while cheering on Russian troops in the Donbas.

""We also would like to respect those who fought with us in 2014,"" Putin added, hailing ""the peaceful people in the Donbas who were killed by the Nazis.""

The Russian president appeared to be citing the Azov Battalion, a unit of Ukraine's National Guard in Mariupol that was once a volunteer regiment and first saw combat in June 2014. In March 2015, Andriy Diachenko, a spokesman for the brigade, told USA Today that 10% to 20% are Nazis, but the ideology ""has nothing to do with the official ideology of the Azov.""

Zelenskyy emphatically denied the claim that the Azov Battalion fosters Nazism.

""The Azov Regiment is not a volunteer (formation), but part of the National Guard,"" Zelenskyy said last week . ""They are (part of) the official army of our state. Anyone who wanted to get involved in politics, (left the Azov Regiment). Those who decided to serve in the National Guard of Ukraine became part of the National Guard of Ukraine.""

It remains unclear to which pre-invasion threats of ""nuclear war"" Putin was referring (Ukraine surrendered its own nuclear weapons in 1994), but after Russia invaded Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for ""global control"" of the Kremlin's nuclear capabilities following the invaders' ""completely irresponsible actions"" during the war.

Ukraine's president recalled the night of March 4, when a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after Russian forces started shelling the plant amid the invasion. ""They knew exactly which object they were firing at,"" he said. ""But they had an order to seize the object at any cost. … They didn't think about how many power units there are and how the shelling could end.""

Zelenskyy also noted that on the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Russian forces ""launched three missiles against Ukraine so that they flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants – over three nuclear power plants at once, over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, and South-Ukrainian NPPs.

It all happened,"" Putin told veterans and residents in Saint Petersburg. ""Everything we do today, including in a special military operation, is an attempt to stop this war. That is the meaning of our operation.""

He claimed that victory in Ukraine would ""protect our people who live there, in these territories.""

""Russia has come to terms with this event, despite the fact that these are our historical territories. Nevertheless, we could not but react to what began to happen there,"" he noted, according to Russian state-owned news outlet RIA Novosti.

""In terms of achieving the end result and the victory that is inevitable, there are several things. ... It is the unity and cohesion of the Russian and multinational Russian people, the courage and heroism of our fighters ... and of course the work of the military-industrial complex and factories like yours and people like you,"" Putin said.

"Russia asked China for military, economic aid in Ukraine conflict following invasion","Russia asked China for military and economic aid following their invasion of Ukraine, Fox News has confirmed.

In an attempt to protect intelligence sources, U.S. officials have been reluctant to detail what type of aid is being sought.

The request for military assistance, which was first reported by The New York Times, has reportedly raised concern among U.S. officials that China might interfere with any efforts from Western nations to assist Ukrainian forces.

""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Sullivan also suggested that China had some idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin was planning something, but conceded the Chinese might not have known the extent of Putin's intentions.

Chinese leaders have declined to rebuke Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, and have come out against Western economic sanctions. China has abstained in multiple United Nations votes to censure Russia.

Last Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed that ""China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda"" about the U.S. developing chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Sullivan is preparing to meet with Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday.

"Russia reacts to US, Germany tank deliveries to Ukraine: 'Direct involvement in the conflict'","Russia responded Thursday for the first time regarding the decision by President Biden to send Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine, accusing it of ""direct involvement in the conflict.""

During his Wednesday announcement, Biden said the shipment of tanks that he classified as the ""most capable tanks in the world"" were not ""an offensive threat to Russia.""

However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov clapped back at that, saying, ""There are constant statements from European capitals and Washington that the sending of various weapons systems to Ukraine, including tanks, in no way signifies the involvement of these countries or the alliance in hostilities in Ukraine.""

""We categorically disagree with this, and in Moscow, everything that the alliance and the capitals I mentioned are doing is seen as direct involvement in the conflict. We see that this is growing,"" he told reporters, according to Reuters.

Russian officials have repeatedly accused the U.S. and NATO allies of being directly involved in the conflict despite the lack of Western troops in the war.

Senior defense officials described the Abrams tanks as the ""best in the world"" in a background call Wednesday, but Moscow has remained largely unreactive to the news from Washington despite accusing Germany of escalating the war following its decision to send Leopard 2 tanks earlier on Wednesday.

UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: GERMANY AGREES TO SEND 2 BATTALIONS OF LEOPARD 2 TANKS AFTER HEAVY PRESSURE

""This extremely dangerous decision takes the conflict to a new level of confrontation,"" Russian Ambassador to Germany Sergei Nechayev said Wednesday, adding that the decision to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine was the ""final refusal to recognize its historical responsibility to our people for Nazi crimes.""

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also claimed it was proof of ""a war planned in advance"" — echoing Moscow’s false claims that NATO was planning aggressive action against Russia in the lead-up to the war.

Russian media has also downplayed the decision by Washington, with one TASS report claiming that Abrams tanks are ""vulnerable"" to Soviet-era weapons.

One retired Russian general also reportedly told the state-owned outlet that Abrams tanks are ""weakly suited for operation on dusty terrain like in Ukraine.""

The coverage shows a stark comparison to Moscow’s reaction when the U.S. first approved the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) for deployment in Ukraine, which prompted subsequent warnings over providing long-range strike capabilities and threats of nuclear escalation.

Russian took a similar tactic following the announcement last month that the U.S. and Germany would send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine — one of the world's most advanced air defense systems, but which Russian President Vladimir Putin described as ""quite old.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-reacts-us-germany-tank-deliveries-ukraine-direct-involvement-conflict,N/A
"Russia threats, rhetoric increase chance of conflict as it seeks NATO assurances","Russia continues to try and pressure the U.S. with vague threats ahead of possible conflict with Ukraine as tensions continue to escalate after disappointing security talks between the two nations.

The New Year started with a wet blanket after the U.S. and Russia walked away from security talks with no progress. Russia did not wait long to start escalating tensions again.

Russia moved more troops to the border Wednesday as it also cautioned the U.S. against attempting to admit Ukraine into NATO, which would provide greater cover for the country against its aggressive neighbor.

The U.S. also announced that it had intelligence that Moscow had planned ""false-flag"" operations in Ukraine near the border, and officials in the U.S. and Europe attributed a massive cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites to Russia.

And Russia has remained concerned over NATO and its possible role in any conflict that results from an invasion into Ukraine. Russian officials submitted a proposal in December for guarantees it wished to see from the U.S., including no further enlargement of the alliance and a reduction of military presence in Eastern European countries.

BIDEN CLARIFIES UKRAINE COMMENT THAT CAUSED UPROAR: RUSSIAN TROOPS CROSSING BORDER WOULD BE ‘INVASION’

""We will not wait forever,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week. ""Our patience has run out…Everyone understands that the situation is not improving. The potential for conflict is growing.""

President Biden did not help matters with a comment during his Wednesday press briefing that the U.S. would not be as clear on its response in the event of a ""minor incursion"" from Russia into Ukraine.

""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and what to not do, et cetera,"" the president said, adding that an invasion would be a ""disaster"" for Russia. He clarified his comments Thursday, stressing ""any assembled Russian units … across the Ukrainian border"" is an invasion.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy hit back at Biden’s comments, saying ""there are no minor incursions and small nations, just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.""

UKRAINE PRESIDENT PUSHES BACK ON BIDEN'S CHOICE OF WORDS: ‘THERE ARE NO MINOR INCURSIONS’

And the U.S. on Thursday announced sanctions on four individuals connected to ongoing Russian intelligence activities ""designed to destabilize Ukraine.""

Two of the individuals serve as members of Ukraine’s parliament.

""This action is intended to target, highlight, and undercut Russia’s ongoing destabilization effort in Ukraine,"" a State Department press release explained. ""It is separate and distinct from the broad range of high impact measures the United States and its allies and partners are prepared to impose in order to inflict significant costs on the Russian economy and financial system if it were to further invade Ukraine.""

SEN. DURBIN SAYS HE'D LIKE TO ASK BIDEN ‘WHAT HE WAS THINKING’ ON PUTIN REMARKS

The U.S. insists that it will continue to seek financial pressures to keep Russia from invading Ukraine, and Russia may not be able to afford the backlash that an incursion would bring: The spiraling situation in Kazakhstan led to Russian intervention with the deployment of over 2,000 troops to the former Soviet nation.

The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that all security alliance forces left the country, but Putin will need to keep an eye on further developments in the country in the aftermath of what has proven a bloody and difficult month.

Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev consolidated power in the drawdown, removing several of his predecessor's most powerful allies who still retained positions in the government.

Russia-Ukraine conflict raises big risks for global economy,"Just what a vulnerable world economy didn’t need — a conflict that accelerates inflation, rattles markets and portends trouble for everyone from European consumers to indebted Chinese developers and families in Africa that face soaring food prices.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine and retaliatory sanctions from the West may not portend another global recession. The two countries together account for less than 2% of the world’s gross domestic product. And many regional economies remain in solid shape, having rebounded swiftly from the pandemic recession.



Yet the conflict threatens to inflict severe economic damage on some countries and industries — damage that could mean hardships for millions of people. Russia is the world’s third-biggest producer of petroleum and is a major exporter of natural gas. Ukraine’s farms feed millions around the world. And financial markets are in a precarious spot as central banks prepare to reverse years of easy-money policies and raise interest rates to fight a resurgence of inflation. Those higher rates will likely slow spending and raise the risk of another downturn.

HOW DO UKRAINE'S MILITARY CAPABILITIES MEASURE UP AGAINST RUSSIA?



""I wouldn’t be misled by just calculating GDP ratios ... especially at a time when commodity prices are already high, inflation is already high,"" said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for banks. ""It’s a tricky moment now, given where the global economy is.’’

Russia’s attack could slow Europe’s economic recovery by sending already elevated energy prices ever higher. Europe, an energy importer, receives close to 40% of its natural gas from Russia. A cutoff of that energy source could undercut the continent’s economy. High natural gas prices have already led to higher home utility bills for both natural-gas heat and electricity generated from gas, crimping consumer spending.

""Gas prices in Europe are already crushing households and consumers, especially low-income households,"" said Adam Tooze, director of Columbia University’s European Institute, whose 2018 history of the last decade’s financial crisis, ""Crashed,’’ explored tensions over Ukraine.



""Escalating tensions put two cornerstones of this year’s expected growth recovery — a rebound in consumer spending and a pickup in industrial activity — at further risk,"" Oliver Rakau and Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics said in a research note.

Natural gas prices, which have tended to rise on crisis news, remain about four times what they were at the start of 2021. Russia sold less gas than normal on the short-term spot market, raising concerns that the Kremlin was using gas to press for approval of its Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The pipeline has now been frozen by sanctions imposed by Germany’s government.

A mild winter and extra supplies of liquefied natural gas from the United States have helped ease some of Europe’s jitters about a potential loss of Russian gas. Analysts say Russia has no interest in a complete gas cutoff, which would mean a sharp loss of revenue.



The threat to farms in eastern Ukraine and exports through Black Sea ports could reduce wheat supplies at a time when global food prices are at their highest level since 2011 and some countries are suffering from food shortages.



MARINE CORPS VET WARNS IF RUSSIAN INVASION ESCALATES, IT WILL BE ‘BRUTAL’

Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter, agricultural analyst Alex Smith wrote last month in the journal Foreign Policy, and many of the countries that rely on its wheat ""already face food insecurity from ongoing political instability or outright violence."" Yemen, for instance, imports 22% of its wheat consumption from Ukraine, Libya about 43%, Lebanon roughly half.



Rising energy and food prices will intensify the inflationary pressures that policymakers and central banks are struggling to ease. In the estimation of Capital Economics, a worst-case scenario of an escalating conflict and sanctions could send oil prices up to as much as $140 a barrel — international Brent crude had surged above $100 on Thursday after Russia attacked Ukraine — and force natural gas prices up, too.

That combination would add a sizable 2 percentage points to annual inflation in the world’s wealthy countries, Capital Economics estimates. In the United States, the world’s largest economy, consumer inflation jumped 7.5% last month compared with 12 months earlier, the steepest annual increase since 1982.



With inflation running hot, central banks may have less leeway — or inclination — to ride to the rescue with stimulus if the economy sputters in the face of the military conflict in Ukraine.

""The current inflationary backdrop suggests that policymakers have less flexibility than in the past to respond to a slowdown in real activity or a fall in asset prices,"" said Jonathan Petersen at Capital Economics.

Indeed, stocks have tumbled in anticipation of higher rates and a potential downturn. Market benchmarks in Europe and Asia fell by as much as 4% on Thursday, while Wall Street futures retreated by an unusually wide daily margin of 2.5%.



In the face geopolitical worries, Michael Taylor, managing director at Moody’s Investors Service, warns that investors may flee to Treasurys and other super-safe investments, thereby driving up the relative credit costs for riskier businesses.

""Chinese property developers would be particularly exposed to this risk"" as they try to roll over large amounts of foreign debt this year, Taylor said.

Financial markets could grow even more chaotic if the United States proceeds with what some call the ""nuclear option"": Cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment network, a messaging service that links thousands of banks and allows them to transfer payments around the world.



Such a move would isolate Russia and bar the transfer of profits from energy production, which account for more than 40% of the country’s revenue. But shutting Russia out of international finance could backfire, too, hurting U.S. and European companies that do business with Russian companies.

""There is a risk for global finance as much as there is for Russia,"" said Ribakova of the Institute of International Finance.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-conflict-risks-global-economy,N/A
Russia-Ukraine conflict: Satellite images reveal extent of Moscow’s military buildup,"Newly-released satellite images are revealing the scope of Russia’s massive military buildup in Crimea and along the Ukrainian border.

Russia warns US military aid to Ukraine will escalate conflict as Zelenskyy addresses Congress,"As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was preparing to address Congress, Russia warned that increasing military aid to the beleaguered country would only aggravate the 10-month conflict.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at an earlier press briefing in Moscow that the expansion of Western weapon supplies to Ukraine ""leads to an aggravation of the conflict and, in fact, does not bode well for Ukraine.""

Asked whether Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington would possibly lead to possible peace talks with Russia, Peskov said: ""I don’t think so.""

His comments were the first official Russian reaction to news that Zelenskyy was heading to Washington – the president’s first known foreign trip since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion triggered a war that has killed thousands and laid waste to towns and cities across Ukraine.

ZELENSKYY VISIT IS A MESSAGE TO PUTIN THAT US WILL BACK UKRAINE FOR ‘AS LONG AS IT TAKES’: WHITE HOUSE

Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden in Washington Wednesday, where U.S. officials announced a huge new military aid package for Kyiv. He later addressed Congress, where he thanked U.S. leaders and ""ordinary Americans"" for their support in fighting off the invaders and pressed for additional aid.

Biden said the U.S. and Ukraine would continue to project a ""united defense"" as Russia wages a ""brutal assault on Ukraine's right to exist as a nation.""

The massive $1.8 billion package includes for the first time a Patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for fighter jets, U.S. officials said.

Speaking during a meeting with his top military brass, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would take lessons learned in the conflict to ""develop our armed forces and strengthen the capability of our troops.""

ZELENSKYY'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS: ‘I REALLY WANT TO WIN TOGETHER’

He said special emphasis would go to developing nuclear forces, which he described as ""the main guarantee of Russia's sovereignty.""

Putin also said the Russian military's new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile will enter service shortly. The Sarmat is intended to replace aging Soviet-built ballistic missiles and form the core of Russia's nuclear forces.

Meanwhile, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the beefed-up Russian military will include 695,000 volunteer contract soldiers, 521,000 of whom should be recruited by the end of 2023. The Russian military had about 400,000 contract soldiers as part of its 1-million-member military before the fighting in Ukraine began.

"Ukraine conflict 'heightens the risk' of Chinese-American war, professor says","The conflict in Ukraine ""heightens the risk"" of war between China and the U.S., a political science professor told Fox News.

Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts University, said China could take action in Taiwan while the U.S. is distracted with Russia's siege on Ukraine. He said conflict between the U.S. and China would most likely break out if the authoritarian superpower were to take military action in Taiwan.

""The United States and China, I think, are at very high risk of conflict,"" Beckley, the co-author of the upcoming book ""Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China,"" told Fox News. ""Not just economic competition or ideological competition, but an actual war.""

Beckley told Fox News that a slowing Chinese economy, rising sentiments of Taiwanese independence and increasing international pressure to contain China’s growth make conflict more likely.

RUSSIA’S FAILURES COULD LEAD TO MORE INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS AGAINST UKRAINIANS, FORMER NAVY INTEL OFFICERS SAYS

""There’s a lot of chatter suggesting that if China is going to move on Taiwan that now would be the opportune time,"" Beckley told Fox News. ""The Russia conflict plays into this because of course it’s a big distraction for the United States.""

In October, President Biden pledged to defend Taiwan if China attacked.

The U.S., under the Taiwan Relations Act, provides defensive weapons to Taiwan, but it is not obligated to provide military support if China were to invade.

Beckley told Fox News that the conflict in Ukraine limits the resources the U.S. can dedicate to protecting Taiwan from China.

""If Russia and China are each fighting back-to-back in their own regions, that's going to overstretch American forces, give them each opportunities to make inroads in their own regions and I think heightens the risk of a conflict over something like Taiwan this decade,"" Beckley told Fox News.

Beckley also noted that Russia and China share mutual interests based ""based on geopolitics, on energy, and on a common ideological aversion to the current international system.""

Beckley called trade between the two nations a ""natural partnership based on an absolutely vital commodity."" China imports over 80% of the oil and natural gas that it consumes and over half of Russia’s government revenue stems from selling gas and oil to foreign countries, according to Beckley.

The two countries also share an interest in ""pushing back against the liberal international order that the United States and its mostly democratic allies sustain,"" Beckley said.

The Chinese-Russian relationship features an ""asymmetry in power"" based on China’s military and economic might, according to Beckley.

""China’s economy is 10 times the size of Russia’s,"" Beckley told Fox News. ""China spends four times as much every year on its military as Russia does, and China is really a multi-dimensional, great power.""

""As a result, Russia is always worried of becoming the junior partner in the relationship, and China is always worried that it will give more than it gets,"" Beckley continued.

Beckley added that there are schisms in Russia and China’s geopolitical interests including border disputes, Central Asian spheres of influence and historical hostilities.

Chinese financial interests counter Beijing’s diplomatic support of Russia, according to Beckley. Chinese banks have ""walked back"" some of their transactions with Russia in ""basic, tacit compliance"" with recent sanctions.

""China, on the one hand, wants to support Russia but is not willing to go to the full extent as an ally would because it worries that it'll get cut off from the Western economic system and invite hostility towards itself,"" Beckley told Fox News.

China has not imposed sanctions on Russia, according to Reuters.

Beckley told Fox News that there are three strategic rationales for this policy.

""First of all, I think the Chinese are worried that if they are to make moves on Taiwan or to get more aggressive or simply a spark the ire of the United States and its allies, they too could be subject to similar sanctions,"" Beckley said. ""And so they want to start undermining the legitimacy of this sort of ganging up on a great power.""

Second, Beckley told Fox News that abstaining from imposing sanctions allows Chinese institutions to avoid getting ""caught up in a broader conflict.""

Third, ""the more trouble Russia can stir up in Europe, the more America's attention and its allies are bogged down in Europe,"" Beckley said. ""And that softens up the international system so that China can potentially blast through it if it wants to make its own offensive in East Asia.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-conflict-heightens-the-risk-of-chinese-american-war-professor-says,N/A

Ukrainian leaders worried about 'war fatigue' among Western allies amid protracted conflict with Russia,"Ukrainian officials are concerned that Russia’s protracted war in the country – now entering its fourth month – could make Western allies tire of their steadfast support.

The U.S., along with its allies, has supplied Ukraine with billions of dollars in aid and weapons to defend itself against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

European and other allied countries have taken in millions of refugees displaced in the conflict in which Russia has been accused of war crimes against civilians. The U.S. has said it's willing to accept around 100,000 refugees.

And while videos and images of alleged atrocities have shocked the world, domestic crises and nearly three and a half months have pulled focus from the largest war in Europe since World War II. Now, Kyiv officials are concerned about international ""war fatigue.""

RUSSIA CLAIMS UPPER HAND IN EASTERN UKRAINE BUT ANALYSTS SUGGEST PROGRESS ‘COSTLY,' POWER DECLINING

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a ""special military operation"" that by all accounts has been much slower and less successful than Putin envisioned.

Russian troops had initially tried to take Kyiv but eventually moved mainly to the disputed Donbas region in the east.

Ukraine believes Russia could leverage a possible waning focus on the war by the West to force the defenders into agreeing to give up land.

""The fatigue is growing, people want some kind of outcome (that is beneficial) for themselves, and we want (another) outcome for ourselves,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said recently.

Political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Associated Press, ""It is obvious that Russia is determined to wear down the West and is now building its strategy on the assumption that Western countries will get tired and gradually begin to change their militant rhetoric to a more accommodating one.""

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said such talk ""can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it.""

Even a remark by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that Ukraine should consider territorial concessions drew a retort from Zelenskyy that it was tantamount to European powers in 1938 letting Nazi Germany claim parts of Czechoslovakia to curb Adolf Hitler's aggression.

Allied leaders are still with Ukraine: last week President Biden said the U.S. plans to send advanced rocket systems and munitions to the country that will enable it to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield and promised he won’t pressure Ukraine to make concessions.

UN chief urges conflict prevention and 'diplomacy for peace',"Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday the Central African Republic, which has suffered overlapping national and local conflicts for decades despite 15 peace agreements since 1997, is an example of why ""diplomacy for peace"" is needed more than ever.

The U.N. chief told the Security Council that he believes it is possible to reverse trends like the one in Central African Republic, which is why ""we must make prevention our priority.""

But Guterres stressed that conflict prevention must include investment in mediation, peacebuilding and economic development that preserves the environment.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby went further, telling council members that mediation can only be effective when it takes place alongside reconciliation efforts.

""Where mediation is about resolving conflict, reconciliation is the process of transforming violent conflict into non-violent coexistence where communities have come to terms with history and are learning to disagree well,"" Welby said. ""Mediation by itself, however skilled, is like using a garden hose to put out a forest fire, when what you need is rain over the whole area to let new life grow and sustain itself.""

Since he became secretary-general in January 2017, Guterres has been focused on how to tackle wars, which he said are ""becoming increasingly complex,"" and mediating peace, which he said is also becoming increasingly difficult.

He said that today conflicts drag on for years and decades, and international attention drifts, with peace agreements becoming ""more elusive and short-lived.""

Guterres said prevention and diplomacy are now top priorities.

U.N. envoys are pursuing mediation which may possibly lead to political solutions in Libya and Yemen, he said, and U.N. efforts have led to peacekeeping missions like the one in Mali, which is the deadliest for U.N. troops.

Noting last month's peace declaration between Ethiopia and Eritrea after 20 years of conflict, Guterres said, the U.N. must move beyond ""negotiations with political and military elites"" to help build peace from the ground up. And he said the 193-nation world organizations must bring disparate tracks together to coordinate peace efforts.

Welby, who leads the Anglican church, said unlike many other organizations ""the church and other faith communities are intimately present where there are conflicts.""

""We cannot and will not walk away from them,"" he said, citing as an example conflict-wracked South Sudan where he said church leaders including Anglican Archbishop Justin Badi ""are playing an increasingly important role in moving the whole peace process beyond the current roadblocks.""

Welby stressed that there will always be profound differences among and within nations.

""We have avoided global nuclear war, yet not its continuing menace,"" he said.

But the archbishop warned that even in the Security Council the international ""rules-based order is struggling"" against national interests.

""Without dealing with even passionate disagreement peacefully, no national interest can prevail,"" Welby warned. ""Short term advantage for one interest leads to long term destruction for all, through great wars and small conflicts.""

British Minister of State Lord Tariq Ahmad, who chaired the meeting, told the council that ""as the nature of conflict evolves, mediation will be needed more than ever"" and ""the United Nations must stand ready to ensure that it is equal to the task.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-chief-urges-conflict-prevention-and-diplomacy-for-peace,N/A
UN Sec-Gen warns Russia-Ukraine conflict is leading world into 'wider war',"United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres presented a bleak outlook on the future and the need to take dramatic action to avoid global catastrophe.

At a Monday briefing to the UN General Assembly on the year's priorities, Guterres noted that experts have determined that the Doomsday Clock is closer to midnight than ever.

""The Doomsday Clock is now 90 seconds to midnight, which means 90 seconds to total global catastrophe,"" Guterres said. ""This is the closest the clock has ever stood to humanity’s darkest hour – and closer than even during the height of the Cold War.""

Guterres pointed to a number of problems that the world is facing, including climate change, poverty, and war. He was particularly worried about the war in Ukraine that began when Russia invaded roughly one year ago.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine is inflicting untold suffering on the Ukrainian people, with profound global implications. The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing,"" he said. ""I fear the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war. I fear it is doing so with its eyes wide open.""

Guterres also pointed to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as situations in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Haiti and the Sahel.

Guterres said the world needs to look to the UN's charter to work toward peace.

""If every country fulfilled its obligations under the charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed,"" he said. ""When countries break those pledges, they create a world of insecurity for everyone.""

Guterres said that the Doomsday Clock in reality ""is a global alarm clock.""

""We need to wake up – and get to work,"" he said.

With that in mind, he called for a New Agenda for Peace that has ""to address all forms and domains of threats, old and new.""

This, he said, included ending ""the threat posed by 13,000 nuclear weapons held in arsenals around the world,"" as well as ""such measures as international bans on cyberattacks on civilian infrastructure, and internationally agreed limits on lethal autonomous weapons systems.""

UN to vote on resolution on link between conflict and famine,"The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote soon on a resolution recognizing the link between conflict and the threat of famine.

Dutch Ambassador Karel Van Oosterom, whose country sponsored the resolution, says the text was agreed on Wednesday and a vote is likely Thursday.

The draft resolution calls on all parties in conflicts to comply with international humanitarian law and stop attacks on farms, markets, water systems and other essentials for producing and transporting food, which is indispensable for the survival of civilians.

It also strongly condemns ""the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in a number of conflict situations.""

The U.N. World Food Program reported in March that between 108 million and 124 million people in conflict situations suffer from severe malnutrition.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-to-vote-on-resolution-on-link-between-conflict-and-famine,N/A
US warns Nicaragua is following path of Syria and Venezuela,"The United States warned the Security Council on Wednesday that Nicaragua is heading down the path that led to conflict in Syria and a crisis in Venezuela that has spilled into the region — but Russia, China and Bolivia said Nicaragua doesn't pose an international threat and the U.N. should butt out.

The sharp exchanges took place at the first Security Council meeting called by U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the current council president, to address what the U.N. says is the government's violent repression of student and opposition protests that have killed over 300 people since mid-April and led thousands to flee the country.

""With each passing day Nicaragua travels further down a familiar path. It is a path that Syria has taken. It is a path that Venezuela has taken,"" Haley said.

She said Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega and Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ""are cut from the same corrupt cloth ... And they are both dictators who live in fear of their own people.""

But she said there is still an opportunity for Nicaragua's government ""to prevent tyranny from threatening peace and security"" by responding to the people's demands for freedom, an end to ""dictatorship,"" and the release of arbitrarily jailed protesters.

Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia countered that the ""subversive policies of the United States against Nicaragua have a long history"" and the meeting —which Moscow ""categorically objects to"" — represented ""a glaring and grim example of destructive foreign intervention.""

It is to ""advance regional ambitions of major powers"" who want to ""wreak maximum damage"" to Nicaragua's economy, ""stoke social unrest, foment intolerance with a single aim — to change the government,"" Nebenzia said.

He warned that ""following today's discussion, polarization in Nicaragua will only worsen.""

The popular protests that began in mid-April were triggered by cuts to the social security system. Ortega reversed the cuts, but demonstrations quickly expanded and turned into a call for him to step down. He has refused to give up power before elections scheduled for 2021.

A report released last Wednesday by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on four months of unrest in the country described government repression that stretched from the streets to courtrooms, where some protesters face terrorism charges.

The human rights office called on the government to immediately halt the persecution of protesters and disarm the masked civilians who have been responsible for many of the killings and arbitrary detentions. It also documented cases of torture and excessive force.

Two days later, the government expelled the U.N. human rights team in the country.

Gonzalo Koncke, chief of staff to the secretary-general of the Organization of American States, told the council that Nicaragua ""is at a critical juncture and the government must take critical measures"" to re-establish democracy in the country.

The government must quickly hold ""free, just, democratic and transparent elections"" and start a dialogue with all parties that leads to agreements.

If democracy is not restored, Koncke warned, Nicaragua ""may go the way of other countries in the region who have fallen in the arms of dictators.""

Civil society leader Felix Maradiaga, a former secretary general of Nicaragua's Ministry of Defense who said he faces constant death threats, told the council he came to convey the urgency of the situation in the country that threatens peace and security in the region.

""Every day we see a climate of terror and indiscriminate persecution,"" he said, citing the rising number of political prisoners, armed and masked people bursting into homes, and sexual attacks.

""For more than a decade, the Daniel Ortega regime has been benefiting from the fact that it is off the international agenda, off the international radar,"" Maradiaga said. ""So we are seeing the danger of Nicaragua spinning out of control in a volatile region of the world.""

Nicaragua needs the attention of the United Nations, he said, ""to ensure there is peace and security before it's too late."" And he urged the U.N.'s most powerful body to adopt a legally binding resolution, assign resources and establish a system to monitor what's happening in the country and support the restoration of the rule of law.

Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Denis Moncada Colindres made no mention of the unrest or elections, stressing instead that ""in Nicaragua we love peace, we strengthen our security and we promote and defend human rights in a holistic way.""

""There is consensus in this council Nicaragua does not represent a threat to international peace and security,"" he said. ""Therefore, its inclusion in this meeting is a clear case of interference in internal affairs of Nicaragua and a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and indeed international law.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-warns-nicaragua-is-following-path-of-syria-and-venezuela,N/A
"Vladimir Putin will only 'escalate' Ukraine war, sees conflict as 'existential' for Russia, expert says","Bill Browder spent a decade navigating the anarchic environment of post-Soviet Russia after moving to Moscow in 1996. He ran a hedge fund that would eventually become the largest outside investor in the country with more than $4.5 billion under management.

The Stanford Business School graduate took a ""naming-and-shaming approach"" to his work, clashing with oligarchs and other Russian officials who he believed were taking advantage of the lawlessness of the ""Wild East.""

""But, of course, exposing corrupt oligarchs didn’t make me very popular in Russia,"" Browder writes in his new book, ""Freezing Order."" ""And, in time, my actions led to a cascade of disastrous consequences.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin blacklisted Browder in 2005, expelling him from Russia and sending his cronies to seize the assets of Browder's fund.

Browder evacuated his staff, liquidated the fund's holdings and hired a team of attorneys who would eventually accuse Interior Ministry officials of working with criminals to orchestrate a $230 million tax rebate fraud.

One of those attorneys, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested in November 2008 and spent nearly a year in a jail cell, where he was refused medical care for a host of issues he developed. On Nov. 16, 2009, Magnitsky was transferred to another detention center and beaten to death by a group of riot guards with rubber batons.

In 2012, former President Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law, which sanctioned the individuals believed to be responsible for the attorney's death and allowed the Treasury Department to target other human rights abusers in Russia.

Browder has spent the years since then encouraging dozens of other countries around the world to adopt their own version of the Magnitsky Act, a mission that has taken on increased significance in the wake of Putin's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

""This war is, for Putin, an existential war,"" Browder told Fox News Digital in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival.

""He started this war — not because of NATO or of some grand vision of Russian Empire — he started this war because he was afraid that someone was going to, or I should say, the people of Russia, were going to finally say enough is enough.""

More than seven months into the invasion, Putin has failed to achieve his immediate goals, prompting the Kremlin to announce a ""partial mobilization"" last week and conscript 300,000 men into the military, a move that could backfire.

""He's really walking a tightrope between having to be seen to be strong and upsetting a lot of people by drafting them, putting them in harm's way, having young men killed, in order to stay strong,"" Browder said.

The partial mobilization has met some resistance within Russia.

More than 2,300 protesters have been arrested during demonstrations in dozens of cities. Some draft offices have been set on fire, while one 25-year-old Russian man opened fire at a miliary enlistment center in the Siberian town of Ust-Ilimsk, wounding the head of the office, according to Reuters.

""You can be assured of one thing, which is that Putin always escalates. He has only a forward gear, no reverse gear. There's no possibility of negotiation. I've never seen him negotiate anything, so he's going to fight until he can no longer fight,"" Browder said.

Putin recently threatened to use ""all the means at our disposal"" if Russia's ""territorial integrity"" is threatened, a statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy derided as ""nuclear blackmail.""

RUSSIA AND US IN 'VERY SPORADIC' TALKS OVER NUCLEAR ISSUES, KREMLIN SAYS

U.S. officials, meanwhile, have warned of ""catastrophic"" and ""horrific"" consequences for Russia if Putin did use nuclear weapons.

""Putin is a psychopath. He holds nuclear weapons. He only cares about his own survival, and if he somehow saw the use of tactical nuclear weapons as a way of staying alive and staying in power, then he very well might,"" Browder said.

The U.S. and Western allies have sent billions of dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine while slapping sanctions on Russian industry and oligarchs.

Throwing a wrench in Russia's war machine won't be possible until the rest of the world joins in cutting off Russia though, according to Browder.

""A lot of other countries — China, India, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil — are sitting it out, they're not involved in the sanctions,"" Browder said.
