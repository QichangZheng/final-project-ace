Biden's failed immigration policies turned every state into a border state,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In April 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 234,088 migrants at the southern border. This is the highest number of monthly apprehensions in CBP’s history, and a 1,268 percent increase compared to April 2020.

What has changed over the last two years? In 2020, we had a president who worked to secure our border and shield American citizens from drug traffickers trying to smuggle illicit substances into our country. Now, we have a president who has welcomed illegal immigrants into our country with open arms. Due to President Joe Biden’s open-door immigration policies, every state in America is now a border state. Through his failed border policies, President Biden has surrendered operational control of America’s southern border to drug cartels.

JUDGE'S HALT OF TITLE 42 REPEAL GETS BIDEN ADMIN, DEMS OUT OF TRICY POLITICAL SITUATION

In his first 100 days in office, President Biden issued more than 90 executive actions on immigration, including stopping the construction of President Trump’s border wall, which cost taxpayers $72 million, and ending the Trump administration’s successful ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which required migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico until their court date in the United States. Because of President Biden’s efforts to dismantle America’s border and immigration enforcement system, drug-overdose deaths reached a new record last year.

The Wall Street Journal reports that over 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2021. Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that roughly two-thirds of these deaths came from synthetic opioids like fentanyl. To date, CBP has seized over 5,000 pounds of fentanyl in Fiscal Year 2022. This is enough to kill 2.4 billion people – nearly one-third of the Earth’s entire population. Fentanyl can be 50 times stronger than heroin, and it is easier for drug cartels to manufacture because it can be made from common chemicals.

Drug cartels are extremely violent and tactical. They have built intricate tunnels that allow them to smuggle drugs into our country undetected, they often send floods of migrants to the southern border to overwhelm Border Patrol agents, and they force their migrants to act as drug mules, carrying marijuana and poppy seeds so their growers can operate on American soil.

Merrick Garland, President Biden’s U.S. Attorney General, has made it clear that the Department of Justice would avoid cracking down on marijuana use in states that have legalized cannabis. This has encouraged drug cartels to produce cannabis ""grows"" in pro-cannabis states farmed by thousands of migrants illegally trafficked across the southern border.

One prime example is Oregon, which has Mexican, Russian, and Chinese criminal organizations operating in the southern part of the state. In November 2021, Oregon State Police uncovered a massive illegal marijuana operation in Jackson County. A drug bust of five warehouses uncovered approximately 500,000 pounds of illegal marijuana. Authorities estimated the value of drugs captured in just this operation at $500 million.

When he was asked for additional manpower to stomp out the drug cartels abusing the Department of Justice’s hands-off approach toward federal marijuana prosecution, Attorney General Garland failed to respond.

In 2021, the Biden administration reduced deportations by roughly 68 percent – the lowest level in 26 years. With illegal immigrants being able to easily claim that they are ""seeking asylum,"" and with Speaker Pelosi’s Congress refusing to fix our broken immigration system, more than 2.6 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at our southern border since Joe Biden took control of the White House. That number represents more than the population of Houston, Texas – the fourth-largest city in America. The asylum laws we have on the books need to be completely gutted and rewritten to address this mass migration catastrophe.

Unless the Biden administration reverses its open-door policy and failed border security agenda, illegal immigrants and transnational criminal organizations will continue to flood across our open border, and every state – no matter where it is located – will be a border state in Biden’s America.

House Republicans have a plan to reverse the Democrats’ self-made border crisis. First and foremost, it is essential that the Biden Administration does not rescind Title 42 of the Public Health and Safety Act. Title 42 prevents illegal immigrants from bringing diseases into America, and this policy has been used to return more than 1.7 million migrants back to Mexico.

Second, end the Biden Administration’s failed ""catch-and-release"" policy, which illegal immigrants have exploited to escape into the United States. Migrants caught trying to illegally enter our country should not be released into our communities while they wait (many for more than five years) for a hearing.



Finally, once the open-door policy is ended, finish building President Trump’s border wall and hire thousands more CBP officers and agents to enforce our laws and secure America’s southern border. These actions will save lives and play a crucial role in stopping the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs into our country.

"Biden's border crisis: Our immigration courts have a 2,023,441 case backlog and it's more than we can handle","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Border Patrol had more than 2.2 million encounters with illegal crossers between ports of entry on the Southwest border in fiscal 2022.

A recent report from the DHS Inspector General indicates that most of the illegal crossers are not put in detention facilities or expelled under Title 42, but rather are processed for outcomes allowing them to be released into the United States to wait for immigration hearings. This has overwhelmed the immigration courts.

The immigration court backlog was 1,262,765 cases at the end of fiscal 2020, which was the last full fiscal year of the previous administration. Under the current administration, it has risen to 2,023,441 cases as of the end of November 2022.

ICE DEPORTATIONS REMAINED WELL BELOW TRUMP-ERA LEVELS IN FY 2022, AMID HISTORIC BORDER CRISIS

Almost 800,000 of them have submitted asylum applications and are waiting for an asylum hearing. The average wait from when an application is filed to when an applicant’s case will be heard is 1,572 days, or 4.3 years.

Moreover, many others have been allowed to enter the United States to wait for an asylum hearing but have not filed an asylum application yet. And the number of asylum seekers is likely to increase greatly when Title 42 is terminated.

The administration seems to want to deal with this problem by finding faster ways to adjudicate the applications instead of admitting fewer asylum seekers to give the immigration court a chance to catch up.

For instance, on May 28, 2021, the administration announced a new Dedicated Docket which is supposed to expeditiously and fairly make decisions on the immigration cases of newly arrived families who are apprehended between ports of entry at the Southwest Border. INA §1325(a) provides that such entries are crimes subject to imprisonment for up to two years.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says in the announcement that, ""Families who have recently arrived should not languish in a multi-year backlog; today’s announcement is an important step for both justice and border security.""

The immigration court backlog was 1,262,765 cases at the end of fiscal 2020, which was the last full fiscal year of the previous administration. Under the current administration, it has risen to 2,023,441 cases as of the end of November 2022.

He is referring to newly arriving families, not the families who already are languishing in the multi-year backlog.

The announcement concludes that while ""the goal of this process is to decide cases expeditiously, fairness will not be compromised.""

Dedicated Dockets are not new or fair.

The Obama and Trump administrations also had Dedicated Dockets for newly arriving migrants to prevent them from having to wait a long time for a hearing.

The Vera Institute of Justice claims that as prior efforts to use expedited dockets have demonstrated, Dedicated Dockets do not provide due process. Court records for a two-year period during the Obama administration show that it was rare for an unrepresented family in Dedicated Docket proceedings to file the papers needed to seek asylum or other forms of relief from deportation. Only 1 in 15 (6.5 percent) managed to do this without representation.

According to a recent TRAC report, more than 110,000 cases have been assigned to the current administration’s Dedicated Docket, and nearly 40,000 of them have been completed. The vast majority (83%) of the completed cases were closed within 300 days from the date of receiving a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings.

But a price must be paid for doing this. Georgetown Law School Professor Paul Schmidt points out that when Dedicated Docket judges are not available to hear cases on the general docket, it places extra burdens on their judicial colleagues who are handling the general docket cases.

And taking judges away from the general docket to serve on the Dedicated Docket also reduces the number of judges who are available for doing cases that would reduce the backlog.

TRAC found that only 34% of the families whose cases have been completed had representation, and few families without representation have been able to complete the paperwork required for filing an asylum application.

Overall, only 2,894 out of 39,187 families who had hearings in fiscal 2022 were granted asylum. The cases in which asylum was granted represent just 7.4% of the completed cases.

The Vera Institute of Justice would address this problem by providing representation for every migrant in Dedicated Docket proceedings. According to the Institute, ""No immigrant should be forced to go through immigration court proceedings without legal defense.""

Is that even possible? And if it is possible, who is going to pay for it? INA §1229a(b)(4), which provides that migrants have the ""privilege of being represented"" in removal proceedings, specifies that it must be ""at no expense to the Government.""

Frankly, I think the main problem is that the administration is flooding our already overwhelmed immigration court with a tsunami of illegal crossers who claim that they are asylum seekers.



The attempt to relieve the immigration court's backlog crisis with a Dedicated Docket didn’t work for the Obama administration and it isn’t working for the current administration either.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-border-crisis-immigration-courts-have-2023441-case-backlog-more-handle,N/A
Geraldo Rivera: Immigration advocates should strike a bargain with Trump. Here's what I propose,"Back in June in Sandusky, Ohio, about 65 miles west of my home here in Cleveland, there was a huge federal raid involving about 200 agents on Corso’s Flower and Garden Center. The combined ICE-led operation rounded up 114 undocumented immigrants workers; some of whom had been here on and off for decades.

The raid lay bare the essential dilemma facing those attempting to enforce our immigration policy. It took a gigantic federal operation to round up and hold for deportation people who were working hard and attempting to do the right thing. No matter how you slice it, our massive, legitimate, law-enforcement operation punished good people trying to work and provide for their families.

Bear the Corso raid in mind when you try to wrap your mind around the current crisis involving the Caravan of Migrants doggedly heading our way from Guatemala and Honduras, trudging through Mexico and causing great consternation and angry condemnation in Washington, D.C.

It would be easy to support the deployment of the U.S. military and other draconian “solutions” to the migrant crisis generally, and the caravan specifically, if the marchers were gang bangers or ISIS recruits. Manifestly most are not, (unless ISIS or MS-13 is recruiting crying, hungry three-year olds). Even the most hardened anti-immigrant pundit cannot justify actions taken to stop the caravan by saying it is mostly about national security. It is not.

It is, in my opinion, fear of our nation being over-run by poor, hungry, brown people in sufficient numbers to change our basic national character, which motivates most critics of this caravan and, more broadly, illegal immigration.

What would the Army do against a caravan of civilians, many of them women and children, anyway? Shoot them?

The president senses that most Americans are responding very negatively to the caravan, and even see it as an existential threat to the nation. He has even stated that he will, if necessary, use our military to stop the caravan from crossing over the southern border. In doing so he ignores the principle known as Posse Comitatus, which by law, prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws.

What would the Army do against a caravan of civilians, many of them women and children, anyway? Shoot them?

The Republicans see this caravan as the perfect issue to rally the base and insure a big, robust turnout for the mid-term elections now two weeks away. Democrats would like to pretend that the caravan is just a giant day-care center filled with needy children that the heartless president doesn’t care about.

This crisis calls for reason, patience, compassion and an immediate parlay among the affected nations in Central America, Mexico and the United States. In exchange for leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in this country--who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents--pro-immigration advocates, like me, should announce our support for President Trump’s border wall. It will help restore order along the southern border, and mitigate the hysteria currently gripping the national immigration debate and tainting the mid-term elections.

But neither building the president’s border wall, nor compassion for the DREAMERS already here, will fully solve the crisis of immigration. We are the world’s richest country. We are located adjacent to some of the world’s poorest and most violent countries. As long as that imbalance exists, they will want to come here.

And neither the Army nor the wall will stop them all.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/geraldo-rivera-immigration-advocates-should-strike-a-bargain-with-trump-heres-what-i-propose,N/A
Here's the truth about my plan for immigration reform,"Americans believe in the value of immigration. We are the most generous nation on earth to immigrants, allowing over one million people a year to come here legally. They come here in pursuit of what we recognize as the American dream – the chance to live in freedom and have the opportunity to work hard to make a better life for themselves and their families.

The problem is that our legal immigration system has been broken for decades. It has enabled 11 million people to come here illegally or overstay visas. It is a bureaucratic and inefficient system that does not address the needs of our economy.

All this has further deepened the American people’s mistrust in the ability of their government to perform basic functions.

Leaving in place a broken immigration system -– and the millions of people whose identities are a mystery to us –- is simply not an acceptable option. This must be fixed.

[pullquote]

More On This... Senators say bombings should spark immigration reform, not halt process

That is why I am advocating for securing our borders, improving enforcement, modernizing our legal immigration system and changing it so that it prioritizes welcoming people to the U.S. based on skills, not just on whether they have a family member already living here.

And that is why I support a process to identify and register those who are here illegally. They will have to submit biometric data in order to pass multiple national security and criminal background checks, pay $2,000 in fines, pay taxes, and learn English and American civics. They won’t be able to get any federal benefits like welfare or ObamaCare.

Before they can even apply to become permanent residents, they will have to wait at least ten years. They will have to get in line behind those who are trying to come the right way.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to prevent illegal immigrants from being hired.

They will have to wait until we have a system in place to track people who overstay their visas.

And they will have to wait until we implement plans to spend at least $5.5 billion dollars to secure the border through more border patrol officers, more technology and more fencing.

I thought long and hard before taking on this issue. I understand how divisive it can be. I’ve seen how the left has used it to accuse opponents of their version of reform of being bigots and racists. And I would much rather be having a debate on the more fundamental ways we can grow our economy and get our debt and spending under control. But with or without us, the president and the Democrats who control the Senate were going to bring this issue up.

And I believe conservatives need to fight for the ideas and policies we believe are critical to fixing our immigration system.

The opponents of reform raise important points about not rewarding the violation of the law. I, too, have felt the frustration many feel that our nation’s generosity has been taken advantage of by some.

But policy-making is about solving problems. And to pick the right solution, you have to weigh the realistic alternatives. Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a practical solution. But ignoring the fact that they are here is just as bad.

For example, passing a law that only focuses on modernization and enforcement and leaves for another day the issue of those here illegally is not a good idea. Because as the enforcement measures kick in, millions of people living here illegally will be unable to work and provide for themselves and their families. The resulting humanitarian impact will then force us to scramble to address it. It is better to address it now as part of an orderly and measured process.

The only solution I know that can work is to reform legal immigration in a way that is good for the economy, do everything we can to secure the border, and allow illegal immigrants to eventually earn permanent residency by passing background checks, paying a fine, learning English and waiting at the back of the line for at least 10 years, at the same time that border security and enforcement measures are put in place to prevent this problem from happening again.

The bill I helped write is a good starting point, but it is not a take it or leave it proposition. I am open to any ideas others may have on how to do this, and I’ve been listening to the legitimate concerns people have raised with the expectation that we will be able to improve the bill as this debate continues.

We must do something to end today’s de facto amnesty, and conservative Republicans should lead on this issue. Because without conservatives at the table and in the fight, we are ceding this issue to President Obama and his allies in Congress. And as the last four years have proven, that is never a good idea.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-the-truth-about-my-plan-for-immigration-reform,N/A
"Tom Homan: In fight against coronavirus, enforcing immigration laws saves lives","Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

The first obligation of every president of the United States since the founding of our nation has always been to protect the American people from harm. President Trump invoked his powers under the Constitution and under laws to do this when he ordered illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to be immediately deported to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Predictably, the president’s critics blasted his action as anti-immigrant hysteria – an irrational act motivated by his supposed hatred of immigrants. But nothing could be further from the truth.

It’s unfortunate that as a deadly pandemic sweeps across most of the world, President Trump’s political opponents can’t put political rhetoric and ideology aside and agree that we should do whatever we can legally do to reduce the terrible toll of serious illness and death the coronavirus is taking in our country.

TOM HOMAN: CORONAVIRUS SHOULDN’T FORCE ICE TO RELEASE DETAINED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

The president’s action, announced March 20, requires Border Patrol agents to immediately send people entering our country illegally or seeking asylum from Mexico or Canada back to those countries, without being detained or processed.

With the vast majority of Americans now being required to shelter in place in their homes – and venture out only for food, medication and to carry out essential jobs – it would be a dereliction of duty for any president to fail to stop people who may be carrying the coronavirus from entering our country.

Keep in mind that President Trump has also ordered a halt to travelers who aren’t American citizens from entering the U.S. from many parts of the world. Many countries have placed a similar restriction on U.S. citizens, or required Americans to be quarantined for two weeks when entering.

None of these actions by any of these countries are an expression of hatred for foreigners. They are commonsense precautions against the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

At this writing, there are over 1.5 million confirmed cases of the COVID-19 globally, including more than 400,000 in the U.S. The disease has caused nearly 90,000 confirmed deaths around the world and nearly 15,000 in the U.S. Many experts say the number of people infected and killed is actually higher, because many cases have not been confirmed.

It’s important to understand that only about 10 percent of asylum seekers who cross our borders actually are granted asylum by our courts. Most don’t qualify for asylum under our laws or simply don’t show up in court for their asylum hearings.

Instead, until the new policy ordered by President Trump took effect, many were released into the U.S. population to await asylum hearings, creating the opportunity for those carrying the coronavirus or other diseases to infect others in the U.S.

The spread of disease happened when I was the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as migrants brought measles, chickenpox, lice, tuberculosis and other infections into the U.S. The same thing can happen with the coronavirus.

No president can ignore our immigration laws and regulations in the interest of pleasing advocates of open borders. To do so would inevitably result in more people falling ill and some of those people dying of COVID-19.

How many people crossing into our country are carrying the coronavirus? No one knows. It’s certainly not all of them, but it certainly must be some of them.

Every Border Patrol agent and Customs and Broder Protection port officer is exposed daily to many people from foreign lands. These federal law enforcement officers don’t have the option to quarantine. They don’t have the option to telecommute and work from home. They risk their personal safety and health every day and know they may take COVID-19 or another disease home to their families.

President Trump has made great decisions regarding these policies. But even though illegal border crossings have decreased substantially, we need to remain vigilant – now more than ever.

We don’t know how the coronavirus has affected Mexico. We also don’t know the number of people in Mexico who have already died from the coronavirus.

As in the U.S., in Mexico tests for the presence of the coronavirus are not routinely administered to most people who die, because there aren’t enough tests. Many people listed as dying of pneumonia or other diseases very likely died of COVID-19. In addition, vast numbers of Mexican nationals do not have access to any health care.

Also, as in the U.S. and countries around the world, the coronavirus is damaging Mexico’s economy. In addition to destroying jobs in Mexico, the virus is depriving many Mexican immigrants in the U.S. of their jobs, forcing them to reduce or stop sending money back to relatives in Mexico.

These payments from Mexicans in the U.S. to help support relatives in Mexico, known as remittances, amount to billions of dollars every year. The dramatic reductions in these payments now taking place may prompt more Mexicans to cross into the U.S. illegally to seek jobs to make up for the lost payments.

If the coronavirus pandemic and economic distress worsen in Mexico it could cause a sharp rise in illegal immigration from that country into the U.S. – meaning we will have to intensify efforts to maintain a secure border.

Illegal immigration by Mexican nationals accounted for 80 percent of all Border Patrol apprehensions in the 1980s and 1990s. However, that percentage dropped significantly as Mexico’s economy improved, while the number of Central Americans crossing into the U.S. illegally rose.

The coronavirus pandemic has already inundated much of the U.S. health care system, filling our hospitals beyond capacity and requiring health care professionals – including volunteers who have come out of retirement – to work long hours. Supplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators are dangerously low. We have to be concerned about adding any more pressure to the system by adding more illegal immigrants to the caseload of patients needing treatment.

Imagine what could happen in a place like El Paso, Texas – a small city of about 680,000 people that sits just north of Juarez, Mexico with a population of 1.5 million – if many sick people from Juarez cross the border seeking medical treatment.

It is only a matter of time before someone carrying the coronavirus will either be arrested by the Border Patrol or – worse yet – not be arrested and sneak into the U.S. In fact, there’s an excellent chance this has already happened an unknown number of times.

It has never been more important to secure our borders than right now. I’m glad we have President Trump in the Oval Office and tens of thousands of American patriots in Customs and Border Protection and ICE protecting our communities as best they can.

We must honor our front-line health care workers for the incredible job they are doing in our country and the sacrifices that they are making every day. At the same time, we can’t forget that the heroic work being performed by first responders in law enforcement – including not just police officers and firefighters, but the men and women of the Border Patrol and ICE who stand vigilant to protect our borders.

As always, we should hope for the best but prepare for the worse in terms of both the coronavirus pandemic and a possible surge in illegal immigration. Doing this is, quite literally a matter of life and death.

"Tucker Carlson: Joe Biden revealed why he supports illegal immigration in 2015, he wants to change the country","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

You’ve got to ask yourself, as you watch the historic tragedy that is Joe Biden’s immigration policy, what’s the point of this? Nothing about it is an accident, obviously. It is intentional. Biden did it on purpose. But why? Why would a president do this to his own country? No sane, first-world nation opens its borders to the world. Promising the poorest people on the planet that they can have endless free, taxpayer-funded services if they show up and break your laws isn’t just stupid. It’s suicidal. For generations, middle-class Americans had access to the best health care in the world. But not anymore. That’s over for good. Our system can’t handle this many destitute newcomers. Imagine what hospitals are going to look like a year from now? How about the schools? What Joe Biden is doing now will change this country forever. So, again, why’s he doing it?

There’s only one plausible answer. You’re not allowed to say it out loud. CNN will attack you if you do. The social media companies will shut you down. The Southern Poverty Law Center will call you dangerous. You could lose your bank account. The left will become completely unhinged and hysterical, and that’s how you know it’s true. They only censor the true things. No one gets in trouble for claiming the earth is flat. So it would be risky for us to explain what’s actually happening here. But for once we don’t need to do that. Joe Biden himself has already done it. Biden explained the entire point of mass immigration back in 2015, when he was Vice President:

JOE BIDEN: An unrelenting stream of immigration. Nonstop, nonstop. Folks like me who are Caucasian, of European descent, for the first time in 2017 we'll be an absolute minority in the United States of America. Absolute minority. Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be white European stock. That's not a bad thing. That’s a source of our strength.

""An unrelenting stream of immigration."" Why? Joe Biden said it. To change the racial mix of the country. That’s the reason. To reduce the political power of people whose ancestors lived here, and dramatically increase the proportion of Americans newly arrived from the third world. And then Biden went further and said that non-white DNA is the source of our strength. Imagine saying that. This is the language of eugenics. It’s horrifying. But there’s a reason Biden said it. In political terms, this policy is sometimes called the great replacement — the replacement of legacy Americans, with more obedient people from faraway countries.

PETE HEGSETH: GOVERNMENT IS AN ‘EXTENSION OF THE CARTEL PIPELINE’ AMID WORSENING BORDER CRISIS

They brag about it all the time, but if you dare to say this is happening they’ll scream at you with maximum hysteria. And yet here you have Joe Biden confirming his motive, on tape, with a smile on his face. No one who talks like this should ever be the President of the United States. The president has a moral obligation to represent all Americans equally, not just those of a specific color. For four years, remember, they told you Donald Trump was a racist. But has anyone shown that Trump ever in his life said anything half as disgusting as Joe Biden said on that tape? No. No one has.

Now, you’re not supposed to notice this, of course. And to keep you from noticing what Joe Biden is doing and why they are as always accusing you of their sins. Two sitting members of Congress told you it’s ""racist"" to enforce immigration law.

AYANNA PRESSLEY: Congress must do the work of investigating and ensuring accountability of the egregious and white supremacist behavior of border patrol agents in Del Rio Texas.

MAXINE WATERS: What we witnessed takes us back hundreds of years. What we witnessed was worse than what we witnessed in slavery. Cowboys with their reigns again whipping Black people, Haitians into the water, where they’re scrambling and falling down. When all they’re trying to do is escape from violence in their country.

""It’s worse than slavery,"" enforcing our own laws. That was Maxine Waters. Everything she just said is a lie. The Haitians now in Texas aren’t trying to escape violence in their own country. They haven’t been in Haiti in years. They’ve been living in South America. Many even had refugee status in South America, in countries like Chile and Brazil. But that wasn’t good enough. They waited until Joe Biden became president and came here, for the free health care and housing Biden promised them. So now they’ve arrived. Why wouldn’t they? You would. Who wouldn’t? Here’s what it is like in South Texas:

BILL MELUGIN: A stunning scene more reminiscent of a third-world country than the United States. Over 10,000 migrants are crammed underneath the international bridge here after crossing illegally into the United States. Many using sticks, plants, and whatever they can find to build shelter, as they wait to be processed by border patrol. From above, a Fox News drone reveals the size and scope of the crisis showing a camp that reached a population of 15,000 at its climax. Because of this, over the weekend we gained exclusive access to a boat on the Rio Grande. We watched as a constant stream of hundreds of migrants crossed the river from Mexico entering the United States illegally, hundreds at a time gathering on the shoreline before walking on the bridge.

Sound like the country you grew up in? No. We don’t have to put up with this, we could solve it in a day. The administration could send these people back immediately. Haitians aren’t bad people, a lot of them are great people. But we have no obligation to let them into our country. American citizens owe no debt to Haiti. Haiti was never an American colony. It’s been an independent country for more than 200 years, since 1804. For much of that time, we’ve sent Haiti a whole lot of aid. So however sad and dysfunctional Haiti might be, it’s not our fault. That’s for sure. Yet Joe Biden is now punishing Border Patrol officers who tried to enforce the law, who dared to deter Haitians from entering this country illegally. They had reins, not whips, reins. But it doesn’t matter to the Biden administration. The officers' real crime was trying to do their job, to stop illegal migration into this country. They have now been suspended and likely will be fired. Can you imagine punishing law enforcement for enforcing the law? This is insane. Why do American citizens have a duty to follow the law at this point? That’s an honest question. People are going to start asking this question.

The White House spent most of today calling those officers' actions ""horrific."" Horrific how, exactly? The White House never told us. That's because no one ever really cared about the ""whip"" was real or not.

Joe Biden's press secretary is an accomplished liar, so she understands that principle well. Here she is, in one of the great clips of all time, claiming that unlike you, Haitians don't need to show vaccination cards:

DOOCY: If somebody walks into the country right across the river, does somebody ask them to see their vaccination card?

PSAKI: Well, let me explain to you again, Peter, how our process works as individuals, as individuals come across the border and they are both assessed for whether they have any symptoms. If they have symptoms, they are the intention is for them to be quarantined. That is our process. They're not intending to stay here for a lengthy period of time.

Oh, so Haitians entering our country illegally from God knows where are not required to show vaccination cards because ""They're not intending to stay here for a lengthy period of time.""

PSAKI GRILLED ON WHY MIGRANTS AREN'T REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED BUT FOREIGN NATIONALS WHO FLY ARE

Really? So let’s say you go out to a restaurant in midtown Manhattan, do you intend to stay in that restaurant for a lengthy period of time, for years? No. You just want to have dinner. But in order to get inside, you still need to show a vaccination card. That’s because you were born here. You’re not Haitian. You don't get a pass.

Let’s be honest: none of these people are ever going home. That’s just true. According to the Associated Press, ""Many Haitian migrants camped in a small Texas border town are being released in the United States."" Haitians, one official told the AP, have been freed on a quote ""very, very large scale."" Well, of course. In recent days, Fox News has confirmed that many of these Haitians aren't even being given court dates. They're given advisory notices requesting that they show up at some point in the future. Any woman claiming to be pregnant is immediately being waved into the country, no proof necessary. Her child would be instantly an American citizen.

Who are these people, exactly? These new Americans. The administration has no idea. None. They don’t care. Today, Jen Psaki again admitted she's not even sure how many Haitians have been admitted into the United States, or how many have been deported. All we know is that several of the Haitians trying to gain access to this country appear to be violent. This was the scene at the airport in Port-au-Prince yesterday:

REPORTER: The scene at Port au Prince airport in Haiti is volatile. Angry Haitians dropped off here by the Biden administration threw rocks and shoes at the plane that carried them home. Three US ICE officers were reported injured during incidents on the tarmac.

Throwing rocks at ICE officers. The Biden administration has made it clear it's not going to do anything about this. The governor of Texas isn’t doing much about it either. That would be Greg Abbott, a Republican. In a matter of moments, Greg Abbott could deploy the Texas National Guard to shut off the southern border completely, protect his state and the rest of the country completely. He has refused to do that. Instead, Greg Abbott has deployed just over 1,000 of the 19,000 troops he controls. Why is that? Why not save the country if you have the power to do that? Why not save your own state? We don’t know, Greg Abbott refuses to come on the show and tell us.

"US immigration law has atrophied and it’s time to bring it into the modern, global world","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The word I like to use for our immigration laws is ""atrophied."" 1990 was the last time Congress proactively explored ways to improve upon our immigration systems and quotas through the lens of economic development and consideration of the potential for the advancement of the lives of immigrants living in America. 1990 was more than 30 years ago.

The time has come to bring our immigration laws into the modern realities of a global economy and an interconnected world.

HOW THE MIGRANT CRISIS ESCALATED IN 2021

The immigration provisions in Biden’s Build Back Better bill are a step in the right direction. Although for now the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that immigration cannot be part of reconciliation I support the measures that are part of the bill as written.

These provisions benefit not only the legal and undocumented immigrants in the United States, but also their spouses, their children, their employers, and their community.

We can Build Back Better, but it’ll take the harnessing of all the talent, vision and ambition between our borders. This bill will make that possible.

First, let’s talk math. For the past hundred years, we’ve approached immigration law as a numbers game. Beginning in 1965, we transitioned to a values-based math formula, prioritizing close family relations and the types of workers that we thought should immigrate fastest.

This system was visionary at its inception and played a huge and transformative role in ensuring that the United States continued its rise as an economic powerhouse and beacon to the world of what a truly multiethnic democracy could look like. But over time, these numbers became insufficient to keep up with the modern world.

BORDER CRISIS OVERWHELMING OFFICIALS, COMMUNITIES AS MIGRANT NUMBERS KEEP SURGING

Over time, the math became a nonsensical zero-sum algorithm of prejudice that created inhumane and illogical delays for legal immigration based on country of origin and the random vicissitudes of government bureaucratic competence.

Our current so-called immigration ‘system’ is punitive and serves no policy goal.

The result is that it can take a decade longer for an Indian-born physician to receive a green card than a colleague born in Nepal. And the consequence is that a child born in India and raised almost entirely in the United States may ""age out"" of their family and be forced to scavenge for visa options or fall out of legal status, desperate to stay in the only country they’ve ever known rather than return to a country with which they have almost no cultural or linguistic connection.

Our current so-called ""system"" is punitive and serves no policy goal.

It exists in its current form because Congress hasn’t been able to agree on updates and for no other reason.

No member of Congress from either party would call our current system a good one.

The Build Back Better bill will fix our math by allowing the immigration agencies to issue wasted green card numbers – hundreds of thousands of numbers lost due to administrative delays and for no other rational, policy-based, purposeful reason.

This is a problem that became really apparent during the pandemic.

Again, I think we could get universal bipartisan agreement in Congress that when they write the laws, the agencies should execute those laws as written and not unilaterally create new quotas and math that supersedes Congress’s power to craft immigration laws.

Build Back Better gives Congress that authority back to ensure that these individuals – who have already demonstrated Green Card eligibility – can be granted permanent residence and liberated from the never-ending delays caused by quotas and bureaucratic inefficiencies.

Through the new provisions, which create numerical exemptions and erase pointless per country limits, our immigration structures will have a momentary reprieve and a release valve will give our system breathing room to function while Congress considers truly reforming the status quo.

Importantly, these immigration provisions aren’t truly ""immigration provisions."" They’re provisions that impact us all.

They will free legal immigrants whose entrepreneurial dreams have been hindered by the Green Card process. They will free employers to allow these employees the flexibility in their roles to evolve and use their growing skills and experience to maximum impact. And they will free families, trapped in the immigration maze due to the fact that there is no ""line"" to get into.

These provisions are about modernizing the vision of 1965, when Congress believed, and we all saw, how immigration can be a powerful engine to boost the economy and the nation.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/us-immigration-law-modern-global-world-sandra-feist,N/A
"AOC says young people not having children because of 'burdens of capitalism,' more immigration is the answer","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that more immigration is a solution to declining birth rates in the United States as people suffer ""under the burdens of capitalism.""

The firebrand Democratic representative from New York took to Instagram to express her dismay that young people aren’t having kids and offered a solution.

""There are quite a few countries that are really struggling because young people, under the burdens of capitalism and living in a society that is increasingly concentrating wealth among the rich, we’re not having kids. Or we’re not having kids at the same rate,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""And we actually need immigrant populations to help balance things out.

"Arizona Senate race debate: Democrat Mark Kelly, Republican Blake Masters clash over immigration, abortion","Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican challenger Blake Masters took to the debate stage in Phoenix Thursday evening, where the two clashed over President Joe Biden’s handling of the U.S. economy, border security, and reproductive rights.

The candidates opened the debate by highlighting how high inflation has crippled consumer spending across the country. Masters specifically shared a story of how some parents are having to forgo meals so they can better afford to feed their children.

""This crushing inflation is ruining people's lives,"" Masters told debate moderator Ted Simons. ""I had parents come up to me two weeks ago to a campaign event. They said Blake, we don't eat breakfast anymore. We drink coffee. We drink coffee so that we can afford to feed our kids breakfast. And that's on you, sir. This is the Joe Biden-Mark Kelly economy.""

Kelly, a former astronaut, was narrowly elected in 2020 to serve the remainder of late Republican Sen. John McCain's term, said the COVID-19 pandemic, which he referred to as ""something unprecedented,"" was squarely to blame for the current economic crisis.

ARIZONA SENATE SHOWDOWN: DEMOCRATIC SEN. KELLY AND GOP CHALLENGER MASTERS FACE-OFF IN THEIR ONLY DEBATE

""Two and a half years ago, we went through something unprecedented. You know, COVID-19, schools had to shut down. Businesses shut down across Arizona,"" he said. ""Sometimes the federal government has to step in to save small business. You know, they have to step in to protect livelihoods.""

Masters, a venture capitalist, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, rebutted, saying Biden continues to needlessly spend money, exacerbating the inflation problem.

The Republican was also asked if Biden was legitimately elected as president in 2020, to which Masters replied: ""Absolutely...have you seen the gas prices lately?""

""Joe Biden is spending like a drunken sailor at every single opportunity. Mark Kelly just says yes. He can't say no to [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer. He can't say no to Joe Biden,"" the Republican said.

He added: ""At least Senator Sinema stopped Build Back Better. My gosh, you were ready to vote for that. That would have just ruined our economy.""

The candidates then tackled border security and immigration.

While both candidates advocated for a more secure border, Kelly pointed to Washington’s — and Biden’s — failure to help alleviate an overwhelmed Border Patrol and to mitigate record levels of immigration. The Democrat was fighting for Arizonans though, he argued.

""I've been strong on border security and I've stood up to Democrats when they're wrong on this issue including the president,"" Kelly said. ""When the president decided he was going to do something dumb on this and change the rules, you know, that would create a bigger crisis.""

KELLY UP IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE, HOBBS & LAKE BATTLE FOR GOVERNORSHIP

The Democrat added: ""You know, I told him he was wrong. So I pushed back on this administration multiple times. And I've got more money on the ground to increase Border Patrol staffing technology and where it makes sense to build more barriers.""

Staying on message, Kelly again pointed to Washington and party leaders, including the president, for failing to secure the border.

""Washington, D.C. has failed on the border,"" Kelly continued. ""Washington, D.C. has failed on this issue of border security and immigration for decades. And it's been crisis after crisis. I've been focused on this since day one, you know, and I brought more resources here to the state of Arizona to deal with it.""

prev Image 2 of 2

Masters countered by saying Kelly was simply not doing enough to help protect Arizona from some of the dangers involved with not properly vetting those crossing into the country.

He also pointed out that Kelly voted against an amendment that would have allowed the hiring of 18,000 more Border Patrol agents.



""If this is the result of Senator Kelly being focused on the border, my gosh, he's the most ineffective and worst senator of all time,"" Masters said. ""The border is wide open. People are walking through by the hundreds of thousands.""

""Mark Kelly voted for more IRS agents not more Border Patrol agents,"" the Republican added.

The two candidates also clashed over abortion and reproductive care, an issue that has risen in popularity among potential voters after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over the summer.

THESE 11 SENATE RACES WILL DETERMINE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE MAJORITY

Masters said he supports an abortion limit set at 15 weeks of pregnancy, matching a proposal from South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham.

""I support limits at the federal level,"" the Republican said. ""Senator Lindsey Graham has proposed a fifteen-week bill with the common exceptions and I support that. I believe in limits.""

Masters said Kelly, who has advocated for codifying a constitutional right for women to have an abortion, believes in ""no limits"" regarding abortions.

Kelly pushed back calling the high court’s decision ""devastating"" and ""wrong"" and argued Masters would completely roll back abortion procedures in the state.

""Let me be perfectly clear. Arizona women have totally lost the right to make a decision about abortion. It's devastating. It's wrong. And it's exactly what my opponent, Blake Masters, wants,"" he said.

"Biden admin mulls move to open pathways to green cards for temporary agricultural, seasonal migrant workers","FIRST ON FOX: The Biden administration is considering a rule that would open the door to allow temporary agricultural and seasonal workers to be able to apply for permanent residency in the United States, Fox News Digital has learned.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced it intends to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to ""modernize and reform"" the H-2A and H-2B visas — which are used for temporary agricultural workers and temporary seasonal workers.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has said that rule will incorporate policies to address exploitation and abuse, protect workers and increase program efficiencies.

Fox has now learned that the rule process, which is still going through the consideration process at USCIS, would allow workers on those visas to take steps to become permanent residents and obtain a green card.

BIDEN ADMIN GRANTS 64,000+ EXTRA H-2B SEASONAL VISAS, 20,000 TO HAITI AND CENTRAL AMERICA

When workers come to the U.S. on temporary (or ""nonimmigrant"") visas, they are expected to come with the intent of returning to their home countries after their visa ends. However, some visas also allow foreign nationals to pursue a green card at the same time, in what is known as a ""dual intent.""

The H-2A and H-2B visas explicitly do not allow for dual intent, stating that workers must return home after completing their period of work. But that would change as part of this rule, should it move forward.

""The [rule-making process] also proposes to provide increased flexibility for H-2 workers by extending grace periods, and allowing H-2 workers to take steps toward becoming permanent residents of the United States without being deemed to have abandoned their nonimmigrant intent or their foreign residence solely on that basis,"" says a summary of the proposal, seen by Fox Digital.

The rule change would be in line with the Biden administration’s pledge to open up more legal immigration pathways to those seeking to come to the U.S., both via the southern border and elsewhere.

The rule would also strengthen prohibitions on immigration fees being collected from H-2 workers by their employees via salary reductions, and would introduce factors by which a petition could be denied based on disciplinary actions taken against an employer by a government agency such as USCIS or the Department of Labor. The regulation is also envisioned as allowing workers to begin work immediately upon USCIS receiving their petition, rather than only when the visa itself is approved.

In response to a request for comment from Fox News Digital, a USCIS spokesperson said the agency is ""committed to promoting policies and procedures that break down barriers in the immigration system, increase access to eligible immigration benefits, enhance protections for temporary nonimmigrant workers, and better ensure the integrity of the H-2A and H-2B programs, and the agency will continue to uphold America’s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility with fairness, integrity, and respect for all we serve.""

Attempts at reforming H-2 visas are not unique to the Biden administration. The Trump administration announced an ultimately incomplete rule-making process to add more flexibility and stop the abuse of the H-2A system, while strengthening protections of American workers.

MCCARTHY RULES OUT AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AFTER BIDEN CALLS AT STATE OF THE UNION

The H-2B visa, intended for workers in seasonal occupations such as landscaping and hotel and restaurant work, has proved controversial with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concerns about the abuse of vulnerable foreign workers and fears that it incentivizes employers to use cheap labor rather than employ American workers. Congress has limited the number of H-2B visas to 66,000 a year, but allows DHS to exceed the cap — which it typically does.

However, the inclusion of a way to allow H-2 workers to eventually gain permanent residency in the U.S. is likely to be controversial among immigration hawks, who fear the programs are used to import cheap labor which competes with U.S. workers. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) says that the move would further reliance on foreign labor and hurt American workers, as it says it has done for other visas — such as the H-1B for specialty occupations, which is used primarily by the tech industry.

""The clear desire of foreign nationals to get an H-1B visa — primarily because it can lead to permanent residence — has encouraged unscrupulous outsourcing practices while reinforcing employers’ dependency on cheap foreign labor,"" FAIR President Dan Stein said in a statement to Fox. ""By morphing two additional guest worker programs into de facto permanent immigration streams, the Biden administration is doing so at the detriment of American workers, even during a time of economic uncertainty.""

Stein said the administration ""must reconsider this proposed rule and instead help American workers who are struggling to compete with cheap foreign labor.""

The administration, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit from Republican states over its measures announced last month that would allow 30,000 migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua into the U.S. each month.

"Biden admin keeps pushing for sweeping immigration bill, including amnesty, two years into migrant crisis","The Biden administration is beginning 2023 to renew its push to get a sweeping immigration bill through Congress that it introduced two years ago when it first entered office -- but that still shows no sign of picking up any Republican support due to its inclusion of an amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.

""On my first day in office… I sent Congress a comprehensive piece of legislation that would completely overhaul what has been a broken immigration system for a long time: cracking down on illegal immigration; strengthening legal immigration; and protecting DREAMers, those with temporary protected status, and farmworkers, who all are part of the fabric of our nation,"" President Biden said in a White House speech last month.

""But congressional Republicans have refused to consider my comprehensive plan,"" Biden said, while announcing a number of new border measures.

The bill Biden was referring to is the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which was unveiled on Biden’s first day in office in 2021, and officially introduced in the Senate a month later. At the core of the bill is an eight-year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the U.S. in the U.S. before Jan. 1 2021 -- as well as immediate green card eligibility for farmworkers, Temporary Protected Status recipients, and some who came to the U.S. as minors.

BIDEN ADMIN CITES DATA SHOWING NEW BORDER MEASURES ‘ARE WORKING’ AS NEW LAWSUIT LOOMS

The bill would also set up refugee processing locations in Central America, increase the number of immigration judges and open up a number of additional avenues for legal immigration -- including ""recapturing"" unused visas from prior years, clearing visa backlogs, and expanding the diversity lottery visa program. The legislation would also provide additional funding for technology at the border and expand anti-smuggling efforts in Central America.

However, to pass at that time, it would have required the support of 10 Republicans in the Senate -- which immediately seemed unlikely, if not impossible. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ., described getting such a measure through Congress as a ""Herculean task.""

WHITE HOUSE FIRES BACK AT GOP OVER CALL TO FUND TEXAS BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS

Sure enough, it met a firewall of Republican resistance in Congress, who immediately objected to passing a mass amnesty just as there were signs of rising border numbers -- numbers that would hit historic highs in the months ahead. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell accused the administration of having ""sketched out a massive proposal for blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the same time.

""This kind of failed approach will invite another humanitarian crisis on our border and privilege powerful interests ahead of American workers,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who had engaged in past discussions about immigration reform, called it a ""non-starter.""

""There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-elect Biden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully isn’t going to be one of them,"" he said.

Soon after that, talk of the bill died out, and congressional Democrats turned to alternative efforts to get pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- including an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to use budget reconciliation to avoid needing Republican support.

OVER QUARTER OF A MILLION MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN DECEMBER ALONE

Since then, the border has been engulfed in a historic surge of migration, with over 1.7 million migrant encounters in FY 2021 and over 2.3 million in FY 2022. Border numbers hit a new high in December when there were more than 251,000 migrant encounters. In the midst of that crisis, the Biden administration has continued to beat the drum for the bill, without making any modifications to the legislation.

""When we first came into office, the first bill we proposed was for a pathway to citizenship, was to fix a broken immigration system that was broken under the previous administration,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said in October.

""Participate in the solution because we are offering solutions,"" she scolded Republicans.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has made similar calls.

""On the very first day in office, President Biden sent to the Hill, to Congress, a comprehensive package that would have meant so much to our ability to really manage the situation at the border, to really bring a broken immigration system that hasn't been reformed for decades, to really bring it into the present day, not just from a point of view of enforcement, but also realizing the opportunities that immigration brings to our country,"" Mayorkas said of the bill in an interview with The Washington Post.

ICE DEPORTATIONS REMAINED WELL BELOW TRUMP-ERA LEVELS IN FY 2022, AMID HISTORIC BORDER CRISIS

Mayorkas went on to make an economic argument for the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.

""We have 10 million job openings in the United States,"" he said. ""I was reading about what Canada is doing to address a million open jobs. They're bringing in about 1.3 million migrants to fill that labor need that cannot be met within their own borders. President Biden sent forward a comprehensive package on day one. It has not occurred yet.""

Mayorkas expresses optimism about the chances for the bill, ""I'm an undying optimist, and we're going to stay true to the fight to pass reform that our country needs and from which our country will prosper.""

However, there has been little justification for such optimism. While some bipartisan talks have been underway that would see $25 billion in border security funding combined with a path to citizenship for two million illegal immigrants who came as minors, such efforts now face an additional roadblock in the form of the House of Representatives.

Republicans took control of the House in January, and House Republican leadership has made it clear that ""amnesty"" is off the table.

""No amnesty,"" he told Fox News in October.

Rep. Mark Green, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, made similar promises last week in a statement to Roll Call.

"" It’s pretty simple: mass amnesty will not pass a House committee or the House floor,"" he said.

However, amid that opposition, Biden has continued to try and increase the pressure on Republicans on the bill.

""There’s more that has to be done, and I laid that out in the first week I was here,"" he said last month. ""That work will not be done unless and until the Congress enacts and funds a more comprehensive immigration plan that I proposed on day one.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-pushing-sweeping-immigration-bill-amnesty-two-years-crisis,N/A
Biden immigration bill changes 'alien' to 'noncitizen' as part of overhaul,"President Biden’s immigration bill would change ""alien"" to ""noncitizen"" in U.S. law -- the latest move in the fight over language related to immigration and immigrants.

Biden’s administration is unveiling the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would include a number of radical measures such as an eight-year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and immediate green cards for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IMPOSES 100-DAY 'PAUSE' ON DEPORTATIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

While the text of the bill has not yet been released, a fact sheet put out by the Biden transition team before the inauguration said that the bill would remove the word ""alien"" from immigration laws and replace it with ""noncitizen.""

The fact sheet said the move ""recognizes America as a nation of immigrants.""

Immigration activists and lawmakers have long battled over language related to immigration. Many now refer not to illegal immigrants but ""undocumented"" immigrants.

BIDEN IMMIGRATION BILL WOULD PUT MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ON 8-YEAR FAST-TRACK TO CITIZENSHIP

""Alien"" has long been used in U.S. code and immigration law as a whole, but has seen pushback from liberal activists and cities. New York City announced last year it would no longer refer to ""aliens"" or ""illegal immigrants.""

Meanwhile, during the Trump administration, there were battles over language from conservatives, too.

BuzzFeed News reported in 2019 that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) planned to change all references of the term ""foreign national"" to ""alien"" in the agency’s policy manual.

A USCIS spokesperson told the outlet that it was aligning with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

""Under the INA, the term 'alien' means 'any person not a citizen or national of the United States,'"" they said.

Biden immigration bill would put millions of illegal immigrants on 8-year fast-track to citizenship,"A radical immigration overhaul to be proposed this week by President-elect Joe Biden would include a path to citizenship that could see millions of illegal immigrants become U.S. citizens in just eight years.

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris told Univision last week that the immigration bill would be ""first order of business"" and will be about ""creating a pathway for people to earn citizenship."" She said that pathway would be eight years long.

BIDEN CONFRONTED WITH MIGRANT CARAVAN CHALLENGE AS HE TAKES OFFICE, GOP BLAMES CAMPAIGN RHETORIC

The Washington Post reported Monday that the bill, to be unveiled on Inauguration Day Wednesday, would put illegal immigrants into protected status and a five-year pathway to a green card. If they meet certain conditions, such as payment of taxes and a background check, they could then be put on a three-year pathway to citizenship. Some estimates put the population of illegal immigrants at around 12 million as of 2015, other estimates are higher.

The Associated Press, which also reported that the eight-year path is in the bill, noted that it would be one of the fastest pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants in recent years.

A pathway to citizenship -- not just legal status -- for illegal immigrants has been a top agenda item for liberals and immigration activists for decades and now -- with Democratic control of the White House, House and Senate -- that goal could be in sight.

It would also grant immediate green cards to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants protected from deportation under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programs. President Trump had moved to abolish DACA, the 2012 Obama-era executive order that protected those who came to the U.S. as children. But he was rebuffed by the Supreme Court, and Harris said that ""we are going to expand protections for Dreamers and DACA recipients.""

""These are some of the things that we're going to do on our immigration bill. And we believe it is smarter and a more humane way of approaching immigration for immigrants,"" she said.

The Post reported that the bill would also include border security provisions at the border, and said it would see increased technology at the border -- but it is unclear what this involves. Biden has promised that ""not another foot"" of President Trump’s border wall will be built under his administration.

MIGRANT CARAVAN MEMBER CITES BIDEN'S PLEDGE TO SUSPEND DEPORTATIONS FOR 100 DAYS AS REASON FOR TRAVELING TO US

The bill would also include provisions to stem the flow of migration by addressing root causes of migration from south of the border. Biden had, during the campaign, promised a $4 billion four-year plan of assistance to be linked with reforms from those countries.

On legal immigration, the Post reported that the bill would open a number of further avenues of legal immigration -- including ""recapturing"" unused visas from prior years, giving work permits to the spouses and children of temporary visa holders.

While the bill has a good chance of being passed in the Democrat-controlled House, it is unclear of its chances in the Senate. It would need 60 votes to pass the chamber, meaning 10 Republicans would have to vote in favor. A number of past efforts at immigration reform have failed, including a 2013 effort under President Barack Obama.

While Republicans have indicated they are open to working with Biden on his key legislative priorities, GOP lawmakers have traditionally demanded that any amnesty of illegal immigrants be accompanied by muscular enforcement at the border. Republicans are likely to face pressure from its conservative base opposed to legalizing millions of illegal immigrants.

The legislation is one of a number of radical actions on immigration that Biden has promised to take. He has promised to implement a moratorium on deportations and to end a number of Trump-era programs to stop illegal immigration, including the Migrant Protection Protocols. He has also pledged to dramatically increase the number of refugees the U.S. takes in every year.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration will face an early challenge in the form of a caravan of thousands of migrants moving toward the border from Honduras. That caravan has called on the administration to honor its ""commitments"" to them.

But, in a possible nod to fears of a migrant surge at the border with a new bill, the Post reported that the pathway to citizenship would only apply to those who arrived in the country before Jan. 1.

The meeting, which is expected to take place virtually Monday, is set to focus on how the United States and Mexico can cooperate on economic and national security issues, as well as combatting the coronavirus pandemic.

López Obrador is reportedly expected to propose a new Bracero-style immigrant labor program to Biden, which could bring 600,000 to 800,000 Mexican and Central American immigrants a year to work legally in the United States.

PSAKI DEFENDS REOPENING OF MIGRANT FACILITY FOR CHILDREN UNDER BIDEN: 'THIS IS NOT KIDS BEING KEPT IN CAGES'

A senior Biden administration official declined to say whether Biden would support or oppose that proposal, but told the Associated Press that both the U.S. and Mexico agree on the need to expand legal pathways for migration.

The original Bracero program allowed Mexicans to work temporarily in the United States to fill labor shortages during World War II and for a couple of decades after the war. López Obrador said the U.S. economy needs Mexican workers because of ""their strength, their youth.""

The Biden administration official told the Associated Press that the meeting would enable Biden to begin to institutionalize the relationship with Mexico, in a swipe at former President Trump, whose administration’s relationship with Mexico involved the threat of tariffs, a crackdown on migration and his efforts to construct a border wall along the U.S. southern border.

The border wall was a paramount 2016 campaign promise for Trump, in which he vowed Mexico would pay for the construction of the wall.

Mexico did not pay for the wall. López Obrador's government did, however, send troops to Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala to deal with an unprecedented wave of asylum-seekers bound for the U.S.

Mexico hosted about 70,000 people seeking U.S. asylum while they waited for dates in immigration courts, a policy known as Remain in Mexico and officially as Migrant Protection Protocols.

Meanwhile, upon taking office, Biden immediately began to unwind Remain in Mexico, suspending it for new arrivals on Jan. 20, and announcing soon after that an estimated 26,000 people with active cases could be released in the United States.

Biden, though, has kept pandemic-related restrictions in place to expel anyone arriving at the U.S. border from Mexico without an opportunity to seek asylum. Typically, Mexicans and many Central Americans are returned to Mexico in less than two hours under Title 42 authority. Biden aides have signaled they have no immediate plans to lift it.

BIDEN CANCELS TRUMP-ERA BANS ON SOME IMMIGRANT VISAS

With regard to other immigration efforts, Biden, on his first day in office, announced an ""immediate termination"" of funding for the border wall and restored the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA allows people who came to the United States as children to request deferred immigration enforcement and work authorization for a renewal period of two years. The Trump administration had sought to end the program since September 2017, mounting a number of federal legal battles.

Biden is also backing legislation that would give legal status and a pathway to citizenship to an estimated 11 million people currently in the United States.

And last week, Biden lifted a Trump administration ban on green cards during the coronavirus pandemic that was blocking most legal immigration to the United States.

Biden, in his proclamation Wednesday, said shutting the door on legal immigrants ""does not advance the interests of the United States.""

""To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,"" he said. ""It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.""

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REOPENING TEXAS HOLDING FACILITY FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN

Biden added: ""And it harms individuals who were selected to receive the opportunity to apply for, and those who have likewise received, immigrant visas through the Fiscal Year 2020 Diversity Visa Lottery.""

Meanwhile, López Obrador, over the weekend, said the U.S. will also need temporary immigrant workers from Mexico to sustain economic growth.

""It is better that we start putting order on migratory flows,"" he said he plans to tell Biden, according to the Associated Press.

But the U.S. southern border has become a challenge for the Biden administration in recent weeks, as an increasing number of children are crossing into the country without visas.

According to the AP, Border Patrol agents are apprehending an average of more than 200 children crossing the border without a parent per day, but nearly all 7,100 beds for immigrant children maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services are full.

The Biden administration has also preserved a policy, imposed at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, of quickly expelling people captured along the border and has tried to dissuade people from attempting the journey.

""This is not the time to come to the United States,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a February briefing. ""We need the time to put in place an immigration process so people can be treated humanely.""

"Biden's immigration agenda is needed reform for some, 'perfect storm' for others","As early as next week, border officials will begin allowing thousands of asylum seekers to cross the border into the U.S. -- a stark reversal of the Trump administraion policy that led more than 68,000 migrants to stay behind.

The undoing of the ""remain in Mexico"" policy, along with reorienting Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize national security threats rather than convicting illegal immigrants with low-level drug offenses, simple assaults and DUIs, signals a major shift in the U.S. immigration process.

""He [Biden] created a perfect storm for a surge at the border,"" said Tom Homan, retired ICE director and Fox News contributor, detailing the constraints placed on Customs and Border Patrol and ICE officials on processing and vetting immigrants at ports of entry.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW 25,0000 ASYLUM SEEKERS TO CROSS US-MEXICO BORDER WHILE CASES ARE PENDING

Making good on his campaign promise to reform immigration policies, President Biden plans to allow up to 25,000 asylum seekers to cross the border as early as Feb. 19, and around 300 people per day, as the administration increases the flow of immigrants into the U.S.

But the coupling of increased immigration and new ICE protocols is raising alarm among former Trump officials, who say the new approach weakens border enforcement.

""This policy pretty much dismantled their enforcement operations,"" Homan said. ""This is a terrible policy for public safety. It's anti-enforcement policy, the worst policy I've seen in my 35 years of enforcing immigration law.""

The controversial memo from Acting ICE Director Tae Johnson -- which was released by the Washington Post on Feb. 7, draws up new procedures: ""Generally, these convictions would not include drug based crimes (less serious offenses), simple assault, DUI, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax crimes, solicitation, or charges without convictions.""

REPUBLICANS SLAM BIDEN MOVE TO ADMIT 25,000 MIGRANTS FROM MEXICO AMID BORDER SURGE FEARS

While the policy has yet to be officially announced by the Department of Homeland Security, many immigration advocates are responding by saying that Biden’s policies offer a safer process for immigrants to enter the country.

""I think what the Biden administration is doing here is they are prioritizing valuable law enforcement resources on significant public safety threats,"" National Immigration Forum Executive Director Ali Noorani told Fox News.

""The Trump administration's approach at the border and even to drug trafficking did practically nothing to improve the safety of American families,"" Noorani said. ""So it's clearly time for a different approach here. Let's develop a functioning immigration system.""

But some say the Biden administration isn't doing enough to keep bad actors out.

For Sabine Durden-Coulter, whose son Dominic, 30, was killed in 2012 by a drunken driver who was in the country illegally, vetting immigrants should be a top priority. The immigrant who took her son's life in California had several felony convictions, including a prior DUI.

""It's absolutely the worst message any president could send to the world to say we're wide open,"" Durden-Coulter told Fox News.

""It's ripping that wound wide open every time I hear of another victim,"" she said. ""It's devastating to know to see the train wreck and know how many more will be affected.""

Below is Durden-Coulter’s letter to President Biden:

[scribd id=494415461 key=key-MyGUqe3e2GUcPBZ7XVc6 mode=scroll]

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki clarified on Thursday that the intention of new immigration policies is not to increase illegal border crossings.

""We don’t want people to put themselves in danger at a time where it is not the right time to come, because we have not had time to put in place a humane and moral system and process,"" Psaki said.

But in the first month of 2021, Customs and Border Patrol averaged around 3,000 border arrests per day, with encounters at the border at the highest rate since July 2019.

Majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of border crisis and immigration: poll,"Only 44% of Americans approve of the job President Biden is doing on border security, with 55% saying they disapprove, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Monday. And on the related issue of immigration, Biden stands at 42% approval and 56% disapproval.

Only a quarter approve of how the president is handling the crisis involving unaccompanied children apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border.

CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION PROJECTING SURGE IN CROSSING THIS YEAR OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS

Nevertheless, Biden's overall approval rating stands at 61% in the new national poll, with 38% disapproving of his performance as president.

The influx of migrants crossing the nation's southern border with Mexico has jumped since Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20. Republicans have repeatedly slammed the president on the issue, blaming him for what the White House refuses to call a ""crisis.""

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is on pace to have encountered more than 171,000 migrants in March alone, two sources familiar with internal CBP data told Fox News — a dramatic increase over last year’s numbers and the latest sign that the crisis at the southern border is not subsiding. The number, based on preliminary data and not yet finalized, would mark a sharp increase in numbers from the already high 100,441 migrants encountered in February — and the roughly 34,000 migrants encountered in March of last year.

FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTOS OF TWO GIRLS RESCUED AFTER BEING DROPPED OVER THE BORDER WALL

According to the survey, nearly nine in 10 Republicans disapprove of how the president is handling border security and immigration, with more than six in 10 independents giving Biden a thumbs-down on the two issues. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats say they approve of how the president’s dealing with both issues.

Four in 10 surveyed in the poll say they disapprove of how Biden is handling the surge of unaccompanied children apprehended at the nation’s southern border, with a 24% approving and 35% saying they neither approve or disapprove. CBP is projecting that as many as 184,000 unaccompanied children could reach the border in the fiscal year 2021, according to sources.

The poll highlights that most Americans think reuniting parents and children who were separated at the border and providing safe treatment to these unaccompanied children should be high priorities for the federal government. Just over half (53%) say increased security at the U.S.-Mexico border should be a key concern for Biden’s immigration agenda. Other immigration issues – including deportation, guest worker visas, and providing a path to citizenship – rank lower in importance.

CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION TO ENCOUNTER MORE THAN 171,000 MIGRANTS IN MARCH

""Most Democrats say reuniting children and parents, providing safe treatment of unaccompanied minors at the border, and finding a way to grant legal status for immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children should be a high priority for the federal government,"" the pollsters write. ""Most Republicans think increasing border security, preventing people from overstaying their visas, and deporting undocumented immigrants should receive high priority by Washington.""

While Biden’s numbers on border security and immigration are well underwater, he stands at 73% approval and 26% disapproval on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, 62%-36% on health care, 60%-43% on the economy, and 55%-43% on foreign policy. The president’s at 48%-50% on dealing with the federal budget and 45%-52% on gun policy.

"Bipartisan immigration framework includes 14% Border Patrol pay hike, visa recapture","FIRST ON FOX: The bipartisan immigration framework being floated by Sens Thom Tillis, R-N.C. and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., would see Border Patrol agents given a 14% pay hike along with a number of other measures including a recapture of unused employment visas, according to a summary document obtained by Fox News Digital.

The framework, which is understood to be still taking shape, is a last-ditch effort to get an immigration deal through Congress before Republicans take the House in early January and before the Title 42 public health order -- which has been used to expel a majority of migrants since 2020 -- expires in less than two weeks.

The core of the deal is border security funding of at least $25 billion and upwards of $40 billion combined with a pathway to citizenship for two million illegal immigrants either protected by, or eligible for protection by, the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Fox News was one of a number of outlets that reported this week that the proposal would also keep Title 42 in place for a year, with metric components in place for an extension.

TILLIS, EYEING IMMIGRATION DEAL, WARNS BORDER PATROL WILL ‘LOSE CONTROL OF THE BORDER’ IF TITLE 42 ENDS

Other border security elements would include hiring more Border Patrol agents as well as pay increases, and the creation of regional processing centers to surge resources at the border and judge asylum claims. It would also include resources for detention, deportation and greater use of expedited removal.

A summary document, obtained by Fox, goes into greater detail about what the plan would include -- specifically that it would set a minimum staffing level at 20,500 Border Patrol agents and would raise pay for agents -- who have been at the frontlines of the border crisis since it started in early 2021-- by 14 percent.

It would also hire an additional 600 officers annually for Customs and Border Protection (CBP)’s Office of Field Operations (OFO) who staff the ports of entry, who would be relied on more under the proposal. The bill also would ""make investments"" in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers and immigration judges and courts -- which have been facing significant backlogs.

On the pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and DACA-eligible illegal immigrants, it would cap eligibility for those who have been in the U.S. since 2018, were under 18 when they arrived and were no older than 38 in 2012.

But the framework also includes a provision on legal immigration to ""recapture"" green cards from past fiscal years. This would take the difference between the number of green cards authorized by Congress and the number actually given out for each year and make that number of green cards automatically available.

It is a provision that has called for by not only immigrant activist groups but also by Big Tech-backed groups like FWD.us, as the employment visas would overwhelmingly affect tech workers from India and China who have come in via temporary visas but are facing a backlog of green card applications. The measure has received bipartisan support but has failed to get through Congress.

The summary calculates the number of visas to be made available to be approximately 200,000.

It is unclear what support the bill may have, particularly given the tight timeframe before the new Congress. House Republican leadership have ruled out any form of ""amnesty,"" and the bill has already seen opposition from Republicans in the Senate. It is also unclear how many Democrats will agree to the border security measures, in exchange for a relatively limited citizenship pathway -- Democrats have pushed to give citizenship to over 11 million illegal immigrants.

While Republicans have balked at amnesty proposals, Tillis has pointed to the looming end of Title 42, and a feared spike in migration, and said that the DACA-for-border-security deal is worth making -- while rejecting its labeling as an amnesty.

SENATORS TILLIS, SINEMA REVIVE TALKS ON POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION DEAL DURING LAME-DUCK SESSION

""These are people that came to this country as minors who are now doctors, scientists, teachers, hundreds serving in the military. And I think the American people understand this is very different than this concept of amnesty,"" he said Thursday on ""America's Newsroom."" ""This is going to give them a path and it's not automatic. They're going to have to work and maintain those highest standards. And for that, we get a closed border and we shut down the cartels. That seems to me like something worth working on.""

He also warned about a new spike if Title 42 ends.

""In the last year of the Trump administration, we had about a half million illegal crossings. That is manageable for Border Patrol. Now we have over 2 million. And if Title 42 goes away, that could be 3 million or more.""

""And the Border Patrol has told me to my face that they will lose control of the border,"" he said. ""They're already spread thin. This is a crisis that the administration refuses to accept, and it's one that we need to solve.""

Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), told Fox News Digital that he has been in contact with both offices and is waiting to see the actual text before saying whether he supports any potential deal. He also said he was pushing to include enforcement measures needed to end the crisis as well as the practice of ""catch-and-release.""

""We are looking at actual solutions to end this crisis,"" he said.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocate groups have praised the bill’s inclusion of a DACA pathway, although others have been cautious about moves they say would ""weaken"" asylum.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who was the author of the original legislation to provide protection for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors, released a statement saying he applauds ""every good faith effort to give these deserving individuals a path to citizenship.

""I’ve been in touch with my colleagues and will carefully review their proposal,"" he said. ""I am determined to do everything in my power to help deliver a Christmas Miracle for Dreamers.""

Immigration hawks were less impressed. Former acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan and former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Tom Homan, released a statement describing the proposal as ""nothing more than amnesty, cloaked with the fig leaf of ‘more funding’ for Border Patrol.""

""In reality, this proposal would do nothing except encourage more families around the world to put their children, of all ages, in the hands of the cartels, enriching these blood-thirsty and savage organizations, driving even-higher numbers of unaccompanied minors to the border, and further overwhelming an already besieged Border Patrol,"" they said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bipartisan-immigration-framework-includes-border-patrol-pay-hike-visa-recapture,N/A
Border hawks dismiss Kamala Harris' immigration announcement: 'Political stunt',"Immigration experts on Monday dismissed Vice President Kamala Harris' plan to address the ""root causes"" of illegal migration by steering billions of dollars in private investment to Central America, and said that plan is just a diversion from the ongoing crisis at the border.

""This is nothing more than a political stunt,"" Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Fox News Digital. ""We cannot control what happens in other countries. We can only control what happens here, and we’re not doing that.""

Harris announced that $4.2 billion in funds from private companies would be directed to Central America to promote job creation, clean energy, gender equity and other goals. The announcement is part of Harris’ effort to boost economic growth in the region in order to reduce the incentives to leave there for America.

But Judd and other immigration experts said the program is ineffective, in part because it's a long term plan that ignores the short term realities at the border.

4 MILLION BORDER ENCOUNTERS SINCE KAMALA HARRIS ASSIGNED TO ADDRESS 'ROOT CAUSE' OF PROBLEM

Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said efforts to stabilize the Central American region have been pursued by previous administrations — including the Obama administration, when Biden was vice president — with little results.

""Even if this worked, it's a long run approach and can’t be applied to the entire planet,"" Krikorian told Fox News Digital. ""This has to be paired with muscular immigration control so the people leaving the land move to their own cities and not to our cities.""

Stephen Miller, the former senior advisor to President Trump and current president of America First Legal, said Harris must rely on her own authority to secure the border as opposed to spending from private companies to strengthen corruption-infused nations.

""Sending more money to Central America — while leaving our border wide open — means more cash is available for illegal immigrants to pay their smugglers,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. ""As long as the Administration continues to allow illegal immigrants to enter by the millions — from over one hundred countries — giving American cash to three nations in Central America is just a further accelerant to record illegal immigration.""

KAMALA HARRIS TO AVOID THE US-MEXICO BORDER DURING VISIT TO ARIZONA

Judd also noted that the Biden administration ultimately wants to eliminate the Title 42 enforcement policy that allows them to turn away migrants at the border because of the possibility of spreading the COVID pandemic. The focus on private investment in Central America, he said, is an attempt to claim more time is needed to counter increased migration.

""You can invest as much as you want through private companies but if the government is corrupt it won’t matter,"" Judd told Fox News Digital. ""It’s not going to alleviate illegal immigration anytime soon.""

The White House and Department of Homeland Security cited data last month that showed southern border encounters declined after their expanded border enforcement efforts and increased asylum opportunities for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

""These expanded border enforcement measures are working,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. ""It is incomprehensible that some states who stand to benefit from these highly effective enforcement measures are seeking to block them and cause more irregular migration at our southern border.""

However, southern border encounters hit an all-time high of 2.38 million in fiscal year 2022. Biden visited the southern border for the first time in January as these migrant encounters near 5 million under his administration. The president is likely to tout these renewed efforts to address the issue in the new year as he delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday.

Harris was assigned the role of countering mass migration to the southern border in March 2021. She traveled to the border once that year and has yet to return. The vice president hosted 17 events on border issues from March 2021 to August 2021, according to a Los Angeles Times database of her scheduled events, but remained largely silent on the issue since. She claimed in recent months that ""the border is secure.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-hawks-dismiss-kamala-harris-immigration-announcement-political-stunt,N/A
"Cantor primary loss shocks Capitol Hill, could put immigration debate on hold","House GOP Leader Eric Cantor's primary loss has sent shockwaves through Capitol Hill, with sources warning that the historic upset could have a ""destabilizing"" effect on party leadership and sideline key legislation.

""Everybody is just in shock right now,"" Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., said.

Cantor, a seven-term Virginia congressman, was defeated in Tuesday's primary by Dave Brat, a little-known economics professor with Tea Party backing. He won in part by hammering Cantor over immigration, accusing him of supporting ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.

That strategy immediately raises questions about the fate of immigration legislation in Congress. GOP leaders had been giving conflicting signals over whether they would try to advance some version of what the Senate passed, perhaps after the primaries.

But Cantor's loss could send immigration talks into a deep freeze. Opponents of the proposed legislation pointed to Brat's victory as a lesson to other members.

""The wage-earning voters of Rep. Cantor's district apparently felt abandoned by his immigration positions that virtually ignored their anxiety about stagnant wages and high unemployment and that projected primary concern for unlawful foreign visitors and employers seeking more foreign workers,"" NumbersUSA President Roy Beck said in a statement.

Democrats hoping for an immigration deal this year were evidently nervous about Cantor's loss. White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer offered this assurance on Twitter: ""Cantor's problem wasn't his position on immigration reform, it was his lack of a position."" He noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., ""wrote and passed a bill and is winning big.""

Asked Wednesday if she thought Cantor's loss means immigration legislation is dead, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed she never thought of Cantor as an advocate for that legislation.

Regardless of the impact on the immigration debate, Cantor's loss potentially opens up a leadership crisis.

The primary loss for a sitting majority leader is unprecedented. It's unclear whether Cantor will even serve the remainder of his term.

One senior aide to House Speaker John Boehner said they were ""absolutely stunned."" Asked if Cantor should step aside, the aide said they'll get an idea from members on Wednesday.

The aide added: ""The last thing we need is a leadership scramble up here as we head into the midterms.""

Though Cantor's loss caught party leaders and rank-and-file by surprise, it swiftly sets up jockeying for key posts.

GOP sources said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, is interested in the position of Republican whip, a post currently held by Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who could now be next in line for Cantor's job -- unless conservatives in the caucus try to move against McCarthy.

There are also questions over what this means for Boehner and his hold on the speaker's gavel. The conventional wisdom is that this makes Boehner stronger because there's no one to challenge him as Cantor was believed to be the heir apparent. One former senior House Republican close to Boehner described this as ""devastating to the party,"" while adding that it may not be to Boehner ""as there is no one else now.""

""We need Boehner now more than ever,"" said the former member. ""Can Boehner step up?""

Democrats were quick to gloat about Cantor's defeat, while playing up the supposed influence of the Tea Party.

Brat, speaking with Fox News, said he enjoyed Tea Party support but was a candidate focused on Republican principles including free markets and ""adherence to the Constitution.""

In the short-term, though, the upset could derail legislative work on Capitol Hill.

One source said Cantor and others were ""playing with fire"" and that Tuesday's race ""will force the Republicans to move further to the right.""

""You have what could be chaos for leadership. They could get caught up in the politics of this and that gets them away from any legislative agenda,"" the source said.

Cornyn's office denies bipartisan immigration bill in the works amid conservative uproar,"Sen. John Cornyn’s, R-Texas, office on Wednesday denied that a bipartisan immigration bill is in the works after comments he made on the Senate floor that his staff say were a joke, but that sparked uproar from conservatives.

Cornyn, who frequently attempts to find bipartisan paths for legislation on a range of issues that includes immigration, was on the Senate floor Tuesday evening as the chamber advanced bipartisan gun legislation that he had helped shepherd.

SENATE VOTES TO ADVANCE BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION

HuffPost reporter Igor Bobic tweeted that Cornyn was smiling as he told California Sen. Alex Padilla: ""First guns, now it’s immigration."" Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was said to have added ""That’s right, we’re going to do it.""

Cornyn’s reported comments drew swift backlash from the right, many of whom were already angered by his support for the gun legislation which advanced 64-34 in the split chamber.

Cornyn has previously backed bipartisan immigration efforts, including a border security bill, which he introduced with Sen. Sinema to combat the migrant crisis at the southern border. He has also backed a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and who were eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance said on Fox News’ ""Ingraham Angle"" that it would be ""catastrophic"" for the Republican Party to ""advance amnesty.""

""The worst thing that we can do as a party right now in the midst of a historic immigration crisis is to advance amnesty. And if we do it, we will get crushed and we will deserve it.""

SEN. CORNYN DEFENDS BIPARTISAN GUN DEAL AFTER CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM OF PROPOSED 'RED FLAG LAWS'

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, meanwhile, appeared to distance himself from any such efforts: ""Amnesty is a non starter with me and won’t be taken up by a House Republican majority,"" he told Axios.

Groups calling for lower immigration groups also came out in opposition of any such moves:

""What a weird way for @JohnCornyn to announce that he never wants to become @SenateGOP Majority Leader,"" the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) tweeted, in reference to reports that Cornyn could succeed Leader Mitch McConnell.

But a spokesperson for Cornyn denied that an immigration bill was on the table.

""No, the tweet is not accurate,"" spokesperson Drew Brandewie told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. ""It was a joke. There’s no immigration bill.""

It is the latest sign that bipartisan efforts on broad immigration reform measures that included pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants, once supported by a number of Republican lawmakers in both chambers, are struggling to gain any traction amid a historic border crisis that saw more than 239,000 migrant encounters in May alone.

Cruz challenged on immigration flip-flop,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was challenged Wednesday by Fox News on his immigration stance and his role in a failed Senate bid at immigration reform.

Fox News’ Bret Baier pressed Cruz on the claims the GOP presidential hopeful made in 2013 -- when he supported a measure granting a pathway to legalization for illegal immigrants -- to his current position, which is the opposite.



During Tuesday night’s Republican debate, Cruz denied that he has ever supported legal status for undocumented workers.

“I’ve never supported legalization. I do not intend to support it,” Cruz said at the fifth GOP debate, in response to claims by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Baier then rolled a May 2013 clip of Cruz saying he wanted immigration reform to pass.

“I do not want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass,” he said. “And so I would urge people of good faith from both sides of the aisle that if the objective is to pass common sense immigration reform that secures the borders, that improves legal immigration and that allows those who are here illegally to come in out of the shadows, then we should look for areas of bipartisan agreement and compromise to come together.”

Cruz tried to clarify his comments during an appearance on “Special Report with Bret Baier” and said his support of the amendment would not have provided legal status but instead said that he was “leading the fight against amnesty.”



Baier pushed back, citing other news outlets where Cruz said the amendment he backed would increase the chances of the bill becoming law.

Cruz’s campaign has said in the past that the amendment was intended to be a poison pill to the overall bill and was created to illustrate that those pushing for immigration reform only cared about granting illegal immigrants citizenship.

Baier again pushed back and pointed to other interviews where Cruz said he didn’t want to kill the overall bill and specifically that the Cruz amendment wasn’t intended to be a poison pill.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cruz-challenged-on-immigration-flip-flop,N/A
"Cuccinelli puts hardline stamp on immigration agenda, just 2 months into USCIS job","LAREDO, Texas – Within weeks of becoming the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Ken Cuccinelli has started enacting sweeping changes across the country’s immigration system, angering critics and showing how the administration increasingly is tightening legal immigration.

USCIS is an overlooked agency for most Americans as it largely deals with bureaucratic issues to do with green card applications and citizenship requests for aspiring Americans. Most media attention tends to divert to other Homeland Security agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO

But any immigrant who has waited in lines at USCIS facilities and nervously opened mail with its seal on the envelope can attest to the agency’s importance in overseeing and enforcing U.S. law.

Cuccinelli, who this week toured the southwest border and met with officials from his agency, ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), has thrust the agency into national attention since being appointed acting director in June.

The agency was in the spotlight last week with the rollout of the “public charge” rule, giving officials updated guidance as to when they should deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to be reliant on government welfare. The rule had been brewing in the agency for nearly two years but, within weeks of Cuccinelli taking charge, it was out.

While the concept of denying residency or admittance to those likely to be a public charge isn’t new and goes back to the 1800s, the rule defines “public charge” as an immigrant who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. It includes benefits such as most forms of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps.

“First of all, I see USCIS as a vetting agency, not a benefits agency,” Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview near the Texas-Mexico border Wednesday. “We have benefits that we give when people meet legal thresholds but it’s on them to prove they’ve done it and it’s our job to make sure those are going to people who have in fact met those thresholds, and we’re protecting America by screening people trying to come in and stay here a long time.”

The rule sparked fierce criticism from Democrats and immigration-rights activists who claimed it would have a ""chilling"" effect on immigrants who need benefits. The move will almost certainly have far-reaching consequences in terms of who now gets a green card, and the administration hopes it will save the American taxpayer billions by preventing public charges from becoming residents.

Cuccinelli said the rollout is a sign of the speed with which the agency is moving under his watch as it looks to enforce the White House’s priorities on immigration.

“Public charge is the biggest thing we’ve brought out,” he said. “That’s going to be properly implemented and it will be very consequential in the long term, but we’re also just moving with a speed on the regulatory front that we haven’t before and I think we’re really getting out and telling the positive story of the president’s agenda on immigration, aggressively.”

While he has been getting that story out, making a number of media appearances including on Fox News, it has also made him a lightning rod for controversy as immigration remains a hotly debated, and partisan, issue.

On Monday after remarks re-emerged showing that Cuccinelli called waves of Central American migrants crossing the border “an invasion,’’ 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said he was “unfit” to lead USCIS.

Within hours of the unveiled “public charge” rule last week, Cuccinelli found himself being asked by multiple reporters about poetry, namely Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus” – a sonnet displayed within the Statue of Liberty and known for its line “give me your tired and poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...” The poem has often been used as a form of counterargument to those concerned about the quality of immigrants coming into the country.

In one of those instances, Cuccinelli was asked if the words are “part of the American ethos.”

“They certainly are: ‘Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,’” Cuccinelli said on NPR, in a twist on the poem’s original words. “That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge was passed — very interesting timing.”

The remark sparked fury within the commentariat, with outlets accusing him of trying to “rewrite” or “edit” the verse. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared: “I think the Statue of Liberty is weeping.”

Cuccinelli later assured a CNN host that he was not intending to rewrite poetry: “I didn’t bring up the poem, an NPR reporter did and now you have. I didn’t bring it up,” he said.

However, asked once again about it by the host, particularly the poem's reference to ""wretched refuse,"" Cuccinelli sparked another furor by saying the poem was ""referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren’t in the right class."" Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke cited the remarks as proof that the administration believes ""the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people.""

Cuccinelli may have little interest in rewriting verses, but his agency has shown a greater appetite for rewriting and overhauling guidance on immigration enforcement — something that could have significantly bigger implications for U.S. immigration policy.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TIGHTENS RULES FOR IMMIGRANT WORK PERMITS

A week after “public charge” was unveiled, USCIS on Monday issued new policy guidance that tightened rules for awarding discretionary work permits to immigrants who have been allowed into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or other “extraordinary” circumstances. USCIS said the guidance emphasizes ""the use of discretion when determining whether to grant employment authorization for foreign nationals paroled into the United States in keeping with existing policies.""

“USCIS has determined that it is necessary to issue this guidance at this time because there is a national emergency at the U.S. southern border where foreign nationals are entering the U.S. illegally,"" the agency said in a statement.

That rule indicates that Cuccinelli’s USCIS is taking strong interest in its role in tackling the migration crisis at the border. While it is primarily an agency dealing with legal immigration, certain aspects of asylum claims fall under its watch. It is in this context that Cuccinelli visited the border this week -- going on an operational mission over the Rio Grande Valley sector with CBP’s Air and Marine Operation (AMO) and touring the river separating Mexico and the U.S. in Laredo, in addition to touring an ICE detention center and other facilities.

BuzzFeed News reported last month that Cuccinelli has pushed officers to get tougher in screening those claiming asylum at the border, using the “credible fear” claim. He noted there is a significant difference between the number who are granted an initial asylum passage and who are eventually deemed to have a legitimate asylum claim.

“Therefore, USCIS must, in full compliance with the law, make sure we are properly screening individuals who claim fear but nevertheless do not have a significant possibility of receiving a grant of asylum or another form of protection available under our nation’s laws,” he said, reminding officers they have tools to combat “frivolous claims.”

The outlet also reported that USCIS has cut the two-day window between an immigrant’s detention and asylum interview to one — something that immigration groups have said will give them less time to prepare.

With these measures in place, along with his vigorous defense of the administration’s policies, the former Virginia state attorney general has picked up a reputation as a hardliner within the administration. It’s not a label that bothers him.

“If enforcing the law is being a hardliner,” he said when asked by Fox if he views himself as one. “Unfortunately I think just enforcing the law at its most basic level has become controversial. Look what’s happening to ICE, they’re being vilified for doing their job -- including by members of Congress who could change the law.”

He also rejects the idea that the goal of the administration is anti-immigrant, or is seeking to shut down immigration into the U.S.

“The president made pretty clear he wants to add value to the immigration system to America, he doesn’t want to shut it down, he wants it to work. I’ve gotten that from him in several conversations, so we’re trying to do that, make sure the law is enforced the way it’s written and try to add value,” he said.

Cuccinelli’s prominence has led to speculation by media outlets and former officials that he could be in the hunt to replace acting DHS chief Kevin McAleenan.

But talking to Fox News, Cuccinelli focused on a number of issues for USCIS to tackle, including the upcoming Supreme Court fight involving the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gave a deportation reprieve to young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

Asked what he sees as a key issue for his agency to tackle in the coming months, he responded: “Making fraud matter.”

“People think with some justification that they can lie to our officers and get away with it, and I’m very determined to bring consequences to that across the agency and that’s something I hope to work on in the next several months.”

DACA court ruling the latest twist for controversial Obama-era immigration policy,"A federal appeals court decision, issued Wednesday, that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is illegal, marks the latest turn in the labored history of the controversial 2012 regulation.

The 5th Circuit U.S. Court determined that the Obama administration did not have the authority to institute the program – which grants protection from deportation for illegal immigrants who had come to the country as minors.

The three judge panel did not dismantle the policy, meaning that while it cannot process new applicants, those already enrolled are still protected from removal. Approximately 700,000 are estimated to have been granted protection under the program, and hundreds of thousands more are deemed eligible.

President Barack Obama controversially created the program through executive action, which was immediately criticized for being an overreach of executive power. Obama said the policy was in response to inaction by Congress to form a pathway to citizenship for those whom activists and some media outlets dubbed ""Dreamers.""

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAMS ILLEGAL, BUT SAYS 600,000 ALREADY IN US CAN STAY

""This is not amnesty, this is not immunity,"" Obama said announcing the move. ""This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.""

While Republicans accused Obama of overreach, immigration activists have complained that the measure has left immigrants in limbo for nearly a decade. The protection needs renewal every two years.

BIDEN ADMIN MOVES TO STRENGTHEN OBAMA-ERA DACA PROGRAM AMID LEGAL CHALLENGES

The hope from the left of an all-encompassing immigration reform bill, including amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants – including DACA recipients – has never come to fruition, unable to gather Republican support for amnesty provisions.

President Donald Trump’s administration sought to end DACA, although it offered a deal to Democrats that would extend the program in exchange for wall funding to end a government shutdown.

However, in June 2020, the Supreme Court blocked the administration’s efforts to end DACA, finding that its efforts to do so were in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which sets out rulemaking for federal agencies.

President Biden entered office promising to defend DACA, taking executive action in the first days in office to do exactly that. He has also called for a comprehensive immigration deal with mass amnesty as a cornerstone.

But later in the year a Texas court ruled that the policy was unconstitutional, putting a freeze on new enrollments. The judge found that the agency's interpretation of statutes was ""overly broad"" and those laws did not carry the authority for the federal government to institute the program.

""DACA would grant lawful presence and work authorization to over a million people for whom Congress had made no provision and has consistently refused to make such a provision,"" Judge Andrew Hanen wrote. The 5th Circuit panel upheld that ruling.

However, in August the Biden administration made changes to the program via a new regulation. Under the new rule, the substance of DACA remains mostly the same in practice, but it is being issued in October in response to a public comment period, which places it more in line with the APA. The rule reaffirms the claim that DACA is not a form of lawful status like a visa, but views DACA recipients as ""lawfully present"" for certain purposes. The 5th Circuit sent the case back down to the lower court to consider the changes.

Biden renewed his call for a pathway to citizenship from Congress and said that while the ruling remains a temporary reprieve for recipients, ""one thing remains clear: the lives of Dreamers remain in limbo.""

As for the way forward for the program, the administration said it was still reviewing its options.

""I am deeply disappointed by today’s DACA ruling and the ongoing uncertainty it creates for families and communities across the country,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. ""We are currently reviewing the court’s decision and will work with the Department of Justice on an appropriate legal response.""

"Illegal immigration set records this year, but Democrats kept border funding flat","The Biden administration and Congress did nothing to boost funding for two key border security agencies in the last fiscal year, leaving them each at the same level as last year even as they coped with a record surge in illegal immigrants.

Final spending data released by the Treasury Department shows that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which enforces immigration laws at the border and runs the U.S. Border Patrol, received no new funding to deal with the problem, which included a record number of migrant encounters over the course of the year.

In fiscal year 2022, which ended Sept. 30, CBP spent $17.8 billion, almost exactly the same as it spent in FY21.

NATIONAL SHERIFFS' GROUP SOUNDS ALARM OVER SPIKE IN MIGRANT DEATHS AT SOUTHERN BORDER

The smaller U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which operates on the border but also enforces immigration laws in the interior of the U.S., spent about 8% more – $8.9 billion compared to the $8.2 billion in FY21. That amounts to a combined 2% increase for the two agencies.

Supporters of a tougher stance on illegal immigration said the lack of any push for new funding is just more proof the Biden administration is uninterested in fixing the problem at the southern border. The wave of illegal immigration led to the death of 856 migrants at or near the border last year, and Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the Biden administration needs to address this head-on.

""This administration has even gone on to brazenly claim that the border is ‘secure’ and the border is ‘closed,’ despite astounding evidence to prove otherwise,"" Katko told Fox News Digital. ""It should come as no surprise that this administration has not prioritized providing the right resources and policies for CBP to effectively do their jobs.""

""As the president and his administration continue to turn a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis at the border, House Republicans will be ready on day one of a Republican majority to deliver real solutions to the border crisis,"" he added.

SEPTEMBER MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS HIT RECORD HIGH, 20 SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARRESTED

Final numbers released by CBP said a record 2,378,944 migrant encounters took place in that year, and that nearly a quarter of a million of those took place in September, another record. The known number of ""gotaways"" who escaped capture at the border was 599,000.

Additionally, 98 suspected terrorists were arrested there over the course of the year.

""The American people should expect more from the president of the United States,"" National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told Fox News Digital. ""We are facing the largest border security crisis in our history and this budget clearly shows the president is unwilling to do what’s necessary to get this crisis under control.

""Unfortunately, President Biden cares more about politics and appeasing the far left base than he does in protecting our children, families, friends and neighbors,"" Judd added.

WHITE HOUSE, TOP DEMS SILENT ON HISTORIC MIGRANT DEATHS WHILE GOP BLAMES BIDEN, VOWS ACTION AT SOUTHERN BORDER

Tom Homan – former acting director of ICE, Heritage Foundation visiting fellow, and a Fox News contributor – agreed that the Biden administration has ""made clear they’re not going to fund enforcement.""

Homan said rather than push for funding to address the problem, the Biden administration has funneled more money into alternatives to detention that are making it easier for illegal immigrants to stay in the country. While former alternatives to detention involved ankle bracelets with GPS capability, the Biden administration has purposefully moved away from GPS devices.

""That’s a clear example of them not funding enforcement, and as a matter of fact, doing the opposite,"" Homan told Fox News Digital. ""This administration has shown they’re not going to fund enforcement, they’re going to fund release.""

Homan said the administration should be funding the completion of the wall on the southern border, including technology improvements that help border agents detect crossings. He also said the U.S. Border Patrol is 3,000 people short of a full staff. ""They should have a record budget,"" he said.

Dems praise Biden for addressing immigration crisis and asylum seekers ahead of US-Mexico border visit,"Democratic officials from across the United States have praised President Biden's recent asylum announcement ahead of his first visit to the southern border on Sunday, which will be the first of his administration.

The announcement included details on how the Biden administration will better manage the flow of asylum seekers primarily from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. It came ahead of Biden's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas on Sunday.

""Thank you to the Biden-Harris Administration for their renewed commitment to taking on immigration with the nuance and resources this issue deserves. We support policies that are fair and reflect our American values,"" tweeted Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C.

""President Biden’s announcement today to expand the humanitarian program to allow more asylum seekers to travel to the United States safely, legally, and in a more controlled manner, is an important, positive step in ensuring our federal partners can better address this humanitarian crisis,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a press release.

BORDER AGENTS ‘BEYOND FRUSTRATED’ AS BIDEN PREPARES TO FINALLY VISIT BESIEGED SOUTHERN BORDER

He also praised the Biden administration’s ""partnership and response to our request for action.""

Biden announced Thursday that migrants will be expelled to Mexico if they attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, effective immediately. He said, however, the U.S. would offer humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 people a month from those four countries, a service which they could receive if they apply online, pay for their airfare and find a financial sponsor.

Adams added: ""We are hopeful this policy will help better control the flow of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border. At the same time, we still need a long-term and proactive strategy to manage the crisis we are seeing.""

The mayor’s praise comes just days after he specifically called the migrant crisis a ""real embarrassment"" on a ""national level"" and said his city was being overwhelmed by its effects.

""It's a real embarrassment, I believe, on a national level, and we must have an appropriate response. We have had conversations around the issues on migrants for decades. This is a national issue. It must have a national response,"" Adams said on WABC’s ""Sid & Friends in the Morning.""

NYC MAYOR ADAMS CALLS OUT BIDEN, SAYS MIGRANT CRISIS A 'REAL EMBARRASSMENT'

Biden also received praise from San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, who said the border announcement will ""help expedite legal pathways for orderly migration and increase funding to nonprofits doing lifesaving work in our communities.""

Gloria also encouraged the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives to work with Democrats to ""pass legislation to fix our broken immigration system!""

Mayor Ron Nirenberg, of San Antonio, Texas, also praised Biden’s action.

""In lieu of much-needed congressional policy, [Biden’s] new action humanely addresses the influx of asylum seekers entering the U.S. We will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that San Antonio receives the necessary funding for our local migrant support efforts.""

Mayor Lori Lightfoot, of Chicago, Illinois, added: ""We support the President’s announcement today. Additionally, we look forward to continued engagement with the White House, federal executive branch stakeholders, as well as our federal elected delegation to address this ongoing national challenge around asylum seekers.""

KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS BIDEN'S 2023 PRIORITIES INCLUDES INFLATION, JOB GROWTH: 'NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC'

And, Mayor Michael Hancock of Denver, Colorado, called the asylum change a ""positive step.""

""Hopeful these add'l resources/enforcement actions will help alleviate the pressures this influx of migrants is putting on Denver & cities across the country,"" he added.

Many of these cities have been the recipients of thousands of migrants that have been transported from Texas, Arizona, and Florida via bus to help ease local migrant facilities.

The New York City mayor specifically complained about the influx of migrants, saying during the interview that a migrant ""onslaught"" had an affect ""on the quality of life in New York.""

4 MILLION BORDER ENCOUNTERS SINCE KAMALA HARRIS ASSIGNED TO ADDRESS 'ROOT CAUSE' OF PROBLEM

""El Paso should not be going through this. Chicago should not be going through this. Houston, Washington, New York, no city should have to make a decision if they're going to provide for their citizens, particularly coming out of Covid or if they're going to deal with an onslaught of migrants and asylum seekers,"" he said.

Biden’s visit to the southern border comes as he kicks off a two-day North American leaders summit in Mexico City that begins on Monday. He will be joined by Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

In addition to the immigration crisis, the leaders are expected to discuss how a collaborative North America can address climate change, manufacturing, trade, and the economy.

DeSantis tested on immigration as 2024 rumors continue mounting,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent dozens of immigrants from Texas to an island off the Massachusetts coast last year in a high-profile effort to highlight illegal immigration on the eve of the midterm elections. But as thousands of Cuban migrants flocked to his own state's shores in recent weeks, he adopted a more cautious approach.

The governor, who is a top Republican presidential prospect, activated the National Guard late last week. But related deployments of soldiers, boat patrols and military planes were slow to materialize. Some residents expressed frustration about the persistent influx of migrants as they recently inspected two large rafts abandoned in a Florida Keys community park.

""If they come over on a boat, they need to turn the boat back around,"" Ernest Vaile, a Missouri resident who winters in Florida, said as he examined the collection of cracked wood, adding that he didn't blame DeSantis. ""From all I know, whatever Gov. DeSantis decides to do will be the right thing.""

RON DESANTIS TO HOLD 'INTIMATE DINNER' WITH TOP DONORS AMID 2024 SPECULATION

The episode unfolding in south Florida offers insight into DeSantis' leadership as he eyes a presidential primary campaign against former President Donald Trump. The hard-charging governor has won admiration from many Republican voters nationwide by championing hard-line conservative policies on cultural issues — among them race, gender and immigration. But as he considers a presidential announcement, DeSantis appears to be treading more carefully with immigration developments in his own backyard.

He has been silent on the topic in the days since declaring a state of emergency and activating the National Guard via news release. His office declined to answer several questions about his approach to the Cuban migrants. In the news release, he blamed the Biden administration while offering empathy to the Cubans, a community that typically favors Republicans in U.S. elections.

""Florida has a long history of helping refugees, including Cubans and others fleeing communist regimes, find support after they arrive in the United States,"" DeSantis said.

While DeSantis is known for embracing Trump’s brash leadership style and even his mannerisms, allies suggest the Harvard-educated former military attorney is more deft at navigating delicate political issues than the former president is.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Trump rival during the 2016 campaign who attended DeSantis' second inauguration last week, offered a warm assessment when asked to evaluate the governor’s approach on hot-button issues like immigration.

""I will say that, overall, Gov. DeSantis has done a good job as governor and Florida is on a roll,"" Bush told The Associated Press.

DeSantis associates privately believe he will finalize his 2024 decision by the end of March, although a public announcement may not come until early summer. He is eyeing an aggressive conservative policy agenda over the coming months to strengthen his prospective Republican candidacy. As DeSantis moves forward, however, the Cuban migrants pose a test for him.

An estimated 7,400 Cubans have been caught in waters off the coast of Florida trying to seek refuge from their communist island nation over the last five months, a dramatic increase under DeSantis' watch that could leave him vulnerable to criticism from the right.

Failed Florida Republican congressional candidate Laura Loomer, a popular voice among Trump's most fervent supporters, questioned DeSantis' commitment to conservative policies on multiple fronts, especially immigration.

""Thanks to Gov. Ron DeSantis, we now have more illegal aliens in our country,"" Loomer said. ""During his time as governor, immigration has actually gotten worse.""

Cubans are leaving the island nation in their largest numbers in six decades. More than 6,000 Cubans journeying by sea were caught by federal authorities in the fiscal year between October 2021 and September 2022, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. That's compared with only about 800 the year before.

Meanwhile, illegal crossings by Cubans at the U.S.-Mexico border surged from 39,000 between October 2020 and September 2021 to more than 220,000 between October 2021 and September 2022, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Once captured, the Cubans are generally freed to pursue their immigration cases in the courts, and many head to Florida.

That number may drop under new asylum rules announced by President Joe Biden that now also apply to Cubans.

Cubans have long been granted immigration benefits under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. While some policies changed under President Barack Obama and were not reinstated under Trump, the lack of formal diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba makes it less likely for Cubans to be deported.

Meanwhile, DeSantis' would-be 2024 rivals — and there are many beyond Trump — are quietly hoping the shine of the governor's political star will fade as his status as a leading presidential prospect attracts new scrutiny.

In recent days, an aide to South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who is also weighing a presidential bid, criticized DeSantis for supporting a ban on abortion at 15 weeks after conception as insufficiently conservative. The Florida governor has faced related criticism from anti-abortion activists in his own state who have called on him to impose even stricter limits on the procedure.

At the same time, Democratic operatives are combing through DeSantis' record and tracking every appearance to generate content designed to weaken his political standing. American Bridge, a pro-Democrat super PAC known best for producing so-called opposition research, has had a team focused on DeSantis, among other potential 2024 Republican candidates, since October.

""DeSantis believes that he has been tested at the national level, but presidential primaries are a whole different ballgame where perceived small mistakes turn into big problems,"" American Bridge President Pat Dennis said.

Meanwhile, DeSantis is planning to bolster his conservative bona fides in Florida's upcoming state legislative session, which begins in March and is expected to conclude by May.

It’s unclear what legislation DeSantis will pursue, but the governor in recent weeks has signaled a desire to keep pulling at partisan divides. He isn't expected to face much meaningful opposition in a legislature with a Republican supermajority.

In late December, DeSantis' budget office called on state colleges to submit spending information on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion and critical race theory, which examines systemic racism. The request could be a prelude to a DeSantis push to slash state funding around what he calls ""woke"" ideology in state schools. The colleges have to submit the spending data by Friday.

FLORIDA SCHOOL DISTRICT BANS BOOK ABOUT REAL-LIFE GAY PENGUIN RELATIONSHIP, CITING PARENTAL RIGHTS LAW

DeSantis also recently made a series of high-profile conservative appointments to the board of trustees of a liberal arts college. Critics worry that he's simply injecting his conservative politics into the state's higher education.

""Is he willing to just burn an institution to the ground and harm the community just to score cheap political points?"" asked Andrew Gothard, president of the union United Faculty of Florida.

The governor is set to notch another political victory in his fight against Walt Disney World. With his blessing, Republican lawmakers are expected to pass a sweeping bill to increase state control of the private government operated by the entertainment giant over its property in Florida.

DeSantis last year pushed the legislature to dissolve the Disney government over the company’s objection to the law that critics call ""Don’t Say Gay,"" which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

It's not all red meat for the Republican base, however.

In the final year of his first term, DeSantis orchestrated pay raises for teachers and law enforcement, a minimum wage increase for state workers and various state tax suspensions. The governor also secured billions of dollars for Everglades restoration and other environmental projects. This week, he signed an executive order calling on lawmakers to dedicate $3.5 billion more to similar environmental initiatives.

And on the Cuban immigration front, he has avoided some of the fiery conservative rhetoric that defined his view on the U.S.-Mexico border — at least, so far.

The Florida National Guard announced Wednesday that it was mobilizing 12 military planes and approximately 150 troops to help south Florida authorities respond to ""mass migration impacting the area.""

"Federal immigration agency delays 13,400 potential furloughs until August","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) delayed the expected furloughs of more than 13,000 employees by at least two weeks as the federal agency seeks to secure $1.2 billion from Congress to stay afloat after the global coronavirus pandemic has dried up immigration revenue.

The agency had initially alerted more than two-thirds of the workforce they would be furloughed starting July 20, but now that date has been pushed back to Aug. 3.

“Without congressional intervention, USCIS will need to administratively furlough approximately 13,400 employees,"" USCIS said in a statement to Fox News. ""We previously anticipated that the furlough to begin on July 20, but we have received additional revenue and have identified cost savings to extend the potential furlough date to August 3 in the event Congress does not provide emergency funding. We continue to work with Congress to provide the necessary funding to avert this unfortunate consequence.”

THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION EMPLOYEES BRACE FOR FURLOUGHS

USCIS must give employees a 30-day notice of an expected furlough. In a note to employees Tuesday, Joesph Edlow, deputy director for policy at USCIS, said notices are being sent out this week in preparation of the Aug. 3 furloughs.

""I regret to inform you that offices will begin the process of distributing furlough notices to employees who will be impacted should an administrative furlough be required to start on August 3,"" Edlow said in the Tuesday notice obtained by Fox News, citing the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

The agency has seen a ""dramatic decrease"" in revenue collections and estimates that application and petition receipts will drop 61 percent through the end of the 2020 fiscal year. That means USCIS will exhaust its funding this summer and won't be able to make payroll. It's seeking a one-time emergency funding request of $1.2 billion.

USCIS offices closed in March as part of the effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, suspending in-person services at field offices and asylum offices. President Trump has also placed significant restrictions on green cards for those already in the country -- which are usually handled by USCIS.

US IMMIGRATION AGENCY SAYS IT MIGHT NOT MAKE PAYROLL WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL HELP

Unlike other government agencies, USCIS is a fee-based agency, meaning it is primarily funded by the money coming from fees that immigrants pay to have their applications processed. After months of closure, USCIS began reopening certain field offices and asylum offices on June 4 for non-emergency face-to-face services to the public.

USCIS alerted its staff and Congress of the budget shortfall back in May.

USCIS wants Congress to pass a one-time $1.2 billion payment to allow the agency to make payroll. The agency promised to pay the funds back to the U.S. Treasury by adding a 10 percent surcharge to immigration applications.

But the House Appropriations Committee hasn't moved forward because the Trump Administration has not submitted a request for the USCIS funding.

""The Administration has still not sent a request for supplemental funding,"" a Democratic aide said.

TRUMP SIGNS ORDER EXPANDING IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS TO INCLUDE H-1B, OTHER GUEST-WORKER PROGRAMS

This is not the first time USCIS has warned of financial difficulty. Back in November, prior to the pandemic, the agency was predicting a $1.26 billion shortfall when it put forth a proposal to increase the fees charged for each immigration and naturalization benefit request by a weighted average of 21 percent.

But a USCIS spokesperson said the $1.2 billion budget shortfall the agency now faces is something different.

""While the forecasted figures came to the same estimated amount, they describe different financial items,"" a USCIS spokesperson said. ""The proposed fee rule forecast projected that revenue would remain flat during the FY 2019/2020 biennial period, and based on that, estimated an average annual budget shortfall of $1.26 billion if USCIS continued at the same volume without implementing the proposed fee rule.""

The current financial problems are related to coronavirus, the agency said. ""The precipitous decline in revenue as a result of COVID-19 began in March.

Federal judge: Obama immigration actions 'unconstitutional',"A federal judge has found parts of President Obama's immigration executive actions unconstitutional, in an opinion delivered as part of a separate immigration case not directly tied to the policy changes.

The opinion filed Tuesday by U.S. District Court Judge Arthur Schwab, in Pennsylvania, still marks the first court opinion to tackle Obama's immigration announcement. He said Obama's immigration actions are invalid and effectively count as ""legislation"" from the Executive Branch.

""President Obama's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause, and therefore, is unconstitutional,"" the judge wrote.

The opinion, though, is unique in that it did not come in response to a challenge to Obama's immigration policy announcement. It is unclear what impact, if any, the opinion might have other than to rally critics and fuel momentum behind other lawsuits.

Rather, Schwab issued his opinion in response to a criminal case against Honduran illegal immigrant Elionardo Juarez-Escobar, who was previously deported in 2005 -- and was caught in the U.S. again earlier this year.

He already has pleaded guilty to ""re-entry of a removed alien,"" but the court subsequently examined the impact of Obama's immigration actions on the case.

For that review, Schwab left open whether the actions might apply to Juarez-Escobar but determined the executive actions themselves were unconstitutional.

He wrote that the action goes beyond so-called ""prosecutorial discretion"" -- which is the ""discretion"" the administration cites in determining whether to pursue deportation against illegal immigrants.

Obama's policy changes would give a reprieve to up to 5 million illegal immigrants, including those whose children are citizens or legal permanent residents and who meet other criteria.

Schwab, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote that this ""systematic and rigid process"" applies to a ""broad range"" of enforcement decisions, as opposed to dealing with matters on a ""case-by-case basis.""

Further, he wrote that the action goes beyond deferring deportation by letting beneficiaries apply for work authorization and allowing some to become ""quasi-United States citizens.""

He also cited Obama's argument that he was proceeding with executive action after Congress failed to act on comprehensive immigration legislation, and countered: ""Congressional inaction does not endow legislative power with the Executive.""

The Justice Department downplayed the significance of the opinion.

""The decision is unfounded and the court had no basis to issue such an order,"" a DOJ spokesperson said in a statement. ""No party in the case challenged the constitutionality of the immigration-related executive actions and the department's filing made it clear that the executive actions did not apply to the criminal matter before the court. Moreover, the court's analysis of the legality of the executive actions is flatly wrong. We will respond to the court's decision at the appropriate time.""

Critics of the administration's policy, though, hailed the opinion.

""The President's unilateral executive action suspending the nation's immigration laws for roughly five million illegal aliens has received its first judicial test, and it has failed,"" John Eastman, law professor at Chapman University, said in a statement.

Other direct legal challenges to Obama's immigration actions, including one by two-dozen states, remain pending before the federal courts.

"Flashback: Biden praised ‘constant,' 'unrelenting’ stream of immigration into US","President-elect Joe Biden, during the Obama administration, said the U.S. benefits from a “constant” and “unrelenting” stream of immigration -- and that those with white European heritage becoming a minority in the U.S. is ""a source of our strength.""

Biden, then the vice president, made the comments at a 2015 White House summit on “Countering Violent Extremism.” In those remarks Biden described the U.S. as a nation of immigrants and a “melting pot.”

BIDEN'S PICKS FOR TRANSITION TEAM THE LATEST SIGN OF A RADICALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION

""It is the ultimate source of our strength, it is the ultimate source of who we are, what we become,” he told roundtable participants. “It started all the way back in the late 1700s. There has been a constant, unrelenting stream of immigration, not in little trickles but in large numbers.”

He spoke of a conversation he had with former Singapore President Lee Kuan Yew. The former president told Biden that China was looking for a metaphorical “buried black box” -- or the secret that allows “America to constantly be able to remake itself, unlike any other country in the world.""

Biden said that he believed there were two parts to that “black box” -- one was an “overwhelming skepticism for orthodoxy.”

“There is a second thing in that black box: an unrelenting stream of immigration, nonstop, nonstop,” he said.

He went on to comment about potential demographic change in the U.S.

TRUMP OFFICIALS WARN OF NEW BORDER SURGE IF BIDEN REVERSES IMMIGRATION POLICIES

“Folks like me who are Caucasian, of European descent, for the first time in 2017 we’ll be in an absolute minority in the United States of America, absolute minority,” he said.

“Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be white European stock,"" he said. “That’s not a bad thing, that’s a source of our strength.""

Biden made similar comments a year earlier, where he reportedly spoke to the National Association of Manufacturers on the need for immigration reform “from a purely economic point of view.”

According to The Hill, which reported on the comments, Biden said a key to U.S. economic strength is the “constant, unrelenting stream” of immigrants into the country.

“Not dribbling,” Biden said. “Significant flows.”

Biden has promised to take a different, more open stance on immigration compared to the Trump administration's. Among his proposed policies are significantly raising the refugee cap, expanding the number of temporary visas, creating a “pathway to citizenship” for illegal immigrants, and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flashback-joe-biden-constant-unrelenting-immigration,N/A
Florida GOP lawmaker introduces sweeping immigration bill with 'dignified' pathway for legalization,"Florida Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar unveiled a new immigration bill Tuesday that would give undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship while requiring them to pay for border security and American worker retraining programs.

Salazar, a freshman GOP congresswoman from Miami, said ""The Dignity Act"" would end illegal immigration once and for all by securing the border and would allow millions of undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows in a dignified way to redemption.

""I'm a brown girl from the hood. I can do this because I do know my people and what they want and what my people want is dignity,"" Salazar said Tuesday in a call with reporters announcing her major legislation. ""They love the promised land and … this is the right thing to do for them and for the country.""

BOEBERT SEEKS TO BAN FEDERALLY FUNDED LEGAL AID TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Salazar said her bill represents the first time a freshman member has proposed comprehensive immigration reforms on her own and without the help of a committee. She issued a challenge to immigration hardliners who have rejected any forms of reform under the guise of ""amnesty"" by saying ""amnesty is what we have now.""

""We have 11 million plus people using our roads, our schools, our hospitals for free,"" Salazar said. ""There is no accountability. Living for free with no consequences is a real amnesty.""

Under her legislation, so-called Dreamers who were brought to the United States illegally as children would have immediate legal status and a pathway to citizenship. The millions of other undocumented immigrants currently in the United States would be allowed to enroll in the ""dignity"" program that offers a 10-year temporary legal status, where they must pay $1,000 a year, pass a criminal background check and be barred from accessing federal benefits and entitlement programs.

Those funds – estimated to bring in $90 billion over the decade if 9 million people are enrolled-- would be earmarked for U.S. worker job skills and retraining programs in an effort to address concerns that immigrants are displacing American workers.

The immigrants would also have to pay 2% of the paychecks to a new Immigration Infrastructure Fund that would be used to secure the southern border, with new border construction barriers, added technology and employing an additional 3,000 border agents.

The 2% levy on immigrant wages is estimated to bring in an estimated $45 billion to $90 billion dollars, assuming wages would range from an average of $25,000 to $50,000.

The legislation also would mandate E-verify nationwide to curb the employment of illegal workers, create tougher penalties for smugglers, create new processing centers at the border to hold immigrants while their cases are pending while the increasing the number of immigration judges and attorneys to expedite the backlog.

MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS INCREASED AGAIN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER

Salazar's legislation has the support of fellow Republicans Dan Newhouse of Washington, John Curtis of Utah, Pete Sessions of Texas, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico, Tom Reed of New York and Peter Meijer of Michigan.

She said Democrats have failed for decades to produce immigration reform. Republicans, she said, have an opportunity to welcome Latinos to the party.

""There's a very big movement within the Republican Party understanding that this is the invitation letter for the Browns, the Hispanics, the Latinos – the largest minority in the country – welcoming them into the Republican Party because we know that we need them in order to continue improving the American economy,"" Salazar said.

But with the current border crisis, which has seen more than 100,000 migrant encounters, and sometimes more than double that each month, some Republicans are cool to any idea of welcoming immigrants.

GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn, a freshman and member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, said he hasn't seen Salazar's legislation, but in general, is not supportive of a pathway to citizenship and believes it could be ""dangerous"" messaging to cartels to bring more people across the border.

""I believe we need the exact opposite,"" Cawthorn told Fox News Digital. ""We should be focusing on deportations and securing our border.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-gop-immigration-bill-dignified-legalization,N/A
"Florida Senate: Marco Rubio and Val Demings take aim at one another on immigration, gun control","A debate between Florida's two Senate candidates – incumbent GOP Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Val Demings – became heated as the pair took aim at one another on a number of issues, including rising prices, abortion, gun control and immigration.

Notably absent from the Tuesday evening debate held at Palm Beach State College’s Lake Worth campus was the issue of crime, which Republicans have prioritized in the election amid rising crime rates across several major American cities.

Asked about rising costs, from housing to gasoline, and how they will ""help families now"" after trillions of dollars were utilized by the government for pandemic relief in America, the two candidates took issue will policies their opponent had supported in the past.

Rubio insisted that the government's spending led to a rise in inflation, saying Democrats ""were warned by Larry Summers, by other Democrat economists, you do this, you're gonna fire up inflation"" and insisted that one resolve to the issue would be the production of American oil.

FLORIDA SENATE: RUBIO AND DEMINGS ARGUE OVER ABORTION LIMITATIONS, EXCEPTIONS IN HEATED DEBATE

""We've got to produce American oil again,"" Rubio said. ""Why are we begging Saudi Arabia for oil? Why are we begging Venzuela and Iran for oil? We're producing a million barrels a day less on oil than we used to do just a couple of years ago. Instead, we are depleting our reserves. Our oil reserves do not exist to win midterms. They exist to help this country in an emergency or in the midst of a storm. What we cannot do is some of these crazy policies that are coming from the left that Congresswoman Demings has supported.""

Responding to criticism from Rubio, Demings said, ""Of course the senator who has never run anything at all but his mouth would know nothing about helping people and being there for people when they are in trouble. No one planned the pandemic, but our response to it is everything. Individuals were hurting, families were hurting, businesses were hurting. We passed the CARES Act.""

""Your number one job as a United States Senator is to protect the safety, health, and wellbeing of the American people,"" she added. ""You've been at it for 24 years…""

Rubio also accused the congresswoman, who currently represents Florida's 10th Congressional District and previously served as chief of the Orlando Police Department from 2007 to 2011, of having ""never passed a bill"" during her tenure in Congress.

""The congresswoman likes to talk about helping people. She's never passed a bill. She's never passed a single bill. She's been in Congress for over half a decade, she's never passed a bill. Not [Paycheck Protection Program], not anything. Not a single thing she's passed has ever become law.""

Demings denied Rubio's claim and said, ""That's not true.""

""I'm really disappointed in you, Marco Rubio, because I think there was a time when you did not lie in order to win. I don't know what happened to you. You know that's not true,"" she said. Demings claimed she passed a measure during her first term in Congress to ""help law enforcement officers with mental health programs.""

The two also took issue with one another on the issue of abortion, with Demings claiming that her opponent supports no exemptions for the procedure, including rape and incest, and Rubio claiming that Demings supports ""no restrictions, no limitations"" on abortion.

FLORIDA SENATE: DEMOCRAT VAL DEMINGS DOESN'T SAY WHETHER SHE WILL ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF ELECTION

""The extremist on abortion in this campaign is Congresswoman Demings,"" Rubio said. ""She supports no restrictions, no limitations of any kind. She's against the fourth-month ban, she voted against the five-month ban. She supports taxpayer funded abortion, on demand, for any reason, at any time, up until the moment of birth.""

""Senator, how gullible do you really think Florida voters are,"" Demings responded. ""You have been clear that you support no exceptions, even including rape and incest. Now as a police detective who investigated cases of rape and incest, no, senator, I don't think it's okay for a ten-year-old girl to be raped and have to carry the seed of her rapist. No, I don't think it's okay for you to get to make decisions for women and girls as a senator. I think those decisions are made between the woman, her family, her doctor, and her faith.""

Demings said she ""supports a woman's right to choose up until the time of viability."" In response, Rubio insisted that's a ""vague"" term that many Democrats use in order to provide a clear answer on limitations.

""Every law I've ever passed has exceptions,"" Rubio said. ""We're never gonna get a vote on a law that doesn't have exceptions cause that's where the majority of the American people are and I respect and understand that.""

On the issue of gun violence in America, Demings insisted that Rubio has lacked on the issue and done little to advance bills that would prevent people from obtaining weapons to cause harm.

""You've done nothing. Nothing to address gun violence and help to get dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people,"" Demings said. ""Our primary responsibility is the safety of Floridians and senator, 24 years in elected office and you have not yet risen to that occasion and then when asked about it you say something that makes no sense.""

DESANTIS AND RUBIO HOLD STRONG LEADS IN FLORIDA GUBERNATORIAL, SENATE RACES, UP BY DOUBLE DIGITS WITH LATINOS

In response, Rubio said, ""What makes no sense is that we're gonna actually pass laws that only law-abiding people will follow and criminals will continue to violate.""

""The truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, Americans have a Second Amendment right to protect themselves,"" he added. ""These killers that are out there, if there intent is killing as they are, they have found multiple ways to get ahold of weapons and cause mass destruction. … I have a bipartisan red flag law, sponsored with Sen. Jack Reed, but the problem is that the leftists in the Senate, and in the House, like Congresswoman Demings are against it because they want the California red flag law that allows your coworker who has a grudge against you to go to a judge and take away your guns. That, I'll never support.""

The two candidates were also asked about the immigration crisis and whether they support a recent policy change from the Biden administration to send Venezuelans who arrive at America's border back to Venezuela and prevent them from applying for asylum in America again.

""You mean Joe Biden just instituted Trump's return to Mexico policy,"" Rubio stated. ""There's not more to it, that's exactly what he did. Congresswoman Demings said what's happening at the border is nothing unusual. We have 5,000 people a day crossing the border. You know how many people have entered our country illegally since Joe Biden took over as president? 5 million.""

""There's no country in the world that can tolerate, or permit, or afford, 5,000 people a day arriving at your border saying the magic words and getting asylum. And she says that's not a problem. She says there's nothing unusual about it. This cannot continue. It has to be fixed.""

Demings responded by referencing her career as a police officer and police chief, saying ""We're a nation of laws. I've enforced them for 27 years.""

""Despite what the senator wants you to believe, he's living in fantasy land,"" she said. ""We need to make sure the men and women at the border have the resources they need. I'm a fan of boots on the ground, but we need to hire more processors. … We're a nation of laws. We have to enforce the law, but we also have to obey the law that says people who are in trouble can seek asylum in this country.""

""The senator likes to talk about open borders. It's almost an insult to the men and women who are there securing the border,"" she added.

Rubio, in response, claimed that the ""only one who's insulted the people working the border are Joe Biden and Democrats who accuse them of whipping Haitian migrants and that turned out to be untrue.""

According to poll of likely voters conducted by Spectrum News/Siena College in September, Rubio leads Demings 48% to 41%.

Fox News Poll: Most voters favor immigration deal,"A sizable majority of voters favors a broad immigration deal that includes a border barrier, non-barrier security measures, and humanitarian aid. At the same time, support for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border stands its highest since 2015.

The number favoring the wall inched up for the second time in two months to 46 percent, according to the latest Fox News Poll. It was 43 percent last month during the government shutdown and 39 percent in September. The high mark was 50 percent in November 2015.

Currently, 50 percent oppose the wall, down one point since January.

READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS.

A bipartisan 66 percent majority favors a budget deal that includes funding for some form of a border barrier, plus other security measures and humanitarian relief.

The compromise deal lawmakers are currently discussing reportedly includes $1.375 billion for border barriers and security, and humanitarian aid. The president must sign legislation by midnight Friday to prevent another shutdown.

While there is a wide gap in the number of Democrats (12 percent) and Republicans (86 percent) favoring the wall, majorities of both parties, 60 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans, favor the compromise.

Seventy-five percent of pro-wall voters favor the broad immigration deal, as do 58 percent of wall opponents.

Meanwhile, pro-wall voters (58 percent) are more than twice as likely as wall opponents (24 percent) to say they are willing to shut down the government over the wall.

Who won the recent shutdown showdown? By a 43-35 percent margin, voters say House Speaker Nancy Pelosi looked stronger politically after the shutdown ended than President Donald Trump. Pelosi also garners more party loyalty: 74 percent of Democrats think she looked stronger compared to 68 percent of Republicans who say Trump did.

Even so, the shutdown didn’t damage the president’s numbers. Both his job approval and his personal favorable rating are within a point or two of where they have been for months.

Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable view of Trump, down three points from 46 percent in December. His negative rating went up two points to 54 percent. That puts his favorable rating underwater by 11 points. For comparison, Pelosi is underwater by 15. Since December, positive views of her held steady at 36 percent (51 percent unfavorable).

Overall, the president’s job rating is negative by 6 points: 46 percent of voters approve of the job he is doing and 52 percent disapprove. Last month, during the partial government shutdown, it was 43-54 percent. In December, it was 46-52 percent.

More than half remain opposed to the president declaring a national emergency as a way to construct the wall without congressional approval. Fifty-six percent are against that, including 20 percent of Republicans.

Sixty-three percent of voters consider the situation at the southern border an emergency or major problem. The same number, 63 percent, feel that way about climate change. Opioid addiction dwarfs that: 87 percent consider it an emergency or major problem.

Just over a third (35 percent) think the migrant caravan is a “major threat” to national security. While that’s more than see instability in Venezuela that way (22 percent), it is far fewer than consider North Korea (52 percent), ISIS (62 percent), and foreign cyberattacks (72 percent) a major U.S. security threat.

Voters favor giving legal status to Dreamers by 70-21 percent, unchanged since January 2018.

One third have a favorable view of sanctuary cities, while 44 percent have a negative opinion

Pollpourri

-- Views of freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are negative: 26 percent favorable vs. 39 percent unfavorable. Nineteen percent have never heard of her. For comparison, 11 percent say they have never heard of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is currently serving his sixth term in the senate. McConnell is viewed more negatively than positively by 20 points (25 favorable vs. 45 unfavorable).

“Ocasio-Cortez’s rapid rise to national prominence is remarkable, and Republicans have a lot to do with elevating her,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the poll with Republican Daron Shaw. “I expect to see her numbers improve as more Democrats realize how much Republicans dislike her.”

-- Melania Trump is more popular than anyone tested. Forty-seven percent of voters have a favorable view of her, 37 percent unfavorable. The first lady’s highest positive rating was 51 percent in June 2017.

-- Mixed views on Vice President Mike Pence: 42 percent favorable vs. 44 percent unfavorable.

-- Post partial federal shutdown, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are on par in the eyes of voters, as 45 percent have a favorable view of each party. In addition, roughly equal numbers of Democrats have a positive view of their party (87 favorable) as Republicans have of theirs (84 favorable). However, far more Democrats, 51 percent, have a “strongly” favorable opinion of their party than Republicans (39 percent) have of the GOP.

The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) (formerly named Anderson Robbins Research) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from February 10-12, 2019.

"House Republicans push specific immigration changes, say reform not a 'race'","House Republicans on Tuesday kicked off one of Washington’s most active and intense rounds of debate over the illegal immigration issue, holding a hearing in which witnesses largely appealed to Congress to pass reform legislation to help families and improve the country’s struggling economy.

While some on Capitol Hill are pushing for a comprehensive immigration reform package, several House Republicans homed in Tuesday on a handful of policy changes they argued should take priority -- including improving the visa system for immigrants who graduate from American schools and dealing with illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, during a policy speech Tuesday at the American Enterprise Institute, called for helping the youngest illegal immigrants while saying the debate must balance “respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally.”

“A good place to start is with the kids,” the Virginia congressman said. “One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents.”

Cantor also said he supports the Senate plan to make border security, employment verification and a workable guest-worker program part of the reform legislation.

More On This...

Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee held a lengthy hearing, marking Congress’ first public debate on the issue since President Obama’s re-election and his second-term pledge to make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority.

“We can save the economy, and immigration is one of the ways to make it happen,” said Vivek Wadhwa, director of research at Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering, during the hearing.

While the House held its hearing, Obama held separate White House meetings with labor and business leaders to discuss a wide range of issues, including immigration reform and how it fits into the broader economic picture.

“We had a great conversation with the president about immigration,” said Arne Sorenson, president of Marriott International. “We've got 11 million people in this country who are not sufficiently documented. They are not going home. We have got to do what we can quickly to make them contributing members of our economy and our society. It'll be good for our economy. … It will be good for their lives.”

Among the most high-profile speakers at the House hearing was Julian Castro, the Democratic mayor of San Antonio, Texas. He urged Congress to help those brought to the United States illegally by their parents and businesses that are helping train highly skilled immigrants, only to see them deported.

“The reforms that you have on the table are … pro-family and pro-business,” Castro testified. “Every year as competition increases, American companies throw up their hands, watch those trained in American universities leave in frustration.”

He also said visa laws that separate husbands and wives for years are “outdated” and “make no sense.”

While Obama and other Democrats have called for expedient and comprehensive reform, Republicans on Tuesday cautioned against passing legislation without a thorough debate.

“We all agree that our nation’s immigration system is in desperate need of repair,” said committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. “But before we rush to judgment, we need to carefully look at the current laws on the books to see what is and isn’t working. Reforming our nation’s immigration laws is a massive undertaking and is too important to not examine each piece in detail.”

His comments were followed those of Alabama Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus, who suggested passing separate legislation, instead of one comprehensive bill, that would first deal with getting high-skilled people working legally in this country.

“It’s going to be a much easier lift to solve the problem of high-skilled workers,” said Bachus, a subcommittee chairman. “We could pass a bill that would take that off the table. When you take compressive, full citizenship, that’s a more toxic contentious issue. ... Let’s not let the more contentious issue prevent us from this year, this month, passing something to address what is a horrible situation -- training people to go back to their countries and compete against us.”

At the same time, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters he was pleased with the bipartisan Senate effort on immigration, but the reform effort is “not a race. It's about trying to get it right.”

While the president and Senate panel each appear to want legislation that includes a path to citizenship, the congressional plan is more closely tied to tightening border security.

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa complained Tuesday that the president’s plan calls for a path to citizenship without first securing borders.

“The president’s trying to go to the left of a bipartisan Senate deal,” he said. “And I think Republicans in the House are trying to figure what we can do on a bipartisan basis, or a partisan basis if necessary, that will help fix this problem, help people who want to be here and who can add to our economy.”

Meanwhile, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has asked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO to promptly reach an agreement on immigration that he and other members of the bipartisan Senate group can incorporate into their legislation.

The possibility of a guest-worker program has traditionally divided labor and business. Labor groups have looked askance on bringing in numerous low-wage workers, while that's an outcome businesses have favored.

Both sides appear hopeful, although Schumer and others say the issue scuttled the last attempt at a comprehensive overhaul of immigration law in 2007.

This time around, officials involved hope for a better result, in part because all involved see the clear necessity of addressing what's called ""future flow"" -- the influx of migrants to the U.S. that's sure to come whether or not Congress passes an immigration bill.

While Congress acts to provide a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in this country, it's just as important to deal with future immigration, advocates say. Otherwise, some time from now the country will once again find itself home to many more illegal immigrants.

""We're at a point where we have to take that issue really seriously and think about what kind of a system do we want to have in place so that 10 years from now, 15 years from now, we're not in the same situation,"" said Ana Avendano, assistant to the AFL-CIO president for immigration and community action.

The Chamber of Commerce ""views the existence of a temporary worker program as vital to a comprehensive immigration bill,"" spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said in a statement.

The U.S. does have several temporary worker programs already, but they're viewed as cumbersome and outdated, and experts say the majority of migrant workers in agricultural and other low-skill fields like landscaping or housekeeping are illegal.

For business and labor, the question is how to come to an agreement on how many workers to let in and under what circumstances, how much they would be paid, and whether and how they would be able to attain eventual permanent residency, the critical step toward citizenship.

""Few aspects of immigration law are so divisive in terms of where the two sides stand,"" said Demetrios Papademetriou, head of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

ICE planning immigration enforcement operations in sanctuary cities,"The Trump administration is preparing a series of immigration enforcement operations targeting illegal immigrants in at least three sanctuary jurisdictions, a source familiar with the operations told Fox News Tuesday.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations will be in California, Denver and Philadelphia, and could potentially include other cities and jurisdictions across the country.

ICE OPERATIONS NAB MORE THAN 2,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, MANY WITH CRIMINAL CHARGES, CONVICTIONS

The Washington Post first reported about the operations, which could take place as soon as this week in California. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf may travel to at least one of the areas, it said.

“We do not comment on any law enforcement sensitive issues that may adversely impact our officers and the public,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “However, every day as part of routine operations, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targets and arrests criminal aliens and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

Sanctuary cities limit or forbid local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials, and specifically ICE detainers. The detainers are requests that ICE be alerted when an illegal immigrant is being released, and sometimes held until they can be detained by ICE and face deportation proceedings.

Supporters of such policies argue that they keep the community safe by encouraging cooperation between illegal immigrants and police. However, opponents argue that it results in the release of criminal illegal immigrants, and point to examples of illegal immigrants committing crimes.

The ICE spokesperson said that in such jurisdictions, “ICE is forced to arrest at-large criminal aliens out in the communities instead of under the safe confines of a jail.”

President Trump made immigration enforcement a key part of his 2016 campaign, and has cracked down on illegal immigration both at the border and in the U.S.

While the timing of the operations will raise suspicions that it is motivated by presidential politics -- just weeks from an election -- the administration has consistently taken measures to pressure sanctuary cities -- including enforcement operations.

Earlier this month, ICE announced that it arrested more than 2,000 illegal immigrants from 20 countries in a series of operations in July and August -- with the vast majority of those arrested having criminal charges or convictions.

“Today the president has unveiled an immigration plan that makes no mention of DACA, a program Trump unilaterally ended in late 2017, that has been hanging by a thread thanks to court injunctions,” Omar began in a speech to liberal activists. “A plan that fails to make sure people with temporary protection status and deferred enforced departure recipients don’t have a path to a permanent status or citizenship. A plan that seeks to limit asylum seekers fleeing violence.”

Omar, a Somali refugee, insisted that Trump's plan would have a ""devastating effect on millions of people around the world"" like her and believed that the US, which she referred to as ""beacon of hope for the world,"" should provide immigrants a ""simple and accessible path to become documented"" and not ""dehumanize"" them or ""call them 'animals.'""

""So what are we asking for? What we are asking for is very simple. We need to make sure that we cut, and not put increases on spending on detention facilities. We need to stop using DHS as a slush fund,"" Omar continued. ""We need to abolish ICE and end all inhumane deportation and detention programs. We need to fight back against the criminalization of immigrants and those crossing the border.

Illegal immigrants who entered US since Biden took office to cost taxpayers $20+ billion a year: analysis,"FIRST ON FOX: The number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. since President Biden took office will cost the U.S. taxpayer over $20 billion each year, according to a new analysis by a hawkish immigration group.

The study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, calculates that the illegal immigrants who have entered the U.S. since Jan. 2021 will add an extra $20.4 billion burden a year, in addition to the $140 billion existing illegal immigrants already cost.

The analysis is based on an estimated 1.3 million released into the U.S. by immigration officials, as well as approximately one million ""gotaways"" -- or illegal immigrants who have slipped past overwhelmed agents. FAIR calculates that each illegal immigrants costs $9,232 a year to support.

The U.S. has been in the midst of a massive border crisis since early 2021, with more than 1.7 million migrant encounters in FY 2021, and more than two million in FY 2022 so far. While many of those encounters are repeat encounters, and nearly half are removed under Title 42 public health protections, a considerable number are released into the U.S. for asylum hearings.

NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS WHO ENTERED US SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE APPROACHING TWO MILLION

DHS sources told Fox News that there have been more than 500,000 ""gotaways"" into the U.S. this fiscal year until July, making at least 900,000 gotaways in FY 21 and 22.

FAIR, which calls for stricter border controls as part of a range of broader immigration reforms, laid out the money the estimated $20.4 billion could be spent on instead -- including providing every homeless veteran in the U.S. $50K a year for the next 10 years.

The money, the analysis says, could also hire 330,000 teachers, fund and expand the National School Lunch Program, provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to more than 7 million extra families or provide every family earning less than $50K a year a $410 grocery voucher.

It could also construct the entire wall at the southern border -- a project that began under the Trump administration.

KAMALA HARRIS DECLARES ‘BORDER IS SECURE’ AS THOUSANDS OF ILLEGALS FLOOD INTO US EVERY DAY

""Even in an age in which trillion dollar spending packages and are considered modest, the additional $20.4 billion the Biden Border Crisis has heaped onto the backs of American taxpayers is still staggering,"" Dan Stein, president of FAIR, said in a statement. ""$20.4 billion could address some very important needs of the American public, instead of covering the costs of the surge of illegal migration triggered by this administration’s policies.""

The analysis comes amid continued conservative and Republican criticism of the Biden administration’s border policies -- which they have blamed for fueling the crisis by encouraging migrants to make the journey north. They argue that the policies have made it easier for migrants to enter the U.S. and be released, while simultaneously reducing interior enforcement.

The Biden administration has stressed that it is seeking to solve the ""root causes"" of the crisis, like poverty, violence and corruption in Central America. It has touted additional funding for Homeland Security as well as a recent anti-smuggling operation, while claiming its interior enforcement focuses on immediate threats to public safety and national security.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading diplomatic outreach to combat root causes, defended the Biden administration’s policies on Sunday -- and claimed that the border is ""secure,"" while calling for amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.

""I think that there is no question that we have to do what the president and I asked Congress to do, the first request we made: pass a bill to create a pathway to citizenship,"" Harris said on ""Meet the Press."" ""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular, over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed.""

Immigration activists dismayed at Biden move to expand Title 42 to Venezuelan illegal migrants,"Immigration activist groups are expressing their concern with the Biden administration’s announcement that it will start expelling Venezuelans to Mexico using the Title 42 public health order -- reducing entry pathways to a limited parole program.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday that it is launching a new large-scale border enforcement operation with Mexico that includes increased checkpoints, a surge in resources and a crackdown on human smuggling.

The administration also announced that all Venezuelans entering the U.S. illegally would now be returned to Mexico under the Title 42 public health order -- which was implemented during the Trump administration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The order allows for the rapid expulsion of migrants and is one that the Biden administration has been seeking to end, but has been stopped by a legal challenge.

There were more than 25,000 encounters of Venezuelan migrants in August, up from just 4,000 in April. Last August, there were just over 6,000 migrant encounters from Venezuela. It comes as part of a massive flow of migrants that has seen more than 2.1 million encounters this fiscal year.

BIDEN ADMIN ANNOUNCES BORDER OP WITH MEXICO, INCREASED REMOVALS OF VENEZUELANS

Simultaneously, the administration announced a new parole program that would allow for up to 24,000 Venezuelans to enter the U.S. if they meet certain conditions. The program requires Venezuelans to have a supporter in the U.S. to provide financial and other support, pass biometric and other security screenings, and complete public health requirements including vaccinations. It is similar to a program announced earlier in the year for eligible Ukrainians .

Nationals would be ineligible for the program if they have previously been deported, have crossed into the U.S. or into Mexico illegally after Tuesday, or have residence status or refugee status in a country other than Venezuela. DHS said the program will be stopped if Mexico stops accepting Venezuelan returns.

""These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future. Those who follow the lawful process will have the opportunity to travel safely to the United States and become eligible to work here.""

The moves come as the administration has been hammered by Republicans for failing to control the border crisis -- a claim that the administration has denied. Meanwhile, governors of Texas, Arizona and Florida have been bussing and flying migrants -- including many Venezuelans -- north to Democratic cities and jurisdictions.

However, immigration activists, while happy to see the introduction of the parole program, were dismayed by the increase of the use of Title 42 -- which they say denies migrants their right to claim asylum in the U.S.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS URGE BIDEN ADMIN TO ‘TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE STEP' TO STOP ILLEGAL MIGRATION FROM VENEZUELA

Murad Awawdeh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, accused the administration of making ""an end run around our humanitarian obligations.""

""By bending to the callous whims of Republican governors in Texas, Arizona and Florida as this country gears up for midterm elections, the Biden Administration has taken multiple steps backwards in time to the cruel immigration policies of Donald Trump,"" he said in a statement.

""America must uphold an asylum system that is fair, humane, and orderly for all people regardless of nationality, race, ethnicity or having U.S. ties. It is time for Title 42 to be ended once and for all. It is time for the Biden Administration to make good on its promises and return America to being a beacon of hope,"" he said.

Activists have long claimed that Title 42 is cruel and sends people back to Mexico, where they can be placed in danger. Many demand that migrants be allowed to claim asylum, even if they enter the U.S. illegally and do not make claims at ports of entry.

The Texas-based Migrant Center for Human Rights claimed the new policy ""blatantly violates the law.""

""Allowing only a subset of 24,000 Venezuelans, those with ‘supporter[s] in the United States who will provide financial and other support’ to come, is no panacea to this policy’s blanket expulsion of all Venezuelan asylum seekers, especially considering the 15,494 average monthly FY 2022 unique encounters (with over 25,000 in August and 33,000 in September),"" the group said in a statement.

""DHS Secretary Mayorkas’ claim that this policy ‘make[s] clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way’ shockingly ignores the situation of tens of thousands fleeing persecution made ineligible for this process and disregards foundational American law that states it is legal to seek asylum in this country regardless of manner of entry.""

The American Immigration Council welcomed the parole program and urged the government to ""expand similar parole options for people from other countries as well.""

""Unfortunately, the administration also announced the expansion of #Title42 expulsions for Venezuelans encountered at the southern border,"" the group said.

Immigration bill to abolish per-country green card caps pulled amid bipartisan opposition,"An immigration bill that would have abolished per-country caps on green cards was pulled from the House floor ahead of a vote on the legislation Wednesday evening marking a significant win for immigration hawks.

The Equal Access to Green Cards for Legal Employment (EAGLE) Act would remove per-country caps on the numbers of employment-based green cards as a way to end a historic backlog. The legislation would also increase the cap on family-based visas from 7% to 15%.

Most employment-based green cards are sought by workers already in the U.S. on temporary visas. But due to the large number of Chinese and Indian nationals brought in by U.S. companies on those visas, nationals from those two countries face the longest backlogs.

The legislation had bipartisan support in the House and backing from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Intel that had called per-country caps ""unfair"" and said they had contributed to the backlog.

BIG TECH BACKS EMBATTLED GREEN CARD BILL AHEAD OF KEY HOUSE VOTE

""We are proud to support the EAGLE Act and are continuing to advocate for commonsense immigration reform on behalf of our employees and their families.,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""We urge Congress to pass the #EAGLEAct, lifting unfair per-country visa caps for employment-based green cards.""

Immigration hawks had lobbied hard against the bill, arguing it would lead to Indian and Chinese nationals dominating the immigration system and encouraging more applications. They also raised concerns about national security related to possible exploitation by the Chinese government.

TOP CONSERVATIVE GROUP WARNS OF CHINESE SECURITY RISK IN KEY IMMIGRATION BILL, URGES ‘NO’ VOTE

The bill had also picked up bipartisan opposition in the chamber. Republican leadership had recommended against voting for the bill, while some Democrats had expressed their opposition to the measure.

Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., warned in a letter to members of the Congressional Black Caucus that eliminating the country caps without a corresponding increase in visas would ""result in a dearth of immigration opportunities for hopeful migrants outside these nations, with particular concern for those from African and Caribbean nations.""

""This legislation comes up short in my estimation and I cannot support efforts that would perpetuate the current inequalities in our immigration system. I believe we can do better,"" she wrote.

With few if any Republican votes and a split in the Democratic caucus, a number of votes were scheduled for the votes in the lame duck session before Republicans take control of the chamber on Jan. 3, but they were repeatedly postponed.

On Wednesday, Democratic leadership announced that further consideration of the bill had been postponed, and the House was no longer expected to vote on the measure.

The announcement was greeted with delight by groups calling for lower immigration. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which had been aggressive in lobbying lawmakers on the Hill against the bill, said it was ""encouraging that support for such an ill-conceived and dangerous bill waned among lawmakers in both parties — especially the GOP.""

""This is another step toward becoming a unified party focused not only on ending the unprecedented wave of illegal immigration, but also legal programs that have a disastrous impact on American workers,"" RJ Hauman, head of government relations at FAIR, said in a statement.

""Not only would enactment of the EAGLE Act harm American workers and result in even less immigration diversity, it would threaten vital national security and economic interests.""

Ryan Walker, vice president of government relations at Heritage Action, which had sounded the alarm about a national security threat from China, called the bill’s defeat a ""significant victory for the conservative grassroots community"" but added that it was ""only the first step.""

""In the next Congress, the American people want to see their representatives in Congress taking real measures to secure the border, hold the CCP accountable for espionage and IP theft and prioritize American workers,"" he said. ""Heritage Action looks forward to helping them achieve that goal.""

Some Democrats and immigration activists expressed disappointment and called on Democratic leadership to continue with the bill and hold a vote.

Immigration Voice urged supporters to call House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ""demand that she return [the bill] to floor for vote today.""

""Be clear - her legacy’ll be ruined by her choice to maintain discrimination unless she reverses course today & schedules the bill for a vote. No day’ll pass without us reminding her,"" the group said in a tweet.

Immigration hawks press GOP leaders to ‘take all actions necessary’ to block lame-duck amnesty push,"EXCLUSIVE: A broad coalition of hawkish immigration groups and former Trump administration officials are sounding the alarm about a Democratic push to get an amnesty for illegal immigrants passed in the final days of the current Congress -- and telling Republican leaders to ""take all actions necessary"" to block it.

Groups including the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Heritage Foundation, NumbersUSA and the America First Policy Institute have signed onto a letter to congressional leaders warning of an ""immediate danger posed by the lame-duck session of Congress that is now underway.""

""Even though power is about to change hands in one chamber, various media outlets report there will be attempts to push damaging immigration legislation such as a mass amnesty and increased immigration through Congress over the next few weeks,"" they say.

Former officials signed onto the letter include former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau, former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan and former Customs and Border Protection Chief Mark Morgan. Also signed on include former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and former deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli.

DEMOCRATS FIRE UP PUSH FOR DACA AMNESTY IN LAME DUCK SESSION BEFORE GOP TAKES HOUSE

Both the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress have been pushing for a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants since the administration took office in early 2021, but it has so far failed due to a lack of votes and Republican support.

Since the midterms, which determined that Republicans will take the House early next year, Democrats have ramped up their push for an amnesty for illegal immigrants eligible for the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program in the final months of the Congress.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill ., said at a recent press conference that, with Republicans set to take the House, time was running out to get legislation passed and demanded action after the Thanksgiving break.

""We know that it's important in December, that we pass the DREAM Act — December of this year when we return from Thanksgiving — because if the House moves, as we think it might politically, it becomes increasingly difficult after the first of the year to take up this issue. We need to do it now and to do it we need bipartisan support in the Senate,"" Durbin said.

Durbin said there are four or five Republicans who would support it, but Democrats need ""10 Republicans who will step up and join us in this effort"" to overcome a filibuster.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , however, said that while the short-term goal was the DREAM Act, the ultimate goal is much broader, but that could wait for the next Senate.

""We have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to,"" Schumer said. ""The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all of them, because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here. And we will be pursuing that in the next Senate.""

Meanwhile, there are a number of other potential immigration pushes in the work on the legal immigration front -- including a potential vote on the EAGLE Act, which would end per-country caps on employment-based visas and has bipartisan support.

The signatories cited polling that they said shows over 60% of midterm voters wanted Congress to focus on securing the border and enforcing immigration law, while less than 10% believe a pathway to citizenship should be at the top of the agenda.

MCCARTHY CALLS ON MAYORKAS TO RESIGN OR POTENTIALLY FACE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: ‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

""We therefore ask that you take all actions necessary to stop these efforts,"" they say.

""We urge you to show the American people that you stand with them by rejecting special interest legislation and instead taking immediate steps to reverse this crisis and restore law and order to our immigration system,"" they say.

The groups previously urged congressional leaders to unite behind a ""flagship"" border security bill to end the crisis at the southern border, which saw more than 2.3 million migrant encounters in FY 2022, and that some lawmakers and officials fear will get worse when Title 42 expulsions end next month.

But before the leaders can get to those negotiations, the signatories say, they must navigate the choppy waters of the lame-duck session.

""Do not allow special interests to take advantage of the lame-duck session to pass their bankrupt immigration agenda and throw average Americans under the bus,"" they say. ""The American people are, after all, the ultimate stakeholders in our immigration system. They have voiced their will and we urge you to respect it.""

Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., the head of the Republican Study Committee recently told Fox News Digital that the party must ""do everything we can to block amnesty.""

Republicans have already been gearing up for a Congress that will likely focus a great deal on the border crisis. GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy led a GOP delegation to the border last week and said that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas must either resign or face a possible impeachment investigation. He has also said called amnesty for illegal immigrants a ""non-starter.""

"Immigration officer union sounds alarm over DHS order for millions of blank work permits, green cards","A union that represents thousands of federal immigration officers is raising alarm after the U.S. government ordered supplies to create millions of blank work permits and green cards, touching off speculation that the Obama administration may be preparing executive action on immigration.

The Associated Press reported last week that the new federal contract proposal from the Homeland Security Department would allow the government to buy enough supplies to make as many as 34 million immigrant work permits and residency cards over the next five years. Though the Obama administration now says the proposal is unrelated to any executive action, the move raised concerns the administration is preparing for a surge of work permit applications from illegal immigrants.

Kenneth Palinkas, the president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, said in a press release Monday that he believes the move indicates the administration is planning to enact “massive unilateral amnesty” after the midterm elections.

“…If you care about your immigration security and your neighborhood security, you must act now to ensure that Congress stops this unilateral amnesty,” he said. “Let your voice be heard and spread the word to your neighbors. We who serve in our nation’s immigration agencies are pleading for your help – don’t let this happen. Express your concern to your Senators and Congressmen before it is too late.”

However, the Obama administration on Tuesday claimed the order is unrelated to any pending executive action. USCIS claims the order pertains only to the Senate-passed immigration bill which never became law.

More On This...

""Solicitations of this nature are frequent practice for USCIS contracts and allow the Agency to be prepared for fluctuations in the number of immigration applications received, which can arise for a number of reasons,"" spokesman Christopher S. Bentley said in a statement. ""For this particular solicitation, USCIS analyzed, during the spring of 2013, the pending comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the U.S. Senate to determine the surge capacity needed. This estimate had nothing to do with immigration relief actions planned by the president.""

Last week, though, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was less clear. Asked if the order was tied to a forthcoming presidential policy, Earnest said: ""I would not suggest that that is an indication that that's what we're preparing to do."" He said those trying to ""read into"" the orders for cards ""are a little too cleverly trying to divine what the president's ultimate conclusion might be.""

But he repeatedly would not say whether the orders were unrelated to a move by the president, claiming these kinds of decisions ""are not micromanaged by the White House.""

The USCIS union represents 12,000 officers of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency responsible for processing visas and other immigration papers. Palinkas said federal immigration officers are already struggling to complete their mission, and the new contract indicates things could get worse.

“Whether it’s the failure to uphold the public charge laws, the abuse of our asylum procedures, the admission of Islamist radicals, or visas for health risks, the taxpayers are being fleeced and public safety is being endangered on a daily basis,” he said.

The U.S. government produces about 3 million work permits and residency identification, known as green cards, annually. The new contract for at least 5 million cards a year would provide the administration with the flexibility to issue far more work permits or green cards even if it chose not to exercise that option.

Obama announced earlier this year that if Congress didn't pass immigration legislation, he would act on his own. After twice postponing a final decision, he said as recently as last month that he would hold off on executive actions until after November's midterm elections.

Justice Department Sues South Carolina Over State's Strict Immigration Law,"The federal government filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to stop implementation of South Carolina's tough new immigration law, arguing that the legislation that requires law officers to check suspects' immigration status is unconstitutional.

Federal officials and state officials had met to discuss the issue a week ago.

The government wants a judge to stop enforcement of the legislation, which requires that officers call federal immigration officials if they suspect someone is in the country illegally following a stop for something else, U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles told The Associated Press.

""The Department of Justice has many important tasks,"" Nettles said. ""Two of those important tasks are the defense of the constitution and ensuring equality is afforded to all.""

The lawsuit filed in federal court names Gov. Nikki Haley as a defendant. A spokesman for the Republican, the daughter of immigrants from India, said the state was forced to pass its own law because there is no strong federal immigration law.

""If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn't have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level,"" Rob Godfrey said. ""But, until they do, we're going to keep fighting in South Carolina to be able to enforce our laws.""

A spokesman for state Attorney General Alan Wilson, who will act as Haley's attorney, said he had not seen the complaint.

South Carolina's law, which takes effect Jan. 1, also mandates that all businesses check their new hires' legal status through a federal online system. Businesses that knowingly violate the law could have their operating licenses revoked.

The law says all law enforcement officers are required to call federal immigration officials if they suspect someone is in the country illegally. The question must follow an arrest or traffic stop for something else. The measure bars officers from holding someone solely on that suspicion. Opponents railed against the measure as encouraging racial profiling.

The law also makes it a felony for someone to make fake photo IDs for illegal residents and creates a new law enforcement unit within the Department of Public Safety to enforce state immigration laws. It also makes it a felony for illegal immigrants to allow themselves to be transported.

Nettles said the law is unconstitutional and violates people's right to due process.

The U.S. Justice Department has been reviewing immigration-related laws passed by several states and is challenging similar laws in Arizona and Alabama. Last week, Nettles met with Wilson on the issue, but no details of that meeting were released.

Assistant attorney general Tony West said Monday the agency continues to review similar laws in Utah, Indiana and Georgia. He quoted Haley saying South Carolina's law would cause illegal immigrants to move elsewhere.

""Pushing undocumented individuals out of one state and into another is simply not a solution to our immigration challenges,"" West said. ""It ultimately creates more problems than it solves.""

Justice department officials said South Carolina's law, like Alabama's and Arizona's, diverts federal resources from high-priority targets, such as terrorism, drug smuggling and gang activity. They contend the laws will result in the harassment and detention of foreign visitors and legal immigrants, as well as U.S. citizens, who can't immediately prove their legal status.

A deputy assistant attorney general said the agency sent a letter to Alabama schools reminding them that children can't be denied enrollment. Unlike the laws in other states, Alabama's required schools to check students' immigration status. That provision, which has been temporarily blocked, would allow the Supreme Court to reconsider a decision that said a kindergarten to high school education must be provided to illegal immigrants.

The Justice Department has set up a hotline and email address for complaints regarding Alabama's law, and officials said they're coordinating with colleagues in other federal agencies -- including the labor, agriculture, education, and health agencies -- to ensure federal money's not being used to discriminate.

In a news release, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said South Carolina's law ""diverts critical law enforcement resources from the most serious threats to public safety and undermines the vital trust between local jurisdictions and the communities they serve, while failing to address the underlying problem: the need for comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the similar laws in other states, several weeks ago sued to block the South Carolina law from taking effect in January.

""It definitely puts a spotlight on the issue and heightens our arguments,"" Andre Segura, an attorney with the ACLU's immigrants' rights project, said Monday.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-sues-south-carolina-over-states-strict-immigration-law,N/A
"Lawmakers question fast track for farm workers in immigration bill, as tempers flare","Lawmakers raised questions Monday about provisions in the proposed immigration overhaul which could create a fast track to legal status for some agriculture workers -- as tempers flared over the separate issue of the Boston bombing and whether it should influence the content of this bill.

Senate Democrats and Republicans, debating the bill at the second hearing held since its introduction, differed over whether illegal immigrants working on U.S. farms should be eligible for a new so-called blue card, which would allow them permanent residence after five years.

Non-farmer workers in the United State illegally would have to wait about twice as long to achieve that status.

Still, the Senate Judiciary Committee debate was again overshadowed and emotionally charged by the Boston Marathon bombings and the legal status of the two Russian-born suspects.

New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said the tragedy should not be an “excuse” for people to delay passage of immigration reform legislation.

“I never said that,” snapped Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, as he banged his gavel.

On Friday, Grassley said the circumstances related to the tragic bombings underscore the “gaps and loopholes” in the country’s immigration system.

Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., began the hearing by saying: “Late last week opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon bombing. … Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous acts of two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hardworking people.”

A bipartisan group of eight senators has been working on immigration reform legislation since January, an effort in part by both parties to reach out to Hispanics, the fastest growing part of the U.S. population.

The legislation was officially introduced last week, and five Senate hearings on the overall issue have been held so far this year. Chamber leaders expect to start submitting amendments in May with a vote this summer.

There are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. And as many as 70 percent of U.S. agricultural workers are in the country illegally.

Roughly 700,000 to 1.1 million illegal agricultural workers would be eligible for the blue card. They first must have at least a two-year work history. And like other applicants, they must pass a criminal background check and pay fines and taxes.

Supporters argue the change is needed in large part because of the high percentage of illegal workers in the industry and Americans won’t do the work.

Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions argued the guidelines for the proposal were crafted as part of a deal between big business and organized labor that has been present as one “best for the United States.”

He also took issue with the argument about “jobs Americans won’t do.”

“I worry about these kinds of things,” he continued. “It seems the agriculture industry is saying, ‘We’re entitled to … these workers.’ ”

Republican Sens. John Cornyn, Texas, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, also raised concerns about how well the overall legislation will improve the tracking of immigrants who overstay their visas.

Cornyn called the existing system essentially “nonfunctional.”

Graham repeated his argument that the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 terror attacks were all students who overstayed their visas.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-question-fast-track-for-farm-workers-in-immigration-bill-as-tempers-flare,N/A
"Left-wing groups attack Biden’s 'dangerous,' 'cruel' immigration policy","Liberal organizations are blasting the Biden administration's new immigration policies as ""dangerous,"" ""cruel,"" ""moving backwards"" and in line with the Trump administration.

Those criticisms came after President Joe Biden pushed a renewed emphasis on southern border security and increased access for asylum-seeking migrants. Biden visited the border for the first time as president on Sunday, which followed an announcement of new border policies Thursday.

Last week, Biden announced that because of a Supreme Court decision, he would continue to use the Title 42 policy that has allowed the government to turn away migrants over fears of spreading COVID-19, even though the White House believes that policy will soon be scrapped. He also announced a tougher stance on border migration, but he sought to find a middle ground by expanding the legal opportunities for migration from countries in Central and South America.

BIDEN RIPPED FOR NOT MEETING WITH MIGRANTS DURING BORDER VISIT: 'HE DID NOT COME TO SEE THIS'

The policy instituted by the administration allows border agents to turn away migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela seeking asylum without authorization. But it will also allow up to 30,000 migrants from those countries to be admitted each month if they have a U.S. financial sponsor, after which they can receive a two-year permit for asylum.

The White House has emphasized that its new asylum rules are not a ban on the process but simply a requirement to set up an appointment with the Department of Homeland Security to arrive at a port of entry to make their claim, which removes the incentive for a migrant to be trafficked by smugglers. The move is seen as an attempt to reach a middle-ground approach at the border where migrants are turned away if they refused to follow a more accessible asylum process.

BORDER PATROL UNION RIPS BIDEN'S BORDER VISIT, SAYS EL PASO CLEANED UP ‘JUST IN TIME’

But the policy announcement Thursday was met with sharp criticism from liberal immigration groups that claim the policy is a ""transit ban"" similar to that of the Trump administration, which was struck down by a federal court prior to the pandemic.

Mary Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center – which has urged to Biden administration to cut funding for and close immigrant detention centers at the southern border – said the president's immigration policies undercut his promise to govern with human decency.

""This administration continues on a dangerous path to replicate some of the worst aspects of the Trump administration’s assaults on the right to asylum,"" McCarthy said. ""After campaigning on human decency, President Biden now makes clear that such decency is not extended to Black, Brown, and Indigenous people in need of protection at our borders.""

TEXAS REPUBLICAN SNUBBED BY BIDEN DURING BORDER VISIT SAYS WHITE HOUSE EXPLANATION 'INSULTING'

The White House said its renewed Venezuela parole process has cut the average number of border encounters by a quarter since its launch. Overall, border encounters have reached historic levels under the Biden administration, with 233,740 in November, according to Customs and Border Control — largely from Central American countries.

Jonathan Blazer, the American Civil Liberties Union’s director of border strategies, said Biden’s promise to increase access to asylum is ""utterly hollow"" in light of the new White House policy that he said ""will put more lives in grave danger.""

""His commitments to people seeking safety will ring utterly hollow if he moves forward in substituting one illegal anti-asylum Trump policy for another,"" Blazer said.

Jeremy McKinney is president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has previously praised the Biden administration for its protection of ""Dreamers"" through regulations that strengthen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. McKinney said the new immigration policies will ""deny legitimate asylum seekers access to a fair and meaningful opportunity to seek protection from persecution"" and infrastructure needed to conduct the asylum process properly still needs to be instituted by Congress.

Anna Gallagher, executive director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, said White House plans on immigration are ""misguided and dangerous"" and that the ""transit ban"" is ""a step backward in the efforts to respect the rights and dignity of migrants."" Biden is a practicing Catholic who often emphasizes Church teachings on welcoming migrants at risk.

EL PASO HOMELESS CAMP CLEANED UP BEFORE BIDEN’S BORDER VISIT

The Biden administration has touted its immigration plan as legal, unlike the Trump administration’s, because it includes measures to expand opportunities for asylum as migrants while unauthorized claims are turned away at the border.

Guerline Jozef, co-founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which praised the Biden administration in December when it extended and redesignated Haiti for Temporary Protected Status, said the asylum policy decision is a continuation of Trump’s legacy.

""We are extremely concerned the administration is returning to some of Trump’s era practice of expelling asylum seekers to Mexico without the opportunity to seek protection and re-introducing an asylum transit ban,"" Jozef said last week. ""We are also extremely concerned that the new parole program will be inaccessible to the most vulnerable amongst us, particularly those en route to the U.S. border who will be ineligible for this program.""

Michele Heisler, the medical director at Physicians for Human Rights, said ""denying safe haven for those seeking asylum is cruel and runs counter to international conventions on the treatment of asylum seekers."" The COVID-19 pandemic, she said, has been used as an excuse to enforce inhumane policies at the border.

""To let Title 42 not only persist, but expand expulsions under the scientifically baseless policy is unconscionable and presents a clear and present threat to the health and human rights of countless asylum seekers,"" Heisler in a statement last week. ""Title 42 policy is one of the most inhumane, racist and xenophobic immigration policies ever implemented at the U.S. southern border.""

"Liberal House Democrats take aim at bipartisan immigration framework, deride ‘assault on asylum seekers’","A group of liberal House Democrats say they will not support a bipartisan immigration framework, which includes a pathway to citizenship for approximately two million illegal immigrants, because of its border security measures that they call an ""assault"" on asylum seekers.

Reps. Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Jose Luis Correa, D-Calif., weighed in on the framework being floated in the Senate that would give two million illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children a pathway to citizenship, combined with increased border security funding.

Created by Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., the proposal marks a last-ditch effort to get an immigration deal through Congress before Republicans take the House early next year and before Title 42 — a public health authority used to expel migrants at the border due to COVID-19 — expires in two weeks.

While the move faces opposition from immigration hawks due to its amnesty for two million illegal immigrants, it is also facing opposition from liberals because of its border security measures, which include a one-year extension of Title 42 and resources for detention and deportation.

BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION FRAMEWORK INCLUDES 14% BORDER PATROL PAY HIKE, VISA RECAPTURE

""We appreciate the ongoing Senate negotiations and recognition to act on the behalf of the nearly 2 million who are DACA recipients or migrants eligible for the program counting on us to ensure protections for Dreamers,"" the three lawmakers said. ""It’s time for Congress to stop playing political games and move forward with meaningful and common sense immigration reform. We are deeply troubled by the Sinema-Tillis framework’s continued assault on asylum seekers.""

Fox News Digital reported this week that border security funding in the framework, which is still fluid, could be upwards of $40 billion and would include a 14% increase in pay for Border Patrol agents, a minimum staffing level of 20,500 agents and investments in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers and immigration judges and courts, which have been facing significant backlogs.

The bill would extend Title 42, with metrics for further extensions, while setting up centers along the border for migrants to be directed to for processing.

On the pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and other illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors, it would cap eligibility for those who have been in the U.S. since 2018, were under 18 when they arrived and were no older than 38 in 2012, and includes other thresholds. It is estimated to protect two million illegal immigrants whom activists call ""Dreamers.""

The lawmakers said that there was a ""moral and legal obligation to guarantee the right to seek asylum to individuals who arrive at our borders.""

""The proposed plan would reinstate the Title 42 expulsion policy while significantly increasing funding for border security. It bolsters a deal to further militarize the border and lacks necessary accountability measures that comprehensive immigration reform would have delivered,"" they say.

They go on to object to the expansion of detention centers and longer jail periods.

SENATORS TILLIS, SINEMA REVIVE TALKS ON POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION DEAL DURING LAME-DUCK SESSION

""This inhumane proposal would also bar [Temporary Protected Status] recipients from receiving green cards,"" they say. Finally, the current proposal creates a lifetime bar for individuals and their families to receive any immigration benefit, including asylum, and harsh sanctions for individuals who fail to appear in court regardless of their fear of persecution.""

""We cannot at this time, in good conscience, support the current framework,"" they say.

The statement highlights how immigration deals face a tightrope between objections to border security on one side from liberals, and objections to pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants from conservatives.

The framework has already faced blistering criticism from immigration hawks, who have blasted it as amnesty cloaked with a ""fig leaf"" of border funding.

Tillis this week sought to push back against conservative criticism of ""amnesty,"" saying a deal was needed in order to stop a new surge in migration at the border when Title 42 ends.

""These are people that came to this country as minors who are now doctors, scientists, teachers, hundreds serving in the military. And I think the American people understand this is very different than this concept of amnesty,"" he said on ""America’s Newsroom.""

""This is going to give them a path, and it's not automatic. They're going to have to work and maintain those highest standards. And for that, we get a closed border, and we shut down the cartels. That seems to me like something worth working on,"" Tillis said.

But time is running out for a deal. Republicans are due to take control of the House in January, and GOP leaders, including Leader Kevin McCarthy, have explicitly ruled out support of ""amnesty.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/liberal-house-democrats-take-aim-bipartisan-immigration-framework-deride-assault-asylum-seekers,N/A
Graham predicts GOP will 'come roaring back' due to Biden's 'radical' immigration policies,"A fired-up Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., railed against President Biden's decision to tap Vice President Kamala Harris to oversee the administration's response to the border crisis in an appearance on ""Fox News Primetime"" Wednesday.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Look at what is happening at the border. It's changing for the worse because President Biden doesn't understand what he is doing when it comes to the border. He has got to put Vice President Harris in charge of cleaning up the mess at the border. I would gladly work with her, but she doesn't understand what has generated this problem. This is not a Trump problem. This is a Biden problem.

It's pretty hard to fix a problem if you don't know what the problem is. So, I think the Republican Party is going to come roaring back, because this radical agenda will not go well with middle America ... The Biden administration did away with the 'Remain in Mexico' policy that Trump had and by the summer, there is going to be at least a million people knocking on our door at the border unless they reinstate Trump policies. We will see if Vice President Harris can figure this out.

Los Angeles County DA Gascon issues directives to avoid ‘adverse immigration consequences’,"Prosecutors in Los Angeles County will now have to weigh the effects charging decisions will have on the immigration status of suspects and are encouraged to seek diversion programs to help avoid deportations, according to a new directive.

The policy from District Attorney George Gascon is another in a long list of progressive measures to overhaul how justice is sought in the nation's largest district attorney's office.

According to the policy, which was obtained by Fox News, alternatives to criminal convictions should be considered, such as avoiding charging for criminal enhancements, which can significantly increase one's prison sentence, ""that would turn an otherwise immigration neutral offense into an immigration damaging one.""

LA COUNTY DA TAKES KEEN INTEREST IN JOHN LEGEND CAR THEFT CASE, PROSECUTOR CALLS IT INSULT TO CRIME VICTIMS

""That's basically saying, ‘We’re going to give you a pass because you used a gun,'"" Eric Siddall, vice president of the Association for Deputy District Attorneys of Los Angeles County, told Fox News Digital.

Anyone under criminal investigation can contact the DA's office to ""present information concerning adverse immigration consequences"" before a case is filed, the measure states, a policy that has been the norm, Siddall said.

""All charging determinations shall be undertaken with the goal of avoiding or mitigating the adverse immigration consequences of a decision when known, possible pr permitting,"" the policy says. ""Under these circumstances and when, consistent with public safety alternatives to filing charges exist, those alternatives shall be pursued.""

The policy further states that pre-trial diversion programs can help deter deportation and other impacts on the immigration status of suspects. Prosecutors are still barred from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The district attorney's office said the policy prioritizes public safety and protects immigrants.

""The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office consulted with our staff, community stakeholders and immigration experts to craft a comprehensive Immigration policy that protects vulnerable victims and prioritizes safety while attempting to avoid overly punitive consequences for the accused,"" Tiffany Blackwell, communications director for the DA's office, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""We believe that we have achieved that result. We will continue to rely upon our staff to provide us with relevant information that will assist in making the determination if alternative sentencing is warranted.""

In cases where a motion has been made to vacate a conviction based on consequences to a suspect's immigration status, prosecutors should consider agreeing with the motion if it's determined that had the consequences been raised during the initial proceedings, a different resolution would have been reached, the policy states.

Siddall, who has frequently criticized Gascon's directives, said the new policy potentially discriminates against native-born suspects because they aren't at risk of deportation and won't be given the same consideration when charging decisions are made.

""That's saying we're going to give better deals to someone because of their immigration status,"" he said.

Gascon has frequently come under fire for measures critics say enable criminals and do little to enhance public safety.

McCarthy rules out amnesty for illegal immigrants after Biden calls at State of the Union,"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Thursday again ruled out any form of amnesty for illegal immigrants already in the U.S., after the Biden administration renewed calls for an inclusion of a pathway to citizenship as part of any immigration deal.

McCarthy spoke to Fox News during his visit to the border in Arizona. He was asked about past statements he has made where he has ruled out any form of pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants as part of an immigration deal. On Thursday he reiterated that stance.

""That is the case, because you can't have immigration reform without first securing the border,"" he said. ""How can you trust? You find people coming one after another and when you ask them why they’ll tell you ‘the president told me to come.’""

The Biden administration and congressional Democrats have called for citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants as part of a reform to fix what they say is a broken immigration system.

MCCARTHY, IN ARIZONA, SAYS ‘NO-ONE BELIEVES’ BIDEN ADMIN'S CLAIM BORDER IS SECURE

The administration unveiled legislation on Biden’s first day in office in 2021. At the core of the bill is an eight-year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the U.S. before Jan. 1 2021 -- as well as immediate green card eligibility for farmworkers, Temporary Protected Status recipients, and some who came to the U.S. as minors, who activists refer to as ""Dreamers.""

Republicans rejected the legislation due to the inclusion of an amnesty for illegal immigrants, and it has shown no sign of picking up Republican support -- but the administration has continued to push the bill, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and President Biden.

""America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts. If we won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, and essential workers,"" Biden said during the State of the Union.

McCarthy made his latest comments during a visit to Cochise County, Arizona , with freshman Reps. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis.,

The lawmakers met with local officials and took an aerial tour of that part of the border. McCarthy dismissed claims by multiple administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Vice President Kamala Harris that the border is ""secure.""

MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS HIT 156,274 IN JANUARY AS BIDEN ADMIN CLAIMS NEW BORDER MEASURES ‘ARE WORKING’

""No-one believes our border is secure, not the border agents, not America,"" he said. ""Mayorkas has no integrity to continue to say that.""

The White House had responded to McCarthy’s visit by accusing him of political grandstanding and cited as progress a recent drop in border numbers between the historic high of 251,000 encounters in December to over 156,000 in January which it attributes to new measures rolled out last month.

""Perhaps seeing this progress will spur House Republicans to do some soul-searching,"" White House spokesman Ian Sams said.

""House Republicans should spend less time on partisan publicity stunts and more time working on solutions.""

Nonprofit that backs defunding ICE to oversee DHS pilot program aiding illegal immigrants,"A nonprofit that called for the defunding and abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is overseeing a Department of Homeland Security pilot program to aid illegal immigrants facing deportation -- including the awarding of grants for the program.

Church World Service was designated earlier this year as the Secretariat and fiduciary agent for DHS’ Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP). The program will provide ""voluntary case management and other services"" to those in immigration removal proceedings, including mental health services, school enrollment, legal aid, ""cultural orientation programs"" and connections to social services -- as well as human trafficking screening and departure planning for those being deported.

The CMPP was authorized by Congress in the 2021 DHS Appropriations Act, which provided $5 million in funding to FEMA for the program. It also set out eligibility for who could sit on the program's National Board, outlining that organizations must be nonprofits, nonpartisan, and have expertise in the asylum and refugee field, detention alternatives and case management.

CWS, a faith-based non-profit that was set up after World War II, is one of the three members that met the criteria and was selected to sit on the board – along with two other non-profits – and has also been designated as its secretariat and fiscal agent. According to documents on the program, CWS ""will be substantially involved in the oversight, implementation, monitoring, and reporting of the program outcomes.""

VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS REMOVED UNDER NEW BIDEN MOVE FEEL BETRAYED BY MEXICO, US

That includes review of implementation plans for subrecipients, managing grant awards, developing the program’s manual, defining data requirements and indicators, approving key personnel, and approving any subgrants. CWS itself does not receive any of the funding nor is it eligible for the grants.

The board and CWS will provide funding awards to service nonprofits and local governments to provide the migrant services -- which can also include language classes, healthcare, transportation, affordable housing and childcare -- to those enrolled in ICE’s Alternatives to Detention program. That program, which has escalated dramatically during the Biden administration, involves more than 300,000 illegal immigrants who are awaiting asylum hearings being tracked by GPS monitoring via ankle bracelets, phone check-ins and/or smart-phone apps. Participants in the pilot will remain part of the ATD monitoring program.

The congressional authorization said the pilot program was being established ""in recognition of ICE's significant lack of referral approvals for enrollment into existing case management services provided by [NGOs] and community partners"" and said explicitly that it was to be executed by nonprofits and ""local communities.""

However, Church World Service has a history of immigration activism, including embracing calls to Abolish ICE entirely or defund it.

LEAKED ICE DOC SHOWS ‘ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION’ PROGRAM HAS ‘LITTLE VALUE’ BUT ‘SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE’

During the Obama administration, CWS demanded that ICE end immigration operations, slamming ""the structural sin of raids and deportations that tear families and communities apart.""

In 2019 it took part in events with Democrats to oppose ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) funding -- including an event where, according to a release, participants including CWS ""urged Congress to divest from oppressive and immoral systems of detention, deportation, and border militarization, including Trump’s wall.""

In 2021, it tweeted ""#AbolishICE"" and ""#FreeThemAll"" about a report that claimed ICE had threatened hunger strikers in facilities with deportation. More recently it has also opposed the expansion of Title 42 expulsions by the Biden administration.

It was one of a number of groups that urged the Biden administration to end its priorization of ""aggravated felonies"" and specifically gang members -- calling for it to ""withdraw any reliance on gang affiliations"" when it laid out its priorities.

""Black, Latinx, and immigrant persons are grossly overrepresented among those labeled gang-affiliated by law enforcement,"" the letter said. ""Criteria for applying such labels are opaque, arbitrary and inflected with racially-biased criteria. The propensity for discriminatory enforcement is particularly alarming in light of increasing evidence of white supremacy ideologies within law enforcement, including gang policing units.""

CWS, which has received funding from activist groups that include George Soros’ Open Society network, is also a member of the Defund Hate group, which is ""committed to divestment"" from ICE and CBP calling them ""agencies that tear apart loved ones and harm our communities.""

""The Defund Hate Campaign has blocked nearly $12 billion from ICE and CBP to date,"" the group says on its website. ""We’re committed to blocking more and redirecting that investment to strengthen families and communities.""

In a response to Fox News Digital, CWS said it has ""long advocated for humane alternatives to detention and against the cruel and inhumane treatment of migrants seeking safety.""

""CMPP is an important step toward the federal government providing the trauma-informed, wholistic case management services that all families seeking safety deserve,"" the group said.

Former acting ICE Director Tony Pham told Fox News Digital that the development is ""another slap in the face to the hardworking workforce over at ICE, especially the enforcement operations group who dedicated their entire career in protecting the United States.""

BIDEN BORDER CHIEF CHRIS MAGNUS FIGHTING SLEW OF ACCUSATIONS OF INCOMPETENCE, DISINTEREST

""I don't understand how they justify doing that. And then turn around and look at the workforce in their face and tell them that they support them as employees of ICE and DHS,"" he said. ""I don't understand it.""

Pham said it isn't unusual to have NGO’s involved in immigration operations, specifically in providing services, but said that putting a group with such positions in an operational role was different, and warned that DHS had turned the operations of the program ""to an organization that doesn't share in the same mission space that the US Department of Homeland Security is supposed to share in.""

""My hopes are that when Congress flips…in November, that the House looks to to call into question the awards of all of these taxpayer dollars, how they were awarded, and, most importantly at them, who they were awarded to,"" he said.

RJ Hauman, head of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) -- which advocates for lower levels of immigration -- said the program should be looked at by Republicans in Congress.

""It’s hard to find a more glaring example of lawlessness and corruption than tapping a Soros-funded, open-borders organization that opposes ICE’s very existence to operate a detention alternative — and not a true alternative with electronic monitoring, but one that provides illegal aliens with services paid for by the American taxpayer and the ability to roam free,"" he said.

""Republicans must nip these practices in the bud if they take back one or both chambers of Congress in November. A border security bill cannot be the only priority. They have to conduct aggressive oversight and apply firm restrictions on every dollar given to DHS, while making sure detention is managed properly.""

Oakland mayor consulted with illegal-immigration activists before tipping off ICE raid,"Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who sparked national outrage when she undermined a federal immigration raid last month, worked with illegal-immigration activists before she warned the public about the raid-- a move that ICE said led to hundreds of illegals evading detention.

Schaaf took to Twitter to warn the public about the raid, and has stood by her decision despite a number of hardened criminals being caught -- and ICE officials warning that potentially hundreds of other criminals escaped as a consequence of the tipoff.

""It is Oakland’s legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws,"" Schaaf said in a statement last month. ""We believe our community is safer when families stay together.""

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH SEX, ROBBERY CONVICTIONS AMONG THOSE WHO EVADED CAPTURE AFTER DEM MAYOR'S WARNING



Her move sparked anger not just from ICE officials, but also the Trump administration. The Justice Department is currently conducting a review of Schaaf's actions.



“What happened in Oakland was a disgrace to our nation,” President Donald Trump said in California on Tuesday.



KPIX5 reports that Schaaf was in touch with Centro Legal de la Raza just hours before the announcement, giving her information on what employers should do in the case of an ICE raid.



That group, which did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News, is a nonprofit with a focus on providing legal services to those in the country illegally. It also appears to act as an advocacy group for illegal immigrants -- printing an “ICE Activity Hotline” on its website.

'ANGEL FAMILIES' WANT TO SEE OAKLAND MAYOR PROSECUTED FOR THWARTING ICE RAIDS

""Centro Legal has been at the forefront of efforts to curtail unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities in order to prevent unjust deportations and keep immigrant families together,"" the group's website says. It does not appear to be affiliated with UnidosUS -- formerly the National Council of La Raza.



According to KPIX5, Schaaf also spoke with a Catholic priest at St. Jarlath’s Church and Emma Paulino at Oakland Community Organizations. Paulino appeared with Schaaf at a press conference warning of the raid.

""It is important for us to understand that sometimes what ICE is doing with these tactics is to try and paralyze our communities,"" she said.

Paulino told Fox News Friday that the conversations were about assessing whether or not to share the information with the community in the first place, and then how to do so in a way that did not create panic.

""It was about if we should share what we know and how to share that information in a responsible way so to not create panic in the community,"" she said. ""People live in fear already.""

KPIX5 reports that the emails also show that the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, received a message saying, “Important Alert! Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26” and, “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”

A spokesman for Schaaf told Fox News that she consulted “with several leaders and groups representing our immigrant community before she made her public comments.”

“She mentioned it in her initial press release and in numerous public statements after; it’s well known that she conferred with several people before making her decision,” he said.



He also said that she did not warn businesses, although added that “it appears those who she consulted with may have shared the information with business owners in an attempt to make sure the owners knew their obligations and responsibilities under state law.”



Families of victims of illegal immigrant crime have expressed their anger at Schaaf’s actions, calling for her to be prosecuted, as have groups which lobby for less migration into the U.S.



“As far as Libby Schaaf is concerned, what she did is nothing short of obstruction of justice,” said Ira Mehlman, of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

“She is not compelled to assist ICE in doing its job, but she certainly has no right to interfere with ICE carrying out its lawful duties,"" he said. ""In our view, the U.S. Department of Justice should look into the matter and prosecute her for obstruction if the circumstances warrant legal action.”

But amid the national controversty, Paulino told Fox News that Schaaf's stance was getting a very positive reception in Oakland.

""People are really supportive of her because she took a stand,"" she said. ""She is serving the people who elected her.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oakland-mayor-consulted-with-illegal-immigration-activists-before-tipping-off-ice-raid,N/A
"Obama says immigration reform 'within our grasp,' key senator raises concern with plan","President Obama said Tuesday that ""now's the time"" for immigration reform, using an address in Las Vegas to try and energize renewed talks in Congress toward comprehensive legislation.

""I'm here today because the time has come for common-sense comprehensive immigration reform,"" Obama said.

The president, setting out to achieve an immigration overhaul where many before him have failed, was running into trouble even before he gave his address. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of four Republican senators involved in a bipartisan effort to craft immigration legislation, earlier in the day blasted Obama for opposing a requirement to shore up border security before legalizing up to 11 million illegal immigrants.

Obama's speech, and a separate fact sheet handed out by the White House, made clear that the administration does not want to link the path to citizenship to border enforcement.

The president said Tuesday that in order for immigration reform to work, ""It must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.""

The comment, albeit subtle, was an apparent reference to a provision in the Senate blueprint that would not let illegal immigrants seek citizenship until border security is strengthened. Obama said that his conditions would only involve the illegal immigrants themselves -- he said that they would have to submit to a background check, pay back taxes and fines, learn English and get in the back of the line in order to apply.

The president described his plan as ""earned citizenship.""

Obama claimed a ""broad consensus"" was emerging on the issue itself, calling the plan outlined by Rubio and others ""very much in line"" with his own -- aside from the path-to-citizenship provision. ""For the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together,"" he said, calling legislation ""within our grasp.""

He said any plan should include the path to citizenship, but also a crackdown on employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers -- and a better system for verifying the status of those workers. He also called for streamlining the legal immigration system, providing visas for foreign entrepreneurs and retaining sought-after science and math graduate students.

The president has run into complaints from conservatives that his plan is tantamount to ""amnesty.""

But the most problematic objection so far has come from Rubio -- a prominent Hispanic conservative who is vital to the bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill.

Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Rubio insisted that illegal immigrants not be allowed to obtain green cards -- let alone citizenship -- ""until the enforcement stuff is in place.""

""I think that would be a terrible mistake,"" Rubio told Fox News. ""We have a bipartisan group of senators that have agreed to that. For the president to try to move the goalposts on that specific requirement, as an example, does not bode well in terms of what his role's going to be in this or the outcome.""

He said: ""If that's not in the bill, I won't support it.""

Obama stressed Tuesday that if Congress cannot move forward ""in a timely fashion,"" he will submit a proposal drafted by the White House.

Amid the exchanges, Republicans congressional leaders expressed a willingness to debate the issue while cautioning against Obama getting too involved.

""There are a lot of ideas about how best to fix our broken immigration system,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. ""Any solution should be a bipartisan one, and we hope the president is careful not to drag the debate to the left and ultimately disrupt the difficult work that is ahead in the House and Senate.""

The issue of immigration reform was put on the back burner during Obama's first term -- overtaken by debate over health care legislation and economic measures. But along with gun control, it is one of the top items on his second-term domestic agenda.

The eight U.S. senators got ahead of him Monday, unveiling a blueprint that calls for, among other things, a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.

But White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president ""welcomes"" the proposal, saying it represents the ""bipartisan support coalescing"" behind certain principles of immigration reform.

Despite the difference over the path to legal status, an Obama administration official told Fox News the senators' plan is on a trajectory that mirrors Obama's immigration plan in many ways, and that the White House is willing to let the group take the lead.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the eight senators, called the new proposal a ""major breakthrough"" and said he hopes to turn it into legislation by March -- with the goal of passing something out of the Senate ""by late spring or summer.""

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., standing beside him, claimed 2013 is the ""best chance"" lawmakers will have to tackle immigration for years.

Even so, the proposed pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants drew immediate criticism from others on Capitol Hill.

""No one should be surprised that individuals who have supported amnesty in the past still support amnesty,"" Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said. ""By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.""

The eight senators who unveiled the new principles are Democrats Schumer, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado; and Republicans McCain, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona.

The Senate framework would also require those here illegally to pass background checks and pay fines and taxes in order to qualify for a ""probationary legal status"" that would allow them to live and work here -- but not qualify for federal benefits -- before being able to apply for permanent residency, a critical step toward citizenship. Once they are allowed to apply they would do so behind everyone else already waiting for a green card within the current immigration system.

Senators also want to reform the legal immigration system, including awarding green cards to immigrants who obtain advanced degrees in science, math, technology or engineering from an American university.

The principles released Monday are outlined on just over four pages, leaving plenty of details to fill in.

"Obama suspends deportation for thousands of illegals, tells GOP to pass DREAM Act","President Obama said Friday the United States will stop deporting hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants and give them work permits, a move praised fellow Democrats but criticized by Republicans on Capitol Hill who said the administration has side-stepped the country’s legislative process.

The executive order will apply to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. before they were 16 and are younger than 30. They also must have no major criminal offenses, have been in the country for at least five continuous years, have graduated from a U.S. high school or have earned a GED, or served in the military.

Individuals who have been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or three or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are not eligible to be considered for deferred action under the new process.

“These are young people who study in our schools and play on our playgrounds,” the president said. “They are Americans in every single way but one – on paper.”

Those now eligible also can apply for a work permit that will be good for two years with no limits on how many times it can be renewed.

The change is expected to impact roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants.

The election-year announcement was met with surprise and question by several GOP lawmakers.

“This is another example of executive overreach,” Florida GOP Rep. Allen West told Fox News.

West said he just learned about the policy change Friday morning and that such a move should have come through legislation on Capitol Hill where it could be debated.

“That’s how we do business in the United States,” said West, R; Fla.

New York GOP Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, vowed an “immediate review"" into the possibility that the Department Of Homeland Security will direct U.S. Border Patrol agents to conduct selective enforcement.

GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said the president's order makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult.

""If I'm elected president, we'll do our best to have the long-term solution,"" he said.

Obama suggested he ordered the policy change because Capitol Hill Republicans have blocked the so-called DREAM Act, buts said the lawmakers still have time to pass such legislation.

“I’ve said this time and again to Congress,” the president said at the Rose Garden press conference. “Send me the DREAM Act, put it on my desk, and I’ll sign it.”

In urging Congress to pass the legislation, the president said his change was “stop gap” and not “a permanent fix.”



The president also made clear he change was not amnesty, immunity or a path to citizenship.

The policy is similar to one by Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio in that it is an alternative to the DREAM Act. However, the first-term senator did not support the president’s order.

“Today’s announcement will be welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer, but it is a short-term answer to a long term problem,” Rubio said. “And by once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long term one.”

The president was briefly interrupted by a reporter who asked: ""Mr. President, why do you favor foreign workers over Americans?""

Obama sternly told the reporter – identified as Neil Munro of The Daily Caller – not to interrupt.

“Excuse me, sir, but it’s not time for questions,"" Obama responded.

“Are you going to take questions?” Munro asked.

“Not while I’m speaking.” Obama said.

The reporter later said he though the president was finished talking.

Earlier in the day, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the change takes effect immediately and is needed to ensure enforcement resources are not expended on “low-priority cases.”

“Young people brought to U.S. by no fault of their own and meet several criteria no longer are removed from country or entered into removal proceedings,” Napolitano said in a conference call with reporters.

The policy change was reported first by the Associated Press.

The move comes in an election year in which the Hispanic vote could be critical in swing states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida.

While Obama has support from a majority of Hispanic voters, Latino enthusiasm for the president has been tempered by the slow economic recovery, his inability to win congressional support for a broad overhaul of immigration laws and by his administration's aggressive deportation policy.

Romney and many Republican lawmakers want tighter border security measures before considering changes in immigration law. Romney opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college but has said he would do so for those who serve in the armed forces.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last month found Obama leading Romney among Hispanic voters 61 percent to 27 percent. But his administration's deportation policies have come under fire, and Latino leaders have raised the subject in private meetings with the president. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported a record 396,906 people and is expected to deport about 400,000 this year.

Under the administration’s plan, immigrants whose deportation cases are pending in immigration court will have to prove their eligibility for a reprieve to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which will begin dealing with such cases in 60 days. Any immigrant who already has a deportation order and those who never have been encountered by immigration authorities will deal with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Last year, Napolitano announced plans to review about 300,000 pending deportation cases and indefinitely suspend those that didn't meet department priorities. So far, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reviewed more than 232,000 cases and decided to stop working on about 20,000. About 4,000 of those 20,000 have opted to keep fighting in court to stay in the United States legally. For the people who opted to close their cases, work permits are not guaranteed.

"Republicans, Democrats warn end of Title 42 will bring immigration disaster","Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are warning that U.S. border authorities are not prepared for the surge in migration that will surely come if President Biden's administration moves forward with ending Title 42.

The Biden administration plans to lift Title 42 on Wednesday, ending a border policy enacted under former President Donald Trump that allows for the deportation of the vast majority of migrants amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans have warned for months that ending the policy would only worsen the crisis at the border. The U.S. Border Patrol had a record 230,000 encounters with migrants in October alone, breaking the previous record set in September.

""Whether it’s COVID or some other issue, when you have people coming across the globe without knowing at all what their health status is, that almost by definition is a public health risk. There’s every reason to keep that in place,"" Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott argued to ABC on Sunday, adding that there would be ""total chaos"" at the border if Title 42 ended.

Many moderate Democrats are also beginning to sound the alarm, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, according to the Washington Post.

IMMIGRATION BILL TO ABOLISH PER-COUNTRY GREEN CARD CAPS PULLED AMID BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION

TOP CONSERVATIVE GROUP WARNS OF CHINESE SECURITY RISK IN KEY IMMIGRATION BILL, URGES ‘NO’ VOTE

""We have a crisis of the border. Everyone can see that,"" Manchin told CBS News on Sunday. ""I think everyone realizes that something has to be done. It needs to be extended until we can get really, truly immigration reform. Immigration reform will not happen in our country until we all come on both sides of the aisle.""

Title 42 is set to expire on Dec. 20, leaving Biden only a brief window of time to extend the policy. There have been several court challenges seeking to block its expiration, but none have been successful.

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday not to keep the policy in place, and Biden's White House has argued that the true solution is for Congress to implement immigration reform.

Title 42 was a major factor in turning away 2.5 million migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. since March, but the Biden administration argues its end will not make the border insecure.

""To be clear: the lifting of the Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants,"" assistant press secretary Abdullah Hasan told Fox News Digital.

""We will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws and work to expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration,"" Hasan added. ""We have a robust effort underway to manage the border in a safe, orderly and humane way when Title 42 lifts as required by court order. Instead of playing political games, Republican officials should provide the funding the president requested for border security and management, and pass the comprehensive immigration reform measures he proposed so we can finally have a modernized immigration system that works.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-democrats-warn-end-title-42-will-bring-immigration-disaster,N/A
Republicans press new immigration tactic: Obama won't enforce border security,"Congressional Republicans pressed ahead Sunday with their emerging stance on immigration reform, arguing President Obama delaying the implementation of his health care law raises major concerns about whether he’ll enforce border security measures in immigration laws.

“We cannot fix with laws things the president refuses to do,” Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told “Fox News Sunday.”

Though well known as one the House’s most conservative members, King has emerged as perhaps the chamber’s most vocal opponent of the Senate’s immigration bill, which includes $40 billion toward additional security along the U.S.-Mexico border and a path to citizenship for at least some of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the United States.

House Republicans appeared to emerge with the new strategy after a closed-door meeting Wednesday, which was preceded by the Obama administration saying earlier this month that it will delay the start of the so-called employer mandate part of the president’s signature health care law until after the 2014 elections.

“If the president can selectively enforce ObamaCare, what’s to say he cannot selectively enforce border security?” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said ahead of the meeting.

New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel urged King and other House members opposed to existing immigration reform legislation not to use the president’s delay on ObamaCare -- and arguments his administration currently doesn’t enforce border security -- to block immigration reform.

“You shouldn’t use this as an excuse,” he told Fox News, pointing out 68 of the Senate’s 100 members agreed this summer to reform legislation and that President George W. Bush and the majority of Americans want the federal government to fix the country’s broken immigration system.

He also said Democrats would work with House Republicans if they wanted to approach immigration reform by passing the legislation in pieces.

King also argued Sunday that it was a “mistake” to think the 2012 presidential election in which Obama won roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote was a referendum on immigration.

Democrats want immigration for a “political issue,” he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-press-new-immigration-tactic-obama-wont-enforce-border-security,N/A
Republicans rip Obama immigration plan; Rubio calls it 'dead on arrival',"Congressional Republicans on Sunday criticized a White House plan on immigration reform that allows illegal immigrants to become legal, permanent residents within eight years -- saying Congress will never pass such a proposal and questioning President Obama’s intent.

Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul said the plan is untenable and so outside of what the country wants that it suggests Obama is not sincere about passing immigration reform.

“The president is torpedoing his own plan,” Paul told “Fox News Sunday.” “It shows me he is really not serious. … The bill won’t pass.”

The draft immigration bill being circulated by the White House also includes plans for a new visa for illegal immigrants living in the United States, as first reported by USA Today.

Obama's bill would create a ""Lawful Prospective Immigrant"" visa for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country. The bill includes more security funding and requires business owners to adopt a system for verifying the immigration status of new hires within four years, the newspaper said.

More On This...

On Saturday, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio called the White House proposal ""half-baked and seriously flawed.""

Rubio -- part of an eight-member, bipartisan Senate panel working on an immigration reform bill -- also said the proposal was disappointing to those “working on serious solutions” and repeats failures of past legislation.

He said the White House also erred in not seeking input from Republican lawmakers.

""If actually proposed, the president's bill would be dead on arrival in Congress, leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for years to come,"" Rubio said in a statement.

Obama Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday the White House is working with members and staffers of the so-called “Gang of Eight” and that the White House hasn’t proposed anything so far to Capitol Hill on immigration.

McDonough declined to answer repeated questions on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about why the White House didn’t first consult Rubio, consider the key Republican on the issue.

“We are doing exactly what we said we would do, which is we will be prepared in the event that the bipartisan talks on the Hill … do not work out,” he told NBC.

USA Today also reported that the bill would require that immigrants pass a criminal background check, submit biometric information and pay fees to qualify for the new visa.

Immigrants who served more than a year in prison for a criminal conviction or were convicted of three or more crimes and were sentenced to a total of 90 days in jail would not be eligible. Crimes committed in other countries that would bar immigrants from legally entering the country would also be ineligible.

Those immigrants facing deportation would be eligible to apply for the visa, the newspaper reported. Immigrants would be eligible to apply for a green card within eight years, if they learn English and U.S. history and government, and they would later be eligible to become U.S. citizens.

House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan took back the praise he gave Obama for his State of the Union remarks on immigration.

“Putting these details out without a guest worker program, without addressing future flow, by giving advantage to those who cut in front of line for immigrants who came here legally, not dealing with border security adequately, that tells us that he's looking for a partisan advantage and not a bipartisan solution,” The Wisconsin Republican told ABC’s “This Week.”

Last month, the group of senators announced they had agreed on the general outline of an immigration plan.

Obama has said he would not submit his own legislation to Congress so long as law makers acted ""in a timely manner."" If they failed, he said, ""I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.""

Paul also told Fox he will submit an amendment to the upcoming Senate bill calling for a General Accounting Office report stating U.S. borders are secure that must be periodically updated.

Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, said Saturday that Obama still supports a bipartisan effort to craft a comprehensive immigration bill. ""While the president has made clear he will move forward if Congress fails to act, progress continues to be made and the administration has not prepared a final bill to submit,"" he said in a statement.

Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, described the draft bill as a ""very moderate"" proposal. While the path to citizenship was welcomed by Noorani, he said not enough attention was being paid to future immigration.

""Commonsense immigration reform must include a functioning immigration system for the future,"" Noorani said in a statement. ""Reform does not begin and end with citizenship and enforcement alone.""

Ron DeSantis sends two planes of illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard,"EXCLUSIVE: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis followed through on his promise to drop off illegal immigrants in progressive states, sending two planes full of migrants to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday.

A video provided to Fox News Digital shows the migrants deboarding the planes at Martha’s Vineyard Airport in Massachusetts.

""Yes, Florida can confirm the two planes with illegal immigrants that arrived in Martha’s Vineyard today were part of the state’s relocation program to transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary destinations,"" the governor’s communications director, Taryn Fenske, told Fox News Digital.

FLORIDA GOV. DESANTIS SAYS FUNDS ARE IN PLACE TO BUS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS OUT OF HIS STATE

""States like Massachusetts, New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as ‘sanctuary states’ and support for the Biden administration’s open border policies,"" she said.

""As you may know, in this past legislative session the Florida legislature appropriated $12 million to implement a program to facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants from this state consistent with federal law,"" she said, later adding that the state's ""immigration relocation program targets both human smugglers found in the state, but also preempts others from coming to Florida.""

The office of Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker responded to an after-hours email from Fox News Digital, saying it was aware of the situation and that the arrivals were provided short-term shelter.

""The Baker-Polito Administration is in touch with local officials regarding the arrival of migrants in Martha’s Vineyard,"" Terry MacCormack, Baker's press secretary, wrote. ""At this time, short-term shelter services are being provided by local officials, and the Administration will continue to support those efforts.""

Fox News Digital reported in April that Florida’s budget since approved by the state legislature included $12 million for the Florida Department of Transportation to remove illegal immigrants from the state and relocate them.

Martha's Vineyard is famously known as a playground of rich progressives, including former President Barack Obama, who bought a multimillion-dollar house there in 2019.

DeSantis, a Republican, proposed Delaware or Martha’s Vineyard as a destination for such migrants, but his office explained at the time that they could also be sent ""to other 'progressive' states whose governors endorse blatant violations of federal immigration law.""

TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT DIRECTS USE OF BUSES TO DROP OFF MIGRANTS AT STEPS OF CAPITOL IN DC

""It is not the responsibility of Floridians to subsidize aliens to reside in our state unlawfully; we did not consent to Biden’s open-borders agenda,"" the governor’s office said at the time.

In November, DeSantis said dozens of migrant flights landed in Florida at the behest of the Biden administration, and he threatened at that time to send them to Delaware on buses.

Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began sending thousands of illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C., in April as the migrant crisis overwhelmed border states. In August, buses from Texas started heading to New York City and Chicago. Arizona has also sent buses to Washington.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who was put in charge of tackling the border crisis by President Biden shortly after they assumed office in 2021, sparked a firestorm this week after she twice declared the U.S. southern border is ""secure"" while administration officials estimate an average of 55,000 so-called ""gotaways"" each month — illegal immigrants who successfully make it into the country without being detained.

"Marco Rubio rejects Biden immigration bill, calls it ‘blanket amnesty’","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Tuesday rejected an immigration proposal by President Biden, describing its call for an 8-year pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants as a ""blanket amnesty.""

In a statement describing the bill as a ""non-starter,"" Rubio said that before dealing with immigration, Biden and Congress should deal with COVID-19, the economy and the threat from China.

NIKKI HALEY SAYS BIDEN IMMIGRATION BILL WILL 'UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW'

""America should always welcome immigrants who want to become Americans. But we need laws that decide who and how many people can come here, and those laws must be followed and enforced,"" he said.

""There are many issues I think we can work cooperatively with President-elect Biden, but a blanket amnesty for people who are here unlawfully isn’t going to be one of them,"" he said.

Biden is proposing an 8-year pathway for the millions of illegal immigrants in the country. It also includes some limited border security measures as well as funding for countries south of the border to stop root causes of migration.

Democrats have control of the House, Senate and White House and will likely be united in their support of the legislation. However, in the Senate, the bill will need 10 Republican votes to pass and be sent to Biden’s desk.

Rubio was one of the members of the 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" that sought to find a compromise immigration reform. That effort ultimately failed. Rubio’s dismissal of the legislation, at least in its current form, suggests that the bill will struggle to gain GOP support.

BIDEN DHS NOMINEE MAYORKAS SAYS ICE SHOULD NOT BE DEFUNDED, DESPITE LIBERAL CALLS

The effort by Democrats to pass the bill in the Senate is being led by Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., another member of the 2013 ""Gang of Eight."" He said in a statement Wednesday that there is a ""moral and economic imperative to get this done.""

""This plan is not only about fixing our broken immigration system, but building a better one that reunites families, brings the undocumented community out of the shadows and on a path to citizenship, stands up for human rights, addresses root causes of migration, and includes a smart border security strategy,"" he said.

However, earlier in the week, Menendez told The Washington Post that the Biden proposal was ""definitely"" more liberal than the 2013 compromise, which included more muscular border security measures.

Rubio’s statement is one of a number of statements by Republicans that the proposal will face steep GOP opposition. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Tuesday blocked the quick consideration of the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas -- Biden’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security -- citing the immigration proposal, as well as Mayorkas’ answers on border security.

"Salvadoran president tells Tucker: Mass immigration 'not profitable,' 'feeding on dependency'","Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that his government is as concerned about the illegal immigration crisis at the southern border as many people in America.

Bukele, a member of the center-right Nueva Ideas Party, told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" mass emigration from Latin American countries to the United States is grounded in two concerns: economic opportunity and security.

Bukele said that in his nearly two years in office he has worked to improve both conditions for the people of El Salvador, but that there is much more ground to make up. He told Carlson that his government's improvements are however borne out in the observation that there are much fewer ""caravans"" of migrants heading through Mexico from El Salvador than from neighboring Honduras or Guatemala.

""It is obvious, our country has failed to provide two basic things which are the two main drivers of immigration which are the lack of economic opportunity and a lack of security,"" he said. ""[But] most people don't want to leave their country. They like their country, their food, weather, it is their country. And they have their family members here and their friends.""

He said that the U.S. had become a draw for many of his citizens because it offered both key elements he mentioned prior.

Bukele however warned that mass immigration is ""not profitable"" for either country involved.

""First, it is immoral -- you need to provide for your people. But, you also have an economic issue. If you send hardworking people and talented people and people who want to risk it just to go to work, you want to keep them here because those will be the drivers of your economy. You don't want them there so that they can send a remittance, which would be a small portion of what they would earn and produce; you want them to produce here.""

""You are talking about problems that have been here in El Salvador and a lot of countries in Latin America for decades. This immigration thing is just feeding on dependency on immigration in the countries that drive it. So it is not good for the United States, and it is not good for El Salvador.""

Bukele added that countries with what he characterized as net exports of people through immigration are hurt economically by that movement.

Instead of exporting goods and services, he said, by exporting potential workers, they will end up basing part of their economy on the ""remittances"" sent by immigrants who become employed in the United States back to their family in Latin America.

""The best thing for both of us is to keep our people here and provide for our people right here in our country. That is what people here want,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/salvadoran-president-tells-tucker-mass-immigration-not-profitable-feeding-on-dependency,N/A
"Sen. Britt to introduce four sweeping immigration measures, call on Senate to acknowledge crisis at the border","EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., will introduce four pieces of legislation Thursday aimed at ""securing and sealing"" the southern border and protecting American communities amid an unprecedented influx of migrants and drugs into the United States.

Britt, who was overwhelmingly elected last November to serve as the Yellowhammer State's junior senator, will introduce a straightforward resolution calling on the Senate to acknowledge that the current situation at the southern border amounts to a crisis. The resolution has support from 18 of Britt's GOP Senate colleagues.

""We have to acknowledge the problem before we can solve it, but President Biden hasn’t even been willing to do that,"" Britt said of the resolution in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""With a record number of Americans dying from fentanyl poisoning, record deaths among migrants attempting to cross the border, record profits by the cartels, and a record amount of people on the terrorism watchlist apprehended at the border, there is no doubt that this is a crisis unlike which we have ever seen.""

In addition to the resolution, Britt will also introduce three measures – the Keep Our Communities Safe Act, the Asylum Abuse Reduction Act, and the WALL Act – in an effort to strengthen border protection measures and curb the flow of illegal migrants into American neighborhoods.

BORDER PATROL NABBED 17 PEOPLE ON FBI TERROR WATCH LIST AT SOUTHERN BORDER IN DECEMBER

The Keep Our Communities Safe Act – according to Britt's office – would put an end to the Obama-Biden ""catch-and-release"" policy, which refers to the federal government's release of migrants into the U.S. interior while they await court proceedings.

Under current law, migrants are to be released from custody into the U.S. after six months if no other country accepts them for deportation. When individuals arrive in the United States, either at ports of entry, or when caught crossing the border illegally, they are considered ""arriving aliens"" under immigration laws. Under U.S. code, those individuals are required to be detained until a decision is made whether they are to be admitted to the country.

The measure, which has received support from 19 GOP senators, would close the loophole preventing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from detaining illegal immigrants for more than six months based on a number of factors, including when ""their release would threaten the safety of the community and the alien either is an aggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence,"" if they ""have a highly contagious disease,"" or if their ""release would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.""

The Asylum Abuse Reduction Act aims to tackle a number of issues related to the asylum process and enhance criminal consequences for illegal immigrants who fail to appear for immigration court.

Britt's office said the four-pronged measure – backed by 10 other GOP senators – would require individuals seeking asylum to have their preliminary screening with an immigration officer by telephone or in person at an embassy or consulate outside the United States prior to being considered for admittance for asylum purposes.

The bill would also impose more heavy-handed criminal punishments by implementing a bench warrant for illegal immigrants who evade court proceedings. Those warrants, for instance, would notify officers who stop an illegal immigrant for an unrelated offense that the individual has violated immigration law.

Additionally, the legislation aims to prevent family separation and codifies a Trump-era plan that prohibits migrants from claiming asylum in the United Sates if they have not sought the same protections in other countries prior to their arrival in the United States.

""It is critical that we end incentives and loopholes that are encouraging immigrants to break the law and game the system,"" Britt said. ""The status quo has led to a tidal wave of people coming across our border. It is imperative that we fix the process to eliminate asylum abuse and ensure legitimate asylum claimants are processed in a timely fashion.""

The WALL Act, which has five GOP co-sponsors, would expend funds to complete the construction of the Trump administration's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

BORDER AGENTS CONFIRM 1.2 MILLION ‘GOTAWAY’ MIGRANTS UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

Specifically, the legislation would pay for the completion of the wall by eliminating the entitlement benefits and tax credits that illegal immigrants are using and placing $3,000 minimum fines on those who illegally enter into the United States. The bill also calls for $300 fines to be placed on those working and filing taxes in the U.S.

Referring to the bill as a ""commonsense measure,"" Britt highlighted the need for physical infrastructure, technology, equipment, and personnel at the southern border.

""An invaluable piece of this equation is finishing the wall on our southern border,"" she said. ""This is a commonsense measure that funds this construction without raising taxes on American citizens or adding to the national debt.""

Last month, U.S. border agents confirmed that 1.2 million illegal migrants ""got away"" from authorities while crossing the border under President Biden's administration. The first half of Biden's four-year term saw monthly border encounters rise from 101,000 in February 2021 to 251,000 in December 2022, according to CBP statistics.

""There is an unprecedented humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border,"" Britt told Fox. ""This is a direct, avoidable result of the Biden administration’s dangerously weak policies. Hardworking parents across our nation want their children to grow up in safe, strong communities, so that they can reach their full potential and live their American Dream. This legislation would help secure that dream for families in every corner of our country.""

Last month, Britt, the first female elected to the Senate from Alabama, traveled to the southern border for a firsthand look at the crisis.

""Joe Biden hasn’t just failed to secure the border – he’s willfully sabotaged it,"" said Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, who co-sponsored three of the measures being introduced by Britt. ""His political games have cost American wages, taxes, and lives.""

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) saw an estimated 718,000 border encounters in the first 100 days of fiscal year 2023, which began Oct. 1. In December, Border Patrol agents stopped 17 people on the FBI’s terror watch list at the southern border, bringing the total of individuals arrested at the southern border to 38 already for the current fiscal year.

Regarding the measures being introduced Thursday, Idaho GOP Sen. James Risch, a co-sponsor of all four pieces of legislation from Britt, said: ""Four and a half million illegal immigrants, more than double the population of Idaho, have been encountered at the southern border since President Biden took office. This record-breaking number fails to account for the gotaways, illicit drugs, and human smuggling that has also poured into communities across the country.""

""President Biden’s southern border is a drug crisis, a humanitarian crisis, and a national security crisis. It’s time to reverse course and secure the border by building the wall, reinstating the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy, and ending ‘catch and release,'"" he added.

Similarly, South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, who is also a co-sponsor of each bill set to be introduced by Britt Tuesday, said: ""Our immigration system has been broken for years, but the Biden administration’s policies have created a crisis at our southern border. Congress must take action if we are ever to find a long-term solution to strengthen our borders, fix the current border crisis and make certain our legal immigration system adequately meets our workforce needs.""

""I am pleased to join Senator Britt on these bills, which are a step in the right direction to protecting against illegal immigration and stopping those who wish to do us harm,"" he added. ""I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to eliminate the crisis once and for all.""

Source: Obama to announce 10-point immigration plan via exec action as early as next week,"EXCLUSIVE: President Obama is planning to unveil a 10-part plan for overhauling U.S. immigration policy via executive action -- including suspending deportations for millions -- as early as next Friday, a source close to the White House told Fox News.

The president's plans were contained in a draft proposal from a U.S. government agency. The source said the plan could be announced as early as Nov. 21, though the date might slip a few days pending final White House approval.

Obama was briefed at the White House by Homeland Security officials before leaving on his Asia-Pacific trip last week, Fox News has learned.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama in Burma Thursday that the president had not made a final decision on any executive actions concerning immigration and would not announce any until he returned to Washington.

The draft plan, though, contains 10 initiatives that span everything from boosting border security to improving pay for immigration officers.

But the most controversial pertain to the millions who could get a deportation reprieve under what is known as ""deferred action.""

The plan calls for expanding deferred action for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- but also for the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.

The latter could allow upwards of 4.5 million illegal immigrant adults with U.S.-born children to stay, according to estimates.

Critics in the Senate say those who receive deferred action, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, receive work authorization in the United States, Social Security numbers and government-issued IDs.

Another portion that is sure to cause consternation among anti-""amnesty"" lawmakers is a plan to expand deferred action for young people. In June 2012, Obama created such a program for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, entered before June 2007 and were under 31 as of June 2012. The change would expand that to cover anyone who entered before they were 16, and change the cut-off from June 2007 to Jan. 1, 2010. This is estimated to make nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants eligible.

One of the architects for the president's planned executive actions at DHS is Esther Olavarria, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's former top immigration lawyer.

Under the changes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also would see a pay raise in order to ""increase morale"" within the ICE workforce.

DHS also is planning to ""promote"" the new naturalization process by giving a 50 percent discount on the first 10,000 applicants who come forward, with the exception of those who have income levels above 200 percent of the poverty level.

Tech jobs though a State Department immigrant visa program would offer another half-million immigrants a path to citizenship. This would include their spouses as well.

The other measures include calls to revise removal priorities to target serious criminals for deportation and end the program known as ""Secure Communities"" and start a new program.

The planning comes as immigrant advocates urge Obama to act. As lawmakers returned for a lame-duck session, Democrats in Congress on Wednesday implored Obama to take executive action.

""We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,"" said Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said: ""I join with my colleagues in urging the president to take action. What he needs to do is give immediate relief to families who are being wrenched apart and living in fear.""

Angela Maria Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, touted executive action as a ""tried and true component of immigration policy used by 11 presidents, 39 times in the last 60 years.""

She said for many undocumented immigrants who have been here for years, ""there is no line for people to get into.""

Obama has vowed to act in the absence of congressional action and has claimed that congressional action could still supersede his executive steps. That claim was restated by Earnest, who said Thursday that if the House approved an immigration reform bill previously passed by the Senate, Obama would ""retract"" any executive order.

In a recent op-ed in Politico, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Congress would stop Obama from taking executive action by adding language explicitly barring money from being used for that purpose. ""Congress has the power of the purse. The president cannot spend a dime unless Congress appropriates it,"" Sessions wrote. He also pointed out that similar language in the past has prevented the president from closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/source-obama-to-announce-10-point-immigration-plan-via-exec-action-as-early-as-next-week,N/A
Supreme Court allows Trump administration to enforce ‘public charge’ immigration restriction,"The Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to enforce, for now, its ""public charge"" immigration restriction, lifting a pair of preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges.

The Monday order followed a 5-4 split vote that divided the court’s conservatives and liberals.

At issue is the administration’s rule issued in August that would restrict immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance, such as housing or health care benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the policy from being implemented while the issue is being litigated.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

After losing at the lower courts, the Justice Department asked the high court to intervene, allowing temporary enforcement until the issue is resolved on the merits. The states of Connecticut, Vermont, and New York, as well as New York City and immigrant rights groups, had brought the suit.

The Trump Justice Department has gone repeatedly to the Supreme Court to lift such court-ordered injunctions, bypassing the traditional appellate process.

Justice Neil Gorsuch -- supported by Justice Clarence Thomas -- wrote a separate concurrence on Monday, criticizing the increased reliance on nationwide injunctions to block government policies.

“The real problem here is the increasingly common practice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the cases before them. Whether framed as injunctions of 'nationwide,' 'universal,' or 'cosmic' scope, these orders share the same basic flaw—they direct how the defendant must act toward persons who are not parties to the case,” Gorsuch wrote.

The court’s liberal justices, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, would have blocked the regulation’s enforcement.

While a “public charge” inadmissibility standard has long been part of U.S. immigration law, it had not been formally defined by statute. The rule, announced by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in August, defines a “public charge” as an immigrant who received one or more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period.

“The principle driving it is an old American value, and that’s self-sufficiency,” USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview last year. “It’s a core principle -- the American Dream itself -- and it’s one of the things that distinguishes us, and it's central to the legal history in the U.S. back into the 1800s.”

Those benefits that would be designated included Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), as well as most forms of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The rule expands the number of benefits that can be considered from interim guidance issued in 1999.

The public charge rule has faced fierce opposition from immigrant activists, as well as many Democrats -- who have opposed measures to limit welfare for immigrants, while also calling for the extension of various forms of government aid to illegal immigrants as well.

“This policy is yet another way for the Trump administration to hurt immigrants,"" said Claudia Center, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Disability Rights Program, said Monday. ""It enshrines the false stereotype that people with disabilities do not contribute to our society. Families will suffer. Congress has repeatedly declared that disability discrimination violates federal law. This rule must be stopped.”

The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, DNC Chair Tom Perez, slammed the ruling.

“It’s sickening to see the United States Supreme Court rubber-stamp Trump’s extreme, anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda,” he said. “The conservative justices of the court are allowing the Trump administration to penalize those seeking help and close the door on their aspirations to become a part of and give back to this country as American citizens or residents.”

The case is Department of Homeland Security v. State of New York and Make the Road New York (19a785).

Tea Party Seeks to Spotlight the 'Horrors' of Illegal Immigration,"The Tea Party is pushing back against what it sees as a campaign by Obama supporters and the media to grant amnesty to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. by highlighting the ""horrors"" of illegal immigration.

The Tea Party Nation sent an e-mail to about 35,000 members Tuesday morning asking them to post stories in a new forum about illegal immigrants victimizing Americans either by taking their jobs, committing crimes or undermining businesses by providing cheap labor to their competitors.

""The drum beat for Amnesty is here,"" the e-mail read. ""The Obama Regime and the drive-by media are pushing Amnesty with stories about illegals who are just here 'to make a better life' for themselves. The media is ignoring stories of the horrors of illegal immigration.""

The group also asks members to share photos or videos of ""illegals or their supporters doing outrageous things (like burning the American flag or putting the Mexican flag above ours, or showing racist posters.)""

""We sent this out because there are two sides to this story,"" Judson Phillips, president of the Tea Party Nation, told FoxNews.com. ""Illegal immigration has a huge and horrible cost.""

The e-mail comes in the wake of a media firestorm over an internal memo in the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services that suggested large-scale plans were being considered to provide a so-called non-legislative version of amnesty. The Obama administration has denied supporting any plans for amnesty.

About 160 comments have been posted on the forum, Phillips said, including stories about illegals causing car accidents, raping the wives of Americans and committing murder. Phillips said he's still deliberating on what to do with the stories. But he added that he's certain he wants to use them somehow to counterbalance the stories focusing on the struggle of illegal immigrants.

""We want to change this story,"" he said. ""This is not about people who have broken the law to come here but Americans who are being victimized by illegal immigrants and the federal government which doesn't care.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tea-party-seeks-to-spotlight-the-horrors-of-illegal-immigration,N/A
Texas attorney general says Biden's new immigration plan may not be legal: 'you're not king',"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is questioning the legality of Biden’s new immigration policy as the president visits the border for the first time in his presidency.

""We have checks and balances. Each branch has its own power. The states have their own power,"" Paxton tells Fox Digital. ""It's his own law, his own rules. And he doesn't run it through Congress.""

After months of urging from Republican lawmakers and border communities, Biden is visiting one of the centers of the border crisis in El Paso, Texas.

In El Paso, CBP agents have been overwhelmed: migrants are sleeping on streets outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, new processing centers have been erected to home thousands of new people crossing daily, and officials are even placing barred wire along the Rio Grande to keep people out.

""Republicans haven't been serious about this at all,"" President Biden said on Thursday. ""I wanted to make sure that I knew what the outcome, or at least the near outcome was on Title 42 before I went down. We don't have that yet so I had to operate. I don't like Title 42, but it's the law now. I have to operate within it.""

Biden announced that he will be extending Title 42, which is a COVID-era policy that allows officials to rapidly expel migrants. The Supreme Court will be hearing arguments about the legality of the policy on March 1st.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES BORDER VISIT; NEW MEASURES AS PRESSURE GROWS OVER MIGRANT SURGE

President Biden also said that he is offering a legal pathway for up to 30,000 migrants a month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela. Migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally are exempt from the program.

""It's not necessarily a bad or good idea. He's just not following any constitutional rules that we have relied for over 200 years,"" said Paxton.

In the past 100 days, Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 718,000 migrants – 198,000 of which were expelled under Title 42.

In the El Paso sector, 106,561 migrants were encountered so far this fiscal year.

Unfortunately, each migrant that is processed takes manpower away from CBP agents that are fighting drug cartels that have pushed the deadly drug fentanyl across the border and destroyed millions of American families in the process.

""That's about an hour, a man hour minimum of processing. And that's not about any type of transport or anything else. That's just about an hour in front of a computer processing that individual that literally wipes out all the Border Patrol agents on the line,"" Former U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott told Fox & Friends.

MAYORKAS SAYS MASSIVE MIGRANT NUMBERS 'STRAINING OUR SYSTEM,' CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO ACT

Although Biden's new immigration policy may provide short-term relief to border communities, Paxton says that the White House may face an uphill legal battle in implementing the program.

""If he's doing this on his own without any type of statutory authority, then we're going to we're going to call a spade a spade, say, hey, Mr. President, again, just a reminder, you're a president, you're not a dictator, you're not a king,"" said Paxton.

Texas Gov: Arizona Immigration Law 'Not Right' for Texas,"AUSTIN, Texas -- Arizona's tough new illegal immigration enforcement law would not be right for Texas, Gov. Rick Perry said Thursday, upholding the state's long-held tradition of rejecting harsh anti-immigrant policies.

The Arizona law will require local and state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status if there's reason to suspect they're in the country illegally, making it a crime for them to lack registration documents. The law also makes it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally.

""I fully recognize and support a state's right and obligation to protect its citizens, but I have concerns with portions of the law passed in Arizona and believe it would not be the right direction for Texas,"" Perry said in a written statement.

""For example, some aspects of the law turn law enforcement officers into immigration officials by requiring them to determine immigration status during any lawful contact with a suspected alien, taking them away from their existing law enforcement duties, which are critical to keeping citizens safe.""

The Arizona law has been hailed by conservatives as long overdue and two Texas lawmakers have said they'll introduce similar immigration measures when the Texas Legislature meets next.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday that a Justice Department review is under way to determine the Arizona law's constitutionality.

Though Texas is ruled by conservative Republicans, top GOP leaders from former Texas Gov. George W. Bush to Perry have rejected harsh and punitive immigration policies.

Bush continued his moderate approach to immigration once he got to the White House, often to the dismay of his conservative base.

""We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals,"" Bush said in his 2007 State of the Union address. ""We need to resolve the status of the immigrants that are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty.""

Perry took heat during this year's Republican primary for backing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, saying in a debate that the students are on a path to citizenship.

""Texas has a rich history with Mexico, our largest trading partner, and we share more than 1,200 miles of border, more than any other state,"" Perry said Thursday. ""As the debate on immigration reform intensifies, the focus must remain on border security and the federal government's failure to adequately protect our borders.

""Securing our border is a federal responsibility, but it is a Texas problem, and it must be addressed before comprehensive immigration reform is discussed.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-arizona-immigration-law-not-right-for-texas,N/A
"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott highlights immigration measures, state's economy in primetime address","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered no hints about whether he might run for president in a rare primetime address Thursday night, but used it to make a case that hard-line immigration measures, tougher criminal penalties and a humming economy are a model for the rest of the U.S.

""We will ensure Texas remains the leader of this nation as an unflinching force in this world,"" Abbott said during his biennial State of the State, which was broadcast across Texas.

The speech drew applause from inside a Texas factory that Abbott chose as the backdrop to lay out his third term agenda, but some audiences elsewhere were not as enthusiastic.

He made no mention of last year's Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers during the half-hour address — which was immediately followed on Texas airwaves by parents of slain Robb Elementary students criticizing him for not supporting tougher gun laws.

Although Abbott used the speech to name school safety a priority for Texas lawmakers to tackle over the next three months, he did not lay out any specific proposals and reiterated a general opposition to new restrictions on firearms.

SNAKES ALIVE! TEXAS CAPITOL FILLS WITH SLITHERING RATTLERS

The speech came a day after gunfire at an El Paso mall left one person dead and three others injured, a shooting that took place across a large parking lot from the Walmart where 23 people were killed in a racist attack in 2019.

""Some want more gun laws,"" Abbott said. He then accused ""too many local officials"" of not enforcing existing gun laws, but did not provide any examples.

For most governors, the State of the State rarely strays from pomp and tradition, serving as part highlight reel of past achievements and part unveiling of new priorities. Most are delivered in state capitols to an audience of newly elected legislators — as formerly was the case in Texas.

But Abbott has not only reimagined them as made-for-TV, but taken the show on the road. His speech Thursday was broadcast from a manufacturing plant in San Marcos, along the booming corridor between Austin and San Antonio that has become a sprawling symbol of Texas' turbocharged growth the last two decades.

Reporters were not granted access to the speech. Nearby, immigrant rights advocates organized a small protest over Abbott's hard-line measures on the U.S.-Mexico border.

TEXAS REP DAN CRENSHAW GIVES INSIGHT INTO WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING TO CONGRESS ON UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS SHOT DOWN

Texas Democrats, who two years ago staged a dramatic 38-day walkout in the state House to temporarily stall a GOP package of new voting restrictions, remain heavily outnumbered in the state Capitol and have little ability to block Abbott's agenda.

They used their 10 minutes of airtime after Abbott's speech to broadcast recorded messages from several Uvalde parents who have been persistent critics of the governor since the shooting last May.

""We're once again begging Gov. Abbott, please, listen to these voices,"" said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Uvalde. ""It's too late for these families. But maybe, if you show some political courage, you can save the next family from having to endure this kind of heartache.""

Abbott is starting a record-setting third term in which his grip on Texas has seldom appeared tighter. He called on lawmakers to deliver another $4 billion in border security spending, mandatory 10-year sentences for migrant trafficking convictions and an end to all pandemic-era restrictions in Texas.

Abbott, 65, has mostly deflected questions about whether he will run for president like his two predecessors in Texas — former governors Rick Perry and George W. Bush — but he hasn't ruled it out.

Dave Carney, Abbott's chief political strategist, said the governor will survey the field of Republican presidential contenders once the Texas Legislature adjourns in May. Abbott will then decide if the race would benefit from his experience in Texas, said Carney, who was also a strategist to Perry's presidential campaign in 2012.

Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, launched a run for president this week to become the first major GOP challenger to former President Donald Trump.

Title 42 immigration fight stalls mammoth $1.7 trillion spending bill in the Senate,"Democrats looking to quickly pass a $1.7 trillion spending bill stumbled Wednesday night as the fight over whether to ease immigration rules spilled out onto the Senate floor.

Republicans and Democrats had been negotiating a trade-off that allowed some votes on amendments to the huge spending bill, in return for GOP agreement to allow an earlier vote on the bill.

One of those amendments was proposed by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to maintain the Title 42 policy under which millions of immigrants have been turned away at the border to limit the spread of COVID-19. That policy is expected to be phased out any day now, which has Republicans, border states and others worried that the immigration crisis could become even worse.

Late Wednesday, Senate Republicans accused Democrats of refusing to allow a vote on Lee’s amendment and allowing it to be attached with a simple-majority vote. Lee said he thinks Democrats are worried it would pass under those conditions.

BIDEN ADMIN ASKS SUPREME COURT TO END TITLE 42, BUT WITH SHORT DELAY ON LIFTING RESTRICTIONS

""Title 42 authority is the only thing standing between us and absolute pandemonium on the border,"" Lee told Fox News. ""The Democrats won’t let us do it. Why? Because they’re afraid it might pass.""

""It is outrageous that Senate Democrats are refusing to allow a vote on @SenMikeLee amendment to extend Title 42 expulsion authority,"" tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican said he supports the omnibus spending bill, ""but not at all costs.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT WARNS POLAR VORTEX THREATENS MIGRANTS DUE TO BIDEN'S BORDER ‘DISASTER’

""If the omnibus – which dramatically increases military spending and funds the government – fails because Democrats care more about letting Title 42 lapse than funding the federal government, so be it,"" he tweeted. ""If this bill fails because Senator Lee was not allowed a vote on extending Title 42, it will be one of the lowest points in the history of the United States Senate.""

The Senate adjourned around 2 a.m. without a vote on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was still confident a vote would be reached Thursday morning.

""It is my expectation that we will be able to lock in an agreement on the omnibus tomorrow morning. We are very close, but we're not there yet,"" Schumer said.

He also said without an agreement, he would abandon the idea of a faster vote in return for amendments and set up a vote by Friday. That’s much later than Democrats hoped to have the bill out of the Senate, in part because of worries about an approaching winter storm that has lawmakers eager to return home.

"Top conservative group warns of Chinese security risk in key immigration bill, urges ‘no’ vote","FIRST ON FOX: A top conservative organization is warning that a key immigration bill, which is expected to be voted on in the House as soon as Wednesday, could open the door for a greater national security threat from the Chinese communist regime -- and is urging lawmakers to vote against the bill as a result.

The House is expected to vote on the Equal Access to Green Cards for Legal Employment (EAGLE) Act Wednesday afternoon, during the lame duck session of Congress ahead of the Republicans taking the House next year.

The bill, which deals with legal immigration, would remove per-country caps on the numbers of employment-based green cards available to nationals as a way to end an enormous backlog of green card applications. It would also increase the cap on family-based visas from 7% to 15%.

Most employment-based green cards are applied for from workers already in the U.S. on temporary visas, but due to the large number of Chinese and Indian nationals brought in by U.S. companies on those visas, nationals from those two countries face the largest backlogs.

LABOR SECRETARY WALSH WARNS OF ECONOMIC ‘CATASTROPHE’ IF CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM

Immigration hawks have opposed the legislation, arguing that it would lead to a dominance of the immigration system by immigrants from China and India at the expense of other countries.

Heritage Action is urging lawmakers to vote against the bill, highlighting in a key vote text – along with other objections – what it says is a potential security risk from expanding green card access to Chinese nationals.

""The most substantial impact of removing country caps is providing a greater avenue for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to increase its theft of America’s intellectual property,"" the conservative group says in a key vote text, obtained first by Fox News Digital.

""The CCP poses the greatest global threat to the United States, our interests, and our values. The CCP’s influence over its people means that an influx of Chinese workers into the U.S.—particularly in the high-tech space where many of these workers would end up—represents a threat to our national security,"" it says.

The legislation acknowledges this potential risk by barring those who are members of the CCP from obtaining a H-1B visa (a visa for high-skilled immigrants used heavily by the tech industry.) However, Heritage cites stats that less than 7% of the Chinese population is a formal CCP member.

""This amendment is inadequate, as it does not cover non-immigrant temporary visas, like students, who also pose security risks,"" it says.

""The CCP views every citizen as an instrument to serve the party, and they encourage and apply leverage against many of their citizens working and studying abroad to continue that theft. Passing legislation that would massively increase the number of Chinese national visa holders is a bad idea at this time,"" the text says. ""Importantly, these visas would come at the expense of visa holders from other countries, where there is no such concern of communist espionage.""

Ryan Walker, vice president of government relations for Heritage Action, told Fox News Digital, that the organization was particularly concerned about the potential for abuse when it comes to Chinese nationals currently on student visas.

COLOMBIA CALLS FOR DEPORATION PROTECTION FOR NATIONALS LIVING ILLEGALLY IN US

""We've seen some of the activity of Chinese nationals and CCP members within our university systems,"" he said. In fact, some universities have had federal agencies come in and contact them and talk to them about espionage concerns within their research departments and otherwise of those folks that may be here on student visas and doing basic research at our core universities and then taking that that intellectual capital back to China and utilizing the state enterprise system that the Chinese government has stood up to essentially steal intellectual capital from the United States.""

The concern about the Chinese security threat is just one objection immigration hawks have had to the legislation, which has bipartisan support in both chambers.

Supporters of the bill have noted that the legislation does not increase the overall numbers of green cards available, only changes the accessibility of the visas.

""As currently written, these changes would take effect over a nine-year transition period to ensure that no countries are excluded from receiving visas while the per-country caps are phased out,"" the White House’s Office of Management and Budget said in a statement of support, in which it said the bill would improve the immigration system and ""ease the harsh effects of the immigration visa backlog.""

Supporters have also argued that scrapping per-country caps means that visas will be awarded based on merit rather than birthplace. They have also pointed to reforms to the visa process, including a Department of Labor website that would require employers to advertise their jobs to American workers first, and a bar on advertising jobs as only available to H-1B workers.

However, conservative groups have argued that the bill would not eliminate the backlog, but only incentivize more applications due to the drop in wait times for a green card.

""So while the backlog currently affects only a few countries, the EAGLE Act will ensure that the backlog burdens all countries,"" the Federation for American Immigration Reform said in a recent analysis. ""In short, the EAGLE Act will wreck the employment-based immigration system for applicants from the rest of the world for the sole purpose of shifting more green cards to India and China.""

Similarly, Heritage Action says the bill is coming at a time when tech companies, which back the bill, are announcing layoffs and hiring freezes.

""Congress should not be radically changing the U.S. visa system in a lame duck, especially not when the result will be massive chain migration, compromised national security, and reduced job opportunities for Americans,"" the organization says.

Meanwhile, the bill has also seen opposition from Democratic lawmakers.

Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-NY, warned this week in a letter to members of the Congressional Black Caucus that eliminating the country caps without a corresponding increase in visas would ""result in a dearth of immigration opportunities for hopeful migrants outside these nations, with particular concern for those from African and Caribbean nations.""

""This legislation comes up short in my estimation and I cannot support efforts that would perpetuate the current inequalities in our immigration system. I believe we can do better,"" she wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-conservative-group-warns-chinese-security-risk-key-immigration-bill-urges-no-vote,N/A
Top Trump immigration adviser predicts immediate change,"A key member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team and a top adviser on matters involving immigration told FoxNews.com Monday the incoming administration will likely move to deport illegal immigrants upon arrest.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a key player in several high-profile immigration measures and court cases, advised Trump on immigration during his campaign and will likely have a key role in shaping the new president's policies. Kobach said Trump is likely to scrap the Obama administration's approach of deporting only those who have been convicted, a policy he said releases dangerous people back into U.S. communities.

“The most extreme criminals are deported while criminal arrestees not yet convicted are turned loose,” said Kobach. “[Under the new proposal,] criminal arrestees will be deported, there will be immediate improvement in safety for all Americans.”

Kobach stressed that Trump must sign off on decisions involving enforcement policies, but said candidate Trump signaled clearly what President Trump will do.

“Ultimately it’s his call,” Kobach said. “There will be a great deal of consistency between the platform and President-elect Trump’s policies – that is, with the caveat that every decision is the president’s decision.”

Kobach spoke to FoxNews.com a day after Trump appeared on CBS’s “60 Minutes” and said that dealing with immigration would be among his first priorities upon taking office in January. He said he would focus on getting criminals off the streets and out of the country, building a wall – though part of it might be a fence, he said – and that later he would turn his attention to what to do about other illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes.

“After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about — who are terrific people,” Trump said. “They’re terrific people, but we are going make a determination at that. But before we make that determination . . . it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.”

Some 12 million people are believed to be living in the United States illegally. Roughly 40 percent entered on visas and did not leave when they expired.

Kobach said that Trump will be able to boost enforcement of existing immigration laws right away by undoing Obama’s executive actions, and giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents more support and freedom to arrest, detain and deport people such as those with criminal records.

“Obama ordered ICE agents to stop doing their jobs,” said Kobach, who represented ICE agents in a lawsuit challenging Obama’s executive actions. “The morale of ICE is the lowest morale of any federal agency.”

Kobach, who was a force behind Trump’s vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and have Mexico pay for it, said that Trump will have the mandate and supportive Congress, with Republicans having control next year of both chambers, to make immediate changes in the immigration system.

“Americans think our laws need to be followed,” he said. “President-elect Trump is in a unique position. He has the mandate from the American people to end illegal immigration and secure our borders for once and for all.”

Asked where the Trump administration might draw the line on criminals – whether a tougher approach would lead to the detention and deportation of only those arrested for felonies, or for lesser crimes, as well – Kobach declined comment.

Kobach added that he did not want to get into details prematurely that had not yet been hammered out or that would put Trump on the spot.

Kobach's appointment to the transition team has raised speculation that he might be named to a post in the Trump administration, but he declined to comment on the prospect.

Advocacy groups are girding for a pitched battle with the Trump administration over illegal immigration, and are warning that deportations - even of criminal suspects - will break up families.

“This will rip apart families and become one of the darkest chapters in American history, all because he wants to throw red meat to his hard core white nationalist base,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a Washington D.C.-based group. “His talk of 'criminals' is a strategy to throw sand in the faces of the American people in hopes of covering his tracks. It’s up to all of us to make sure he doesn’t get away with it.”

Few people have been more influential in state-level and nationwide efforts to push for stricter immigration enforcement than the 50-year-old Wisconsin native.

Kobach, who holds degrees from Harvard, Yale and Oxford, co-authored Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law, which led to similar legislative efforts in several other states after Congress repeatedly failed to fix the system and address border security.

Kobach served as chief adviser on immigration and border security in the U.S. Department of Justice, and helped shape enforcement programs after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, including the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which screened people seeking to enter the United States from countries where Al Qaeda was active.

Kobach predicts that under Trump, local police and federal immigration agents will work more closely.

“They play a vital role on being the eyes and ears of the federal government,” he said. “Most of the arrests by ICE in the past would come from local law enforcement.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-trump-immigration-adviser-predicts-immediate-change,N/A
Supreme Court hands Trump administration a victory in immigration battle,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday handed the Trump administration a victory in its battle to clamp down on illegal immigration by making it easier to detain immigrants with criminal records.

The ruling that federal immigration authorities can detain immigrants awaiting deportation anytime after they have been released from prison on criminal charges represents a victory for President Trump.

In the case before the justices, a group of mostly green card holders argued that unless immigrants were picked up immediately after finishing their prison sentence, they should get a hearing to argue for their release while deportation proceedings go forward. But in the 5-4 decision on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled against them, deciding that federal immigration officials can detain noncitizens at any time after their release from local or state custody. The court also ruled the government maintains broad discretion to decide who would represent a danger to the community in deciding who to release or detain.

BORDER PATROL UNION LEADER: CONGRESS IS WRONG, NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON THE BORDER IS REAL

During oral arguments in October the Trump administration argued that given the limited money and manpower available, it was nearly impossible for the federal government to immediately detain every immigrant upon their release from custody.

Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, stating that ""neither the statute's text nor its structure"" supported the immigrants' argument. The court's conservative justices sided with the Trump administration, which argued as the Obama administration did, against hearings for those convicted of crimes and affected by the law.

The case before the justices involved a class-action lawsuit brought by non-citizens in California and a similar class-action lawsuit brought in the state of Washington. One of the lead plaintiffs, Mony Preap, has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1981 and has two convictions for possession of marijuana. He was released from prison in 2006 but was not taken into immigration custody until 2013.

Preap won in lower courts, and the government was ordered to provide him and other class members a bond hearing. Preap has since won his deportation case.

The ruling was the first in the court’s current term – which began in October – and the first for Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who, along with Chief Justice John Roberts, wrote a concurring opinion. The court’s four more liberal justices dissented, and Justice Stephen Breyer took the unusual step of reading an oral dissent from the bench.

Trump expected to sign executive order expanding immigration restrictions,"President Trump is expected to sign an expansion of immigration restrictions in the coming days in response to the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic -- an order that will reportedly suspend a number of guest worker programs.

Trump signed an order in April suspending some forms of immigration, citing “the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor” as a reason for the restriction, as well as pressures on health care and other factors.

IMMIGRATION HAWKS UNDERWHELMED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, CALL FOR TRUMP TO 'DO BETTER'

That order suspended, for 60 days, green cards for immigrants who are currently outside the U.S. and do not already have a valid immigrant visa. While it was criticized by Democrats and immigration activists for being part of an “anti-immigrant agenda,” it also left many restrictionists unhappy because it did not target temporary guest work visas such as the H-1B and H-2B programs, which give visas for the tech and seasonal industries, respectively.

Hawks say that those visas are used to replace American workers with cheaper labor at a time of sky-high unemployment, while business groups counter that such labor is needed to fuel an economic recovery.

Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in April that “additional steps” were likely before the order expires, which will be in the coming days.

NPR first reported Saturday that the order could be signed as soon as Saturday evening, and will bar H-1B and H-2B visas, as well as L-1 visas for business executives and J-1 visas for teaching and work-exchange programs, until the end of the year. A source familiar with discussions about the order confirmed the details to Fox News.

Such an order would reflect the priorities of groups that call for lower levels of immigration, such as the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), who wrote to Trump in May asking for limits on guestworker programs.

""These visas -- notably H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, L-1 and J-1 -- are unnecessary given the economic conditions facing American households,"" FAIR President Dan Stein said. (H-2A visas, for temporary agricultural workers, are not believed to be targeted by the order.)

The order is also expected to include a number of exceptions amid warnings from business groups that an order too strict will affect the economic recovery.

REPUBLICANS, IMMIGRATION HAWKS CALL ON TRUMP TO FURTHER EXPAND IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS AMID ECONOMIC WOES

“As the economy rebounds, American businesses will need assurances that they can meet all their workforce needs. To that end, it is crucial that they have access to talent both domestically and from around the world,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Thomas Donohue wrote in a letter to Trump.

“Policies that would, for example, impose wide-ranging bans on the entry of nonimmigrant workers or impose burdensome new regulatory requirements on businesses that employ foreign nationals would undermine that access to talent, and, in the process, undercut our economy’s ability to grow and create jobs,” he said in the letter reported by The Hill.

NPR reported that there will likely be “national interest” exceptions on a case-by-case basis for areas including public health and national security. Many of those cases would be handled by the State Department. A source familiar with discussions told Fox that the exemptions were still being finalized.

The order is likely to see significant opposition from Democrats and immigration activists groups. Leon Fresco, a former Obama administration official who now represents H-1B workers told NPR that it was “counterproductive” and akin to “using a nuclear bomb to address a bar fight,""

Meanwhile, even with the possible exceptions, reports of the expansion were welcomed by immigration hawks in Congress and outside.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, one of a number of Republicans who wrote to Trump last month urging him to expand the restriction to include guest worker programs, said he was glad to see Trump “delivering in such a big way.”

“If the exceptions are kept tight, this is a HUGE win for American workers,” he added.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-expected-sign-order-expanding-immigration-restrictions,N/A
"Trump, GOP senators champion bill to cut legal immigration levels","President Trump joined two Republican senators on Wednesday to champion legislation overhauling legal immigration in America, calling for a merit-based system that would significantly cut admissions over the next decade.

Speaking at the White House, the president called it “the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half century.”

“As a candidate, I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers and taxpayers, and that is why we are here today,” Trump said.

He was joined by Georgia Sen. David Perdue and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republicans who first introduced the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy, or the RAISE Act, in February. They have said the legislation aims to reduce the number of green cards issued in half from 1 million to 500,000 a year.

Trump, Perdue and Cotton argued on Tuesday that low-skilled and unskilled immigration into the United States has depressed wages.

According to a fact sheet released to reporters, the new system would favor immigrants who are educated, speak English and have high-paying job offers. It would also reduce low-skilled and unskilled labor immigration.

Trump said new immigrants must be able to “financially support themselves and their families.”

“The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare and protects U.S. workers from being displaced,” the president said. “And that’s a very big thing, they’re not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare.”

The bill would prioritize immediate family members of United States residents, including spouses and young children. But it would end prioritization for extended family members and adult children of residents.

The legislation also eliminates the Diversity Visa lottery system and limits permanent resident status for refugees to 50,000 a year.

Trump lamented how the country has “record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants.” The White House said most of the 1 million immigrants who are accepted into the United States for legal permanent residency every year are low or unskilled workers.

Among the hardest hit by this, the president said, are minority workers, who he said are “competing for jobs against brand new arrivals.”

“It has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers,” he said.

The administration also said 50 percent of immigrant households receive welfare benefits, as opposed to 30 percent of native households in the country.

Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a hallmark of his administration and has tried to slash federal grants for cities that refuse to comply with federal efforts to detain and deport those living in the country illegally.

His involvement will put him at the center of efforts to make changes to the legal immigration system.

Trump's appearance was aimed at bringing attention to the bill, which has been largely ignored in the Senate, with no other lawmaker signing on as a co-sponsor. GOP leaders have showed no inclination to vote on immigration this year.

Some immigrant advocates have criticized the proposal, saying that slashing legal immigration would hurt industries like agriculture and harm the economy.

""Our system is broken, but the response should be to modernize it, not take a sledgehammer to it,"" said Jeremy Robbins, executive director of New American Economy, a group of business leaders, mayors and others backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that advocates for comprehensive immigration reform.

"Trump administration to increase immigration fees, impose fee for asylum claims","The Trump administration announced Friday that it is increasing immigration fees -- with those seeking citizenship facing a hike of more than 80 percent, while asylum seekers will face a charge for their claim.

The rule, first proposed last year and published in the federal register Friday, increases the application for citizenship fee by 81 percent to $1,160 among a number of fee increases for immigration applications.

FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENCY DELAYS 13,400 POTENTIAL FURLOUGHS UNTIL AUGUST

Immigrants will be charged a $50 fee to claim asylum -- although that applies to claims that are made from within the U.S., and therefore would not apply to people arriving across the U.S.-Mexico border or other ports of entry.

Citizenship and Immigration Services has said that it pays $366 in adjudication costs to process each affirmative asylum application, bringing the total to almost $1,800 once overheads are included.

Opponents of the new fees have called it cruel and argue that very few countries charge for asylum claims.

The agency, in announcing the change Friday, noted that that it is almost entirely funded by fees rather than taxpayer money and that a recent review found that current fees would leave the agency underfunded by approximately $1 billion a year.

Immigration Services is ""required to examine incoming and outgoing expenditures, and make adjustments based on that analysis,” Joseph Edlow, the agency's deputy director for policy, said in a statement. “These overdue adjustments in fees are necessary to efficiently and fairly administer our nation’s lawful immigration system, secure the homeland and protect Americans.”

The agency has been facing severe financial hardship amid the coronavirus crisis, which has limited immigration revenue, and has warned that it may need to furlough thousands of employees to stay afloat.

It had initially alerted more than two-thirds of the workforce they would be furloughed starting July 20, but now that date has been pushed back to the end of August.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HALTS NEW DACA APPLICATIONS AS IT CONSIDERS CANCELING PROGRAM

The agency is offering a $10 reduction in fees for those who submit applications online. The new fees will take effect in October.

Notably absent was a $275 fee included in the proposal last year for the two-year renewal of recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) -- the Obama-era policy that shielded some illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. as minors from deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this week that it is halting new DACA applications and limiting renewals to only one year, rather than two, as it considers the future of the program in the wake of a recent Supreme Court decision.

That decision found that the administration’s move to end the program was done in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner, although justices did not rule on the merits of the program itself.

Trump immigration proposal could provide path to citizenship for 1.8 million in US illegally,"The White House Thursday released an immigration plan that would offer a path to citizenship for approximately 1.8 million of the so-called ""Dreamers,"" along with a $25 billion investment in border security -- including for President Trump's long-promised wall.

The White House was expected to provide more details of the president's proposal early next week. But the proposal represents a reversal for Trump and could provoke resistance among his conservative allies.

In September, Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which currently covers roughly 690,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

""We're not looking at citizenship,"" Trump told reporters at the time. ""We're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here.""

On Wednesday, however, Trump said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children.

""We're going to morph into it,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's going to happen, at some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years.""

The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said it believes the largest share of the White House's 1.8 million people who'd be eligible for citizenship -- 1.3 million -- are people who currently meet all of DACA's eligibility requirements. These include years in the U.S., their ages now and when they entered this country, and whether they have a high school or equivalent education.

Another 400,000 are people who'd be eligible for DACA protection but for their education. And 100,000 more are people who are under age 15 --the minimum age allowed for most people requesting protection under the program.

Legal status for the recipients would be revocable for criminal behavior and national security threats, sources familiar with the plan told Fox News, and eventual citizenship would require still-unspecified work and education requirements -- and a finding that the immigrants are of ""good moral character.""

Trump's plan would restrict new family-based immigration to spouses and minor children, doing away with provisions allowing parents, adult siblings and others to enter the country. The sources said it would only end new applications for visas, allowing those already in the pipeline to be processed.

It would also end the diversity visa lottery program, which drew Trump's attention after the New York City truck attack last year, redirecting the allotment annually to bringing down the existing backlog in visa applications.

Trump had deferred to a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to craft an immigration proposal, saying he would sign whatever they passed. But as talks on Capitol Hill broke down -- in part because of controversy Trump ginned up using vulgar language to describe other countries -- the White House decided to offer its own framework.

The release follows on concerns raised by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the president had not sufficiently laid out his priorities. One official said the Thursday release represents a plan for the Senate, with the administration expecting a different bill to pass the House.

In a statement, McConnell said the White House plan ""indicates what is necessary for the president to sign a bill into law.""

""I am hopeful that as discussions continue in the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the aisle will look to this framework for guidance as they work towards an agreement,"" McConnell added.

Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., echoed the sentiment saying: ""We're grateful for the president showing leadership on this issue and believe his ideas will help us ultimately reach a balanced solution.""

But a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the plan as part of a ""hateful anti-immigrant agenda.""

Drew Hammill accused White House aide Stephen Miller, a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, of ""trying to ransom the lives of innocent DREAMers for a $25 billion anti-immigrant wish list.""

""The White House strategy of moving the goal posts every time the President isn't paying attention continues to complicate this process,"" he said in a statement.

The president's most loyal media ally, Breitbart News, attacked Trump as ""Amnesty Don."" The conservative group Heritage Action for America said the proposal ""should be a non-starter.""

However, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who played a key role in immigration talks earlier this month, said Trump's proposal was ""generous and humane, while also being responsible.""

""It protects those eligible for DACA, who are here through no fault of their own. But it also will prevent us from ending up back here in five years by securing the border and putting an end to extended-family chain migration.""

Among other Republicans, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said he supports the citizenship pathway Trump described Wednesday. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., called Trump's words ""positive"" and said Trump's description ""gives us a better sense"" of his views, but added, ""We have a long way to go yet.""

Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said the White House framework was ""something that both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate should be eager to support.

""We all want a good deal,"" Perdue added, ""and here it is.""

Some of Congress' more conservative members seemed unwilling to open the citizenship door for the Dreamers.

""DACA itself didn't have a pathway to citizenship,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who battled Trump in 2016 for the GOP presidential nomination. ""So I think it would be a profound mistake and not consistent with the promises we made to the voters, to enact a pathway to citizenship to DACA recipients or to others who are here illegally.""

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he supports a more conservative, more sweeping immigration bill proposed by House members, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., which has won strong support from House conservatives. Ryan has promised to push for support for that measure.

Meanwhile, immigration activists blasted the plan. Lorella Praeli, with the American Civil Liberties Union, called it ""a hateful, xenophobic immigration proposal that would slash legal immigration to levels not seen since the racial quotas of the 1920s, eliminate legal immigration channels for African countries, and spend $25 billion for a harmful, wasteful border wall and an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents. ""

""The White House proposal is clearly an effort to sabotage bipartisan talks on the issue by continuing to put issues on the table that are non-starters,"" she said.

"Trump signs new immigration order, narrows scope of travel ban","President Trump on Monday signed a revised executive order suspending the refugee program as well as entry to the U.S. for travelers from six mostly Muslim countries, curtailing what was a broadly worded directive in a bid to withstand court scrutiny.

As before, the order will suspend refugee entries for 120 days. But it no longer will suspend Syrian refugee admissions indefinitely.

The new order also will ban travelers from six countries who did not obtain a visa before Jan. 27 from entering the United States for 90 days. The directive no longer includes Iraq, as the original order did, but covers immigration and travel from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Iraq, a key U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS, was removed from the travel ban list after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he spoke with the Iraqi government about its vetting process and felt that the screening system was thorough enough to stand on its own.

Trump privately signed the new order Monday while Tillerson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly formally unveiled the new order in an event with reporters. They took no questions. The first version of the order, by contrast, was unveiled during a presidential signing ceremony at the Pentagon’s Hall of Heroes.

Tillerson defended the new order on Monday, saying Trump is using “his rightful authority” to keep people safe.

“This order is part of our ongoing efforts to eliminate vulnerabilities that radical Islamic terrorists can and will exploit,” he added.

Kelly said the new executive order “will make America more secure.”

“Unvetted travel isn’t a privilege especially when national security is at stake,” he said.

Among other things, the revised order also makes clear that green card holders are not affected.

“If you have travel documents, if you actually have a visa, if you are a legal permanent resident, you are not covered under this particular executive action,” White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News earlier Monday. “I think people will see six or seven major points about this executive order that do clarify who is covered.”

The Trump administration also plans to cap the number of refugees it accepts to 50,000 a year – down sharply from the 110,000 accepted by the Obama administration.

According to the new executive order, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will have 20 days to perform a “global, country-by-country review of the identity and security information that each country provides to the U.S. government to support U.S. visa and other immigration benefit determinations.”

Countries will then have 50 days to comply with requests to update or improve the “quality” of the information they provide to U.S. officials.

For countries that don’t comply, the State Department, DHS and intelligence agencies can make additional recommendations on what, if any, restrictions should be imposed.

The new order also details categories of people eligible to enter the United States for business or medical travel purposes.

Almost immediately, there was pushback from Democratic lawmakers and human rights groups.

“A watered down ban is still a ban,” Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a written statement. “Despite the administration’s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American. It must be repealed.”

Despite the changes, it’s unclear whether the new version can withstand judicial challenges.

“I fully expect this executive order to have the same uphill climb in the courts that the previous version had,” Schumer said.

Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, agreed.

“President Trump has recommitted himself to religious discrimination, and he can expect continued disapproval from both the courts and the people,” he said in a statement.

More than two dozen lawsuits were filed in response to the original travel ban. One suit filed in Washington state succeeded in having the order suspended by arguing that it violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination.

Trump’s original order prohibited travelers from seven nations including Iraq from entering the U.S. for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were banned indefinitely, but under the new order they are not given separate treatment.

The White House was criticized the first time around for its rocky rollout of the travel ban. Trump has expressed frustration both in person and on social media over the stalled ban, at times targeting the courts and federal judges who he claimed put the country at risk by holding up the order.

Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that “the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision.”

Despite widespread belief the first order was done in haste, Trump and other White House officials have repeatedly called it a success.

DONALD TRUMP: Thousands and thousands of people are coming up right now as we speak. And you're going to have millions of people pouring into our country. And it's going to destroy our country. I don't know what they're doing. And they don't know what they're doing. It's a very, very dangerous situation. I'd love not to be involved. Somebody else is supposed to be doing it.

Over the next few weeks, I guess I’ll go [to the border]. And I’m not sure that I really should do it, Jeanine, other than the fact that I have such respect for the Border Patrol and for ICE. And these people they’re dying for leadership. There’s nothing. There’s no leadership. You have to see the squalor, the children and, frankly, people that have come in to the country when you look at what’s happening, the dirt and the filth of those places. That’s why they’re not letting the press in.

And, frankly, if that were me the press would be going crazy. It’s a very dangerous situation. It’s horrible for our country. They’re going to destroy our country.

Since taking office, Biden has undone a number of Trump-era immigration policies, including halting funding for the border wall and ending the Remain-in-Mexico policy.

The Trump administration set up and expanded MPP during the 2019 migrant crisis as part of a broader agreement with Mexico, and hailed it as a key plank in its efforts to end ""catch-and-release"" -- by which migrants were released into the interior of the U.S.

Instead, MPP keeps migrants in Mexico as they await their asylum hearings. Proponents say the policy ended a key pull factor that brought migrants north, while critics say it is cruel and puts migrants in danger by leaving them in Mexico.

Meanwhile, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities have been operating far beyond capacity amid a troubling surge in border crossers. The agency announced that it had encountered more than 100,000 migrants at the border in February, while numbers of child migrants in custody have also increased dramatically.

The Biden administration has refrained from calling the situation a ""crisis,"" but has admitted that border apprehension numbers could surge to a 20-year high.

"Under Trump, old deportation orders get new life","For years, immigrants facing deportation have been allowed to stay in the U.S. provided they show up for regular check-ins with federal deportation agents and stay out of trouble. After a brief meeting, they're usually told to return months later to check in again.

Now, in cases spanning from Michigan to California, some of these immigrants are being told their time here is up.

Immigrants who already have deportation orders and were allowed to stay in the country under the prior administration have become a target under President Donald Trump's new immigration policies, with some getting arrested on the spot during check-ins with officers. Such arrests have dismayed family members and sent chills through immigrant communities.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOW HAVE RINGTONE ALERTING THEM FROM DEPORTATION

In other instances, immigrants have been fitted with ankle-monitoring bracelets. Others have been released much like they were during President Barack Obama's administration in what immigration attorneys say appears to be a random series of decisions based more on detention space than public safety.

""Everywhere, people going in to report are just absolutely terrified,"" said Stacy Tolchin, a Los Angeles immigration attorney.

Agents still consider requests to delay deportations at immigrants' regularly scheduled check-ins if, for example, someone has a medical condition, said David Marin, who oversees enforcement and removal operations for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. But decisions are made on an individual basis, and efforts are being stepped up to procure travel documents from foreign countries to send people back home.

""They still have the ability to file a stay, but again, we're looking at it in a different light,"" Marin said. ""There has to be an end game here.""

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT DEPORTED 15 TIMES ARRESTED IN HIT-RUN CRASH THAT HURT 6-YEAR-OLD BOY

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it is tracking nearly 970,000 immigrants with deportation orders. The majority — 82 percent — have no criminal record, the agency said. ICE declined to say how many must regularly report to authorities or are tracked by ankle monitors, and it is unclear how many are being arrested.

Trump boosted immigration arrests by 38 percent in the early days of his administration, but deportations fell from a year ago as activity on the U.S.-Mexico border slowed.

For authorities keen on showing they're beefing up immigration enforcement, immigrants who already have deportation orders are seen as an easy target. They can be removed from the country more quickly than newly arrested immigrants, whose cases can drag on for years in immigration court proceedings and appeals.

IMMIGRATION SWEEP NETS 70 PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA, TEXAS

""I just assume they figure this is an easy removal. All we have to do is deport this person, and that adds to our numbers of people who are out of the United States,"" said Heather Prendergast, chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association's National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Liaison Committee.

Many immigrants with old deportation orders have lived in the United States for years and set down roots here despite having no legal status, which deportation agents were known to weigh to decide who was a priority for removal.

Under the Obama administration, immigration lawyers said their clients often were told they faced no immediate risk of being deported and could temporarily remain, so long as they committed no crimes.

In Michigan, Jose Luis Sanchez-Ronquillo reported to authorities for more than four years before he was arrested at an April check-in and sent to a Louisiana detention facility. The 36-year-old father of two came into contact with police during a traffic stop and lost his immigration case in 2012. But he was then repeatedly allowed to stay, said Shanta Driver, his lawyer.

In Virginia, 33-year-old Cesar Lara was detained in May after living here for a decade. The Mexican house painter wound up with a deportation order after he was arrested in 2012, when officials stopped him for removing wood from a forest, said his mother, Maria De Lara.

""(Trump) said they were just going to deport pure criminals and bad people, and my son is not a criminal,"" she said. ""He's working for the community.""

It's hard to know how many immigrants with deportation orders are being detained. In Atlanta, immigration attorney Charles Kuck said one in five of his clients with scheduled check-ins has been detained since Trump took office, something that hardly ever happened during the prior administration.

Immigration lawyers said they tell clients they must attend required check-ins, and immigrants usually do, hoping to be allowed to stay and avoid the prospect of deportation agents showing up at their homes.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said he believes deportations will rise as the Trump administration continues to arrest immigrants here illegally and that authorities will focus more on the interior of the country as activity on the southern border declines.

""These are people who have had their chance at due process, and it is just Obama decided to let them stay,"" said Krikorian, who wants stricter limits on immigration. ""It is a perfectly defensible and perfectly appropriate use of their resources to start with these people who are already ordered deported.""

While those supporting Trump see the shift as a necessary fix to a dysfunctional immigration system, critics say politics is driving the change.

Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said authorities already are deporting immigrants from the jails, and illegal immigration from Mexico has waned, prompting the Trump administration to look for ways to satisfy campaign supporters.

""The administration ran on this phantom problem, and now they're going to have to big-time deliver on their promises,"" Nowrasteh said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/under-trump-old-deportation-orders-get-new-life,N/A
What will Biden's immigration overhaul mean for national security?,"Just one week into his presidency, President Biden has already signed six executive orders concerning immigration. Experts say Biden is quickly undoing Former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, and some fear these reversals will have huge impacts on national security.

""The plans Biden announced so far portend a more dangerous America,"" Todd Bensman, senior national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies said.

Bensman spoke with Fox News from Juarez, Mexico. ""I’ve just returned from interviewing migrants in Juarez,"" Bensman said. ""Without exception, all of them have been made expectant and excited that they will be able to come into the U.S. with no fear or possibility of rejection or later deportation. The entire galaxy of aspiring migrants hear the Biden plan as a clarion to come now and come all.""

Last week, Biden proposed immigration legislation that would give legal status, and a path to citizenship, to anyone in the U.S. before Jan. 1, which is an estimated 11 million people. He also halted work on the border wall with Mexico, lifted travel bans from several predominantly Muslim countries, among other initiatives.

CHAD WOLF: BIDEN IMMIGRATION ACTION 'ABSOLUTELY' GOES AGAINST THE LAW

Immigration Attorney Rachel Self said this immigration bill is ""pretty ambitious.""

""Giving millions of people a path to residency and citizenship hasn’t been done since the Regan era, around 1986,"" she said. ""The bill raises visa caps to reduce the backlog so that more people can bring their families over. We’re talking about people who have been waiting 20, 30 years to be able to bring a family member over here.""

According to Self, Biden’s thorough undoing of Trump’s immigration policies are, ""a promising indication that he and his administration understand the pressing need to start reversing the damage inflicted by the Trump administration on our immigration systems.""

Self said there are no ""quick fixes"" for immigration reform but that this is a good start.

""These policies have been affecting the lives of real people with real families for four years,"" she said. ""They will never get those years back.""

While Bensman and other experts worry Biden’s immigration policy will have negative effects on national security, Self said the government will ensure people granted immigration benefits are not a security threat.

ARIZONA SHERIFF RIPS BIDEN'S IMMIGRATION ACTIONS AS 'POLITICAL THEATER': 'STOP THIS MADNESS'

However, Retired Acting ICE Director Tom Homan said border security directly affects national security; therefore, no amnesty should be considered until Congress fixes the three loopholes that cause surges:

Asylum rules

The Flores Agreement, the 1997 legal settlement that requires that minors in INS custody must be housed in facilities that meet certain standards, including state standards for housing and care of dependent children

The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000

""They have to plug the hole rather than continue bailing water,"" he said. ""Secure the border to stop the illegal flow before you reward illegal behavior. Talk of amnesty is just enticing more people to come illegally.""

Homan said another concern that comes with a ""porous"" border is illegal drugs being smuggled into the U.S.

TOP DEM ADMITS PASSING BIDEN IMMIGRATION BILL A ‘HERCULEAN' TASK AMID GOP OPPOSITION

""During the last surge when Border Protection had only 50% of the manpower on the line because they were caring for family groups, enough opioids came across the border that killed 62,000 Americans"" from overdoses.

Mark Morgan, the acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Fox News that the border crisis has already begun.

""One migrant on his way to enter our country illegally, -- quote -- said ‘Biden has given us a hundred days to get to the U.S. border,’"" Morgan noted referencing Biden’s policy halting deportation for 100 days.

""That’s not an immigration strategy. That’s an open border strategy,"" Morgan said.

Self, on the other hand, said migrants come to the U.S. for a plethora of reasons, most prominently that the conditions of their home country are ""unsurvivable.""

""President Biden’s proposed immigration bill directly addresses this, devoting resources to cure the root causes of why people flee their homes in the first place,"" Self said. ""No border can stop people from trying to save their families from gang violence or starvation. Until their homes are safe and prosperous, people will always migrate. President Biden’s bill does far more to address migration to the U.S. than President Trump’s unbuilt wall ever did or could.""

With roughly 7,500 migrants making their way on foot to Mexico and the U.S. just last week, Homan reiterated the importance of border security and the national security threat that could arise from Biden’s immigration policies.

""Biden wants to appease the left more than he wants border security,"" Homan said. ""More lives will be lost and the border will be in chaos again.""

White House unable to describe what Kamala Harris is doing on immigration,"The White House said Monday that it was unable to describe what Vice President Kamala Harris is doing to address the ""root cause"" of mass migration to the southern border, one of the major issues in her portfolio.

""I don’t have anything to lay out specifically on what that work looks like,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked about Harris’s role at a briefing Monday.

KARINE JEAN-PIERRE RIPPED FOR CLAIMING BIDEN HAS WORKED TO SECURE THE BORDER: 'MOST EGREGIOUS LIE I'VE HEARD'

Jean-Pierre referred further questions about the vice president's work to her office, which did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

A surge of migrants has arrived at the southern border in recent days as Wednesday marks the expiration of the so-called Title 42 policy, a pandemic-era policy under President Donald Trump that called on border agents to turn away migrants at the border as a way of coping with the pandemic. Jean-Pierre insisted last Wednesday that the end of the Title 42 policy does not mean the border is open.

BORDER OFFICIALS MAKE DESPERATE PLEAS TO BIDEN ADMIN AS TITLE 42 NEARS END: 'DON'T SEE ANY HOPE RIGHT NOW'

Encounters at the southern border hit an all-time high this year and stood at 2.4 million as of September. Border officials and others expect these encounters to spike as the Title 42 policy comes to an end.

Georgia Town Abandoned After Immigration Raid,"Trailer parks lie abandoned. The poultry plant is scrambling to replace more than half its workforce. Business has dried up at stores where Mexican laborers once lined up to buy food, beer and cigarettes just weeks ago.

This Georgia community of about 1,000 people has become little more than a ghost town since Sept. 1, when federal agents began rounding up illegal immigrants.

The sweep has had the unintended effect of underscoring just how vital the illegal immigrants were to the local economy.

Click here to visit FOXNews.com's Immigration Center

More than 120 illegal immigrants have been loaded onto buses bound for immigration courts in Atlanta, 189 miles away. Hundreds more fled Emanuel County. Residents say many scattered into the woods, camping out for days. They worry some are still hiding without food.

At least one child, born a U.S. citizen, was left behind by his Mexican parents: 2-year-old Victor Perez-Lopez. The toddler's mother, Rosa Lopez, left her son with Julie Rodas when the raids began and fled the state. The boy's father was deported to Mexico.

""When his momma brought this baby here and left him, tears rolled down her face and mine too,"" Rodas said. ""She said, `Julie, will you please take care of my son because I have no money, no way of paying rent?'""

For five years, Rodas has made a living watching the children of workers at the Crider Inc. poultry plant, where the vast majority of employees were Mexican immigrants. She learned Spanish, and considered many immigrants among her closest friends. She threw parties for their children's birthdays and baptisms.

The only child in Rodas' care now, besides her own son, is Victor. Her customers have disappeared.

Federal agents also swarmed into a trailer park operated by David Robinson. Illegal immigrants were handcuffed and taken away. Almost none have returned. Robinson bought an American flag and posted it by the pond out front — upside down, in protest.

""These people might not have American rights, but they've damn sure got human rights,"" Robinson said. ""There ain't no reason to treat them like animals.""

The raids came during a fall election season in which immigration is a top issue.

Last month, the federal government reported that Georgia had the fastest-growing illegal immigrant population in the country. The number more than doubled from an estimated 220,000 in 2000 to 470,000 last year. This year, state lawmakers passed some of the nation's toughest measures targeting illegal immigrants, and Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue last week vowed a statewide crackdown on document fraud.

Other than the Crider plant, there isn't much in Stillmore. Four small stores, a coin laundry and a Baptist church share downtown with City Hall, the fire department and a post office. ""We're poor but proud,"" Mayor Marilyn Slater said, as if that is the town motto.

The 2000 Census put Stillmore's population at 730, but Slater said uncounted immigrants probably made it more than 1,000. Not anymore, with so many homes abandoned and the streets practically empty.

""This reminds me of what I read about Nazi Germany, the Gestapo coming in and yanking people up,"" Slater said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Marc Raimondi would not discuss details of the raids. ""We can't lose sight of the fact that these people were here illegally,"" Raimondi said.

At Sucursal Salina No. 2, a store stocked with Mexican fruit sodas and snacks, cashier Alberto Gonzalez said Wednesday that the owner may shutter the place. By midday, Gonzalez has had only six customers. Normally, he would see 100.

The B&S convenience store, owned by Keith and Regan Slater, the mayor's son and grandson, has lost about 80 percent of its business.

""These people come over here to make a better way of life, not to blow us up,"" complained Keith Slater, who keeps a portrait of Ronald Reagan on the wall. ""I'm a die-hard Republican, but I think we missed the boat with this one.""

Since the mid-1990s, Stillmore has grown dependent on the paychecks of Mexican workers who originally came for seasonal farm labor, picking the area's famous Vidalia onions. Many then took year-round jobs at the Crider plant, with a workforce of about 900.

Crider President David Purtle said the agents began inspecting the company's employment records in May. They found 700 suspected illegal immigrants, and supervisors handed out letters over the summer ordering them to prove they came to the U.S. legally or be fired. Only about 100 kept their jobs.

The arrests started at the plant Sept. 1. Over the Labor Day weekend, agents with guns and bulletproof vests converged on workers' homes after getting the addresses from Crider's files.

Antonio Lopez, who came here two years ago from Chiapas, Mexico, and worked at the Crider plant, said agents kicked in his front door. Lopez, 32, and his 15-year-old son were handcuffed and taken by bus to Atlanta with 30 others. Because of the boy, Lopez said, both were allowed to return. In his back pocket, he carries an order to return to Atlanta for a court hearing Feb. 2.

But now, ""there's no people here and I don't have any work,"" he said.

The poultry plant has limped along with half its normal workforce. Crider increased its starting wages by $1 an hour to help recruit new workers.

Stacie Bell, 23, started work canning chicken at Crider a week ago. She said the pay, $7.75 an hour, led her to leave her $5.60-an-hour job as a Wal-Mart cashier in nearby Statesboro. Still, Bell said she felt bad about the raids.

""If they knew eventually that they were going to have to do that, they should have never let them come over here,"" she said.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/georgia-town-abandoned-after-immigration-raid,N/A

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

On this Martin Luther King holiday weekend, the nation's capital is still reeling from president Trump's incendiary remarks about immigrants from Africa and Haiti.

His comments have reignited the debate of whether the president is a racist, and they have also derailed progress on a bipartisan deal on immigration, a setback that could lead to a government shutdown midnight Friday.

Joining me now for an exclusive interview, the new secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen.

Welcome to ""Fox News Sunday.""

KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Thank you. My pleasure.

WALLACE: Before we get to immigration, let's discuss that false alarm in Hawaii yesterday.

Just after 8:00 yesterday morning, people across the state got this alert: Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.

People were understandably terrified for 38 minutes before they got the all clear. Now, it turns out it was a state official who hit the wrong button. But as the head of federal DHS, what have you learned about the state of emergency preparedness in that state and across the country?

NIELSEN: You know, I think this is a very important topic and I just want to encourage everyone first and foremost not to draw the wrong conclusion. So, I would hate for anybody not to abide by alert warnings coming from government systems. They can trust government systems, we test them every day. This is a very unfortunate mistake.

But these alerts are vital, seconds and minutes can save lives. So, first, I would encourage everyone not to draw the wrong conclusions. Secondly, from a DHS perspective, we are looking with state and locals to ensure not only that the messaging is clear, but what to do next is clear as well, how we can best support them and work with them.

As you know, they are on the first lines and they are the first responders. Unfortunate situation, but we are all working together to make sure it doesn't happen again.

WALLACE: But, you know, this raises questions not only about emergency alerts, and as you say generally, we can -- we can trust him. It also raises questions about civil defense.

You know, I remember as a kid in the '50s, we’d all gone (ph) to public school, we’d get under desk and repair for the nuclear attack. When looking back on it, it's laughable. We don't have bomb shelters today, we did not have that kind of civil defense.

God forbid, if this were a real attack, if the North Koreans or somebody else had fired a missile over the horizon at an American city, what should folks on the ground do?

NIELSEN: It’s a good -- it's a good question. Of course, it depends on where you are and what the particular type of threat is. So, in this case, citizens who are in that could be affected, should look at any guidance and advice that comes out from the government.

FEMA has a whole variety of measures and preparedness of things they can do. Sometimes it's shelter in place. Sometimes as you saw in Hawaii, if you are in a car, they asked you to get out of the car and lay flat on the ground. So, it just depends, but the government has provided tremendous amounts of information we should all seek it out and make sure we know what we need to do as citizens.

WALLACE: Is it true that the Trump administration has not conducted a full scale exercise to plan for this kind of an event, and if so, how soon are you going to order a full scale exercise among all the principals and the government?

NIELSEN: So, when we look at response we all act under something called the national response framework. We test that very frequently. We use different scenarios.

We did have what's called a deputies committee. So, that's the deputy secretaries of the department, exercised in December specific to this threat and we had already planned to have that principal cabinet level exercise, if you will, early next month. We will continue on that.

But the national exercise program is very robust, as well as it should be. We need to both provide action after a real event and, of course, prepare for events unfortunately might befall us.

WALLACE: Let's turn to that meeting at the president held with a half dozen members of Congress on Thursday. They were discussing immigration from Africa.

And according to Democratic Senator Dick Durbin the president said this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: That’s when he used these vile and vulgar comments, calling the nations they come from (EXPLETIVE DELETED) holes. The exact words used by the president, not more -- not just once, but repeatedly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Secretary, you were in that meeting in the Oval Office. Did the president say that?

NIELSEN: I don't recall him saying that exact phrase. I think he has been clear and I would certainly say undoubtedly the president will use, continue to use strong language when it comes to this issue. He feels very passionate about it.

I think what was frustrating about that meeting for all of us in the meeting was that although the deal presented in theory and approach to the four pillars upon which we had agreed, did not address the core security issues that we need to do our job. And more importantly, there's nothing in there that would prevent us from getting here again.

So, we’re not interested in half measures. We don't want additional temporary populations here. It's unfair to them, it's unfair to American citizens and it certainly raises security risks.

WALLACE: I don’t understand -- I’m just going to press back on you once on this subject. It seems to me -- you were in the meeting when these comments were made. I can understand you either saying they were sad or they were not said. It is pretty shocking language and to say I don't recall seems implausible.

If the president of the United States use the word blank-hole talking about countries in the Oval Office or didn't say it, I would know.

NIELSEN: I understand the question. It was an impassioned conversation. I don't recall that specific phrase being used, that's all I can say about that.

WALLACE: There are several things about the president's comments, alleged comments, and are both Republicans and Democrats who confirm that he sent it. One is the president seems to be writing off people who come from black countries, while he saying we should take people coming from one of the whitest countries on earth, Norway.

Here was a comment from an official at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RUPERT COLVILLE, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS SPOKESMAN: I’m sorry, but there's no other word one can use but racist. You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as of (EXPLETIVE DELETED), whose entire populations who are not white, and therefore not welcome.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Isn't that the definition of racism, to say we don't want people from these black countries, but we do want people from a very white country?

NIELSEN: I think what the president is saying is he’d like to move to merit-based, which is based on an individual. So, whether individuals can come here and can contribute to our society, help our economy, assimilating communities, and help America be better.

I take a little bit of offense to the comments and suggestions that the president is racist. What he's looking at is the exact merit-based system we have in Australia and Canada. I’m sure that we are not, any of us, suggesting that Canada and Australia and their leaders are racists.

WALLACE: But the president seems in these comments to be equating merit to the countries that people come from. He seems to be suggesting you’d rather have a janitor from Norway than a doctor from Haiti.

NIELSEN: I disagree. I think --

WALLACE: Why would merit have to do with the country? Why would it have to do with your qualifications?

NIELSEN: I think it does. I think what he's trying to do is move away from a quota based system, whether that's a quota of underrepresented countries or a quota of Norway, for example. I think what he's trying to say is we need to look at the individual and ensure that we look at those who can bring merit to our country.

WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the practical implication of that because the big question in Washington now is chances for a deal on DACA. The president tweeted out this morning, and let's put it up on the screen.

DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.

One, is DACA dead? Is there a chance for it? And is the president willing to see the government shutdown if Democrats insist on linking a DACA deal to funding for the government before it runs out of money midnight on Friday?

NIELSEN: I do not believe DACA is dead, but what I would say is for my perspective, of course, as the secretary of homeland security, it's not a DACA deal. It's a security immigration deal. What my role this is, is to ensure that we don't end up here again. We must close these loopholes to ensure that these temporary populations not only are not encouraged to take the dangerous journey to get there, but then when they get there, we are able to promptly remove them so we don't end up with the category of DACA again.

In terms of the funding, what I would say is in my opinion where I sit it's completely responsible to tie the two together. We need to fund our troops, we need to protect them, we need to increase homeland security. These are vital national security interest we need to fund. To tie them into a DACA deal or the actual expiration date is in March is irresponsible.

WALLACE: So, if the Democrats insist on linkage and the government shuts down, that's on them?

NIELSEN: Well, it would be very unfortunate if they continue to do that. They are not the same conversation. I think you heard Democratic leaders say just that in the past.

WALLACE: One more DACA question. A federal judge this week blocked the administration decision to phase out DACA and wrote of -- and let's put this on the screen.

A plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.

Your reaction to that and how quickly will the administration appeal that judge's decision blocking the phasing out of DACA?

NIELSEN: On the appeal, I’d refer to the attorney general. We will be in close contact on that.

With respect to the quote, I find that offensive on its face. I took an oath when I became secretary of homeland security to defend and support the Constitution. The program was unconstitutional.

What we should be focused on instead of these court interventions and these distractions is that we need a permanent solution. We have said that, I have said that, the president has said that. We want to find a permanent solution to the DACA population, not a continual three-year renewal period.

WALLACE: All right. In the short period of time we have left, I want to ask you about some of the issues that are facing your department. Border apprehensions are down 40 percent in 2017, which some administration officials have called the Trump effect. But in December, there was a significant increase as the border patrol caught more than 40,000 people attempting illegal crossings.

Why has it gone back up?

NIELSEN: It's a great question and I appreciate you asking because I think it's very important for the viewers to understand this.

The problem is that we have so many loopholes within our legal system based on a panoply of court decisions, confusion with respect to the laws and how we can enforce them that if you are in the South or Central America, those who would wish to smuggle you are able to tell you if you get to America you can stay. So, more and more are willing to undertake the journey because there is no way for me to promptly remove them.

So, we talk about the wall, the wall is a very, very important part of this. It works, but it only gets us partway there because if I can stop them at the border but I can't remove them, that's not border security. And they will continue to come.

WALLACE: So, what some people are saying is the reason it's going back up is because for all the tough talk from the president, people in Central America, smugglers and people wanting to come across, they finally decided the system really hasn't changed.

NIELSEN: The system is worse. Every time a court makes a patchwork decision based on one individual, we continue to exacerbate the systemic failure of the system. My troops (ph) cannot remove those that they apprehend, whether they are criminals in some cases or whether there are multiple repeat illegal entry. We have to change these loopholes so that we can promptly remove them.

WALLACE: Finally, this week, federal agents raided 98 7-Eleven stores in 17 states in the District of Columbia, resulting in 21 arrests. Will you order more raids on employers in this country, and what’s the message you're trying to send?

NIELSEN: Yes, and the message we're trying to send is if you consistently and willfully disregard the laws that the Congress and the American people have passed, and you will be held accountable. These are not accidental hiring as illegal immigrants. Some of these countries unfortunately have continually and systematically tried to get around the system. Hire illegal aliens, which affects the ability of the American workers, but it also continues to encourage those who might not otherwise take the journey to take the journey.

So, we are looking to the employers to try to stop this bad behavior and hold them accountable.

WALLACE: Secretary Nielsen, thank you.

NIELSEN: Oh, it’s my pleasure.

WALLACE: Thanks for coming into this holiday weekend. Please come back.

NIELSEN: I would love to.

WALLACE: Right.

NIELSEN: Thank you so much.

WALLACE: Up next, reaction from Xavier Becerra, who is California's attorney general, has filed several lawsuits against the Trump administration on immigration issues, and just won a temporary reprieve for the Dreamers. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Just before President Trump's shocking comments this week about immigrants from Africa and Haiti, a federal judge in California blocked his move to end DACA.

Joining me now from Sacramento, Xavier Becerra, attorney general of California and a former Democratic congressional leaders who filed that lawsuit.

Mr. Attorney General, you just heard Secretary Nielsen. What’s your reaction to her defense of the president's position in that meeting with Senator Durbin and others this week?

XAVIER BECERRA, D-CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Chris, I don't know if it's defensible, and it's disturbing to see so many people with such short-term memory losses and the inability to recall a conversation, important conversation that has taken place just a few days ago. Can you imagine what happens when you have a conversation about nuclear war or what we do about natural disasters and you have a room of people who can't remember what was said just a few days ago? That's dangerous.

WALLACE: Do you think President Trump is a racist?

BECERRA: In every respect, what he is showing us is that he is a racist.

Let me put it to you this way -- mental instability, mendacity, now bigotry. Having any one of those in the White House is dangerous. Having the combination? That's lethal.

WALLACE: What about the argument -- get beyond the words, and I understand the words are hard to get beyond. But this question of merit based immigration what about the argument that too many of our immigration programs, family unification, or as it's also called chain migration, visa lotteries, do more to help people from other countries than they do to attract and to bring in people to this country who can best help us?

BECERRA: I can only speak to you, Chris, from the perspective of a son of two of those immigrants. And I can simply tell you that with a man who had a chance to go to the sixth grade, a mother who didn't get past 18 years of age when she finally got here, both of them never having had a chance to step on a college campus. They did a great job of getting four kids a college education or military service and a man who couldn't walk into a restaurant when he was young because of the sign that said no dogs or Mexicans allowed, well, because of his children had a chance to walk into the White House to meet the president of the United States. Not this one, but the president of the United States.

So, in every respect, my dad, a proverbial ditch digger, built this country. And now, the results are that his grandkids are going to some of the finest colleges and universities and they are not going on any taxpayer's dime because their parents can afford to have them go.

My mom was a whiz when it came to finances, and because of them, today, they live in retirement, better than they ever lived when they were both working.

Those are two examples of immigrants who came to this country with little and gave so much.

WALLACE: Let's talk about the situation here in Washington right now because Democrats are threatening to shut down the government, to refuse to vote for another funding bill when the government runs out of money at midnight Friday if they don't get a deal on DACA. I -- this seems to directly contradict something that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said a few years ago when the Republicans were threatening President Obama. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NEW YORK: We believe strongly in immigration reform. We can say we are shutting down the government, we’re not going to raise the debt ceiling until you pass immigration reform. It would be governmental chaos.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Mr. Attorney General, if it was wrong for Republicans to threaten a Democratic president and to threaten to hold the government hostage, why is it all right for Democrats to do exactly the same thing?

BECERRA: Chris, I don't believe Democrats are doing anything to try to hold up a government funding bill. They are just not agreeing with the outlines of what Republicans have put forward in the Republican funding bill. And they are objecting to this budget because right after -- less than a month after passing a $1.5 trillion tax break bill which benefited mostly the super-rich and corporations, all of a sudden, having used the government credit card to pay for that, now Republicans want to cut benefits for veterans, for seniors, for students, for working-class Americans to pay for that tax cut.

WALLACE: Wait, wait --

(CROSSTALK)

BECERRA: Democrats are saying, we’re not going to take part in that.

WALLACE: Number one, they haven't called for cutting all those benefits. Number two, that's not specifically the question I’m asking you. I’m asking you specifically about the fact that Democrats are saying no deal on spending. I agree, they have to work out the spending deal -- but no deal on spending and less you also pass a DACA fix. That's what some people say is holding the government hostage.

Do you think the Democrats should link funding for the government to a deal on DACA?

BECERRA: Chris, if you listen closely what Democrats have been saying is that we need to have a deal on DACA because President Trump, by trying to repeal DACA has created this chaos.

I will tell my Democratic friends the following: DACA is now actually alive and Homeland Security Department is now accepting renewal applications. So, it's nowhere near dead.

I would hope it would not agree to any bad deals on immigration, talking really bad stuff that has nothing to do with helping our borders in order to get a DACA deal. That DACA deal should stand on its own, it should be clean. Worrying about the budget is what Republicans and the majority in the House and the Senate should be doing because otherwise the government shuts down.

And so, Republicans are threatening to shut down the government unless they get a whole bunch of bad stuff on immigration. And I believe Democrats are saying, let's do a clean fix on DACA because it has nothing to do with the budget. If we could tie it all together, great, but don't try to hold young people hostage to get a budget and certainly don't try to load up a bill with that stuff whether in the budget or on immigration.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Let me just interrupt because I’m closer to Washington now than you were, although you were a Democratic leader here for years.

But no, the Democrats are -- Republicans rather are not insisting on linking DACA and immigration. They just want to pass a funding bill and, in fact, they are talking about a three or four-week continuing resolution.

Let me switch to another subject, because you brought up the fact that DACA is alive and well now. And one of the reasons it’s alive and well is because you as California's attorney general filed a lawsuit where the judge agreed to stop the phasing out of DACA by March.

I want to ask you about that because this -- it seems to me, sir, is not the no-brainer that some people suggested. President Obama didn't even create the DACA act. It didn't even protect the Dreamers until 2012, almost four full years into his term when he was running for reelection. Why doesn't, just as a matter of principle and law, why doesn't President Trump have the same right to end DACA? And in fact, he doesn't want to end DACA. He just wants to be a congressional law, not an executive action.

But why doesn't he have the same right to move on DACA that President Obama did when he started four years into his term?

BECERRA: Chris, because no person in this country, even the president, is above the law. If he wants to take an action he must do it according to the law.

And as the judge held in this case, the president and his administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously. And so, that's why we've been able to have several victories. It's kind of poetic that the son of immigrants is the person wielding the legal slingshot against the Trump administration's attacks on our constitutional civil rights.

But the reason we keep winning, in fact, we are batting a thousand against this administration is because the president believes he is above the law and he continues to act arbitrarily and capriciously and taking action. If you want to change the law, Chris, don't break it.

WALLACE: Well, I’m not sure I understand how he's breaking it. He was saying this was an executive order taken by the president. It wasn't even a law and here you had Donald Trump saying I am resending that executive order giving six months to do so.

Why is that breaking the law?

BECERRA: Because, Chris, you go about a process. Even President Obama went about a process to establish an executive order. You go about a process.

Remember, you have a whole bunch of people in this country when our government takes action, they start to rely on the representations of our government, to their detriment. And so, whether it's the consumer who decides to get health care or the consumer who decides to go send his kids to particular college, it's based on certain representation oftentimes that the government says, we will be there in this respect of health care or an education or on immigration.

And if you are going to try to unwind that you've got to do it through the right process, and clearly the president has continued to be arbitrary and capricious in the way he's tried to undo things. And that's why as I said before we haven't lost a case yet against Donald Trump, a guy who should know how to operate in the courts since he's been sued or sued himself thousands of times.

WALLACE: All right. I got one final question. I got less than a minute left.

You have condemned the president's decision to remove temporary protected status from Salvadorans and there are 50,000 of them living in California who have been here since the earthquakes in El Salvador way back in 2001.

The question I have though, sir, just as a kind of matter of common sense. The earthquakes ended. The devastation was repaired. Why are people still here 17 years later on temporary protected status?

BECERRA: Clearly, things are broken both in those countries that sent a lot of those immigrants and in our own immigration system. And over the course of some two decades, those individuals who were the victims of that broken system on both sides have --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But it wasn’t a political system, sir. It was earthquakes. They came in because of a natural disaster. Why should they stay here?

There are a lot of broken countries, that doesn't mean we take them all in.

BECERRA: We don’t. And we don’t.

Why should we take them in over an earthquake that happened 17 years ago? Continue to have them here?

BECERRA: We don't. And, Chris, we don’t. What we do is we tell the country get yourself -- get back on your feet. We’re not going to try to make things more difficult for you to get back on your feet.

Two decades have gone by. Those individuals in this country have now established businesses. They have gone to schools here. They have families here. And to, all of a sudden, just jerked the rug from underneath them, I don't think it's the American way.

And I do believe Congress should try to resolve this because it is a program that was not meant to be permanent. But Congress could take action as it has in the past to address it. And I think it would be only correct and right to do so because these are people who have made major investments in this country to make it better.

WALLACE: Attorney General Becerra, thank you. Thanks for your time. It's always good to talk to you whether it's here in Washington or in California.

BECERRA: Thanks, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss where Congress is in talks about immigration and spending, with the clock ticking down to a government shutdown midnight Friday.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: Coming up, Congress continues work on an immigration bill as the clock ticks down to a government shutdown.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-MINORITY LEADER: A resolution to the DACA issue must be part of a global deal on the budget.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel if Congress can get a deal done and what will happen to the dreamers, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When this group comes back, hopefully with an agreement, this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it. I think I will be signing it. I'm not going to say, oh, gee, I want this or I want that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump on Tuesday predicting smooth sailing for a DACA deal of that televised meeting with two dozen members of Congress. Of course, all that fell apart later this week in an explosive meeting in the Oval Office.

And it's time now for our Sunday group.

Former press secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, Adrienne Elrod, former director of strategic communications for Hillary Clinton's campaign, and John Bussey from The Wall Street Journal.

Well, Marc, I understand the argument intellectually that we should go to a merit-based system of immigration, but I want to pick up on the discussion I had with Secretary Nielsen because what troubles a lot of people is the idea that we're equating country of origin with merit and -- and -- and it raises the issue, what's better, as I said, a janitor from Norway or a doctor or an engineer from Haiti?

MARC LOTTER, FORMER VP PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I don't think the president is talking about making any kind of geographic or quotas based on any country. He's --

WALLACE: But he did say that.

LOTTER: Well, what he was saying is that -- he's basically saying, because right now under the current system we are -- we are have -- we do have quotas. We do have random lotteries where people, not based on their skill, just because they apply, our allowed entry into our country. He's basically saying that let's judge the people who want to come and move to America based on who they are, not where they're from.

WALLACE: Juan -- I mean, forgive me, it doesn't seem to me that's what the president said and --

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think -- that's not what the reporting indicates. The reporting indicates that --

WALLACE: And -- and then let me -- let me just put up first --

WILLIAMS: Oh --

WALLACE: Before -- I'll get to you in a second, what House Speaker Paul Ryan said reacting to the president's comments.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. PAUL RYAN, R-HOUSE SPEAKER: My family, like a whole lot of people, came from Ireland on what they called coffin ships then, came here and worked the railroads. The Irish were really looked down upon back in those days. I here all these stories from my relatives about Irish need not apply.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: And that, I guess, is the point. Throughout our history, people come to this country because the situation in their countries is bad and it's often the best and the brightest who take the initiative to take that step to sail across the Atlantic Ocean or fly across the Atlantic Ocean from a much worse situation.

WILLIAMS: Correct. And I think that that's why, you know, on the Statue of Liberty we have emblazon that phrase, that American idea that we will take your people who are burdened, oppressed, you know, people who have been left behind and judged to be inferior and we make them. And I think this is what Lindsey Graham was saying to the president in the Oval Office. Come to America and adapt the idea of this as a place of opportunity and political freedom and stability. And that's -- that's the American idea. It's not based on where you come from, certainly not the Irish that you just heard Paul Ryan talk about, not for Italians, not for Jews, not for Catholics. At one point in our history, all those groups have come up against this kind of bigotry. So I think for Paul Ryan to say this is unhelpful, huh, how about, you know, say clearly that this is racist and un-American?

WALLACE: I just want you to respond before I bring everybody else in.

LOTTER: Well, again, I think what we are talking about here is, in the future. I mean we -- we have a great history of immigration. And no one can -- and no one debates that. And no one -- and on one debates the countless contributions that have been made by immigrants and now second, third, multiple generations of immigrants to our country.

But as we are moving forward, as we face challenges in terms of homeland security, and as we are trying to get more people jobs in America, putting American workers above the needs of other people who may not be coming in here with the skills to be able to compete. There was a study that said over half of immigrant lead families are receiving some sort of welfare. Three quarters of those families with children are receiving some sort of welfare. Can we -- can we not look at who we are bringing in? And that's what the president is saying, not necessarily where you're from, that's -- that's --

WALLACE: But -- but he didn't say that. He did say exactly where they're from. He didn't say, you know, we need to bring in doctors and engineers. We don't need to bring in ditch diggers.

LOTTER: Let's look at the context of what that conversation was about. In this -- in this immigration --

WALLACE: I'm not -- I mean it was what -- the language he used, sir.

LOTTER: Well, I understand. But when you look at the way that the context of that conversation, it was -- it was supposedly in a broad immigration discussion and it was also talking about TPS.

WILLIAMS: What he's talking about is the lottery program --

LOTTER: Where we're talking about some of those --

WILLIAMS: And in the lottery system, what he clearly said was, why do we need people from these s-hole countries because right now they're underrepresented. And the reason the lottery exists is to make sure that there's more adequate representation of people who have not been coming.

WALLACE: All right, let me -- let me --

WILLIAMS: And he spoke not about the countries when saying that, but about the people who would be included in the lottery. That's why it's so personal to people like me.

WALLACE: Let me bring in Adrienne.

This is a good moment. You're a Democratic -- or strategist. This is a good moment for Democrats. A good political moment for Democrats. But should they actually take the final step they're threatening to take, which is to link DACA and a deal on DACA to funding the government and risk a government shutdown? Is that smart politics?

ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, absolutely it is. And here's why, Chris.

Number one, Democrats have absolutely no control in the -- of the House, or the Senate, or the White House. Republicans have full control right now. This is the only bargaining chip that Democrats have. We are tired of seeing these DACA recipients not have a fix. We are tired of watching Republicans play, you know, political football with their lives. This is our last bargaining chip. January 19th is the last train coming.

So, look, Democrats have made it very clear, we will compromise on DACA and we will have border -- stronger border security. We will make a compromise. But we are absolutely not going to allow DACA recipients any longer to live in the state of limbo.

WALLACE: John?

JOHN BUSSEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: You know something, I -- this seems to be an issue, again, about messaging from the president. Marc's interpretation of his remarks is a generous one, right, that he's really talking about it being a meritocracy. We -- we're going to get more physicists from Norway than we are going to get from -- from Haiti. That's the generous interpretation.

The failure of the message is that it leaves open this big discussion of whether or not the president is a racist because of the language that he chose. Similarly, coming off of that Tuesday meeting, which was an incredible hit for him, that was a remarkable public relations success for the president, looking very presidential, having Democrats and Republicans in the room, getting along civilly over disagreements that were fundamental to the two parties. And then the very next day having -- having changed the narrative away from Russia, away from the ""Fire and Fury"" book the questioned his mental stability, the very next day coming back and attacking the courts on their DACA decision, on saying that he's going to change the libel laws so that books can't be written about him that are negative. On attacking Dianne Feinstein that morning the day before she sat across from him at the table.

This is what's working against the president in any negotiation over DACA, over the spending bill, over immigration in general.

WALLACE: Let me ask you about a different aspect of this though because the president took some heat from that big televised meeting because a lot of people in his base said he seemed too soft, to open, let's get a deal, let's -- I'll sign anything you want. Maybe he didn't intend to do it quite the way that he did it, but aren't there some people in his base who are going to be reassured by the hard line he took in that Oval Office meeting?

BUSSEY: Absolutely. And we saw some very far right wing elements say, hey, we liked the language of, you know, s-hole that you used. But is that in his interest right now? He's looking at 2018. Some very dicey elections, campaign coming up. He -- it's in his interest to have a win on DACA, on the spending bill. It's in the interest of the Democrats similarly. They are fairly close, honestly, to reaching some kind of agreement. Democrats have agreed to spend something on a version of a wall, whatever it might be. That gives the president a fig leaf, some face, while also getting DACA advanced. Why not close that deal as opposed to endangerment it right before the CR expires, when it's in the interest of the Democrats to show a dysfunctional White House.

ELROD: And, Chris, the votes are there. I mean if we're looking at a bipartisan bill, the votes are there. There are enough Democrats and Republicans who will come together on this bill and supported a DACA fix, whether it's a clean DACA fix or whether it's a DACA fix that actually has a border security element. We even have the progressive wing of the party, senators like Kamila Harris, who have said, I will support a border security agreement as well, or border security -- strengthening border security. But ultimately the votes are there. Republicans have the task of actually putting this bill on the floor.

WILLIAMS: Yes, but the question is what happens when talk -- right wing talk radio. Ann Coulter said it was the lowest moment of the American -- of Trump's presidency this week because he engaged in that kind of talk. And I think you can see this now that the far right, the Freedom Caucus, is really going to put heat on him and he says this week in the meeting, John, he says, I'll take the heat. Well, Mr. President, this is your chance because the votes are there.

WALLACE: Yes. OK.

ELROD: Yes.

WALLACE: All right, folks, we have to take a break here. When we come back, President Trump says he won't re-impose sanctions on Iran and the nuclear deal, but he gives Congress and European allies a deadline of 120 days to fix the agreement.

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the deal? Should the U.S. stick with it or rip it up? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: President Trump back in October reluctantly agreeing to stay in the Iran nuclear deal, but the White House announced Friday Congress and our European allies have 120 days to fix it or the U.S. will pull out. And we're back now with the panel.

John, the president is demanding two big changes to the Iran nuclear deal. I want to put them up on the screen.

First, inspectors must have access to any site they want in Iran. And, second, elimination of so-called sunset provisions that Iran would be able to restart parts of its nuclear program in ten or 15 years. Is there any reason to believe that either Iran or our European allies, who negotiated this deal with us, are going to agree to rewrite it?

BUSSEY: Yes, he wants a third thing, too, which is something said about their missile program, containing their missile program. Those are three things that a lot of people can agree on, that these are issues that need to be resolved before we move ahead with continuing the program as it is, on the left, on the right, in Europe and here.

The problem is, there's an agreement and it's set. And it took a long time to get to it. There are six countries that are signers of that agreement, not just us, five others, with Iran, that -- that have signed that agreement that don't agree with the United States on reopening it. France has said no. Germany's not encouraging this. China and Russia. The United Kingdom. They're not in favor of kind of reopening this.

So the president may find himself on the outs with his allies and Iran. And this might be something like we saw with TPP, where we move away from an agreement, but the agreement has a life of its own. There (INAUDIBLE) with Iran. We would just be on the out of that as we are with the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

WALLACE: I want to pick up on that. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook from Michael P. Mulhall, who incidentally we have put up questions from before. So good for Michael. What are the possible consequences to the U.S. -- to the U.S., should the Trump administration decertified the Obama Iran nuclear deal?

Juan, how do you answer Michael?

WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's two levels. One is, I think if you decertify, it makes it more likely, not less likely, that Iran gets nukes and therefore is a greater threat to our important ally Israel in the Middle East. The second thing to say is it signals to our allies that we are not to be trusted having signed a deal. We signed that deal, made a deal, and America has to keep its word going forward if, as we heard in the question, people are asking about U.S. as an effective negotiator in any international arena.

WALLACE: Michael will have a follow-up for you.

WILLIAMS: I think -- and I'm looking forward to Michael's next question.

WALLACE: No, I -- we get questions from him every week. We appreciate that, Michael. Probably (INAUDIBLE) here on the panel.

There's another big story brewing. There are reports that the president's legal team is negotiating with the special counsel's team, Robert Mueller's team, about terms for an interview in the Russia investigation. Last June Mr. Trump said that he would 100 percent be willing to answer questions, but it was a different story this week. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Certainly I'll see what happens. But when they have no collusion and nobody has found any collision at any level, it seems unlikely that you'd even have an interview.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Adrienne, what happens if the president decides he is not going to sit down with Robert Mueller and his team?

ELROD: Well, look, he has a couple of options. I mean, number one, and I think his attorneys would probably do this, they would say, maybe before we actually sit down with you for an interview, Mr. Mueller, let's think about, you know, maybe a signed affidavit or answering questions in a written context. But, ultimately, the president of the United States, he owes this to the American people to explain, in his own words, what happened. If there was really no collusion with Russia, then sitting down with Special Counsel Mueller should not even be an issue with him.

So, again, he is the president of the United States. He certainly has the option to plead the, you know, the fifth. But essentially if he wants to get to the bottom of this investigation and restore any sort of public trust --

WALLACE: But what would Democrats do if the president pleaded the fifth?

ELROD: Well, I think it would be a real -- I think it would be a real big problem. He certainly has that option. I don't think it's politically tenable for him to do it, but he certainly has that option as any American would under our constitutional rights. But, ultimately, if he wants to nip this in about the bud, he needs to have a conversation and needs to do it in an interview format with the special counsel.

WALLACE: Marc, do you think it's possible that the president will refuse to sit down for an interview with Robert Mueller?

LOTTER: I don't know. I mean the president's personal layers right now are dealing with a special counsel on that. They have been cooperative from the beginning. They continue to be cooperative. So they'll have those discussions. I mean, who knows, maybe they're asking right now if they can get the Hillary Clinton treatment, you know, on an interview with the FBI where, you know, you do it and then the decision's already been made beforehand.

So I don't know what those details are, but, you know, he's been very transparent. There's still no evidence of collusion. And we'll trust the lawyers to work that out.

WALLACE: Adrienne, which like to respond to the (INAUDIBLE) Hillary Clinton?

ELROD: No, I just -- I just think -- I think from the broad context, it's -- I find it so laughable that every time Republicans have -- that this issue comes up, you guys immediately pivot to, you know, bringing Secretary Clinton in to try to deflect from, you know, the real issue here. So --

LOTTER: Well, so far that is still the only collusion that's been proven.

ELROD: OK. All right. Well, that is -- that is your take, not --

BUSSEY: But this is not about collusion alone.

ELROD: Exactly.

BUSSEY: This is -- there's an obstruction of justice question that's outstanding. And so the administration pivots to collusion when it should be answering the question, is Mueller wanting to talk to the president about the possibility of obstruction of justice?

WILLIAMS: Yes, not only that, there's a constitutional crisis in the making here if the president refuses to talk to Mueller because then you put the Congress in the position of saying to the president, you must comply. In order to have credibility for our justice system, this to be a country of laws, the president, as the chief law enforcement officer, cannot be exempt from the laws of the United States.

WALLACE: Well, and that raises this specific question --

ELROD: Right.

WALLACE: And, again, all of this is speculative, but Robert Mueller could go to a court and get a subpoena --

WILLIAMS: Yes.

WALLACE: A court order for the president to testify. I think that's what happened with Bill Clinton.

LOTTER: Yes, I believe that's what I recall.

WALLACE: So that's not politically tenable for the president to refuse to submit to a subpoena, a court order.

LOTTER: Well, and it's all speculation right now. They're still talking. So if he comes back with a subpoena, that deal is an entirely different level then whether they're having voluntary conversations and back and forth in terms of what may be on the table and what parameters may be set for an interview, those kinds of things.

But, again, the president's personal lawyers and the special counsel have been -- have been cooperating the entire time. They continue to be cooperative. And we'll see whether -- how this goes out.

WALLACE: John, I -- we've got less than a minute left. But what interests me is the fact that whatever -- we'd like to move on with this president. Highs like the tax bill, lows like the comments in the Oval Office this week. But -- but the Russian investigation, both possible collusion, obstruction of justice, continues to cast a shadow over this presidency.

BUSSEY: Yes, it does. And that's what this is about. That's what all of the tangling with lawyers is about. That's what the constant iteration that there's no collusion is about. It's the feeling that this Russia investigation is expanding, is possibly getting closer to the Trump organization or the Trump family or perhaps the president himself. We just don't know yet. There are a lot of outstanding, you know, questions that haven't been resolved. And so it's the big play, it is the big issue along with 2018.

WALLACE: All right, panel. And 2018, that's another big subject too. We'll talk about that.

Thank you. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" From hard hits on the field, to heavy lifting on The Hill, we'll follow a pro football player's journey to House Speaker Paul Ryan's office.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Eight years ago I was at the headquarters for the Washington Redskins to do a profile of the team's new head coach. One of the players walking off the practice field said he watched this program every week. Who was that political junkie? Here's our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DERRICK DOCKERY, BUSINESS COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR SPEAKER RYAN: What I do on a daily basis, I basically block and tackle. It's my job to build key alliances to help move the speaker's agenda forward.

WALLACE: Derrick Dockery has been a staffer for House Speaker Paul Ryan for the last two years, working on everything from the tax bill, to school choice. But when he uses football analogies, it's not just talk. Dockery was an offensive lineman in the NFL for ten years.

WALLACE (on camera): Which is tougher, politics or football?

DOCKERY: I was born to play football and now I've been having to transition from the field to The Hill. Obviously it was a tough transition, but with the help of a great team around me, it's easy now.

WALLACE (voice over): Dockery says he didn't care about politics until two of his fellow lineman on the Buffalo Bills pulled him into their discussions.

DOCKERY: Well, every day they would bring in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times. We'd talk taxes, religion, national security.

WALLACE: The turning point.

DOCKERY: One day I looked at my paycheck and I began to think about taxes. I was like, man, I pay a lot of taxes.

WALLACE: During two stents on the Washington Redskins, Dockery made some contacts which led to the next step.

WALLACE (on camera): You're an NFL player. You're making some good money. Why did you decide you wanted to be an intern in the off-season?

DOCKERY: Because I wanted to transition well. I wanted -- I was thinking about what's next.

WALLACE (voice over): He got a job interning on the House Budget Committee, then chaired by Paul Ryan.

WALLACE (on camera): What did your teammates think?

DOCKERY: They loved it. I mean they -- they used to always say, I look at political Dockery. It got so bad I would watch C-SPAN. No, I loved it. I couldn't get enough of it.

So this is pretty cool.

WALLACE (voice over): Dockery took us out of the speakers' balcony, looking down the National Mall, to reflect on his remarkable journey.

DOCKERY: You play at FedEx Field in front of like 80,000, 85,000 screaming fans --

WALLACE (on camera): Right.

DOCKERY: And this is surreal too. You think about just the history.

WALLACE: You know the best part, you don't have to choose, because you've done both.

DOCKERY: I've done both, right. So I get the best of both worlds.

WALLACE (voice over): Which brought up the politics of football.

WALLACE (on camera): How do you feel about NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem?

DOCKERY: We need to pay attention to criminal justice and the inequities in our country. We should always strive for a more perfect union. But to me personally I'm not comfortable using the anthem as a protest.

WALLACE: Would you let your son play football?

DOCKERY: I would. If you ask my wife, she'd give you a different answer. But if it was up to me, I would.

WALLACE: So the answer is no.

DOCKERY: The answer is no. Yes.

Tonight is about you having tons of fun.

WALLACE (voice over): Dockery and his wife started a non-profit called Yellow Ribbons United to help veterans and to support the families of the fallen and military who were still serving.

DOCKERY: The reason why we do this is because of my wife's brother, who we lost in Afghanistan, Sergeant David Williams. He really inspired us to give back.

WALLACE: It's all part of a tough transition --

DOCKERY: (INAUDIBLE) how you doing? Good to see you again.

WALLACE: Derrick Dockery has made look easy.

DOCKERY: I enjoy getting up every day and having a purpose. I'm not at home trying to figure out what's next. I enjoy working with people. I enjoy being a part of a team. And that's the main thing, being a part of a team.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Dockery says he has no plans to run for office, but he doesn't rule it out.

To learn more about his charity, Yellow Ribbons United, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""

7-Eleven immigration raids net 21 arrests; nearly 100 stores targeted,"Federal immigration agents arrested 21 suspected illegal immigrants Wednesday after auditing about 100 7-Eleven stores as a part of four-year investigation into the employees’ immigration statuses.

Wednesday’s operation stemmed from a 2013 investigation under the Obama administration that found managers used stolen identities to hire 115 illegal immigrants and pay them below minimum wage, court documents said. Officials called it the largest immigration action against an employer under Donald Trump's presidency.

Nine 7-Eleven franchisees and managers in New York and Virginia were charged.

Since then, eight people have pleaded guilty and were ordered to pay more than $2.6 million in back wages.

The most recent audit comes as President Donald Trump aims to expand border security and immigration policy. Deportation arrests have increased by 40 percent under the new administration.

Acting head of ICE’S Homeland Security Investigations Derek Benner said Wednesday’s audit was “the first of many” to come for employers across the country.

""This is what we're gearing up for this year and what you're going to see more and more of is these large-scale compliance inspections, just for starters,"" Benner said.

Following these inspections, officials have said they'll decide whether the cases warrant a criminal investigation.

Employer audits ramped up under the Obama administration, with more than 3,100 just in 2013.

ICE’s top official, Thomas D. Homan, said in a statement that this type of hiring is a key factor that draws illegal immigrants into the U.S., The Washington Post reported.

""Businesses that hire illegal workers are a pull factor for illegal immigration and we are working hard to remove this magnet,"" Homan’s statement said. ""ICE will continue its efforts to protect jobs for American workers by eliminating unfair competitive advantages for companies that exploit illegal immigration.""

Despite 7-Eleven being the target in the latest audits, Benner said all employers would going to susceptible to inspection.

""It's not going to be limited to large companies or any particular industry, big medium and small,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the House GOP rolled out its new immigration and border security bill which included a measure making it mandatory for employers to check that they're strictly hiring legal workers.

7-Eleven Stores Inc. released a statement pointing out that owners of its Franchises are responsible for hiring and verifying workers eligibility.

Arkansas church insists sign saying ‘heaven has strict immigration laws’ was not political,"A Springdale, Arkansas church incurred backlash after putting up a sign they insist was meant to be biblical, and not in any way political.

""Heaven has strict immigration laws,"" the sign read. ""Hell has open borders.""

'COLLEGIATE DAY OF PRAYER' AIMS FOR A 'SPIRITUAL AWAKENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES'

Springdale Apostolic Faith Church, which is in an area with a large Hispanic population, was criticized by some members who felt insulted by the sign.

""A lot of undocumented and just in general immigrant people live in that area where the church is located and having to pass by that message every day, I don't think it's something they should have to go through,"" Irvin Camacho told FOX 24. ""This is a welcoming community.""

Alice Gachuzo-Colin, who also lives in the area, said she almost wrecked her car when she saw the marquee, calling it a ""slap in the face"" in such a diverse area.

But the church says the message was misconstrued and removed the word ""immigration"" from the sign.

""My wife actually came up with it before anyone else,"" Assistant Pastor Michael Pennington told the local FOX affiliate. ""The reason we put that sign up was to tell everybody it is not easy to make heaven. If you read scriptures, it tells them the road to hell is wide and broad, but the road to heaven is narrow and straight.""

Pennington noted that he ran the signage by several church leaders who never made the political connection to President Trump's bush for a border wall.

Fake immigration attorney charged with filing hundreds of fraudulent asylum claims for migrants,"A Florida man is accused of filing more than 200 fraudulent asylum applications for migrants while posing as a fake immigration attorney, prosecutors announced Wednesday.

Elvis Harold Reyes, 56, of Brandon, was charged Monday with mail fraud, making false statements in immigration documents, and aggravated identity theft, according to a press release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Prosecutors said Reyes owned and operated EHR Ministries Inc., while portraying himself as an immigration attorney (despite having never been a licensed attorney), pastor, accountant, immigration expert, former immigration officials, and former federal law enforcement officer.

According to the indictment, Reyes targeted undocumented immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries in Florida who were seeking driver licenses and work authorization. He allegedly gave false or incompletely legal and immigration advice so the victims would retain his services.

Prosecutors said victims paid Reyes to represent them in immigration-related matters before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and other agencies.

Reyes allegedly filed fake immigration applications in the victims’ names, seeking asylum relief and withholding-of-removal protections. The applications were filled out with fabricated stories about threats, persecution, and the applicants’ supposed fear of returning to their native countries, prosecutors said.

Reyes allegedly did not inform the victims of the answers he gave on their behalf, nor did he inform them about the legal ramifications of filing false asylum claims.

Asylum requests overwhelm US immigration system: A look at the numbers,"An explosion in asylum requests from immigrants facing deportation has overwhelmed U.S. courts and denial of the requests does little to keep illegal immigrants out, according to federal statistics.

Thousands of migrants are hoping to seek asylum, even though experts say they have poor cases and little chance of gaining the status. But that has not stopped hundreds of thousands (possibly millions) of asylum seekers from landing permanently in the U.S., where they live as illegal immigrants, experts say.

The caravan, and others like it, have put President Trump’s sweeping pledge to secure the border to the test, and dealing with the court backlog and administrative policies is a White House priority. On July 15, the Trump administration announced a new policy tightening restriction for asylum seekers from Central America — a major crackdown that's likely to face a legal challenge in the near future.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES MAJOR CRACKDOWN ON ASYLUM SEEKERS

According to a new rule published in the Federal Register, asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border. The rule, expected to go into effect on July 16, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone.

There are some exceptions: If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied, then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum.

Migrants are entitled under both U.S. and international law to apply for asylum. But there already is a bottleneck of would-be asylum seekers waiting at some U.S. border crossings to make their claims, some waiting as long as five weeks. For others, the process could even take years.

""The reality is that most people in [caravans] will not be found qualified for asylum, and many of them know it. Others are encouraged to, but likely their claims will not pass muster, especially under new guidance from Jeff Sessions, to get back to a stricter adherence to the law,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies — a Washington, D.C.- based research institution, previously told Fox News.

Vaughan suggested it would be quicker to process these claims ""right away"" at the border rather than putting asylum requests on hold.

During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted.

Read on for a closer look at immigration, by the numbers.

327,000

By the end of March 2019, there were more than 327,000 pending affirmative applications pending with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to data provided by the agency. Last year around that time, asylum seekers have to wait around 1,000 days — on average — for their cases to be reviewed in an immigration court, the American Immigration Council reports.

809,000

The backlog in the immigration courts has grown significantly in the past five years. In November 2018, there were around 809,000 pending cases on the U.S. immigration court's docket, according to a report by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.

In 2017 alone, courts fielded around 120,000 asylum requests — four times greater than in 2014 — from immigrants facing deportation, The Washington Post recently reported.

This recent influx may be due to an increase in credible fear claims in recent years. Immigrants may declare ""credible fear"" if they are afraid to return to their home country and thus cannot be deported from the U.S. until their asylum application is formally processed.

""Here are the shocking statistics: in 2009, DHS conducted more than 5,000 credible fear reviews. By 2016, that number had increased to 94,000. The number of these aliens placed in removal proceedings went from fewer than 4,000 in 2009 to more than 73,000 by 2016 — nearly a 19-fold increase — overwhelming the system and leaving those with just claims buried,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in October 2017, claiming credible fear claims have been ""abused"" at the border.

However, The Washington Post noted roughly 76 percent of those who made fear claims in 2016 were found to be credible in interviews — though that doesn't necessarily mean they were granted asylum.

TRUMP'S BORDER WALL: A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

Vaughan said most people pass the ""credible fear"" test, but only a handful actually gets approved.

""According to Department of Justice statistics, half of those let in after passing credible fear and released do not even submit the formal asylum application, and half of those who do end up skipping out on the hearings. Of those Central Americans who complete the process, only 20 percent are approved,"" Vaughan told Fox News.

She added, ""We need to align the credible fear standard more closely with the asylum standard. Even now under Trump 75 [percent] pass credible fear and are allowed in, even though we know they are not likely to qualify or even complete the process.""

65 percent

In the fiscal year 2018, U.S. immigration courts ruled on more than 42,000 cases, and 65 percent of requests were denied, data obtained by TRAC in November 2018 reveals. According to the research, Mexico had the highest denial rate in 2018 — with courts granting only 14.5 percent of applicants asylum. El Salvadorians had the highest success rate, with 23.5 percent of asylum applicants being approved, the institution reports.

121,000

When immigrants sense their asylum request will be denied, they may withdraw from the process and continue living in the U.S. illegally. In fiscal year 2018, there were more than 121,000 removal orders issued by immigration judges, per TRAC. In 2019, TRAC projects the number will rise to nearly 165,000.

“Saying a few simple words — claiming a fear of return — has transformed a straightforward arrest for illegal entry and immediate return too often into a prolonged legal process, where an alien may be released from custody into the United States and possibly never show up for an immigration hearing,” Sessions said in September 2018, per The Washington Post.

Yuma law enforcement overwhelmed by illegal immigration: 'Absolute chaos',"Local law enforcement officials describe themselves as overwhelmed after a surge of illegal immigrants passed through one border city.

Last week, more than 6,000 people crossed through Yuma.

Hundreds of illegal immigrants are crossing through a gap in the unfinished border wall in Yuma each day.

The sheriff’s office, the Arizona National Guard and families in Yuma are all concerned about the unprecedented number of people crossing illegally.

""The best way I can describe the border right now is chaos. Absolute chaos,"" said Maj. Eben Bratcher, operations chief of the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office.

""The best way I can describe the border right now is chaos. Absolute chaos."" — Maj. Eben Bratcher, operations chief, Yuma County Sheriff’s Office

Col. Matthew Stubbs said the surge of immigrants is the largest he's seen in his career.

""This is going on 24 hours a day,"" adds Yuma resident Dennis Cook.

YUMA, ARIZ., AT BREAKING POINT OVER ASYLUM SEEKERS, OFFICIALS SAY

Spike in encounters

Since October of this year, Customs and Border Protection reported close to 22,000 encounters in the Yuma Sector.

That's a 2,647% increase from this time last year.

The Yuma County Sheriff’s Office receives dozens of calls each day relating to illegal immigration, some from the immigrants themselves.

""They’re calling 911. They’re showing up and sitting on the border like they’re told, waiting for their ride. After hours and hours and sometimes a day or more goes by, they get frustrated. And they get scared. And they get hungry. And they get thirsty. And they start calling 911.""

ARIZONA'S DUCEY CALLS ON BIDEN TO ACT AFTER MIGRANTS RUSH BORDER: 'MR. PRESIDENT, DO SOMETHING -- DO ANYTHING'

Bratcher says staffing is a challenge.

""At any given time, I might have three dispatchers answering all of the calls that come into our office,"" he said. ""If they’re tied up handling 911 calls that wouldn’t be happening otherwise, your 911 call because of a vehicle accident or something other than that more serious might ring a few extra times, and that’s scary.""

Unfinished wall

Cook’s backyard overlooks the unfinished border wall.

He sees the crossings every day and knows just how overwhelmed Border Patrol is.

""There’s times when I've called Border Patrol, and Border Patrol says ‘We can't do anything. We’re totally booked up. We can’t do nothing with them,"" Cook said. ""Since I’ve been on camera here, I'll bet you we've had 20 people cross already.""

Yuma’s mayor issued a local emergency , and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey deployed the National Guard.

""The problem is just so large. So many are coming through, and that’s why we’re here,"" Stubbs said.

Pregnant women and young children are making this trip too.

Some of the immigrants explained why they came to the U.S.

""For a better life for my daughter who is about to be born,"" one immigrant from Brazil said.

An immigrant from Venezuela is looking ""for a better quality of life because we can no longer be in our country, and it’s unfortunate what is happening over there. This is what we have to do.""

Between Friday and Tuesday, Border Patrol stopped about 2,600 people crossing illegally.

Trump policy restored

Numbers are down significantly from last week, which was around the same time that the Biden administration reinstated the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy following a court ruling.

AZ MAYOR DECLARES EMERGENCY AFTER BORDER CHAOS: 'HUMANITARIAN CRISIS' COULD BE DEVELOPING

Under that Trump-era policy, known officially as the Migrant Protection Protocols, asylum-seekers are required to remain in Mexico until their court dates.

The surge in illegal immigration is also a health issue.

""We have one hospital here, and with people coming across, they’re coming with all sorts of conditions that then fill up our hospital,"" Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls lamented.

It’s also affecting the farming industry.

Yuma supplies 90% of the country’s lettuce during winter.

It’s not uncommon for border crossers to make their way through the fields, damaging crops.

Despite the ""border crisis,"" Nicholls says Yuma is safe.

""There’s no hesitation for me living in Yuma with my family,"" Nicholls said. ""It’s just we have a different dynamic we need to make sure we’re staying on top of, and that’s what we’re doing.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/law-enforcement-overwhelmed-by-illegal-immigration,N/A
‘Legal Cinderellas’: Immigration judges drowning in sea of cases,"“We are legal Cinderellas.”

That’s how U.S. immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks describes her job these days. She said in the debate over what to do with people in the country illegally, the immigration courts are the forgotten ones.

The system is about to buckle and it has left many wondering just how much more it can handle – as additional federal dollars pour into enforcement, generating additional cases, further straining the courts.

""A long time between a case entering the system and being resolved does not benefit anyone,"" Marks said.

There are 38,428 cases in the San Francisco district, where Marks serves. Immigration courts across the country are seeing similar – or larger – backlogs.

Marks has been living and working in the crowded trenches for the past 40 years. The first 10 were spent as a young and eager immigration lawyer, before she was given the honor of wearing a black robe. Over the past three decades she has presided over countless cases.

According to data provided by a research center at Syracuse University called TRAC (the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse), there are currently 542,411 pending cases in the immigration court system. That translates into an average wait time of 673 days, or nearly two years. It’s even longer in some states with high immigrant populations, like in Texas, where the average wait time for a case is 1,076 days, or almost three years.

“We have been a neglected part of the immigration enforcement world for so long,” said Marks, who is also president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, a voluntary organization that represents more than 300 judges. “There are legitimate concerns about how long cases pend in the immigration court.”

LONG LINES, SUSPENDED LIVES: STATISTICS REVEAL IMMIGRATION COURTS ARE DROWNING

Prior to sitting down with Fox News, Marks made clear that her opinions and statements don’t necessarily reflect those of her employer, the federal government. Her top role at the NAIJ allows her to speak more freely about immigration issues than other judges.

Marks’ concerns seem to be growing as quickly as the number of backlogged cases.

If a new case pops up but involves a repeat offender or a defendant who has committed a violent act – it could be fast-tracked and placed ahead of a person with a lower priority on the docket.

That means the legal limbo is always fluctuating. Some cases get pushed back repeatedly, only exacerbating the problem and feeding what seems to be a never-ending cycle.

“The system is broken,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas.

The congressman told Fox News that he was shocked after seeing a report from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, which studies the movement of people. This specific report examined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget and how those dollars were allocated over a period of time between 2005 and 2012. Veasey said after looking at the numbers more closely he realized the funds were not being distributed in a proportionate manner.

“When you have a system that increases border security funding by about 300 percent and it only increases funding for immigration courts by 70 percent, you have a disaster,” Veasey said.

Veasey says the law enforcement agencies like U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration Customs Enforcement enjoyed large bumps in funding year over year. But the court system somehow didn’t get the same treatment – and seems to have fallen through the cracks.

He has introduced legislation in Washington known as the “End the Backlog Act,” which would temporarily freeze funds for federal law enforcement agencies and re-direct cash to the struggling judicial side.

“No more money for border security until we do something about adding more money for additional judges and additional immigration courts,” he said.

DOJ REPORTEDLY PLANS TO SEND FLEET OF JUDGES TO IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS

Help is starting to arrive and more is on the way, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The EOIR, which oversees the country’s immigration court system, is part of the U.S. Department of Justice. That agency says 12 brand new judges were sworn-in at the beginning of February and more than 50 others are currently going through the hiring process.

“EOIR is continuing to advertise and fill positions nationwide for immigration judges and supporting staff,” said Kathryn Mattingly, a department spokeswoman.

Mattingly says there are currently 301 active judges on the bench and the agency recognizes it must keep hiring to address the mounting caseload. Congress has authorized 374 judgeships across the country – leaving more than 70 vacancies to be filled.

As for addressing the budget and leveling the playing field when it comes to the way dollars are divvied?

“EOIR is working through the Department of Justice to provide necessary information to the Office of Management and Budget, in support of the effort to finalize funding requests, as necessary to continue to advance EOIR’s mission.”

In the meantime, Marks tries to remain positive and optimistic as she grinds through the expanding workload. She’s hopeful a combination of new hires and potential infusion of cash will ease the caseload.

“Many of us still onboard are eligible to retire, but that’s a difficult choice,” Marks said. “Especially as the caseload gets higher and the pressures get greater.”",https://www.foxnews.com/us/legal-cinderellas-immigration-judges-drowning-in-sea-of-cases,N/A
NYC lawsuit: Immigration detainees denied day in court,"A civil lawsuit filed by immigration rights advocates in New York City has accused federal authorities of denying detainees their day in court.

The suit filed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan says the amount of time people accused of immigration violations in New York and New Jersey go before a judge is growing at an ""alarming rate.""

The suit was filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union and other groups against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It says the average wait time between arrest and initial court appearance had grown to 42 days last year, up from 11 days in 2014.

The average was 80 days into July of this year, according to the suit.

The ICE office in New York declined comment on Friday.

""While they wait in jail, most detainees lack basic information about the charges and evidence against them, do not know the steps required to prepare to apply for bond or to defend themselves in their removal cases, and do not have lawyers,"" according to the suit.

Oregon DA announces immigration reform policy to balance deportation risk when prosecuting cases,"The top prosecutor in Oregon's most populous county announced an immigration reform policy Thursday in an effort to protect non-citizens from being deported if they are charged with a crime.

The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said the new policy will balance the rights of American citizens and those living in the country illegally. It directs deputy district attorneys to consider immigration consequences in all phases of a prosecution, including when making charging decisions, plea bargaining and sentencing.

It also allows for punishments to be restructured so that they don't result in deportation, as long as the changes don’t reduce the severity of the sentence.

""Prior to these reforms, non-citizens accused of a crime could be sent back to their country of origin and given a lifelong ban from re-entry for non-violent offenses, where a naturalized U.S. citizen charged with the exact same crime may only receive a few months probation,"" District Attorney Mike Schmidt said during a news conference.

He said deportation doesn't make the community safe but instead breaks up families, threatens the local economy and further propagates generational inequities.

""These outcomes makes us less safe,"" he said.

As an example, advocates used a hypothetical case of a barroom fight. Those involved could be charged with attempted assault, a minor misdemeanor could result in six months in jail but is often resolved with a fine, said Erin McKee, the co-director of the Oregon Justice Resource Center’s Immigrant Rights Project.

However, the incident could be considered a crime of ""moral turpitude"" by immigration officials and someone with a green card could face deportation, she said.

‘Tent courts’ set up at border towns to ease strain on immigration cases,"The Trump administration has quietly started implementing its latest measure aimed at easing the strain of immigration courts tasked with a growing backlog of asylum cases at the southern border.

A new tent court, or “soft-sided” facility, began operating this week in Laredo, Texas, to help handle the tens of thousands of cases of asylum seekers that were part of the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program. Others are expected to open soon in Brownsville, in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, and in Yuma, Arizona.

The hearings at these tent courts are held entirely by video conference — as was the case Thursday morning of a woman, a migrant from Cuba named Lorena, who had been bussed from Mexico to the temporary court in Laredo. The judge on her case was 160 miles northeast, in a courtroom in downtown San Antonio, The New York Times reported.

BORDER APPREHENSIONS PLUNGE AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAILS MEXICO PACT

The ""Remain"" program, which the U.S. ramped up this summer with Mexico's cooperation, has been credited by American officials with a significant reduction of the number of migrant apprehensions at the southern border, a key goal of President Trump.

Asylum claims have spiked since 2010, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Most asylum claims often fail to meet the legal standard after they are reviewed by asylum judges, and only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.

The new tents were built near international bridges in the two Texas towns on the property of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. They have a walkway from each bridge that eventually leads to courtrooms with video-conferencing equipment.

SUPREME COURT ALLOWS TRUMP ASYLUM RESTRICTIONS TO TAKE EFFECT, ENDING 9TH CIRCUIT INJUNCTIONS

While judges hold the hearings remotely, U.S. officials said if attorneys have formally agreed to represent migrants, they will be allowed to attend hearings in person.

However, outside attorneys who routinely observe immigration proceedings will not be allowed at the hearings. Media outlets will not be allowed into the tents without permission either.

Under U.S. Department of Justice rules, immigration court hearings are generally open to the public, though immigration judges can close some hearings for privacy reasons or to protect ""the public interest.""

One official said the government might allow potential observers to submit applications ""as we move forward.""

Ashley Huebner, an attorney at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told The Associated Press that she was denied access to the initial hearings on Wednesday in Laredo.

""Attorneys aren't jumping to go in and solicit paying clients in these courts,"" Huebner said. ""They want to ensure that people's due process rights are being protected, and there's no opportunity to do that.""

Kennji Kizuka, an advocate with Human Rights First, called the court restrictions a ""due process nightmare.""

""It is just another attempt to cover up the flaws in this sham asylum process, a process created to block refugees from finding safety in the United States,"" Kizuka said in a statement.

Amnesty International plans to travel to South Texas next week to seek access to the tent courts, the Times reported.

Under the “Remain” program, more than 40,000 migrants – mostly from Central and South America – have been told to wait for their immigration court dates in Mexico.

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court cleared the way for an even farther-reaching asylum policy. The court ended all injunctions that had blocked the White House’s ban on asylum for anyone trying to enter the U.S. by traveling through a third country, such as Mexico, without seeking protection there.

The policy targets tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty who travel through Mexico each month to seek asylum in the U.S. and would affect asylum seekers from Africa, Asia and South America who arrive regularly at the southern border.

"Most illegal immigrants in US receive government benefits, costing taxpayers billions: experts","This week, the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to count self-identified illegal immigrants in the 2020 census. Cities worry adding the citizenship question could undercount 6.5 million people. Their argument, however, isn't just about political power but billions of dollars in federal funds states expect.

The case underscores what experts say is a growing cost to taxpayers from the surge of Central American families and unaccompanied minors.

""We're talking about billions of dollars in taxpayer benefits over the next few years,"" said Dan Stein, director of the right-leaning think tank, Federation for American Immigration Reform. ""The payout for the taxpayer is enormous and income to the Treasury is miniscule.""

A FAIR study in 2017 found illegal immigrants are a net consumer of taxpayer benefits worth more than $100 billion a year, not including the cost of enforcing the border.

While federal benefits are supposed to be off limits, in practice many are not. More than 25,000 undocumented workers receive subsidized housing, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Children receive free education and most qualify for English lessons and free school breakfast and lunch.

Pregnant women are entitled to prenatal and postpartum care under the Women, Infants and Children program. Infant delivery costs are paid for by Medicaid. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found a federal-state immigrant insurance program cost $2 billion a year in emergency treatment, not including the $1.24 billion in infant delivery expenses.

Illegal immigrants are not entitled to food stamps, but families with U.S.-born children are. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, 31% of such families use the SNAP program and more than 50% of Central American families in the U.S. use at least one welfare program.

This is especially true of asylum seekers said Art Arthur, a former immigration judge now with the Center for Immigration Studies, an immigration think tank. Arthur said because there is a three to five year lag time between apprehension and court appearance, young asylum seekers put down roots, allowing many to access programs they are initially unaware or afraid to use.

""You're going to buy a house, get a job, have kids,"" he said. ""So their entire life changes, and that means their claim changes. Because of a lack of a bright line for immigration judges, appeals are endless and people don't leave.""

Recognizing that many illegal workers fill jobs communities need, 26 states offer them *state-funded* benefits. New York state offers up to $300 a month in cash assistance. Eleven states offer free or subsidized medical and hospital care. California offers food stamps, legal services and benefits for those over 65 or disabled. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently asked for an extra $50 million from lawmakers to serve the state's illegal immigrant population.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: CONGRESS MUST ACT TO END THE CRISIS ON OUR BORDER

Such sanctuary states and immigrant-friendly cities are an obvious draw, but others say it is all about finding work not using benefits.

The Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018 found Central American families may struggle financially in the U.S. but they work (76%) at high rates than native-born Americans (73%).

""At the end of the day people are going to go where their jobs are, not necessarily where the services are,"" said Ali Noorani, director of the National Immigration Forum. ""So yes, 26 states may provide state-funded access to public benefits. But if those states don't have a growing economy and don't have jobs that are open immigrants, much as anybody else, they're not going to see them.""

Up to 70% of immigrants apprehended at the border this fiscal year are families or unaccompanied minors claiming asylum. Unlike other border crossers, after six months asylum seekers qualify for work permits and most taxpayer subsidies. But because most are unskilled and uneducated, they earn minimum wage or less.

Almost half, according to the census survey, never finished high school. They earn 40% less than U.S.-born workers and about 50% of families live in poverty, requiring community support for food and cash for necessities. Some have sponsors, but most are usually immediate families that are not much better off.

""There is a cost for communities for sure,"" Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., said last week outside a Salvation Army shelter in Yuma. ""Whether it is in uncompensated care in hospitals or the education system in different ways. It has never really been measured, but it is very real.""

Advocates for illegal immigrants argue most studies are flawed because they do not account for their economic contribution to the economy as a whole. Not just because they perform jobs Americans won't, but studies don't account for their lower wage differential that produces cost savings to U.S. consumers.

""We need an immigration system that treats the American taxpayer fairly,"" Noorani said. ""Right now, our immigration system doesn't treat the American taxpayer fairly and I would argue it really treats nobody fairly. At the federal level, what the Congress and the president need to do is work together to create an immigration system that is fair to the taxpayer and 10 or 11 million people who are undocumented.""

"Trump immigration policies showing results, with illegal border crossings plummeting","Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted after the Trump administration required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for court hearings in the U.S., according to a report.

When the policy took effect in the Border Patrol's Yuma sector in May, arrests hit 14,000. By October, they had fallen 94 percent, or around 800, and have stayed there since, making Yuma the second slowest of the agency’s nine sectors on the U.S.-Mexico border, according to statistics cited by The Associated Press.

There have been several reasons for the recent drop. Anthony Porvaznik, chief of the Border Patrol's Yuma sector, said the so-called Migration Protection Protocols have been a huge deterrent, based on agents' interviews with people arrested.

""Their whole goal was to be released into the United States, and once that was taken off the shelf for them, and they couldn't be released into the United States anymore, then that really diminished the amount of traffic that came through here,"" Porvaznik said.

In the neighboring Tucson sector, arrests rose each month from August to December, bucking a border-wide trend and making it the second-busiest corridor after Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Porvaznik attributed Tucson's spike to the policy's late implementation.

Over 55,000 asylum-seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for hearings through November, 10 months after the policy first took effect in San Diego.

The immigrants were from more than three dozen countries, but nearly two out of three were Guatemalan or Honduran, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Critics have said the policy was unfair and exposed asylum-seekers to extreme violence in Mexican border cities, where attorneys could be difficult to find.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups asked to put the policy on hold during a legal challenge. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Oct. 1 and has not indicated when it may decide.

This past Tuesday, critics won a separate lawsuit when a federal judge in San Diego said asylum-seekers being returned to Mexico from California deserved access to hired attorneys before and during key interviews to determine if they could stay in the U.S. while their cases proceeded.

In Yuma, asylum-seekers have been held in short-term cells until space opened up to be returned to Mexicali through a neighboring California sector.

While illegal crossings have dropped in Yuma, asylum-seekers still have signed up on a waiting list to enter the U.S. at an official crossing in San Luis, Arizona.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection has called the Mexican shelter managing the list to say how many asylum claims it would process each day. The shelter estimated the wait at three to four months.

US parents ‘totally abandoned’ as Biden immigration policy fuels blockade on entry of adopted Haitian children,"A recent change to the U.S. immigration system has fueled another crisis in the Caribbean as Haitians flock to leave the crime-ridden nation and American parents watch with tied-hands as their legally adopted children are unable to join them in the U.S.

Dozens of adopted children have been unable to obtain Haitian passports — the final step in the adoption process — as immigration offices in Haiti have become overrun since early January after the Biden administration said it would accept up to 30,000 migrants from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela per month.

Passport applications have skyrocketed with reports showing that requests went from an average of 1,500 a day to 5,000, the Miami Herald first reported earlier this week.

COAST GUARD INTERCEPTS 309 HAITIAN MIGRANTS IN 'LESS THAN SEAWORTHY' VESSEL OFF FLORIDA'S COAST

But the U.S. policy has done more than overrun Haitian immigration facilities, it has effectively blocked children legally adopted by parents in the U.S. from being able to obtain the necessary documentation needed to board the two-hour flight from Port-au-Prince to Miami.

""I just want to be clear,"" one adoptive parent told Fox News Digital, ""My wife and I, we really support this as an idea. I think they should give people a safe and legal way to come to the United States.""

""But the issue is that this program also requires applicants to have a Haitian passport,"" he continued. ""It’s totally overwhelmed the passport office.""

Bryan Hanlon and his wife Julie, who live in the Washington, D.C. area, became the legal parents of Peterson, 5, and Gina, 6, in August 2022 after starting their adoption process in 2018. The couple were matched with the brother-sister pair in May 2021 when they were respectively 3 and 4 years old.

Adoptions out of Haiti have been notoriously difficult for years Hanlon explained but the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent assassination of then President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 has made it all the more difficult.

Haiti has gradually fallen into state of chaos following a series of devastating earthquakes and hurricanes since 2010, and the economic situation has fallen to the extent that Haiti is now the poorest nation in the western hemisphere and gangs have taken over.

Adopted children are required to make an appointment to get a passport – which in theory should grant them priority over other Haitians lining up outside the immigration offices.

But the situation in reality has become so dire that people have begun scaling the sides of the immigration offices, climbing up stairwells to cut ahead once inside and causing such chaos that applicants with prearranged appointments are either not able to get inside the offices or have had their appointments canceled without a rescheduled date.

Haiti’s Director of Immigration, Jean Osselin Lambert, told the Miami Herald this week that the crowds of people camping outside the offices have become so immense that immigration employees also cannot gain access to their offices.

The boisterous crowds at the Central Bureau of Immigration and Emigration in Port-au-Prince on Friday prompted security officials to deploy tear gas inside the building in an attempt to gain control over the situation. The building was then evacuated according to local reports.

American parents and the U.S. National Council for Adoption are calling on the Biden administration to step in.

JAMAICA IS WILLING TO SEND SOLDIERS, POLICE TO HAITI AS CHAOS CONTINUES

A letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken Tuesday, obtained by Fox News Digital, urged the department to allow adopted children to enter the U.S. without passports – a move the department permitted just three months ago.

""There is simply no rational basis for the State Department to refuse to exercise its legal authority to provide a safe, legal alternative when the Haitian passport office is functionally closed to these children,"" the letter said.

A crisis provision under Title 22 enabled the State Department to permit access to the U.S. for adopted Haitian children without passports between mid-October to mid-November.

The waiver was permitted in coordination with the Haitian government after the nation effectively shutdown following a months-long fuel blockade after gangs surrounded a major fuel terminal from September to November.

In emails reviewed by Fox News Digital, the Hanlon’s have also repeatedly written to the State Department highlighting not only the dangerous situation surrounding the immigration offices but the complete inability to secure an appointment or to obtain a passport.

But the State Department maintains that the offices remain ""functioning"" and therefore have refused to enforce the crisis waiver.

""They say the same thing over and over,"" Hanlon said. ""We're just asking the State Department to recognize that if Haiti won't give us a passport appointment, we can't get a passport. We are in the same situation that the families in the fall we're in, in that we can't get a passport to bring our kids home.

""We just feel totally abandoned by our government,"" he added. ""They created this situation, and it doesn't appear that they're lifting a finger to do anything.""

A spokesperson for the State Department said it understands ""it is currently difficult for adoptive parents to obtain a Haitian passport"" and that it remains ""committed to helping adoptive parents.""

""We will continue to engage with the Haitian government on this issue and communicate updates with families, U.S. governmental agencies, U.S. accrediting entities, adoption service providers, state authorities, and the larger adoption community,"" the spokesperson added.

The department did not answer Fox News Digital's questions on if Blinken will respond to the letter or if the department will again waive passport requirements amid the ongoing crisis.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-parents-totally-abandoned-biden-immigration-policy-blockade-entry-adopted-haitian-children,N/A
