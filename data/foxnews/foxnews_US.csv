0,US sending up to 200 more troops to Taiwan as China tensions grow,"The U.S. is preparing to send 100 to 200 troops to Taiwan for training amid rising tensions with China, a U.S. official familiar with the planning confirmed to Fox News on Thursday.

This number will expand a much smaller training program, which has included the National Guard, Special Ops, and U.S. Marines in the past.

The Michigan National Guard will also train a contingent of the Taiwanese Army, including some training as part of larger exercises, on U.S. soil.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, cited U.S. officials as saying only around 30 American troops were stationed in Taiwan about a year ago.

""We don't have a comment on specific operations, engagements, or training, but I would highlight that our support for, and defense relationship with, Taiwan remains aligned against the current threat posed by the People’s Republic of China,"" Lt. Col. Marty Meiners, a Defense Department spokesperson, told Fox News on Thursday.

""Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,"" he added.

PENTAGON SAYS MAJORITY OF DOWNED CHINESE SPY CRAFT FOUND

The Wall Street Journal described the planned troop increase in the coming months as the largest deployment of American forces in Taiwan in decades.

Officials who spoke to the newspaper said the increase has been planned for months, before China escalated tensions with the U.S. by flying a spy balloon over American soil.

The troops going to Taiwan will be tasked with training its military on U.S. weapon systems, as well as maneuvers to counter a potential offensive from China, they added.

In recent weeks, China has frequently been sending its ships and aircraft into Taiwanese waters and airspace.

Taiwan split from China in 1949 after a civil war. The only connection between the two nations is billions of dollars in trade and investment. Mainland China does not recognize Taiwan independence and wants it to unite with the mainland.

""One of the difficult things to determine is what really is objectionable to China,"" one of the U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal about the planned troop deployment. ""We don’t think at the levels that we’re engaged in and are likely to remain engaged in the near future that we are anywhere close to a tipping point for China, but that’s a question that is constantly being evaluated and looked at specifically with every decision involving support to Taiwan.""

1,"China blames US gun policies for global violence, says America exports ‘woes and instability’","America’s ""loose management"" of firearms is creating a ""recurring nightmare"" of domestic gun violence that is now spilling into other countries as U.S.-made weapons and ammunition are increasingly finding their way into the wrong hands, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the ministry, lamented that at a United Nations meeting last week, the U.S. opposed a Chinese proposal to block transfers of ammunition to non-state actors. He then argued that America’s tolerance for guns is creating violence around the globe.

""Gun violence has become a recurring nightmare for the American people,"" Wang said. The U.S.’s loose management of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, massive weapons export and persistent transfer of military articles to non-state actors are equally worrying.""

""A lot of the ammunition from the U.S. have become untraceable and even ended up in the hands of terrorist and extremist groups, posing a grave threat to regional and international peace and stability,"" he added.

Wang said gun violence is increasingly America’s main export to the world.

""The U.S. brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights but livelihood woes and instability,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to know that the more it engages in such exports, the worse the backfire will be on the U.S. itself.""

Wang added that violent elements in Mexico, Pakistan and elsewhere have been ""found to use U.S. weapons"" and noted a Center for American Progress study said more than 50,000 guns originating in the U.S. were recovered in 15 criminal investigations between 2014 and 2016.

His remarks came several days after a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, at which China said it is worried that U.S. exports of arms to Ukraine are raising the risk of ""strategic miscalculation and escalation of hostilities"" because they might be misdirected to ""terrorists and armed groups.""

The U.S. rejected that assessment at the meeting and dismissed the ""victim-blaming notion that Ukraine’s self-defense is the obstacle to ending this war.""

2,US warned Russia of Biden's visit to Ukraine 'hours' before departure,"U.S. officials warned Russia that President Biden was visiting the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv hours before he made the trip, the White House National Security Council revealed Monday.

National security officials provided more details about Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday, calling the trip unprecedented given the lack of U.S. military infrastructure in the war-torn region. Reporters pressed national security adviser Jake Sullivan on whether the U.S. had warned Moscow that Biden was headed to Kyiv, a city scarred with Russian missile strikes.

""We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv,"" Sullivan told reporters Monday. ""We did so some hours before his departure for de-confliction purposes.""

Sullivan declined to elaborate on how the Russians were notified and whether they responded, however.

Sullivan went on to characterize the trip as an ""affirmation"" of the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine.

""This was not a celebration,"" he clarified, adding that there will likely be dark days ahead.

Biden himself acknowledged the challenges facing Ukraine in comments during his visit. Large areas of Ukraine remain under Russian control even after months of successful ground offensives from Kyiv's forces.

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" Biden said in a Monday statement.

Sirens could be heard in war-torn Ukraine as Biden arrived in the country. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also announced $5.5 billion in aid for Ukraine as Biden visited with Zelenskyy.

Biden's visit comes just before Russia is expected to ramp up its offensive once again in its own acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Ukrainian officials warned of a massive barrage of missiles that Russia may launch on Friday, Feb. 24.

Both the U.S. and Russia are capable of deploying far more than the allotted nuclear warheads as Washington and Moscow have a combined total of more than 13,000 warheads – making up roughly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal, according to data provided by the Arms Control Association.

4,"US spent at least $1.5 million shooting down ‘objects’ over Canada, US","The U.S. spent at least $1.5 million on missiles alone to bring down three unidentified ""objects"" over the U.S. and Canada earlier this month, according to a report.

The U.S. military fired four AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles to bring down the objects over Alaska, northern Canada and Lake Huron, with one of the missiles missing its target on the last object. Each missile costs at least $400,000, and other costs associated with the operation are likely to spike the total up by several hundred thousand dollars.

Defense officials now suspect the three objects were simply recreational balloons, though they have yet to issue any formal findings according to The Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. military also released the first images of China's spy balloon taken by U-2 pilots before the craft was shot down. The images show the clearest view yet of the massive, bulbous balloon carrying a large surveillance payload.

CANADA PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU SAYS US SHOT DOWN HIGH ALTITUDE AIRBORNE OBJECT OVER NORTH AMERICA

The U.S. shot down China's spy craft and the three ""objects"" earlier in February. President Biden has faced heavy criticism for allowing China's craft to cross the entire continental United States before shooting it down over the coast of South Carolina.

NORAD shot down the other three objects out of an abundance of caution, though the objects were not believed to be Chinese in origin.

6,Fox News Poll: Half say US should support Ukraine as long as it takes,"Friday marks the one-year anniversary since Russia invaded Ukraine and half of American voters say the U.S. should back the embattled nation for as long as it takes, according to a new Fox News survey.

The survey, released Thursday, asks what the timeframe should be for U.S. support in Ukraine: 50% think it should continue until Ukraine wins, while 46% think it should be time limited.

Democrats (66%) favor sticking with Ukraine until it’s victorious, while Republicans (61%) opt for a time limit on U.S. support. Independents split: 49% set limit vs. 45% as long as it takes.

On Monday, in the middle of the survey’s interviewing period, President Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv stating the U.S. would support Ukraine for ""as long as it takes."" Biden also announced an additional half-billion dollars in assistance which will include artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars.

A January Fox News survey found that two-thirds favored the U.S. continuing to support Ukraine both by sending weapons supplies and providing funding. Majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and independents agreed on lending help in both ways.

Voters sharply divide over Biden’s response to Russia’s invasion: 48% approve vs. 49% disapprove. That’s the highest his approval has been since the war started, the previous high was 45% in January and the lowest was 40% in August.

Since last August, Democrats (74% today vs. 68% in August), Republicans (24% vs. 19%), and independents (41% vs. 31%) have all increased their approval of Biden on Ukraine.

""Biden is approaching majority approval for his handling of the Ukraine situation,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News survey with Republican Daron Shaw.

7,Blinken insists Biden 'makes the decisions' in US response to Russia,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during a lengthy interview about Russia a year after the invasion of Ukraine, took a moment to insist that when it comes to how the United States handles the situation, President Biden is the one calling the shots.

Blinken was in the middle of discussing how Biden wants to continue supporting Ukraine but does not want to ""broaden"" the war, then made it clear that it is indeed up to Biden.

""And by the way, he’s the one who makes the decisions,"" Blinken told Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. ""The rest of us, we can give him advice, recommendations, if you’re not in government you can opine and criticize, which is always what’s needed to make sure we’re doing the best that we can, but ultimately, as the saying goes, the buck stops with him. And that’s something that he takes very seriously.""

The statement came at a time when it remains a question whether Biden will seek re-election in 2024. Members of both parties have expressed concern about the president's ability to win and serve a second term, as he recently turned 80.

""Right man, right place, right time. Someone who stood up to this moment in history,"" Blinken said, adding that the Ukrainian leader has ""become an extraordinary figure on the world stage, as well, all to the benefit of his country.""

Blinken also addressed the nature of the situation between Russia and the U.S., fielding a question of whether it is Cold War-like in nature. The secretary noted that the current conflict is not ideologically based in terms of communism versus capitalism.

His resolution would mandate that President Biden remove U.S. armed forces from Syria no later than 15 days after the date of the resolution’s adoption.

""Since the invasion of Ukraine, we seem to have turned our attention away from some of America's entanglement in Syria,"" Gaetz told Fox News Digital. ""And the purpose of my legislation is to force members of Congress to vote on record regarding whether they think we ought to continue Obama's war in Syria. President Obama kicked off our involvement … and now we still find ourselves in the middle of a Syrian civil war with Russia and Turkey and Iran, all present in a very confined neighborhood.

""And it strikes me as a powder keg for very dangerous escalation,"" he added. ""And as we find ourselves here in 2023, we ought to ask ourselves, ‘Do we really want to continue the Obama-era policy of engaging in a Syrian civil war?’ I don't think we should.""

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

Gaetz, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, filed the resolution following a Feb. 17 report from U.S. Central Command that four U.S. service members were wounded during a U.S. and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) helicopter raid in northeastern Syria that killed a senior ISIS leader.

Gaetz said he's worried President Biden does not have a cognitive grasp on the Syrian conflict, citing an August 2021 interview with ABC News on U.S. involvement in the Syria conflict in which Biden stated, ""We don't have military in Syria to make sure that we’re going to be protected.""

US CAPTURES ISIS OFFICIAL AFTER HELICOPTER RAID IN SYRIA

But news reports rebut that claim and say that, at the time of the interview, the U.S. had an estimated 900 troops in Syria for the purposes of helping SDF fight ISIS.

Gaetz says Congress has never authorized participation of U.S. armed forces in Syria, which Gaetz argues is required by the Constitution.

Gaetz’s resolution is pursuant to the War Powers Act of 1973, which was designed to limit the president's ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad. Under that Act, the House will be forced to vote within 18 days after Gaetz’s resolution was introduced.

""I’ve heard reports as recently as today from people who've spent time in the Syria theater, indicating that Russian and U.S. personnel get into very close proximity to one another, close enough to take photos and wave,"" Gaetz said of potential escalation in the region.

""And the risk of an accident or miscalculation or just misuse of authority could lead to direct kinetic conflict between the United States and Russia in Syria. And we ought to really think about whether or not that risk is worth whatever it is we're fighting for in Syria.

""If Joe Biden wants to keep U.S. troops in the Syrian conflict, he should have to explain to us why, what the goal is and what winning looks like.""

Gaetz said he hopes his resolution will win the approval of both Republican and Democratic colleagues.

""One of my great disappointments in the 118th Congress is that people who I thought were anti-war Democrats seem to be consumed, have become cheerleaders for our armed conflict,"" Gaetz said.

""In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty,"" Putin said in his annual address to the nation, just one day after President Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine.

In his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast Russia and Ukraine as victims of Western double-dealing. He said Russia, not Ukraine, was the one fighting for its very existence.

The speech reiterated a litany of grievances that the Russian leader has frequently offered as justification for the widely condemned war and ignored international demands to pull back from occupied areas in Ukraine.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV. UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

The New START treaty, first signed in April 2010, limits the U.S. and Russia from having more than 1,550 nuclear warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

Both the U.S. and Russia are capable of deploying far more than the allotted nuclear warheads as Washington and Moscow have a combined total of more than 13,000 warheads – making up roughly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal, according to data provided by the Arms Control Association.

Following the nuclear arms race that largely came to an end with the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.N. has pushed for nuclear disarmament and global warheads inventories have dropped since hitting their peak in 1985, when more than 70,000 warheads were estimated to make up global stockpiles.

Putin's speech comes three days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has continued its attack on Ukraine over the last year despite Western sanctions and losses on the battlefield. Ukraine's defense has been supported by a number of other countries, most of which are in the West.

Ukrainian officials have said they expect Russia to ramp up its offensive in Moscow's acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the war on Feb. 24.

Biden on Monday met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mariinsky Palace to announce an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

The new assistance includes shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, air surveillance radars and other aid but does not offer new advanced weaponry.

Biden said he visited Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy and ""reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."" He said Putin was ""dead wrong"" in believing Ukraine was weak when he launched the invasion a year ago.

""I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine,"" Biden said in a statement Monday. ""I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine.""

13,China furious after US warns against arming Russia: ‘The US is in no position to tell China what to do’,"Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China deteriorated further on Monday after China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs snapped at the Biden administration for suggesting that it has information suggesting that China is considering sending weapons and ammunition to Russia to help its war against Ukraine.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken made that accusation Sunday on CBS, where he said Chinese companies have already been supplying Russia with non-lethal aid and may soon do more.

""The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,"" Blinken said. When asked what lethal aid China might deliver, Blinken said, ""weapons.""

BLINKEN BATS DOWN IDEA US IN ‘COLD WAR’ WITH CHINA, SAYS RELATIONS CAN'T BE REDUCED TO ‘BUMPER STICKER’

That remark drew a furious comment from China on Monday – but not an outright denial – even as China’s top diplomat was expected to travel to Moscow this week.

""It is the U.S. not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said. ""The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing, or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia.""

Wang said China supports peace and took another shot at the U.S. by saying it’s the U.S. that is promoting conflict by arming Ukraine.

BLINKEN ISSUES WARNING TO CHINA ABOUT SPY CRAFT IN ‘CONFRONTATIONAL’ MEETING WITH COUNTERPART

""The international community is fully aware who is calling for dialogue and striving for peace, and who is fanning the flames and stoking confrontation,"" he said. ""We urge the US side to seriously reflect on the role it has played, do something to actually help deescalate the situation and promote peace talks, and stop deflecting the blame and spreading disinformation.""

Wang said China would soon release a document proposing a peaceful resolution of the conflict, which will stress that a ""nuclear war must never be fought and can never be won.""

Wang also fired back at the U.S. over the diplomatic disruption that was caused when the Biden administration confirmed the existence of a Chinese surveillance balloon hovering over the U.S. That discovery prompted Blinken to postpone a scheduled trip to China.

Blinken said over the weekend he met with Chinese officials at the Munich Security Conference to warn that the U.S. would not stand for any violation of U.S. sovereignty. But Wang accused the U.S. of continuing to ""fuss"" over the incident.

""The U.S. itself is the number one country in conducting surveillance worldwide, whose high-altitude balloons have illegally flown over China multiple times,"" Wang said, repeating an assertion the U.S. has rejected. ""The U.S. is in no position to smear China. The U.S. needs to demonstrate sincerity, and acknowledge and resolve the damage its abuse of force has done to China-US relations.""

14,Does China’s purported green energy push signal a coming conflict with the US?,"Beijing is only attempting to appear as though it's concerned about climate change to appease the West — all while China is using more domestic coal as a way to strengthen energy independence in case of a future conflict, according to a policy analyst.

""The Biden administration and frankly, too many policymakers in Washington, D.C., continue to see China as a partner,"" Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Fox News. ""They look at things like cooperation with climate change as one of the things that we should be working with China on.""

""I find [it] utterly remarkable that Chairman Xi [Jinping] of China and the Chinese Communist Party gives a tinker's damn about the planet's climate or climate change,"" DeVore continued. ""It is merely a device to engage gullible Westerners into thinking that somehow we can get meaningful cooperation.""

Jinping promised not building more coal-powered power plants abroad in 2021. But that same year, the country began building over half of the world’s new coal-based power plants, all within China, according to The Wilson Center.

Since the country doesn't have any other significant energy sources, China's reliance on coal allows Beijing to avoid depending on foreign sources, DeVore told Fox News. That also means China's recent increased investment in coal-powered industries helps protect its energy independence in case of conflict.

""It's not at all about green energy,"" Devore said. ""It's about making the Chinese economy resilient in the event of a conflict with America.""

China hit a coal production record in November — the same month President Biden and Xi discussed climate goals — and 2023 production is expected to expand further, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. About 55% of China's energy comes from coal compared to 11% in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

GOP LAWMAKERS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM JOHN KERRY OVER ‘EFFECTIVELY OUTSOURCING’ US POLICY-MAKING

""If you look at the amount of electric vehicles being sold in China, you look at their high-speed electric rail, et cetera, they're going all in,"" DeVore told Fox News. ""Those electric vehicles in China are coal-fired cars. That's where the energy comes from to charge the cars in China. Coal, Chinese coal.""

""If you thought that carbon dioxide emissions were a problem and the planet was warming, then you'd have to ask yourself, ‘why is it that the Chinese are converting so much of their coal into fuel right now,'"" DeVore added.

China has been increasing investment in its coal-to-liquids industry, which enables coal to be turned into cheap fuel for pedestrian and military use, according to DeVore. But that process makes more carbon dioxide emissions than traditional oil refining methods.

WHAT IS THE NATIONAL POWER GRID AND HOW RESILIENT IS IT?

Other Chinese green energy products have also sparked concerns from federal agencies.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized shipments of Chinese-made solar equipment last year because the products were from Xinjiang, where the U.S. has banned purchases over concerns of slave labor.

Regardless, climate change should not be the priority of U.S.-Chinese foreign policy, according to DeVore.

""America's number one priority is maintaining our ability to deter the People's Republic of China from aggression on its neighbors,"" he said. ""This would include the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, the nations of the Indo-Pacific.""

15,"Biden spurns US energy producers, turns to Venezuela for millions of barrels of oil: 'Outright hostility'","President Biden is showing ""outright hostility"" to the U.S. oil industry by turning to foreign countries — including adversaries — to supply America's energy needs rather than domestic producers, according to experts and industry insiders.

The U.S. is on track to receive nearly 3 million barrels of crude oil from Venezuela this month, Reuters reported. That's because oil producer Chevron is shipping more than 100,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude to the U.S. under a license from the Treasury Department.

Last year, the Biden administration authorized Chevron to expand production in Venezuela and to resume exports of Venezuelan oil. Venezuela, an OPEC member, has been under U.S. sanctions, with its oil frozen for the past several years, due to international outcry over the conduct of Venezuela's socialist government.

Experts were quick to note that the U.S. turned outward to Venezuela, a country hostile to the U.S., rather than inward to domestic energy producers.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION GIVES MADURO REGIME LIFELINE AS VENEZUELANS CRY FOUL

""It's really sad to see the way President Biden treats our domestic oil industry, while asking countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to produce more oil,"" Robert Rapier, a chemical engineer with decades of experience in the energy industry, told Fox News Digital.

""I have never understood this outright hostility to an industry that is critically important for U.S. manufacturing, transportation, and national security,"" he continued. ""Instead of working with the oil industry, President Biden approaches them with outright hostility, making demands upon them and criticizing them for making profits.""

The surge in Venezuela oil to the U.S. appears to be part of a White House strategy months in the making.

Early last year, American officials went to Venezuela, a Russian ally and longtime U.S. foe, to open a dialogue with President Nicolas Maduro about easing sanctions so the country can sell its oil on the international market to combat rising prices amid Russia's war in Ukraine.

Over the course of the year, the Biden administration offered Venezuela sanctions relief and ended up easing certain sanctions related to oil, giving Chevron a greenlight to import Venezuelan crude.

HERE IS WHERE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IS INCREASING AND DECREASING ACROSS THE US: SPOTLIGHT ENERGY MATTERS

According to experts, the administration's efforts to increase Venezuela's oil experts really kicked into high gear over the summer, when Saudi Arabia rebuffed Biden's efforts to get the country to increase the oil supply.

""Unfortunately, when the Saudis stiff-armed the administration on production increases last summer, it left them with very few options for the type of crude many US refineries need — particularly with the rapid draws from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Tim Stewart, president of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association, told Fox News Digital. ""So last fall, they turned to the Marxist regime for an assist.""

In October, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its non-member allies, a coalition known as OPEC+ led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, announced they were going to slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day, a move that observers feared would push up already high global energy prices.

The White House, which had been desperately lobbying OPEC+ members to vote against the proposed production cut, decried the decision.

Experts have argued OPEC+ has increased sway in part because Biden's policies have limited U.S. domestic energy production. According to an analysis last year by economists Stephen Moore and Casey Mulligan for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, the Biden administration's policies have caused the U.S. to produce significantly less oil and gas during Biden's presidency than it would have during a second term for former President Trump.

SAUDIS SAY BIDEN ADMIN REQUESTED OIL PRODUCTION CUT TO COME AFTER MIDTERMS

""The U.S. would be producing between 2 and 3 million more barrels of oil a day and between 20 and 25 more billion cubic feet of natural gas under the Trump policies,"" the report states. ""This translates into an economic loss — or tax on the American economy — of roughly $100 billion a year.""

By turning to Venezuela for oil, Biden may also be undermining his own climate and environmental agenda.

""Venezuela has the dirtiest oil production in the world,"" said Stewart.

Last summer, the World Bank published data showing the U.S. has made great strides in reducing flaring, which is the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction. Biden has said he wants to end the practice by 2030.

The U.S. has seen a 46% reduction in flaring intensity, the volume of gas flared per barrel of oil produced, over the past decade and last year was better than almost every country at limiting it, according to the World Bank data.

GOING BLACK, NOT GREEN: CURBING US OIL, GAS PRODUCTION WOULD HURT THE ENVIRONMENT, REPORT FINDS

Venezuela, meanwhile, is ""among the worst performers, with a flaring intensity 18 times higher than that of the U.S.,"" the Bank's Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report found.

Frequent oil spills in Venezuela, which often aren't cleaned up, are also causing serious environmental damage. Experts have highlighted Venezuela's ""unsafe and careless production practices"" of contaminated oil, which damages not only the environment but also the health of local communities.

Venezuela is allied with Russia, which has been a chief backer of Maduro's regime and supported the Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA. Russia has a controlling stake in 40% of Venezuela's operations in five different projects.

Venezuela also maintains close military ties with Iran and economic ties with China.

""Every barrel of Venezuelan crude the administration imports into the U.S. just further props up the Maduro regime and indirectly funds Russia's war in Ukraine,"" said Stewart. ""Now that Venezuela is hosting the Iranian navy and has laid out a welcome mat for the [ruling Chinese Communist Party], the Biden administration is funding the four major U.S. foreign adversaries with one single and very bad energy policy decision. It is efficient but very wrong.""

""The sad thing is,"" continued Stewart, ""this administration treats its own oil and gas industry and our workers as greater enemies than Venezuela, Russia, Iran, or China.""

16,"On this day in history, Feb. 22, 1980, US Olympic men's hockey team shocks Soviets in 'Miracle on Ice'","The United States men's hockey team, mostly amateur college stars, shocked the fearsomely talented Soviet Union 4-3 in the Winter Olympics on this day in history, Feb. 22, 1980.

It's gone down in sports lore — and entered wider American culture — as ""the Miracle on Ice.""

The victory by American boys in Lake Placid, New York, over the invincible Soviets, winners of four straight Olympic gold medals, proved much more than a hockey game.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEB. 21, 1916 CATASTROPHIC BATTLE OF VERDUN BEGINS WITH GERMAN ATTACK ON FRANCE

It shook the nation out of what President Jimmy Carter depressingly called America's ""crisis of confidence"" only seven months earlier in his infamous ""malaise"" speech.

""We could use another 1980 right now,"" Mike Eruzione, a Winthrop, Massachusetts, native and captain of the 1980 U.S. men's hockey team, told Fox News Digital this week.

""The country was in great turmoil at the time and along we came. The work ethic, the values we had — it proved the values that make this country so great. The nation saw what we did and took great pride in it.""

The stunning victory by Eruzione and his teammates inspired a spontaneous, even delirious, wave of unbridled patriotism from coast to coast.

""We could use another 1980 right now."" — U.S. Olympic hockey legend Mike Eruzione

The victory itself, purely in sports terms, was truly a miracle.

The Soviet Union team of 1980 is widely considered perhaps the greatest collection of hockey talent ever assembled

PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER ENTERS HOSPICE CARE

""In February 1979, they faced an NHL All-Star team that featured an astounding 20 future Hall of Famers in a three-game series,"" ESPN wrote in 2016.

""The Soviets won two of the matchups, including Game 3 at Madison Square Garden in a 6-0 rout.""

The Soviets humiliated the same U.S. hockey team 10-3 in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden in New York City just weeks before the Olympics.

They then eviscerated their first five opponents in the 1980 Olympics by a combined score of 51-11.

The Soviets were unbeatable.

""In a time when the NHL’s professional players were barred from the Olympics, Russian pros were free to chase medals — the state officially considered them soldiers who played as amateurs,"" the website Russia Beyond wrote in a 2014 obituary of legendary Soviet hockey coach Viktor Tikhonov.

""The mighty Soviets buckled after being punched in the nose by Uncle Sam's young skaters.""

""Athletes were servants of the state, working for achievements that would boost national glory and show the superiority of Marx and Lenin.""

The American boys, with an average age of just 21, the youngest squad in the Olympics, were amateurs.

Yet the mighty Soviets buckled after being punched in the nose by Uncle Sam's young skaters.

American Mark Johnson tied the game at 2-2 as time ran out in the first period. Tikhonov benched goaltender Vladislav Tretiak — considered the best in the world — at intermission.

Analysts say it was a moment of panic felt by his team.

Eruzione scored what proved the game winner with 10 minutes left to play in the final period.

The Americans, backboned by netminder Jim Craig, withstood a furious onslaught as the final minutes appeared to last hours.

""Five second left in the game. Do you believe in miracles?!"" announcer Al Michaels, just 35 at the time, shouted above the din in Lake Placid.

""Yes!!""

The broadcaster's jubilant proclamation has gone down as the most famous coda in American sports history.

""It came out of my heart,"" Michaels told radio broadcaster Colin Cowherd years later.

AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL: 50 MUST-SEE LANDMARKS THAT TELL OUR NATIONAL STORY

The delirious hometown crowd cheered wildly, many waving U.S. flags, as the American boys jumped, embraced and rolled on the ice in a spontaneous unscripted moment of national joy.

""It came out of my heart."" – Al Michaels on his famous 1980 hockey call

The celebration quickly spread from coast to coast.

The national malaise, a decade of economic crises, the divisive conflict in Vietnam and a deepening divide between elites and working Americans had been broken.

""We touched the lives of so many people around the country,"" Eruzione said by phone from a rink in Boston, where he watched three of his grandchildren play hockey.

""People still come up to me and cry when they tell me what that moment meant to them.""

""We are at a turning point in our history,"" President Carter said in his infamous July 1979 ""malaise"" speech.

It turns out the inflection came from the most unexpected place: on the ice of the Olympic Center in Lake Placid.

It has since been renamed Herb Brooks Arena, in honor of the hockey coach who handed the nation its Miracle on Ice.

But the win over the invincible Soviets is the one for which the team is remembered.

Sports Illustrated dubbed it the Greatest Sports Moment of the 20th Century.

The United States went on to a new period of confidence, peace and prosperity in the 1980s.

It was capped by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989; the collapse of the Soviet Union — and its mighty hockey dynasty — in 1991; and victory in the Cold War.

""People still come up to me and cry when they tell me what that moment meant to them."" — Eruzione

Does Grandpa Eruzione ever get tired of talking about the moment of national pride that erupted in the wake of his miracle as a young man, 43 years ago?

""Never. I never get sick of it,"" he said, adding that the 2004 movie ""Miracle"" brought the story to a new generation of young Americans.

""Who am I not to talk about it when I see the joy it still brings to people's faces? I take great pride and joy in it,"" he said.

""I still do. Everybody's got a story to tell me about that moment. We did something very special for a lot of people.""

17,‘Mosul Orb’: US silent on UFO filmed by military over Iraq,"A metallic-looking orb was filmed by a U.S. military spy plane in an active conflict zone, but the Department of Defense has declined to answer any questions about it.

The four-second clip of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, a government-coined phrase that means UFO, was recorded by a reconnaissance plane moving over Mosul, Iraq, in April 2016.

Jeremy Corbell is an investigative journalist and documentary filmmaker who was the only civilian named during Congress' historic UAP hearing in May 2022. He and investigative reporter George Knapp released the image on Jan. 24 during their show ""WeaponizedPodcast.com.""

Corbell shared the image with Fox News Digital and said this was the first time the American public had seen a designated UFO in an active conflict zone, which presents a potential problem for combatants, because they don't know whose asset it is.

FORMER FIGHTER PILOT SAYS UFOs MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE THINK: 'WE WERE SEEING THEM ON OUR RADARS'

""As you know, we are shooting things down over the United States of America now without really identifying them before we shoot them down,"" said Corbell, referring to the four aerial objects, including a Chinese spy balloon, that were shot down over an eight-day stretch.

The origins of the other three objects are still unknown, President Joe Biden said during a Thursday-afternoon press briefing, when he added that it's now believed they were most likely from private entities and not related to China or other surveillance operations.

TIMELINE: FOURTH FLYING OBJECT DOWNED BY US MILITARY IN 8 DAYS

""I gave the order to take down these objects and couldn't rule out the risk of surveillance,"" which could represent a more aggressive approach to engaging UFOs, Biden said.

""The rules of engagement of how and why we can fire upon objects is completely being rewritten right now,"" Corbell said during a Thursday interview before the president spoke.

""This is a problem, because if we get two nations firing upon these unknowns, these unidentified flying objects, then what we have is a potential for crossfire and a potential for each country thinking it's the other's asset.""

Department of Defense spokesperson Susan Gough declined to answer several of Fox News Digital's questions when reached by phone on Wednesday.

""We have nothing further to say,"" Gough repeated when asked about the ""Mosul Orb."" ""We will not be discussing intelligence-related matters.""

UFO SHOOT-DOWNS REVEAL ‘STRATEGIC GAPS’ IN SECURING US AIRSPACE, DEFENSE EXPERTS SAY

When asked whether there could be other sightings like the ""Mosul Orb,"" or whether any of the recently shot-down flying objects in the U.S. had similar characteristics, Gough again declined comment.

Corbell said, ""Intelligently control UAPs are picked up by radar, seen by pilots and engaged by our military on a daily basis,"" and argued that ""there's no reason"" the American public shouldn't be allowed to see these videos.

""That footage is never released to the public unless leaked to journalists,"" said Corbell, who explained the four-second clip of the ""Mosul Orb"" was part of a larger, internal classified briefing from DoD to destigmatize military reporting of UFOs.

Interest and speculation around UFOs have ramped up since last week, when the fighter jets took down at least four aerial objects, which were a topic of a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday.

BIDEN SAYS THREE AERIAL OBJECTS SHOT DOWN LIKELY NOT RELATED TO CHINA SURVEILLANCE

A source familiar with the briefing told Fox News Digital that the three objects shot down over the weekend were substantially different in size from the Chinese spy balloon. One was shaped more closely to a balloon-like object, and the other two were the size of an ATV.

In contrast, the Chinese spy balloon was 200 feet tall, and its payload was 90 feet across.

The U.S. is in the process of recovering pieces of the Chinese balloon, but debris from the three other objects shot down over Alaska, Canada's Yukon territory and in U.S. airspace over Lake Huron ""are lost,"" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told reporters after Tuesday's hearing.

""The remnants are in very difficult terrain with low temperatures,"" he said. ""They haven't been able to find them.""

Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command, said on Sunday that he hasn’t ""ruled out anything"" as to whether the objects could be of extraterrestrial origin, but the intelligence community would make that determination.

The raw power of the image instantly gripped a nation at war with Nazi Germany in Europe and imperial Japan in the Pacific — young American fighting men unfurling the Stars and Stripes on a remote island far from home in World War II.

Its power endures today.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEB. 22, 1980, US OLYMPIC MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM SHOCKS SOVIETS IN ‘MIRACLE ON ICE’

""The flag raising became a symbol synonymous with American victory in World War II and what the nation can accomplish when we all pull together and unite for a just cause,"" Owen Connor, senior curator of the National Museum of the Marine Corps, told Fox News Digital

The photograph hit the front page of almost every newspaper in the United States within days.

It's been duplicated and admired endlessly through the decades and endures as the most powerful image of heroism in American history.

The Marines in the photo represent a broad cross-section of the American people.

""The photo became in many ways one of the first media events of the 20th century."" — Owen Connor, National Museum of the Marine Corps

The latest research indicates that the men are, from left: Pfc. Ira Hayes, 22, a book-loving Pima native from Sacaton, Arizona; Pfc. Harold Schultz, 20, of Detroit, who lied about his age to join the Corps after Pearl Harbor; Sgt. Michael Strank, 25, born in what's now Slovakia and raised in Franklin Borough, Pennsylvania; Pfc. Franklin Sousley, 19, a factory worker from Hill Top, Kentucky; Harold Keller, 23, a telephone lineman from Brooklyn, Iowa; and Cpl. Harlon Block, 20, a star high school football player from Weslaco, Texas.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST COMMANDED THE MARINES: REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO SAMUEL NICHOLAS

Block, Sousley and Strank were all killed on Iwo Jima, a volcanic island about 700 miles south of Tokyo.

The Marines invaded Iwo Jima on Feb. 19, its capture deemed essential to tightening the noose around the Japanese homeland.

""It took four days for the Marines to reach the summit of Suribachi,"" the Department of Defense reports.

""The taking of the 554-foot hill was significant, in that it suppressed the fires from Japanese who were dug in and who had prime vantage of much of the island.""

The fighting continued until March 26.

Iwo Jima is considered by many historians the greatest battle in Marine Corps history.

About 27,000 Marines and sailors were killed or wounded in a month of combat.

Almost all 21,000 Japanese defenders, fighting from entrenched caves, tunnels and pillboxes, were killed; only 216 were taken prisoner.

Twenty-seven Marines and Navy Corpsmen earned the Medal of Honor on Iwo Jima, more than any other battle in U.S. history, according to the National World War II Museum.

""Uncommon valor was a common virtue,"" Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who commanded the Navy war effort in the Pacific, said of Iwo Jima.

""Uncommon valor was a common virtue."" — Admiral Chester W. Nimitz

""The photo became in many ways one of the first media events of the 20th century,"" said Connor.

""Due to the speed in which the image went from the battlefield to Sunday newspapers in the United States (48 hours), it took on even greater meaning to a nation.""

The federal government immediately seized on the power of the photo to aid the war effort.

""The photo was the centerpiece of a war-bond poster that helped raise $26 billion in 1945,"" the Pulitzer Prize Board writes in its online account of the image.

""On July 11, before the war had ended, it appeared on a United States postage stamp. Nine years later it became the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.""

The Battle of Iwo Jima has been immortalized in numerous books, movies and even popular music.



""The Ballad of Ira Hayes"" tells the sad tale of the Pima flag-raiser. It was recorded by many artists, including Bob Dylan, and became a hit for Johnny Cash in 1961.

The image's meaning to millions of Americans still today is deeper and more powerful than the deserved acclaim among journalists and artists.

The raising of Old Glory far from home amid the savagery of global war represents the terrible human struggle to end the tyranny and slavery that ruled the world in the 1940s — for which the American people and their Allies fought to end in World War II at a terrible human cost.

The identity of the men in the photo has been a source of considerable controversy in recent years. The confusion was caused by numerous factors.

Navy Corpsman John Bradley was one of the men long identified as a flag raiser.

His son James Bradley wrote the powerful 2000 history of Iwo Jima, ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" an intense look at the horror of Iwo Jima and the lives of the men in the photo.

It was learned in recent years that Corpsman Bradley was not among the six men in the photo.

He remains no less a hero.

The book written by his grateful son stands as one of the best ever written on the brutality of war and the cost paid by the men who fought and died in World War II.

20,Seattle becomes first US city to ban discrimination based on caste,"The Seattle City Council voted 6-1 on Tuesday to add caste as a protected category in the city's anti-discrimination laws, making it the first city in the U.S. to outlaw such discrimination.

Kshama Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party and the only Indian American on the Seattle City Council, circulated a petition in the lead-up to the vote that said ""caste discrimination remains a largely hidden and unreported issue.""

""Caste discrimination is a widespread and increasingly grave contributor to workplace discrimination and bias faced by South Asian Americans and other immigrants—not just in other countries, but here in Seattle and across the United States,"" the petition reads.

India's caste system dates back thousands of years, stratifying people into social classes based off birth, though the country banned discrimination based off caste in 1948.

""The majority of the affected communities live in or originate from South Asia, including India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, where many are known by the self-chosen identity of 'Dalits,' which means ‘those who have been broken but are resilient’ and others are indigenous or indentured community members,"" the ordinance that was passed on Tuesday explains.

The ordinance did face considerable pushback from Seattle residents, with the Hindu American Foundation arguing that a yes vote amounts to ""discriminating against ethnic minorities.""

""Throughout our two decades of existence, HAF has maintained that caste discrimination is wrong, violating core Hindu principles of the divine oneness of all beings,"" Hindu American Foundation Executive Director Suhag Shukla said in a statement on Tuesday. ""At the same time, we maintain that the singling out of South Asians and addition of ‘caste’ to non-discrimination policy violates the very policies it now amends.""

A handful of colleges throughout the U.S. have added caste to their anti-discrimination policies, including the California State University System, Colby College, Brown University, and Brandeis University.

21,Can US Mint fix the debt ceiling crisis and conjure up a $1 trillion platinum coin?,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

With Congress refusing to raise the statutory debt limit, some are calling on the U.S. Mint to create a single platinum coin and then ""sell"" it to the Federal Reserve for $1 trillion. If the Fed, plays along, it would pay for the coin by waving its hands and typing ""1,000,000,000,000"" on an excel sheet – thereby conjuring the needful dollars. Is this legitimate?



Congress granted the U.S. Mint the power to mint coins that honestly contain what they claim. For example, a one-ounce gold coin must contain one gold ounce. Creating a platinum coin with an imaginary price to fund government operations would mark a radical departure from the historic understanding of the role and powers of the mint.

The United States Constitution (Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 5) grants Congress ""power To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures."" The Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint for this purpose. It allowed citizens to convert gold, silver and other metals into coins issued by the government mint, which attested to the value and purity of those coins. This service was initially provided nearly free of charge, other than a small fee to cover the expenses of the process.

The mission of the Mint changed as it became an adjunct to the Federal Reserve, to which Congress delegated expansion or contraction of the money supply under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. As a result, the mint retained responsibilities and powers delegated by Congress in Title 31 of the United States Code.. 31 U.S.C. §5111(a)(1), which instructs the secretary of the Treasury to produce the coins described in Section 5112 "" in amounts the Secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States."" Those coins, from pennies to half-dollars, are specified – along with their compositions – in 31 U.S.C. §5112.

DEMOCRATS' SPENDING THREATENS AMERICANS' HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING

Since the creation of the Mint, the treasurer has ensured that there are enough coins in circulation to ensure that those engaged in everyday commerce can conduct transactions without having to resort to giving change in candy, as is done in some countries with coin shortages. The Mint sends its newly minted coins to the Federal Reserve, which then distributes them to its member banks as needed.

The Mint produces about 14 billion coins – worth some $1.1 billion – each year. That’s roughly the same level of production as in 1976, despite massive population and economic growth. With more transactions being done via check or credit card, there has been no need for a large increase in coinage.

Congress further expressly authorized the Mint to strike commemorative coins and collectibles that may be sold to the public at a markup. It may also produce pure gold and silver coins – typically not used for everyday commercial transactions – sufficient ""to meet public demand"" and made available to the public at a cost not exceeding the production plus marketing expenses (Section 5112(i) and (f).

There is no reason to believe that Congress, when it enacted this statutory provision largely for the creation of souvenir coins, also intended to give the Mint effective control of the money supply, which is exactly what would happen if the Mint could issue coins in nonsense values like $1 trillion.

Furthermore, exercise of such power – even if lawful – would stoke economic mayhem by inducing unlimited increases in the amount of dollars in existence.

Today, Treasury has only very limited capacity to issue U.S. currency notes – only up to $300 million may be outstanding and in circulation. (31 U.S. Code Section 5115) and none may be held or used for reserve. These are not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes we think of as cash. Although the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing produces these notes, this is done at the behest of the Federal Reserve under the authority given the central bank by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that actually delegated responsibility over money creation to the Fed.

Minting $1 trillion coins dutifully bought by the Fed would effectively end the supposed independence of the Federal Reserve. Treasury has already dramatically eroded the separation between the politically motivated administration and the supposed neutral experts at the Federal Reserve by effectively forcing the Fed to buy trillions in new debt during COVID lockdowns.

But never has the U.S. Mint used its limited minting authority as a mechanism to create coins with fake denominations for the purpose of funding government operations.

Such a concept lies in the realm of banana republics. Indeed, a trillion-dollar coin would further concentrate American monetary policy into the hands of one of the most reckless administrations in our nation’s history, while paving the way for much higher inflation in the future.

22,US ally announces spy 'hive' bust in major intel victory against foreign nation,"Australia’s top intelligence official revealed that the country has purged a number of ""highly trained"" spies that have operated there for years.

""They were good — but ASIO was better. We watched them. We mapped their activities. We mounted an intense and sustained campaign of operational activity,"" Mike Burgess, chief of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), said Tuesday. ""Working with our partners, we removed them. The hive is history.""

""ASIO is... busier than any time in our 74-year history. Busier than the Cold War, busier than 9/11, busier than the height of the caliphate,"" Burgess added. ""From where I sit, it looks like hand-to-hand combat.""

Burgess did not identify the country behind the operation, but he revealed plenty of details, such as how the spies aimed to manipulate and influence media coverage in a ""concerted campaign,"" the BBC reported.

The operation included ""repeated attempts to hack into scores of Australian media outlets"" to unmask sources critical of the foreign government.

One of the operatives would offer journalists all-expense-paid tours to a foreign country where other operatives could gain information for leverage, while others would study and try to seduce journalists, as well as judges and other officials.

Burgess highlighted a more troubling element of the operation that focused on targeting dissidents of the home nation, which included plans to physically harm targets.

""In one case, the intelligence service started monitoring a human rights activist and plotted to lure the target offshore, where the individual could be — quote — 'disposed of,'"" he said. ""In another, a lackey was dispatched to locate specific dissidents and — quote — 'deal with them.'""

Burgess stressed that ASIO would need to take more aggressive measures going forward to create a stronger ""counterespionage posture,"" The Guardian reported.

""In the last year, we have identified multiple spies from multiple countries developing and trying to leverage relationships with government officials, bank workers, doctors, police employees and other professions to obtain the personal details of perceived dissidents,"" Burgess said.

""Insiders have been offered tens of thousands of dollars to… ‘do whatever is necessary’ to obtain personal data,"" he explained. ""The spies and their proxies can then use this information to identify, locate, follow, film, harass and intimidate their targets.""

23,"Most US states failing to protect schools' water from lead contaminants, study finds","Could drinking from the school’s water fountain put your child’s health at risk?

The odds are higher than parents might think, according to a new report from the Environment America Research & Policy Center in Denver, Colorado, called ""Get the Lead Out.""

Researchers examined each U.S. state’s policy in regard to preventing lead contamination of drinking water.

More than half the states got a failing grade of an F.

KIDS’ SCREEN TIME SKYROCKETED DURING PANDEMIC — AND IT’S STILL HIGHER THAN PRE-COVID

Eight states received a D and 13 got a C.

Only two states — New Hampshire and New Jersey — plus Washington, D.C., scored a B.

John Rumpler, lead author of the study and clean water program director for Environment America, said an F generally means a state has done ""little to nothing"" to stop lead contamination of schools’ water.

""Many of these states now have limited, voluntary testing programs, but testing doesn't make the water any safer,"" Rumpler told Fox News Digital via an email.

""Instead of spending time and money on more tests confirming that kids have been drinking lead-tainted water, families would be better served if officials took steps to prevent lead contamination in the first place.""

More than half of U.S. states got a failing grade of an F for their efforts to protect schools' drinking water from lead.

Environment America last performed this study in 2019.

The results weren’t promising then, but Rumpler said the data confirming widespread contamination of schools' water is even stronger now.

The new study was released on Thursday morning, Feb. 23, 2023.

Health hazards of lead in drinking water

The dangers of drinking water tainted with lead — a toxic metal — are well-known and widespread.

In children, exposure to even small amounts over time can lead to behavioral and learning problems, stunted growth, lower IQ, hearing problems, anemia and damage to the nervous system, as listed on the EPA’s website.

POST-COVID, MANY PARENTS ARE GIVING KIDS FEVER-REDUCING MEDICINE WHEN IT'S NOT NECESSARY: STUDY

In rare cases, high levels of lead exposure can result in coma, seizures or even death.

The effects are far more pronounced in children than in adults.

""Children have developing brains that are highly susceptible to the damaging effects of lead,"" Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist at the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C., told Fox News Digital in an email.

""While a smaller number of children might be admitted to the ER with acute lead poisoning — from whatever source — millions of kids are at risk of behavioral, developmental and/or cognitive damage from low levels of lead,"" Rumpler added.

Efforts lacking in urban and rural schools

Rumpler was somewhat surprised to find that lead contamination of water is happening in suburban and rural schools as well as in urban ones.

""The time for state and local governments to step in and protect our kids' health is now.""

""Tests have documented lead-tainted water in all types of communities — rural towns, big cities and affluent suburbs,"" the study findings stated.

""Examples include schools in Cherry Hill, New Jersey; Yarmouth, Maine; several school districts in upstate New York and suburban communities in Illinois.""

AS EMERGENCY ROOMS SEE MORE OF AMERICA'S MENTALLY ILL KIDS, NEW STUDY PINPOINTS ISSUES

Among the schools that are testing their water, some found alarmingly high levels of lead.

At a Montessori school in Cleveland, for example, water from a drinking fountain was found to contain 1,560 parts per billion of lead; a faucet at an elementary school in Massachusetts tested at 22,400 parts per billion.

By comparison, the EPA only allows a maximum of 15 parts per billion, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has called for limits to be set at 1 part per billion.

Where’s all the lead coming from?

The problem stems from aging school buildings — and old pipes.

A 2016 report in Education Week found that the average age of U.S. school buildings was 44 years.

""Because many schools are older and may contain lead pipes or older fixtures, it is certainly possible that these aging plumbing systems may experience corrosion over time, leading to the release of lead into the drinking water,"" said Johnson-Arbor.

In many cases, the service lines carrying water from the streets to the school buildings are also made from lead.

There is no federal law that requires schools to test drinking water for lead, per the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Lead gasoline and lead-based paints were both banned in the 1970s.

However, Rumpler pointed out that limits on lead in plumbing and fixtures were not dramatically reduced until 2014.

New laws signify (slow) progress

The Environmental Protection Agency has called for drinking water to contain zero traces of lead due to health hazards.

Even so, there is no federal law that requires schools to test drinking water for lead, per the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

CDC ADDS COVID-19 VACCINES TO OFFICIAL IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE FOR KIDS AS YOUNG AS 6 MONTHS

""In all states with failing grades, we could find no law requiring all schools to even test their water for lead, never mind shut down taps where lead is detected or prevent contamination in the first place,"" said Rumpler.

However, on a positive note, some areas — such as Maryland and Washington, D.C. — have made at least some improvements to their laws surrounding schools’ water safety.

""​​Since our last report in 2019, several states have gone from utter failure to taking at least some incremental steps toward safer drinking water for children at school,"" Rumpler told Fox News Digital.

""Yet in nearly every case, even these new policies only require remediation of taps if testing confirms lead concentrations in water above a certain threshold.""

These ""test and fix"" policies are better than nothing, but they don’t eliminate the risk — especially when lead concentrations can vary from one faucet or fountain to the next.

What’s being done and what still need to happen?

In an ideal world, schools would remove any lead-containing plumbing and fixtures to eliminate the problem at the source.

Yet when that’s not feasible, Rumpler calls for replacing fountains with water stations that have filters certified to remove lead.

These filters capture the lead before it can contaminate kids’ water bottles (or lunches, when used in the cafeteria).

Schools in some cities — including Portland, San Diego and Detroit — have already started this effort.

Ideally, Rumpler says all schools should have these filtered water stations, with at least one per 100 students and staff members.

Parents can ask principals to identify those filtered stations and make sure their kids only use those for drinking.

For new construction or renovations, all fixtures and plumbing should use only lead-free materials.

""Given the pervasiveness of lead contamination in schools' water across the country, the time for state and local governments to step in and protect our kids' health is now,"" Rumpler said.

""It would take a small fraction of the unprecedented federal funding that states and school districts are now receiving to install filtered water stations at every school in America.""

24,US government agency says 'no link' between dead whales and wind farm development,"An independent government agency focused on the protection and conservation of marine mammals said this week there is no evidence linking the recent string of dead whales washing ashore to wind farm development.

This winter, 16 whales have washed up dead along the Atlantic coast in places like Assateague Island in Maryland, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Long Island, New York.

The standings are part of what the National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, call the Humpback Whale Unusual Mortality Event, which started in 2016.

DOZENS OF NJ MAYORS CALL FOR IMMEDIATE OFFSHORE WIND MORATORIUM AFTER LATEST WHALE DEATHS

The Marine Mammal Commission said in a statement posted to its website on Tuesday that 40% of the whales were examined at necropsy and showed evidence that a ship struck them, or they got entangled in fishing gear.

The commission also said these strandings are nothing new, and they are not isolated to the Atlantic coast.

According to the commissioner, at least 10 humpback whales have stranded each year during the UME, though in 2017 the highest number of 34 were recorded stranded.

What scientists have found is the number of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is increasing, and the younger whales are moving to the Atlantic coast, where they are vulnerable to being struck by ships.

UPTICK IN DEAD WHALES ALONG EAST COAST SPARKS INTENSE DEBATE AMONG ENVIRONMENTALISTS OVER OFFSHORE WIND

Many people, though, say wind farm development is the cause of the whale strandings.

Wind farm development and research is taking place up and down the Atlantic coast, in places like Block Island, Rhode Island; Montauk, New York; off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland, and nearly 20 miles offshore Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, say there is no link between wind farms and the whale strandings.

Now add a third, but independent, agency.

""Despite several reports in the media, there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development,"" the Marine Mammal Commission said.

NJ CONGRESSMAN DEMANDS INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS ARE KILLING WHALES

The commission also addressed the stranding of a North Atlantic right whale in Virginia Beach on Feb. 12.

According to the commission, the 20-year-old, 43-foot male whale was subject of a necropsy conducted by the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Program, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and City of Virginia Beach’s Beach Operation Division.

What scientists discovered was the whale suffered a catastrophic blunt force traumatic injury, impacting the vertebral column.

Independent Women's Forum Senior Fellow and District of Conservation Podcast Host Gabriella Hoffman is not buying the dismissal of wind farms when it comes to the whale strandings.

""The Biden administration is sowing distrust with the American public by instantly dismissing concerns that offshore wind development could be behind the whale deaths,"" Hoffman told Fox News Digital. ""Calling it misinformation or downplaying the concern is why people don’t trust them on the conservation front. Even NOAA fisheries spox Ben Laws told the Chesapeake Bay Magazine that offshore wind could constitute Level A and Level B harassment.""

Hoffman also said NOAA conceded that increased traffic from vessels because of wind farm construction could lead to more clashes between whales and boats.

Wednesday’s comments came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

Price clarified that the U.S. has not seen concrete evidence of direct support, but added ""we don’t believe they’ve taken it off the table, either.""

Price said China’s providing of lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine ""would cause real consequences in our bilateral relationship.""

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

""We’ve been clear we will not hesitate to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, and we’re monitoring very vigilantly for potential violations.""

Price predicted that China would suffer ""reputational costs"" if it were to follow through with providing Russia with lethal aid.

""Already, it is providing diplomatic support. It is providing economic support. It is … spewing propaganda that serves to amplify the lies, the distortions, the myths, the half-truths that are emanating from Moscow,"" he said.

Later in the press conference, a reporter questioned what possible leverage the U.S. has as a deterrent if China sides with Russia.

Price said there was ""an advantage to some degree of ambiguity.""

""We have been clear with the PRC about the fact that consequences would befall them if they were to provide lethal assistance, but we think it’s most effective if we leave that ambiguous and we continue to warn consistently of those consequences,"" Price said.

Experts have argued that the Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing its suspicions that China was considering providing Russia with lethal aid.

27,"Christianity quickly diminishing in US, on pace to become minority religion in decades: study","A recently released study suggests the number of Christians in the U.S. is diminishing quickly and being replaced by those who do not identify with any religion.

A new report by Pew Research Center and the General Social Survey published Tuesday found a surge of adults leaving Christianity to become atheist, agnostic or ""nothing in particular."" It predicted that if the number of Christians under 30 abandoning their faith accelerates beyond the current pace, adherents of the historically dominant religion of the U.S. could become a minority by 2045.

Noting how approximately 90% of Americans identified as Christians in the early 1990s, the study observed that number, which includes children, had fallen to only 64% by 2020. The number of people in the U.S. who identify as religiously unaffiliated, meanwhile, skyrocketed from 16% in 2007 to 29% in 2020, the research showed. Other religions such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, accounted for approximately 6% in 2020.

The study presented four hypothetical scenarios by which the U.S. religious landscape could change in the coming decades. In one scenario, researchers analyzed the potential impact of young Christian adults abandoning their faith and switching affiliation without limitation.

PASTORS BATTLE SKYROCKETING BURNOUT AMID POLITICS, PANDEMIC: ‘WEARING ON THE SOUL’

The other three scenarios hypothesize other types of increasing religious disaffiliation, but ""they all show Christians continuing to shrink as a share of the U.S. population, even under the counterfactual assumption that all switching came to a complete stop in 2020.""

All four scenarios project swelling ranks among the religiously unaffiliated, or ""nones,"" throughout the next half-century. The only scenario that projects Christians maintaining a majority in the U.S. through 2070 is if no one changes their religious affiliation after 2020.

""Of course, it is possible that events outside the study’s model — such as war, economic depression, climate crisis, changing immigration patterns or religious innovations — could reverse current religious switching trends, leading to a revival of Christianity in the United States,"" the study said. ""But there are no current switching patterns in the U.S. that can be factored into the mathematical models to project such a result.""

METHODIST LEADERS SAY ‘REBELLION AND DYSFUNCTION’ OVER LGBT ISSUES SPLITTING DENOMINATION

The study's data showed that while more older Americans are remaining identified with Christianity, many younger adults are increasingly switching to ""nones.""

""If the pace of switching before the age of 30 were to speed up throughout the projection period without any brakes, Christians would no longer be a majority by 2045,"" Pew researchers noted.

In such a scenario, the number of religiously unaffiliated would stand at 52% and the number of Christians dip to 35% by 2070.

""Switching has not ended and there is no reason to think it will come to an abrupt stop,"" the researchers said, adding, ""Still, if fewer future young adults switch from Christianity to no affiliation, or if movement in the opposite direction increases, the future religious landscape might resemble the results of this projection.""

The researchers predicted based on recent generational trends that the most likely scenario among their hypotheticals is Christianity is declining but with religious switching remaining capped at 50%.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/christianity-quickly-diminishing-us-pace-become-minority-religion-decades-study,N/A

29,"Wild 'super pigs' in Canada poised to wreak environmental havoc, spread disease in US, expert says","A cross-bred ""super pig"" from Canada is poised to wreak havoc on the environment in the United States and must be dealt with aggressively and immediately, a wildlife expert told Fox News Digital.

""These pigs are easily the worst invasive large mammal on the planet,"" said Dr. Ryan Brook, an assistant professor in the department of animal and poultry science at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.

These ""super pigs"" are actually a cross between a European wild boar and a domestic pig, Brook said.

PIGS AND A PLAYLIST? FARMER FINDS HIS PIGS ARE HAPPIER WHEN THEY HEAR MUSIC

The pigs ""cause crop damage, destroy natural environments, get into cities, destroy water quality and can spread disease to humans, livestock, pets and native wildlife,"" he also noted.

The pigs are coming into the U.S. from Canada as their numbers swell there, causing populations to migrate south. Left unchecked, these ""super pigs"" could negatively impact just about everyone, Brook emphasized.

""The only people who should be worried about this is anyone that lives in North America and eats meat, or eats vegetables, or eats any foods based on grain crops or spends time outside for any reason,"" he said.

The reason these ""super pigs"" are so dangerous is twofold, Brooks said.

First, they lack natural predators.

""Wild boar farmers were told to cross the wild boar with domestic pigs to make a bigger and longer animal.""

""There are no native pigs in Canada,"" said Brook. ""Anything that sounds like a pig and oinks like a pig has been imported.""

The first European wild boars were imported to Canada in the 1980s to diversify that country's agriculture, said Brook.

While these boars sometimes managed to escape their fences, after the wild boar market peaked in 2001, some farmers had no more use for the animals.

COW CUDDLING AS STRESS RELIEF: IT'S ‘NATURALLY RELAXING,’ SAYS ANIMAL SANCTUARY

""Many producers cut their fences and let them go,"" said Brook.

Initially, it was believed that these boars ""would never survive a Canadian winter,"" particularly in the harsh cold of the country's Prairie Provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, he said.

This was quickly proven incorrect — and it presents the second reason these pigs wreak havoc: science.

The ""super pigs"" began with a unique set of circumstances, said Brook.

PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN QUITS HER JOB AS MAKEUP ARTIST, OPENS FARM ANIMAL RESCUE SANCTUARY

""Wild boar farmers were told to cross the wild boar with domestic pigs to make a bigger and longer animal,"" Brook said.

He said a domestic pig has an extra set of ribs and has larger, more frequent litters.

""This was great for wild boar farmers, but [it] was a huge problem when [these animals] got into the wild,"" he said.

Additionally, a scientific concept called ""Bergmann's rule"" has come into play — to a potentially disastrous environmental end.

Bergmann's rule states that specimens in a species ""will tend to be larger the farther north you go in their range, because being big is really important to survival in the cold,"" said Brook.

SHAKIRA AND SON ATTACKED BY WILD BOARS: ‘THEY’VE DESTROYED EVERYTHING’

This has proven true for the ""super pig"" in Canada, with the largest one discovered weighing well over 600 pounds, he also said.

The typical male feral hog is 220 pounds, says the website for the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

The animals' size, along with their intelligence, has made the ""super pigs"" capable of survival in harsh conditions and therefore hard to eradicate, said Brook. He noted they've even learned how to tunnel into snow caves to keep themselves warm.

""It is much warmer under than snow than on top of it,"" said Brook.

Eradicating these wild pigs must be done as ""quickly as possible,"" he emphasized.

RISING POPULATIONS OF WILD HOGS WORRYING EXPERTS, MANY DEEMED 'SUPER-PIGS': REPORT

There must be ""a rapid and highly aggressive response, just like dealing with cancer or forest fires — that is really the only option.""

He added, ""Once [the pigs] are established, you will have them for another 500 years.""

Traditional hunting techniques are not effective in pig eradication, said Brook.

""Large traps and tracking Judas pigs (wild pig with a GPS collar that will lead you to other pigs), ground removal teams, fencing and education are all key,"" he said.

Failure to quickly eradicate the pigs will result in devastation to the environment.

32,Biden says three aerial 'objects' US shot down likely not related to China surveillance,"Three aerial objects that were shot down after the military's take-down of the Chinese spy balloon aren't believed to be connected to China or other surveillance operations, President Biden said Thursday.

The intelligence committee is still assessing the three unknown aerial objects. ""We don’t yet know what these three objects were, but nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country,"" the president said during Thursday afternoon's press briefing.

""These three objects were most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research,"" Biden said.

Fighter jets shot down at least four aerial objects , including a Chinese spy balloon that flew across country from Alaska to South Carolina, over an eight-day stretch.

""I gave the order to take down these three objects due to hazards to civilian commercial air traffic, and because we could not rule out the surveillance risk of sensitive facilities,"" Biden said.

""The remnants are in very difficult terrain with low temperatures,"" he said. ""They haven't been able to find them.""

Despite the recent sightings, Biden said there's no evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky.

33,Former Mexican security chief convicted of drug trafficking in US,"A former Mexican presidential cabinet member was convicted in the U.S. on Tuesday of taking massive bribes to protect the violent drug cartels he was tasked with combating.

Under tight security, an anonymous New York federal court jury deliberated three days before reaching a verdict in the drug trafficking case against former Public Security Secretary Genaro García Luna.

He is the highest-ranking current or former Mexican official ever to be tried in the United States.

KEY WITNESS TESTIFIES IN TRIAL FOR FORMER MEXICAN PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEF GENARO GARCÍA LUNA

García Luna, who denied the allegations, headed Mexico’s federal police and then was its top public safety official from 2006 to 2012. His lawyers said the charges were based on lies from criminals who wanted to punish his drug-fighting efforts and to get sentencing breaks for themselves by helping prosecutors.

He showed no apparent reaction on hearing the verdict in a case with political ramifications on both sides of the border.

Current Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has railed throughout the trial against ex-President Felipe Calderón’s administration for, at a minimum, putting García Luna in charge of Mexico’s security. López Obrador spokesperson Jesús Ramírez tweeted after the verdict that ""justice has come"" to a Calderón ally and that ""the crimes committed against our people will never be forgotten.""

García Luna's work also introduced him to high-level American politicians and other officials, who considered him a key cartel-fighting partner as Washington embarked on a $1.6 billion push to beef up Mexican law enforcement and stem the flow of drugs.

The Americans weren’t accused of wrongdoing, and although suspicions long swirled around García Luna, the trial didn’t delve into the extent of U.S. officials’ knowledge about them before his 2019 arrest. López Obrador has, however, pointedly suggested that Washington investigate its own law enforcement and intelligence officials who worked with García Luna during Calderón’s administration.

A roster of ex-smugglers and former Mexican officials testified that García Luna took millions of dollars in cartel cash, met with major traffickers and kept law enforcement at bay.

He was ""the best investment they had,"" said Sergio ""El Grande"" Villarreal Barragan, a former federal police officer who worked for cartels on the side and later as his main job.

He and other witnesses said that on García Luna’s watch, police tipped traffickers about upcoming raids, ensured that cocaine could pass freely through the country, colluded with cartels to raid rivals, and did other favors. One ex-smuggler said García Luna shared a document that reflected U.S. law enforcement’s information about a huge cocaine shipment that was seized in Mexico around 2007.

García Luna, 54, didn’t testify at the trial, though his wife took the stand in an apparent effort to portray their assets in Mexico as legitimately acquired and upper-middle-class, but not lavish. The couple moved to Miami in 2012, when the Mexican administration changed and he became a consultant on security issues.

García Luna’s lawyer César de Castro emphasized that prosecutors’ case relied on testimony from admitted lawbreakers, without recordings, messages or a documented money trail to corroborate them.

""Nothing backs up what these killers, torturers, fraudsters, and epic narcotics traffickers claimed about Genaro García Luna,"" defense lawyer César de Castro said in a closing argument.

García Luna was convicted on charges that include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, which carries a potential sentencing range of 20 years to life in prison. His sentencing is set for June 27.

The trial was peppered with glimpses of such narco-extravagances as a private zoo with a lion, a hippo, white tigers and more. Jurors heard about tons of cocaine moving through Latin America in shipping containers, go-fast boats, private jets, planes, trains and even submarines.

And there were horrific reminders of the extraordinary violence those drugs fueled.

Witnesses described cartel killings and kidnappings, allegedly including an abduction of García Luna himself. There was testimony about police officers being slaughtered and drug-world rivals being dismembered, skinned and dangled from bridges as cartel factions fought each other while buying police protection.

Witnesses said García Luna held meetings with cartel leaders in settings ranging from a country house to a car wash and collected boxes and bags full of drug money at safe houses, a warehouse full of cocaine and a fancy Mexico City restaurant.

One ex-smuggler, Óscar ""El Lobo"" Nava Valencia, said he personally heard García Luna and a then-top police official say they would ""stand with us"" during a meeting with notorious Sinaloa cocaine cartel kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzman’s associates amid a cartel civil war. That sit-down alone cost the drug gang $3 million, Nava Valencia said.

FORMER MEXICAN SECURITY CZAR EMBEZZLED UP TO $746M, AUTHORITIES CLAIM

Testimony also aired a secondhand claim that Calderón, the former president, sought to shield Guzmán against a major rival; Calderón called the allegation ""absurd"" and ""an absolute lie.""

García Luna was arrested after testimony about his alleged graft emerged at Guzman’s high-profile trial about four years ago in the same New York courtroom.

The former lawman also faces various Mexican arrest warrants and charges relating to government technology contracts, prison contracting and the bungled U.S. ""Fast and Furious"" investigation into suspicions that guns were illegally making their way from the U.S. to Mexican drug cartels. The Mexican government has also filed a civil suit against García Luna and his alleged associates and businesses in Florida, seeking to recover $700 million that Mexico claims he garnered through corruption.

Anticorruption activists gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate Tuesday's verdict.

""[Mexican migrants] have voting power and the ability to influence and advise their family who lives in Mexico,"" Marko Cortés, national president of Mexico’s center-right party PAN, said at an event near Dallas, Texas.

Remittances, the money sent from citizens living and working abroad to families from their homeland, play a significant part as a crucial source of income for countries like Mexico, and with that comes the right to vote in key elections. Mexican citizens who have left the country can vote in presidential elections, but only a fraction of them usually register to vote.

Mexico is the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world in 2022, with its roughly $58.9 billion a nearly 13% increase over the previous year, according to the IMF. Nearly 11 million Mexican nationals live abroad, with the majority residing in the U.S.

MEXICO TO FAST-TRACK VISAS FOR CUBANS WITH FAMILY ALREADY IN COUNTRY

The election in 2024 will bring in a new president as current Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will finish out his term and cannot run again – even if they hold the post on a caretaker basis. Recent polling indicates strong support for Obrador’s MORENA party, but it remains unclear whom the party might finally put forth as a candidate.

The parties have already started their outreach, with some looking across the border to tap into that significant foreign contingent for support, according to the Texas Tribune. About 2.5 million immigrants in Texas – about half the total number in the state – come from Mexico.

35,US leads the rest of the world with $196 billion given to Ukraine amid war with Russia,"The United States continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in promised or sent aid, as the U.S. ally continues its fight against Russia.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

These figures do not include loans sent to Ukraine or additional contributions that were approved by their respective governments between Dec. 2022 and Feb. 2023.

MATT GAETZ RIPS ‘BIPARTISAN COALITION’ THAT FAVORS WAR IN UKRAINE

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited each of these top contributing countries, except Estonia.

The growing figures come as the Ukraine-Russia war nears its one-year mark. Russia first invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

""How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?"" asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. ""Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which redline we set will we not later cross?""

The proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations.

The ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" has at least 10 co-sponsors and calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution notes the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, providing financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally.

36,US military shoots down unidentified flying object over Great Lakes region; same object spotted over Montana,"The U.S. military on Sunday shot down another unidentified flying object over Lake Huron in Michigan.

The Defense Department (DOD) said President Joe Biden, shortly before 2:42 p.m., directed an F-16 to fire an AIM-9X missile to shoot down an airborne object flying at around 20,000 feet over Lake Huron.

The DOD said the path and altitude ""raised concerns, including that it could be a hazard to civil aviation.""

""The location chosen for this shoot down afforded us the opportunity to avoid impact to people on the ground while improving chances for debris recovery. There are no indications of any civilians hurt or otherwise affected,"" Lt. Col. César Santiago said in a statement.

It was the third time in as many days and the fourth overall since Feb. 4 that an ""unidentified object"" was shot down in North America.

Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., confirmed that the ""U.S. military has decommissioned another ‘object’ over Lake Huron.""

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., tweeted that the object had been ""downed"" by Air Force and National Guard pilots.

CANADA RECOVERY TEAMS SEARCHING FOR THIRD FLYING OBJECT SHOT DOWN OVER NORTH AMERICAN AIRSPACE, TRUDEAU SAYS

The U.S. has shot down four objects over North America in the past week, with the first being a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4. The second and third are believed to have been smaller balloons, which were shot down over Alaska and Canada, respectively. Sunday's is the fourth object shot down in about eight days.

U.S. officials were still trying to precisely identify the other two objects blown from the sky by F-22 fighter jets over the past two days and were working to determine whether China was responsible as concerns escalate about what Washington says is Beijing's large-scale aerial surveillance program.

U.S. officials said the two more recent objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected Chinese spy balloon that fell into the Atlantic Ocean after being downed by a U.S. air-to-air missile. They said the Alaska and Canada objects were not consistent with the fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that targeted more than 40 countries, stretching back at least into the Trump administration.

That large white orb first appeared over the U.S. in late January, and since then Americans have been fixated on the sky above them. U.S. authorities made clear that they constantly monitor for unknown radar blips, and it is not unusual to shut down airspace as a precaution to evaluate them.

On Sunday, the U.S. briefly closed the airspace over Lake Michigan; on Saturday night, that was done over rural Montana. Officials Sunday said they were no longer tracking any objects over those locations.

""North American Aerospace Defense Command detected the object Sunday morning and has maintained visual and radar tracking of it. Based on its flight path and data we can reasonably connect this object to the radar signal picked up over Montana, which flew in proximity to sensitive DOD sites,"" the DOD said.

""We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more.""

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., slammed the Biden administration for its ""lack of communication"" regarding the closing of Montana airspace and the recent shoot-downs.

37,US forces China’s hand in revealing possible lethal aid to Russia amid war in Ukraine: experts,"The Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing this week that it suspects China is considering sending Russia lethal aid as Moscow’s war in Ukraine drags on, experts told Fox News Digital Tuesday.

""China has a difficult decision to make,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""They want Russia to win. On the other hand, they don’t want to lose their economic access to Europe.

""It’s impossible to know where they’ll come down,"" he added.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken first revealed the U.S.'s suspicions following his meeting with Beijing's top diplomat Saturday, after which he expressed concern ""that China’s considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine.""

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.

China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.

In recent weeks Beijing has struggled to keep a balance between maintaining constructive relations with the West while condemning the U.S. of ""hysterics,"" as Beijing did over the shooting down of the surveillance balloon and accusing it of escalating the war by providing defensive aid to Ukraine.

International security experts agree that China is trying to ""strike a balance"" between preserving its economic interests and its desire to see the U.S. fall in the global hierarchy.

""China needs Russia to help it change the rules-based world order,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Michael Ryan said. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] partner in trying to undermine U.S. influence in the world and to show that autocracy and not democracy is the superior form of government.""

Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.

Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Providing arms to Russia would have obvious consequences and change the dynamic on the battlefield, making it harder for Ukraine to win.

Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.

""This would increase the odds of the war in Ukraine becoming even more protracted,"" explained James Anderson, the former acting under secretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration. ""The longer the war in Ukraine drags on, the greater the chances it will spread to other countries in Europe.""

Iran and North Korea have already been providing some weaponry to Moscow, and Tehran’s drone contribution has allowed Russia to hit the one area that Ukraine is unable to effectively beat it — air defense.

But Russia needs munitions, tanks and armored vehicles — which is where China could step in and change the course of the war.

Experts agree that China’s involvement in the war would do more than aid Russia’s war effort, it would morph into a new ""Cold War with China.""

""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPY CRAFT

Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.

""[China] does not want to see Russia fail because it portends…Western support in terms of [the] Taiwan scenario,"" Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under the Trump administration, told Fox News.

""The Chinese have been caught by surprise,"" Klinck said pointing to not only Russia’s operational failures on the battlefield but the steadfast response from the U.S. and its Western allies.

Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.

""What is more important to China: ensuring Russian success?"" he questioned. ""Or is it being part of an international order?""

Ultimately experts agree that China has to consider whether it will more negatively be affected by the strategic implications of a Russian failure and its ally’s standing on the global stage or the economic repercussions that would directly impact Beijing.

""Those domestic implications are always what drive Chinese decision-making,"" Klinck argued.

Anderson also pointed out that the West will need to move quickly to decide how it will respond with economic repercussions should China involve itself in the war effort.

""This would be a real test of Western unity since many European countries have extensive trading relationships with China, and some of our allies and partners may well be reluctant to jeopardize them with sanctions,"" he said. ""Anything less than a massive sanctioning effort would likely fail.""

""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.

38,"US intel assesses Chinese spy balloons transited US several times, went 'undetected': Senior admin official","U.S. intelligence assesses that Chinese government surveillance balloons have transited the continental United States several times but went ""undetected,"" a senior administration official told Fox News Digital.

A defense official on Saturday said Chinese spy balloons briefly traveled over the United States at least three times during the Trump administration.

TRUMP, TOP NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS REFUTE CLAIM THAT CHINESE SPY BALLOONS TRANSITED US UNDER LAST ADMIN

Former President Trump and a number of his top national security and defense officials refuted Biden administration officials' claims that Chinese surveillance balloons briefly transited the continental United States during the Trump administration, telling Fox News Digital that it ""never happened.""

But on Sunday, a senior administration official told Fox News Digital that ""U.S. intelligence, not the Biden administration"" assesses that ""PRC government surveillance balloons transited the continental U.S. briefly at least three times during the prior administration and once that we know of at the beginning of this administration, but never for this duration of time.""

The information on Chinese spy balloons under the Trump administration was ""discovered after"" he left office and ""they went undetected,"" the official told Fox News Digital.

The official said this is ""part of a larger pattern.""

""These balloons are all part of a PRC fleet of balloons developed to conduct surveillance operations, which have also violated the sovereignty of other countries,"" the official explained, adding that these activities are ""often undertaken at the direction of the People’s Liberation Army.""

The official said that over the past several years, Chinese balloons have been spotted over countries across five continents, including in East Asia, South Asia and Europe.

""Two things can be true at once: this happened and it wasn’t detected,"" the official told Fox News Digital.

U.S. officials told Fox News on Sunday that a Chinese spy balloon crashed into the Pacific off the coast of Hawaii four months ago. Those officials said that at least one Chinese spy balloon flew over portions of Texas and Florida during the Trump administration.

MILITARY EXPERTS PROVIDE FRANK ASSESSMENT OF US SHORTCOMINGS IN POTENTIAL CHINA CONFLICT

But Trump and his top national security and defense officials told Fox News Digital they were never briefed on something like that happening, stressing that it did not occur, and saying the Biden administration is spreading disinformation.

""This never happened. It would have never happened,"" Trump told Fox News Digital on Sunday morning, adding that Beijing ""respected us greatly"" under his leadership.

""It never happened with us under the Trump administration and if it did, we would have shot it down immediately,"" Trump said. ""It's disinformation.""

Trump said the Biden administration is spreading this because ""they look so bad, as usual.""

""They are incompetent,"" he said.

Former Trump White House national security adviser John Bolton told Fox News Digital that he never heard of anything like this under his tenure.

""I don’t know of any balloon flights by any power over the United States during my tenure, and I’d never heard of any of that occurring before I joined in 2018,"" Bolton said. ""I haven’t heard of anything that occurred after I left either.""

Bolton said that if the Biden administration has ""specific examples, they need to tell Congress.""

He added: ""I can say with 100% certainty not during my tenure.""

Robert O’Brien, who served as White House national security adviser from 2019 to 2021, told Fox News Digital that he had no knowledge of anything like this occurring.

""Unequivocally, I have never been briefed on the issue,"" O’Brien said, telling Fox News Digital that his team, which included Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser, and Allison Hooker, who served as senior adviser to Asia, also were not briefed on these activities.

Former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, who led the intelligence community at the onset of COVID, told Fox News Digital that he did ""one of the biggest intelligence deep dives on China, their spying and the origins of COVID"" during his tenure.

""It never came up,"" he said. ""If a balloon had come up, we would have known. Someone in the intelligence community would have known, and it would have bubbled up to me to brief the president.""

And former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who led ODNI after Grenell and through the end of the Trump administration, also refuted the claim.

""It's not true. I can refute it,"" Ratcliffe said on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""The American people can refute it for themselves. Do you remember during the Trump administration, when photographers on the ground and commercial airline pilots were talking about a spy balloon over the United States that people could look up and see, even with the naked eye, and that a media that hated Donald Trump wasn't reporting?""

He added: ""I don't remember that either, because it didn't happen.""

Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck told Fox News Digital that he also was unaware.

""I can’t rule out that things occurred that I was unaware of, but I do think something like this, I would have been aware of,"" Klinck said.

Former Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper also said he was never told about Chinese surveillance balloons above the United States during his time at the Pentagon.

CHINESE SPY BALLOON MAY HAVE GATHERED ‘UNSEEN’ INFORMATION, EXPERTS SAY

""I don't ever recall somebody coming into my office or reading anything that the Chinese had a surveillance balloon above the United States,"" Esper said during an appearance on CNN. ""I would remember that for sure.""

And former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, who had previously served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also told Fox News he never had heard of a Chinese spy balloon while he was in government.

""Never heard a whisper and I have to think if anything like that happened that would have been a huge issue,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. ""No. Absolutely never heard of anything like that while I was in government or at the Pentagon.""

It is unclear, at this point, if these activities did take place, and if it was military leadership that chose not to brief civilian leadership on the matter.

39,US government monitoring suspected Chinese spy balloon over northern states,"The U.S. government is monitoring a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been moving over northern states over the past several days.

Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said during a briefing on Thursday afternoon that the U.S. government has detected a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the continental U.S.

""The United States government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now. The U.S. government to include Norad, continues to track and monitor it closely. The balloon is currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground. Instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years. Once the balloon was detected, the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information,"" Ryder said.

A senior defense official said that the U.S. government is ""confident"" that the surveillance balloon belongs to the People's Republic of China.

The defense official said that the balloon was recently over Montana and that officials were considering bringing it down with military assets, but they decided against doing so because of the risks associated, adding that President Joe Biden was briefed on the situation and asked for military options.

""You did see reports yesterday of a ground stop at Billings Airport and the mobilization of a number of assets, including F-22. The context for that was that we put some things on station in the event that a decision was made to bring this down while it was over Montana. So, we wanted to make sure we were coordinating with civil authorities to empty out the airspace around that potential area. But even with those protective measures taken, it was the judgment of our military commanders that we didn't drive the risk down low enough. So, we didn't take the shot,"" the official said.

The White House hasn't ruled out shooting the balloon down if it were deemed safe to do so, according to the source.

According to the source, there's more than just a balloon, and heavy equipment would come crashing to the ground if it were to be shot down, creating a large debris field.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin convened a meeting with senior Department of Defense leadership Wednesday to discuss the balloon, and it was decided not to take military action due to ""the risk to safety and security of people on the ground from the possible debris field,"" the official said. At the time, Austin was visiting Camp Navarro in the Philippines, which is around 2,000 miles from China.

The balloon's discovery also comes as the U.S. and Philippines agreed to increase its military presence within the islands amid escalating tensions between China and Taiwan.

The senior defense official said that the government has been tracking the balloon for ""some time"" and said it entered U.S. airspace a ""couple of days ago.""

40,George Santos cosponsors bill to make AR-15 the National Gun of the US,"Freshman U.S. Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., is co-sponsoring a bill that would make the AR-15 the National Gun of the United States.

The legislation, H.B. 1095, known as the AR-15 National Gun Act, was sponsored by Alabama Republican Barry Moore, FOX New York reported. Georgia Republican Andrew Clyde and Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert have also signed on as co-sponsors.

""The anti-Second Amendment group won’t stop until they take away all your firearms,"" Moore said Tuesday at a gun shop in Troy, Alabama to announce the bill. ""One rule to remember: any government that would take away one right would take away them all.""

GEORGE SANTOS DELIVERS SPEECH ON HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE AFTER LYING ABOUT JEWISH HERITAGE

Text of the bill was not available Thursday and was not posted on the Congressional website.

Santos, whose embattled electoral victory has dominated his first weeks in Congress, has not publicly said anything about the legislation. However, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul criticized him in a statement for attaching his name to the bill.

""This weapon of war has been used in mass shootings across the United States - from my hometown of Buffalo, where the shooter used a modified AR-15 to murder ten people in a despicable act of white supremacist terrorism, to Parkland, Florida, where the shooter killed seventeen innocent people with an AR-15-style weapon,"" she said.

""The families and friends of those killed in Parkland have become heroic advocates for gun safety - including the Beigel-Schulman family of Dix Hills, who fight for change in memory of their son, Scott,"" the governor added. ""This bill, which attempts to glorify the weapons that have been part of such horrific tragedies, adds unforgivable insult to injury for those families.""

The AR-15 has been used in several high-profile mass shootings and prompted some to call for the outlaw of the weapon along with other firearms.

Santos previously wore an AR-15 lapel pin on Capitol Hill. In an interview with the news outlet last week, he said, ""From the moment we come back from being in recess I'm going to be introducing some original bills and I think the district is going to appreciate them because they are really district-focused bills.""

41,Swalwell’s next attack on Trump: Kicking him out of the US Capitol,"Embattled Rep. Eric Swalwell, the Democrat who was kicked off the House Select Committee on Intelligence by Republicans for having a years-long relationship with a Chinese spy, is looking to kick former President Donald Trump out of the Capitol forever.

Swalwell, D-Calif., is the sole co-sponsor of a new Democratic resolution that says Trump and several of his top aides should be permanently banished from the Capitol because of their attempt to ""undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election.""

The resolution from Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., asks the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police to take ""such actions as may be necessary"" to prohibit Trump and eight of his top former advisers and counselors from ever entering the Capitol again.

MCCARTHY CONFIRMS SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR WILL LOSE COMMITTEE SEATS

It makes that recommendation after recounting the work of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, which held several Trump allies in criminal contempt of Congress and referred some of them to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.

""The effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election damaged the functions of our democracy,"" the resolution states. Those efforts also ""damaged the integrity of Congress’s constitutional role in certifying the election results.""

In addition to Trump, the resolution bans former Trump adviser Steve Bannon; former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; former White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino; former Trump assistant Peter Navarro; former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, who urged support for an investigation into election fraud in 2020; and Trump attorneys John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani, who also supported election fraud claims.

HOUSE SPEAKER MCCARTHY REJECTS JEFFRIES' DEMAND TO REAPPOINT SCHIFF, SWALWELL TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

Swalwell was one of several Democrats who aggressively accused Trump of conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 election and accused Trump of acting on ""Russia’s behalf"" while in office.

The tables were turned in late 2020, when reports surfaced that Swalwell had a lengthy relationship with a Chinese spy, Fang Fang, who worked on Swalwell’s campaign as early as 2014. Swalwell has denied any sexual relationship with Fang, but that news drew Republican complaints that Democrats should remove him from the House Intelligence Committee.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., finally kicked Swalwell and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., from the committee soon after McCarthy won the gavel in the new Congress.

After being relieved of their duties on the committee, Swalwell argued the decision was an example of how Republicans are trying to support Russia.

ERIC SWALWELL ROASTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ASKING WHY GOP COLLEAGUE'S 'GUN' IS 'SO SMALL'

""There is a sympathy for or a desire to, you know, do Putin’s bidding instead of America’s,"" Swalwell said.

""It inspires these death threats. People parrot what Kevin McCarthy is saying when they call and make the threats,"" Swalwell said.

A senior U.S. military official said that an F-22 was used to bring down the balloon at 58,000 feet, adding that a single A9X missile was fired.

A senior defense official said during a Thursday afternoon briefing that the U.S. government is ""confident"" the surveillance balloon is from the People's Republic of China.

When asked about the balloon on Saturday by a reporter, Biden said, ""We're going to take care of it.""

CHINA MAINTAINS SPY BALLOON IS CIVILIAN, CLAIMS SOME IN US 'HAVE HYPED IT UP TO ATTACK AND SMEAR CHINA'

A senior U.S. official told Fox News on Saturday that the government was considering a plan to shoot the balloon down while it was over the Atlantic Ocean, where it would not harm any individuals on the ground.

The official added that the U.S. government could potentially recover the balloon.

During the briefing on Thursday, the defense official said that the balloon had been previously spotted over Montana, where a decision was made to not shoot it down because of the potential risks.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin, III said in a statement after the balloon was shot down that ""President Biden gave his authorization to take down the surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon’s path.""

""After careful analysis, U.S. military commanders had determined downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload. In accordance with the President’s direction, the Department of Defense developed options to take down the balloon safely over our territorial waters, while closely monitoring its path and intelligence collection activities,"" Austin said.

""This action was taken in coordination, and with the full support, of the Canadian government. And we thank Canada for its contribution to tracking and analysis of the balloon through NORAD as it transited North America. Today’s deliberate and lawful action demonstrates that President Biden and his national security team will always put the safety and security of the American people first while responding effectively to the PRC’s unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,"" he added.

When President Biden was briefed on the situation, he asked for military options, the official said.

""You did see reports yesterday of a ground stop at Billings Airport and the mobilization of a number of assets, including F-22,"" the official said. ""The context for that was that we put some things on station in the event that a decision was made to bring this down while it was over Montana.""

""The airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,"" the spokesperson said. ""Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course.""

However, the Pentagon does not believe that this was a weather balloon that simply veered off course.

""This was intentional,"" a senior U.S. official said, adding that the balloon initially took off from mainland China.

Todd, noting how the U.S. is expanding its military presence in Guam, the Philippines and Australia, helping Japan change its national security posture and continuing to arm Taiwan, challenged Blinken, ""If it's not a Cold War, what is it?""

""We intend to compete very vigorously.

Blinken also appeared on ABC’s ""This Week"" and CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on the heels of what’s been reported as a ""confrontational"" meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Blinken reportedly spoke directly to Wang about the ""unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law"" by China flying a high-altitude surveillance balloon across the U.S., warning that the ""irresponsibly act must never again occur.""

On the contrary, Wang said at the Munich Security Conference that the U.S. military shooting down the Chinese spycraft off the coast of South Carolina, after the surveillance balloon was detected above Montana and traversed the U.S., was ""absurd"" and ""hysterical,"" claiming ""Cold War mentality is back.""

""More than 40 countries have had these balloons go over their territory,"" Blinken told ABC.

""This launch is a routine test, which was scheduled far in advance and consistent with previous tests,"" he told reporters.

Wednesday's test comes less than a month after a previous test was also launched.

Ryder said the U.S. notified the Russian government per treaty obligations ahead of the operational test and noted that the pre-launch announcement was pursuant to The Hague's international Code of Conduct.

The missile test comes as concerns over nuclear security have once again mounted amid Russia’s war in Ukraine and flagging relations between Moscow and the West.

Russia has not only threatened to resort to nuclear escalation if the U.S. becomes more directly involved in the war, but has threatened Europe’s nuclear security by stationing its troops at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine.

The power plant has repeatedly been threatened by shelling since Russia’s February invasion and subsequent occupation in early March.

The drone was taken down at around 2:30 p.m. local time, according to U.S. Central Command.

""US forces in Syria engaged and shot down an Iranian-manufactured UAV attempting to conduct reconnaissance of Mission Support Site Conoco, a patrol base in northeast Syria,"" U.S. Central Command said in a statement.

The U.S. and Iran both carry out counterterrorism missions in Syria, although the two countries support different groups. The U.S. backs a Kurdish-led group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which leads an autonomous government in northeastern Syria, and Iran supports the central government in Damascus.

Iran, the Syrian government and Russia have accused the U.S. of exploiting Syria's natural resources through a military presence the three countries say is illegitimate. And the U.S. says Iran has sought to expand its influence in Syria through support for militias that have targeted U.S. forces in the past.

48,Putin promises to build up Russia's nuclear arsenal after backing out of New START treaty with US,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he will strengthen Russia's nuclear forces, announcing that his military is prepared to deploy a new intercontinental ballistic missile system with hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines.

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches its one-year anniversary, Putin has declared that Russia will pull back from the New START treaty negotiated with the United States, signaling his intention to ramp up the country's nuclear armaments. In a speech commemorating Defender of the Fatherland Day, a Russian holiday that honors the country's armed forces, Putin said Russia will continue to ""focus on strengthening the nuclear triad.""

He said the new RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fueled missile, also called ""Satan 2,"" is ready for combat deployment after a years-long delay. The ""nuclear triad"" refers to missiles based on land, sea and in the air.

""This year, the first Sarmat missile system launchers with the new heavy missile will be put on combat duty,"" Putin announced. ""We will continue full production of the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic systems and begin mass deployment of Tsirkon sea-launched hypersonic missiles.""

RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN NEW START NUCLEAR TREATY WITH US, PUTIN SAYS

On Tuesday, Putin announced that Russia would suspend its participation in the New START treaty, which caps the number of nuclear armaments each country can possess at 1,550 warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

He also threatened to resume testing nuclear weapons if Western nations do not cease their aid to Ukraine, which is suffering under a brutal Russian invasion. Putin has characterized the conflict as an attempt by Russia to defend itself from encroaching Western powers and asserted that neo-Nazi forces have ""taken root in Ukraine.""

PUTIN ISSUES NUCLEAR WARNING TO US, THREATENS TO RESUME WEAPONS TESTS

Russia's Sarmat missile is 35 meters long (nearly 115 feet), has a range of 18,000 km (about 11,000 miles) and is able to carry at least 10 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles — each with a nuclear warhead — that can be aimed at different targets, Reuters reported.

Putin also noted the completion of a new nuclear-powered submarine called ""Emperor Alexander III,"" which is now operational in the Russian navy.

""With the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine Emperor Alexander III becoming operational in the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100 percent,"" Putin said. ""In the coming years, three more cruisers from this project will be delivered to the navy.""

49,He Gets Us responds to AOC's attack on Christian Super Bowl ads,"The group behind two commercials promoting the Christian faith that aired during the Super Bowl responded Monday to a series of attacks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others who took issue with advertisements promoting Jesus as a role model.

""Our research shows that many people's only exposure to Jesus is through Christians who reflect him imperfectly, and too often in ways that create a distorted or incomplete picture of his radical compassion and love for others,"" He Gets Us spokesperson Jason Vanderground told Fox News Digital when asked to respond to ongoing attacks. ""We believe it's more important now than ever for the real, authentic Jesus to be represented in the public marketplace as he is in the Bible.""

He Gets Us, a campaign touting itself as a ""movement to reintroduce people to the Jesus of the Bible and his confounding love and forgiveness,"" aired two advertisement spots during Sunday night's Super Bowl.

The first one is 30 seconds and urges viewers to ""be childlike"" while showing children being helpful and kind to each other and animals. ""Jesus didn't want us to act like adults,"" appears on the screen. ""He gets us. All of us. Jesus.""

AOC CRITICIZES CHRISTIAN SUPER BOWL ADS, SAYS JESUS WOULD NOT FUND COMMERCIALS TO 'MAKE FASCISM LOOK BENIGN'

""On multiple occasions, Jesus used the term 'childlike' to refer to a humble and trusting attitude,"" said Vanderground, referring to the ad. ""Christians often refer to their faith as childlike, being humble enough to place one's trust in a power greater than self.""

The second ad is 60 seconds and is meant to promote inclusion amid perceived division. It shows people arguing and confronting each other angrily until ""Jesus loved the people we hate"" appears onscreen.

""What could possibly be louder and more powerful than hate? Love can. But not just any love. Confounding love. Unconditional love. Sacrificial love. The love we see in Jesus,"" Vanderground said of the longer ad. ""What if we tried to love our enemies the way Jesus loved his? How would it change the tenor of our conflicts and our conversations?""

Despite the messages of love and inclusion, Ocasio-Cortez took issue with the commercials, appearing to liken them to fascism.

""Something tells me Jesus would *not* spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign,"" the New York Democrat wrote in a tweet.

According to He Gets Us, however, the goal of the ads is anything but fascist.

""He [Jesus] cares about our problems because he has experienced them. He gets us,"" said Vanderground. ""We believe that investing in efforts to ensure more people consider his life and movement as inspiration for their own, will in turn, help improve the lives of those listening — and begin to create the kind of cascade of love Jesus himself sought to generate.""

DEM OPERATIVE MERCILESSLY MOCKED AFTER BLASTING CHRISTIAN SUPER BOWL ADS: 'WOKE CORPORATIONS SPENT MILLIONS'

Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the only Democrat to take issue with the religiously-themed commercials.

A Democratic operative who promoted the false narrative that Border Patrol agents were whipping Haitian migrants similarly attacked He Gets Us on Twitter.

""With the money the 'He Gets Us' people spent on their right-wing Jesus ads, they could permanently house 1,563 people experiencing homelessness,"" wrote Sawyer Hackett, who according to his Twitter profile is a senior adviser to both the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

It reportedly costs $7 million for 30 seconds of ad time during the Super Bowl broadcast. The He Gets Us spots are part of a multimillion-dollar campaign from the nonprofit Servant Foundation, which also does business as an organization called the Signatry.

Twitter users were quick to note that Hackett didn't take issue with any of the other ads promoting things such as beer or gambling — just the ones promoting Jesus.

""Instead of responding to divisiveness in anger or avoiding conflict altogether, Jesus demonstrated how we can and should show confounding love and respect to one another,"" said Vanderground. ""The goal is that the two commercials will not only inspire those who may be skeptical of Christianity to ask questions and learn more about Jesus, but also encourage Christians to live out their faith even better and exhibit the same confounding love and forgiveness Jesus modeled.""

Vanderground added that the Super Bowl commercials can open a better way to respond to the inevitable adversity that comes with life.

50,US transfers military weapons stockpile from Israel to Ukraine,"The U.S. has transferred thousands of artillery shells from a military weapons stockpile in Israel to Ukraine for weapons aid.

The Israeli stockpile has traditionally been used to arm U.S. forces operating in the Middle East. The U.S. has begun relying on it to arm Ukrainians, however, as U.S. aid to the country cuts deeper and deeper into stores, the New York Times reported.

The stockpile in Israel is the second major store of weapons the U.S. has begun to drain, as it has also turned to stores in South Korea in recent months.

The location of the stores is politically sensitive, however, as both Israel and South Korea have vowed not to provide lethal aid to Ukraine. Neither of the countries has officially broken that promise, but some fear Russia could argue that allowing the U.S. to siphon arms from their stockpiles constitutes such aid, according to the Times.

RUSSIA TO EXPAND SIZE OF ITS MILITARY TO 1.5 MILLION TROOPS, DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS

52,US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri in 'successful' Afghanistan counterterrorism operation,"President Biden announced Monday that the U.S. government killed the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, in a ""successful"" counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan that removes the terrorist from the battlefield ""once and for all,"" and degrades the terror network's ability to operate.

The U.S. government, on July 30 at 9:48 p.m. ET, and 6:18 a.m. Kabul time, undertook a ""precision counterterrorism operation,"" killing Zawahri, who served as Usama bin Laden’s deputy during the 9/11 attacks, and as his successor in 2011, following bin Laden’s death.

Biden, in an address to the American people on Monday night, said ""justice has been delivered,"" and warned those that seek to do harm to the U.S.

The president explained that Zawahri ""coordinated al Qaeda's branches all around the world"" since bin Laden's death in 2011, including ""setting priorities for providing operational guidance that call for and inspire attacks against U.S. targets.""

WHO IS AYMAN AL ZAWAHRI? AL QAEDA LEADER KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN

Biden said Zawahri made videos, including in recent weeks, calling for his followers ""to attack the United States and our allies.""

""Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more,"" the president said. ""People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer.

""The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm,"" Biden continued. ""We make it clear again tonight that, no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.""

The president explained that he ""authorized a precision strike that would remove [Zawahri] from the battlefield once and for all.""

Biden gave the final approval ""to go get him"" on July 25.

REPUBLICANS JOIN DEMOCRATS IN PRAISING BIDEN FOR DEATH OF AL QAEDA LEADER ZAWAHRI

""I'm sharing this news with the American people now, after confirming the mission's total success through the painstaking work of our counterterrorism community and key allies and partners,"" the president said, adding that his administration has kept congressional leaders informed as well.

A senior administration official said Monday that there were no civilian casualties as a result of the operation.

The president, speaking to his decision to withdraw U.S. military assets from Afghanistan in August 2021, said that he decided that ""the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm.""

""And I made a promise to the American people that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond,"" Biden said. ""We've done just that.""

He added that the killing of Zawahri helps to ""never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe have because he is gone.""

""We're going to make sure that nothing else happens — you know, it can't be a launching pad against the United States,"" Biden said of Afghanistan. ""We're going to see to it that won't happen. This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and will always make good on that solemn pledge.""

Officials said Monday that Zawahri ""continued to pose an active threat to U.S. persons, interests, and national security,"" and explained that the U.S. government has ""multiple intelligence sources via multiple methods that had enabled us to confirm that this was Zawahri, and that we were successful in achieving our objective.""

BIDEN ADMIN WARNED NOT TO WITHHOLD AFTER-ACTION REPORTS ON BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL

The official said that the U.S. government identified Zawahri at a location in Kabul.

""The Zawahri family exercised longstanding terrorist tradecraft that we assessed was designed to prevent anyone from following them to Zawahri,"" the official explained, noting that the government identified Zawahri’s wife, daughter and her children at a safe house in Kabul this year.

In early April, Biden administration officials, including White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, were briefed on that intelligence, which was later shared with the president.

Zawahri was located in a safe house, which U.S. government officials investigated the construction of so that they could ""confidently conduct an operation to kill"" him without threatening the structural integrity of the building and minimizing the risk to civilians and the Zawahri family.

The official explained that ""only a very small and select group of officials at key agencies were brought into the process and the deliberations at the early stage"" and briefed on the developing intelligence.

""The president convened over the course of the last few weeks several meetings with his key advisers and cabinet members to carefully scrutinize the intelligence and evaluate the best course of action for targeting Zawahri,"" the official explained, noting that Biden received updated on the developments of the targets throughout May and June.

On July 1, Biden was briefed on a proposed operation in the White House Situation Room by key members of his Cabinet, including CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Center Director Christine Abizaid, as well as other national security officials.

""The president was, as always, deeply engaged in the briefing and immersed in the intelligence. He asked detailed questions about what we knew and how we knew,"" the official explained, noting that the president sought explanations of ""lighting, of weather, of construction materials and of other factors that could influence the success of this operation and reduce the risk of civilian casualties.""

""He was particularly focused on ensuring that every step had been taken to ensure the operation would minimize that risk and he wanted to understand the basis upon which we had confidence in our assessment,"" the official continued.

Biden then directed the intelligence community to prepare a series of impact analyses that he could fully understand, and directed that the U.S. government be ""prepared to manage the ramifications of the strike in the region and beyond.""

Biden and officials met multiple times in person in the White House Situation Room over the course of June and July to ""pressure test"" the intelligence.

The official explained that interagency lawyers examined the intelligence reporting as well to confirm ""the legal basis for the operation.""

""They confirmed that Zawahri was a lawful target based on his continuing leadership role in al Qaeda and his participation and operational support for al Qaeda attacks,"" the official said.

President Biden authorized the air strike on July 25 at the conclusion of a meeting with officials.

The official said the president asked for ""each participants’ view,"" and said ""all strongly recommended approval of this target.""

""At the conclusion of the meeting, the president authorized a precise, tailored air strike on the condition that a strike minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the risk of civilian casualties,"" the official explained, noting that meant the government could conduct a strike ""once an opportunity was available.""

On July 30, the strike was carried out by unmanned aerial vehicles. Two hellfire missiles were fired at Zawahri, and he was killed.

A senior administration official said the government identified Zawahri on ""multiple occasions for sustained periods of time on the balcony, where he was ultimately struck.""

""We are confident through our intelligence sources and methods, including multiple streams of intelligence, that we killed Zawahri and no other individual,"" the official said, noting that members of his family were present ""in other parts of the safe house at the time of the strike and were purposefully not targeted and were unharmed.""

""We have no indication that civilians were harmed in the strike,"" the official said.

""Zawahri’s death deals a significant blow to al Qaeda and will degrade the group’s ability to operate, including against the U.S. homeland,"" the official explained. ""This action keeps faith with the president’s solemn pledge to protect Americans from terrorist threats, including threats that might emerge from Afghanistan.""

The Biden administration closed the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and withdrew all military assets from Afghanistan on Aug. 31, 2021, ending the U.S.' longest war.

""Even as the president ended two decades of war in Afghanistan by getting American servicemen and women out of harm’s way there, he promised that we would establish a capacity from outside the country to identify and address terrorist threats to Americans,"" the official said. ""He made good on that with this action, as U.S. forces showed extraordinary capacity to build an intelligence picture on the world’s most-wanted terrorists, and then take precise action to remove him from the battlefield.""

The official added that the president’s decision ""has made the world a safer place and brought an additional measure of closure for all of us who mourn the victims of 9/11 and other al Qaeda violence.""

Biden, during his speech Monday night, also cited other missions that eliminated terrorists since the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and said his administration ""will continue to vigilantly monitor and address threats from al-Qaeda no matter where they emanate from.""

""As Commander in chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America safe in a dangerous world,"" Biden said. ""The United States did not seek this war against terror--it came to us, we answered with the same principles and resolve that have shaped us for generation, upon generation to protect the innocent, defend liberty, and we keep the light of freedom burning a beacon for the rest of the entire world.""

Biden added that a ""great and defining truth about our nation, our people"" is that ""we do not break. We never give in. We never back down.""

Meanwhile, the official Twitter account of the Spokesman of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban, on Monday posted that an ""air strike was carried out on a residential house in Sherpur area of Kabul city,"" saying that the ""nature of the incident was not revealed at first.""

The spokesperson condemned the strike: ""The security and intelligence agencies of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and found that the attack was carried out by American drones. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.""

The Taliban spokesperson added: ""Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region. Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.""

A senior Biden administration official said the U.S. government ""did not alert the Taliban that we were going to take this strike.""

President Biden defended pulling out of Afghanistan last year by claiming al Qaeda was gone.

""What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone?"" Biden said on Aug. 20, 2021. ""We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, as well as — as well as getting Osama bin Laden. And we did.""

But Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley warned lawmakers last September that terror groups like al Qaeda may be able to grow much faster following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, at the time, said that the focus of continued U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan would be countering terrorist threats, not the Taliban. Austin said the U.S. would ""keep an eye on"" al Qaeda, the extremist network whose use of Afghanistan as a haven for planning the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. was the reason U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001.

Ayman al-Zawahri appeared in a video last year commemorating 20 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks despite rumors that he died months earlier.

Officials on Monday said Zawahri continued to produce videos once he arrived at the safe house in Kabul. Officials said the U.S. ""should not be surprised if Zawahri filmed additional videos that may be released subsequent to his death.""

Former Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News Digital in reaction to the news of the operation: ""It's good that we got him, I've been out of the business for many years, so I am waiting to learn all the facts.""

53,US poised for slowdown in high-end munitions deliveries to Ukraine,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signaled this week that the U.S. and its Western allies are having trouble keeping pace with Ukraine’s demand for the advanced weaponry it needs to fend off Russia’s invasion. That signal reflects dwindling supplies for Ukraine and fear in the White House of escalation that could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia.

The risk of reduced U.S. stockpiles of high-end munitions has been reported almost since the U.S. began contributing to Ukraine’s defense. Now, nearly eight months since the start of the war, experts interviewed by Fox News Digital say the U.S. is at or very near the end of its capacity to give.

They agreed that Austin’s remarks indicate that the initial rush of high-end munitions like HIMAR rocket launchers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft Stingers and M-777 Howitzers is over. These sources said there may be two factors at play that are contributing to this reality.

One factor is the issue that Austin addressed directly this week – the U.S. is running low on equipment that it can hand over to Ukraine.

RUSSIA SCRAMBLES TO REPAIR CRIMEA BRIDGE, ZELENSKYY VOWS TO ACCELERATE ‘VICTORY’

At a press conference Wednesday, Austin was asked whether the U.S. and other nations are worried about running so low on domestic supplies of critical munitions that they can no longer help Ukraine. Austin dodged the question by stressing that the desire is there to get Ukraine what it needs, but he left unsaid whether Ukraine’s allies can actually deliver.

""Well, it certainly is not a question of lack of will,"" Austin replied.

Austin had just concluded a meeting with officials from dozens of countries about Ukraine’s munitions needs. As he described that meeting, he again talked about willpower but hinted at strained capacity to provide more for Ukraine, which is using up munitions faster than the world can deliver them.

RUSSIA'S WAGNER GROUP MAKES ‘SOME’ ADVANCES IN DONBAS IN FIRST TACTICAL GAINS SINCE JULY: UK INTEL

""We will produce and deliver these highly effective capabilities over the course of the coming months — and in some cases years — even as we continue to meet Ukraine’s most pressing self-defense requirements in real time,"" Austin said of the most recent commitment to send HIMARS, vehicles, radar systems and other equipment.

Mark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies who spent seven years working on DOD procurement issues for the Office of Management and Budget. His assessment based on inventory levels, industrial capacity, and information from the Biden administration is that the U.S. has ""limited"" supplies of HIMARs, Javelins, Stingers and M-777 Howitzers.

""There are some areas where we’re basically at the bottom of the barrel,"" he told Fox News Digital.

In some cases, this means the U.S. will likely start meeting Ukraine’s request for weaponry by sending over lower-end substitutions, such as lighter Howitzers that are serviceable but not what Ukraine is after. In other cases, the U.S. may not have much to give – Cancian said that while there is talk of the U.S. providing more air defense equipment, there is not much the U.S. can give in that area.

Cancian said he reads Austin comments as a sign that the days of the U.S. giving Ukraine its best stuff are gone.

NATO HEAD WARNS RUSSIA TO AVOID ‘VERY IMPORTANT LINE’ AHEAD OF NUCLEAR TESTS

""It confirmed what I believe, that we will continue support Ukraine, but we’re going to have to do it in different ways, like providing substitutes, or we might have to buy stuff from other people, or it will take longer,"" he said. ""That it won’t be quite the same.""

He said this runs the risk of creating what he called a ""petting zoo of NATO equipment"" in Ukraine – relatively small numbers of many types of equipment that could create compatibility issues.

Some on Capitol Hill are reading Austin’s remark differently that leads to largely the same result – that the Biden administration is purposefully slowing down the transfer of critical munitions to Ukraine, because it is increasingly worried about stumbling into a direct conflict with Russia.

A congressional aide with working knowledge of these issues told Fox News Digital that while officials are hinting at limited supplies, there is still room to give more, and that the slowdown is because of a different calculation the Biden administration is making.

""They are afraid of escalation,"" this aide said.

Just last week, President Biden openly talked about the ""Armageddon"" scenario that could unfold if Russia tried to win the war with a tactical nuclear strike. The congressional aide interpreted Austin’s remarks as a sign the administration is more and more worried about crossing a line that might force that outcome.

Another sign of U.S. caution, the aide said, is that the administration allowed nearly $2.8 billion in authority to supply Ukraine with weapons to expire a few weeks ago, at the end of fiscal year 2022. Some on Capitol Hill are reading that as an indication that the administration is finding its own comfort level when it comes to arming Ukraine, and that level stops short of what Congress authorized.

""Congress gave the administration more than it wanted,"" the aide said. The Defense Department declined to respond to questions from Fox News Digital about the expiration of this authority.

RUSSIA USING IRANIAN-MADE ‘KAMIKAZE DRONES’ TO STRIKE AROUND KYIV

There is a related view within Congress that while U.S. stocks of certain munitions have clearly been reduced as the U.S. sends items to Ukraine, that reduction is not a security threat to the United States itself. The aide explained that many of these items were stockpiled largely for use in a possible conflict with Russia, and that conflict is already playing out with Ukraine in the lead.

That conflict is reducing Russia’s military capacity, which means a corresponding drop in U.S. inventories is not putting the U.S. anywhere near a stockpile crisis.

To put it another way: the Biden administration has more flexibility to give Ukraine more but is choosing not to.

The American Conservative Senior Editor Dr. Sumantra Maitra joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Tuesday to discuss how Biden is playing into the hands of the Chinese strategy one day after he announced an additional half-billion dollars to aid Ukraine in its war against Russia.

""They want the U.S. to be bogged down in Europe,"" Maitra said of China. ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom that if the U.S. isn't involved in Ukraine, then rival powers will see it as weakness, the Chinese do a very different calculation. To them, as long as the U.S. is bleeding in Europe by producing and supplying to the point of inflation and insolvency, the U.S. cannot pivot to Asia.""

As concerns grow over a potential proxy war with Beijing, Maitra noted that China would be able to ""outproduce"" the United States in manufacturing capacity given its massive population of more than 1 billion people.

RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN NEW START NUCLEAR TREATY WITH US, PUTIN SAYS

""What we plan to do to Russia and Ukraine, the Chinese plan to do to us in international relations. We call this strategy bloodletting,"" Maitra said. ""If Russia, Europe and [the] U.S. bleeds dry in a regional war of attrition in a region which is at best of a peripheral interest of the direct American homeland, China continues its path of unrivaled hegemony.""

""I think it's about time we start to think, not from our point of view of morals of what we are doing is right for Ukraine, but from a point of strategic interest. Look, if we continue to do this in Europe, we are giving China a blank check to kind of bleed us dry.""

Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday. He announced the aid package there, which includes shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles and air surveillance radars.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

The president was previously scheduled to arrive in Poland on Monday per his public schedule, but instead took a covert, 10-hour train ride to meet with Zelenskyy.

""Biden has promised that he'd continue to support Ukraine without a strategic outline, a fixed objective, a theory of victory or a fixed end date, and Americans don't really like a strategy without an end game,"" Maitra said.

""We are now at a precipice where we are risking a nuclear war of sorts or a war of attrition, with China ramping up production supplies in support of Russia,"" he continued. ""Neither are good, and the president doesn't really know how to back out of it.""

Maitra's comments came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted during his visit to Ankara, Turkey, that there are growing concerns surrounding potential Chinese aid to Russia in the form of ""lethal assistance,"" and that could have a significant impact on U.S.-China relations.

""As President Biden said going back many months, when the aggression first took place, and he spoke to President Xi Jinping, he told him at that point that there would be real consequences in our own relationship were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia in this aggression against Ukraine,"" he said Monday.

Chinese officials were infuriated after Blinken suggested Beijing would be sending weapons to Russia, but did not deny that they would consider doing so.

55,US military families struggle to put food on table as Biden directs aid abroad: 'Should be our first priority',"A Pennsylvania food bank assisting U.S. military families is shining a light on the financial struggles facing Americans at home and calling out the government for ""failing"" to take care of families serving the country.

Director of Keystone Military Families Kyle Lord and volunteer and veteran Jerry Hosler joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Thursday to discuss the growing number of military spouses facing food insecurity as the Biden administration pledges more aid to Ukraine and first lady Jill Biden visits Africa.

""These are the people that keep us safe and warm at night. And clearly, we're failing our active duty folks,"" Hosler said.

Twenty-five percent of active duty military spouses reported being food insecure in the Department of Defense’s latest survey, with a growing number relying on food pantries to survive.

INFLATION BIG SETBACK FOR RETIREMENT SAVINGS

Lord argued that taking care of the families that take care of America should be a ""first priority.""

""These are people protecting us, protecting our borders and keeping us safe. And yet they have to worry if their child is going to [get] food before school or if there is going to be enough dinner when they get home,"" she said.

Hosler said a young man or woman entering active duty makes approximately $1,900 a month, which does not go far to cover expenses.

""Some of them are from deployment. Some of them are from the low pay scales. They're worried about how they can put enough food on the table and have gas in their cars if they have to go somewhere. We see it every day and our numbers have increased weekly since 2021,"" Lord said.

Hosler argued Americans should feel ""very angry"" that military families are struggling while there are reports of illegal immigrants getting free food and throwing it out.

""I have a daughter, son-in-law, stationed at Fort Wainwright in Alaska. Cost of living is very high there, of all the spouses would like to work. But having young kids, there is a waiting list for child care. And then once they do get child care [it's] so expensive… it's not cost-effective for them to even work so long. Essentially, it's a one-income family on one very low income,"" Hosler said.

With inflation rising 0.5% from month to month, Americans everywhere are feeling the pressure in one way or another.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) says that inflation is up nearly 6.5% from last year — and many people are seeing this reflected in food prices.

""Restaurant: Impossible"" host Robert Irvine, chef and founder of the Robert Irvine Foundation which helps give back to military and first responder families, said seniors are also seeing the negative effects of inflation.

Irvine told co-host Steve Doocy last week that seniors cannot afford meat and dairy — leading many to show up at food banks across the country as well.

Irvine said he was recently out helping over 1,000 active duty military men and women who cannot afford to feed their families.

""Food banks have got more business today than we’ve ever had,"" Irvine said.

56,Israel rejects US request for Hawk missiles in aid to Ukraine,"Israel on Wednesday rejected the U.S.’ request to send Hawk missiles to Ukraine as the Washington looks to bolster defenses for Kyiv ahead of a looming Russian offensive.

The Biden administration asked for old Hawk anti-aircraft missiles that Jerusalem had in storage as air defense remains a top priority for Ukraine, first reported Axios.

""The policy of the security echelon has not changed,"" a spokesperson from the Israeli Ministry of Defense told Fox News. ""Each request is examined on its merits. Beyond that, we do not refer to additional details.""

US TRANSFERS MILITARY WEAPONS STOCKPILE FROM ISRAEL TO UKRAINE

The request’s rejection comes just one week after the U.S. said it transferred thousands of artillery shells from weapons stockpiles in Israel to Ukraine and said it would take similar steps in South Korea.

The U.S. is ""looking under every rock"" for munitions, an official told Fox News.

Both Israel and South Korea have vowed not to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, and neither country has broken that promise – though some fear Russia could argue allowing the U.S. to siphon arms from their stockpiles constitutes aid, some reporting suggested earlier this month.

Ukraine also took issue with the new Netanyahu administration after Israel’s recently appointed foreign minister, Eli Cohen, held a call with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in early January and suggested Jerusalem was pursuing a policy change when it came to diplomatic relations with Moscow.

The call was the first time an active Israeli foreign minister had contacted Lavrov since the war in Ukraine had begun in February 2022.

UKRAINE DECRIES ISRAEL, RUSSIA CHAT AND SUGGESTS 'CHANGE OF POLICY' AMID NEW NETANYAHU ADMIN

Israel’s silence when it comes to condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine has caused a diplomatic riff between the two nations, even though from the campaign trail, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to suggest that under his administration Israel may be prepared to send more than humanitarian aid to Kyiv.

That suggestion appears to have been contingent on Ukraine’s stance when it comes to the Israel-Palestinian issue.

Netaynahu attempted to solidify Kyiv’s alliance with Jerusalem when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reject a U.N. resolution this month that called on the International Court of Justice to provide a legal opinion on the ramifications of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands.

Zelenskyy pushed back and asked for guarantees on air support from Israel to stop Russian strikes, to which Netanyahu reportedly said he would consider.

The number is an all-time high for guns intercepted at U.S. airports. It roughly translates to about 18 guns intercepted every day.

With the exception of pandemic-disrupted 2020, the number of weapons intercepted at airport checkpoints has climbed every year since 2010.

Experts tell The Associated Press that the issue is not people seeking to do harm by getting a gun through security, but more often than not, people just forget they had a gun with them.

NEW ORLEANS MAN STOPPED FROM CARRYING AR AND 163 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION ONTO FLIGHTD

TSA administrator David Pekoske told The AP that guns tend to be intercepted at bigger airports in areas with laws more friendly to carrying a gun.

Punishment ranges from arrest to just having the gun confiscated. Local and state laws play a major role in determining repercussions. Sometimes flyers are allowed to give the gun to another person that is not traveling with them and continue on their way.

Unloaded guns can be put in checked bags, but proper procedures must be followed.

Between 2020 and 2021, nearly 79,000 people between 18 and 45 years old — 37,208 in 2020 and 41,587 in 2021 — died of fentanyl overdoses, the data analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl shows.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be deadly even in very small amounts, and other drugs, including heroin, meth and marijuana, can be laced with the dangerous drug. Mexico and China are the primary sources for the flow of fentanyl into the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

Comparatively, between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 15, 2021, there were more than 53,000 COVID-19 deaths among those between the ages of 18 and 49, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

""This is a national emergency. America’s young adults — thousands of unsuspecting Americans — are being poisoned,"" James Rauh, founder of Families Against Fentanyl, said in a statement. ""It is widely known that illicit fentanyl is driving the massive spike in drug-related deaths. A new approach to this catastrophe is needed.""

Rauh, who lost his son to an overdose, added that ""declaring illicit fentanyl a Weapon of Mass Destruction would activate additional and necessary federal resources to root out the international manufacturers and traffickers of illicit fentanyl and save American lives.""

The DEA on Thursday announced a surge in the sale of fake prescription pills containing deadly opioids on social media platforms like Snapchat.

Experts believe there is a correlation between the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent increase in fentanyl overdoses.

WHAT IS NARCAN? THE LIFESAVING TREATMENT THAT CAN REVERSE OPIOID OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS

More adults between 18 and 45 died of fentanyl overdoses in 2020 than any other leading cause of death, including COVID-19, motor vehicle accidents, cancer and suicide. Fentanyl also killed more Americans in general in 2020 than car accidents, gun violence, breast cancer and suicide, according to the analysis of CDC data from Families Against Fentanyl.

Fentanyl deaths doubled from 32,754 fatalities to 64,178 fatalities in two years between April 2019 and April 2021.

In the first five months of 2021 alone, more than 42,600 fentanyl overdose deaths were reported, which represents an increase of more than 1,000 fentanyl deaths per month compared to the same time period in 2020.

""The only safe place to obtain drugs is the pharmacy.""

Overall drug overdose deaths are expected to surpass 100,000 in 2021, according to preliminary CDC data, representing a 28% increase between April 2020 and April 2021.

President Biden on Wednesday issued an executive order authorizing sanctions against any foreigner engaged in illicit drug trafficking or production.

""I find that international drug trafficking — including the illicit production, global sale and widespread distribution of illegal drugs, the rise of extremely potent drugs such as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, as well as the growing role of internet-based drug sales — constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,"" Biden's order states.

Fentanyl drug seizures at the border have reached record highs in 2021, according to data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as the Biden administration faces a continuing crisis at the southern border.

Border authorities have seized more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl so far in fiscal year 2021, with less than one month to go, dwarfing the 4,776 pounds seized in fiscal 2020. CBP seizures of other drugs, including marijuana, cocaine and heroin have generally decreased since 2018.

""I can confirm that the Department of Defense was tracking a high altitude object over Alaska airspace in the last 24 hours. The object was flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. Out of an abundance of caution and the recommendation of the Pentagon, President Biden ordered the military to down the object. And they did. And it came in inside our territorial waters,"" Kirby said.

Kirby added that the ""object"" landed on frozen waters, and that ""Fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command took down the object within the last hour.""

He also added that the ""object"" was ""much, much smaller than the spy balloon that we took down last Saturday.""

CHINESE SPY CRAFT PAYLOAD LOCATED OFF WATERS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, MOSTLY INTACT: US OFFICIAL

""The way it was described to me was roughly the size of a small car as opposed to a payload that was like two or three buses sized,"" Kirby said.

Kirby said that he doesn't know of any ""outreach"" to the Chinese government about the object, and said that the government doesn't know who owns the unmanned object.

BIDEN SAYS CHINESE SPY FLIGHT 'NOT A MAJOR BREACH'

""We do not know who owns it, whether it's state owned or corporate owned or privately owned,"" he said.

Kirby said that the object was shot down because it was flying at around 40,000 feet and could have posed a threat to civilian aircraft versus the Chinese spy craft discovered last week, which Kirby said was at 65,000 feet and posed no threat to civilian aircraft.

Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, said Friday afternoon that the military has located a significant amount of debris from the object, stating that it was shot down by an F-22 using an A9X missile out of Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. He said the object entered U.S. airspace on Thursday.

""Debris that's been recovered so far is being loaded on to vessels taken ashore, cataloged, and then moved onwards to labs for subsequent analysis. And while I won't go into specifics due to classification reasons, I can say that we have located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities,"" Ryder said.

""We have no further details about the object at this time, including any description of its capabilities, purpose or origin,"" Ryder added.

Just over a week ago, defense officials said that a Chinese spy craft was spotted over Billings, Montana. After it traveled at high altitudes around 60,000 feet, it was shot down on Saturday by an F-22 using a single A9X missile.

President Biden ordered on Feb. 3 that the spy craft should be shot down whenever the military determined that it's safe to do so without potentially harming civilians on the ground.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement after the balloon was shot down that ""President Biden gave his authorization to take down the surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon’s path.""

""After careful analysis, U.S. military commanders had determined downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload.

61,"China's interest in US agriculture poses security threat, federal report warns","China’s determination to become self-sufficent and resolve its food security challenges could put the U.S., as the world's leading producer in agriculture, in Beijing’s crosshairs, a federal report warned this week.

The report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) warned that China’s efforts to bolster its agricultural sector not only pose an economic challenge but a threat to U.S. security.

China’s failure to secure enough domestic production to feed its mammoth population means it has looked to nations like the U.S. to acquire farmland, livestock, equipment and intellectual property – in some cases through theft.

""The United States is a global leader in all of these fields, making it a prime trading partner and often a target of China’s efforts to strengthen its agriculture sector and food security, sometimes through illicit means,"" the report stated.

US NOT INTERESTED IN 'COLD WAR' WITH CHINA, PLANS TO INCREASE DIRECT COMMUNICATION: BLINKEN

China is looking to dominate the genetically modified seed industry, which has the potential for massive economic windfalls.

Advancing Beijing’s seed stockpiles would not only reduce its dependence on nations like the U.S., it could make it a major competitor in the global market.

The USCC report found that the U.S. exported $1.62 billion worth of seeds, mostly vegetables, corn, soybeans and grasses, in 2020.

In 2021, $173.9 million of exported seeds were sold to China alone, which equated to roughly 15% of total exports.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the agricultural industry to expand its seed collection as he looks to cut China’s reliance on foreign resources.

Rather than directing its resources for development and research in domestic seed innovations, spying has become a chief tool for its agriculture industry.

""Acquiring U.S. trade secrets through agricultural espionage has become a convenient way for China to improve its agricultural output and become more competitive in global markets,"" the report found. ""Agricultural IP theft could enable Chinese agribusinesses to undercut U.S. competitors on international seed markets.""

But outside the economic woes Beijing could inflict on the U.S. lies an even more ominous threat on U.S. food production.

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER PUSHES LEGISLATION TO STOP CHINA BUILDING 'AGRICULTURAL MONOPOLY' IN US

Genetically engineered seeds help to circumvent the unpredictable reality the agriculture industry faces every season by mitigating the risk of drought, pests and diseases.

Though the technology behind genetically modifying a crop can save a farming season, it can also be used to target engineered crops.

""One vulnerability of genetically modified seeds is their limited genetic variation. Consequently, a virus or fungus engineered to kill a genetically modified plant could wipe out an entire crop with no genetic variation to mitigate the losses,"" the report found.

House Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Rep. Glenn Thompson told Fox News ""food security is national security"" and said the USCC report showed the U.S. needs to take tougher stances to safeguard U.S. intellectual property and the agricultural industry.

""Our producers go to great lengths to guarantee the U.S. provides the safest food supply, and that cannot be jeopardized,"" he said. ""It is high time to reinforce our battered supply chains and ensure U.S. producers have access to free and fair markets to ease the impact of the looming global food crisis.""

Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, China expressed concern that bioterrorism could be an increasing threat and biosecurity became a chief priority for the nation.

Traditionally, China has been hesitant to import animals and plants that have been genetically modified.

But the report noted that Beijing has ""increasingly acknowledged the strategic advantages [of] genetically modified organisms"" and could be using Western imports to develop its technology and achieve global agricultural dominance.

""The Chinese Communist Party clearly wants to supplant our country’s influence and leadership in every area, including agriculture,"" Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. John Boozman told Fox News. ""We must not fall asleep at the switch and give China an opening to exploit.

62,"If China conquers Taiwan, it would be huge blow to US national security, economy","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Imagine deterrence fails and China successfully takes Taiwan. How would it affect the U.S. economy and inform whether the U.S. should fight China for Taiwan’s freedom?

Losing Taiwan would be an unrecoverable blow to America’s strength and influence. An absorption of Taiwan’s GDP into China would give it enhanced market power. Taiwan’s centrality to the sea’s busiest lanes of international commerce would give China an even greater launching pad to dominate Asia. Would China abuse its economic superiority and new position atop the strategic crossways of Asia? Its current economic behavior suggests it would.

First, the Chinese are already flagrant violators of trading rules. A Taiwan takeover would give Beijing increased leverage over its regional trading partners and would afford China more opportunity to bend or break rules to its benefit. Already the U.S. has shelved its trade ambitions in Asia by abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A takeover of Taiwan further cedes the field to the Chinese alternative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). China could use RCEP to further set the rules of global trade and deepen its economic relationships in Asia at the expense of the U.S.

US TO SEND B-52 BOMBERS TO AUSTRALIA IN MOVE CHINA WARNS COULD 'TRIGGER' ARMS RACE

Second, a Taiwan takeover would afford the Chinese opportunities for hostile economic activity like preventing or taxing ships in ""its waters."" Would China abuse its new position? China is certainly capable of such brazenness. Just consider the Chinese ""land grab"" in the South China Sea. Through a campaign of militarization and coercion over the last decade, China has built massive artificial island bases and actively sought control over virtually all the waters, seabed, and airspace of the South China Sea. Also, in April 2020, a China Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat. Taiwan would give China a new platform to engage in gray zone activities to bully its neighbors for economic benefit.

Third, a Chinese takeover would put Asia-centric supply chains at the mercy of the Chinese. Take for example the disruptions due to COVID-19. Thousands of unfinished cars and trucks sit idle awaiting Taiwan’s chips which are also critical to smartphones, computers and home appliances. Some reports indicate this cost the U.S. economy $240 million. But this could be modest when compared to China’s new leverage over Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing.

Taiwan makes 65% of the world’s semiconductors and almost 90% of advanced chips. One study estimates a one-year loss of $490 billion in global electronics companies in the event of a yearlong disruption. Chinese control of Taiwan’s semiconductor capacity is an unacceptably high risk to the U.S. economy when considering that Taiwan accounts for roughly 70% of the world’s microchip supply.

Finally, we can expect a China augmented by Taiwan’s market power to exert economic coercion on its neighbors, many of whom are our allies. Just take the example of their relations with Australia. China made 14 infamous demands, among them, that Australia cease faulting China on human rights and other ""internal matters."" As leverage, China cut off some market access with astronomical tariffs on barley, beef, and wine. Relations between Australia and China went into a near-freeze for two years and are only recently normalizing. China is already the leading trade partner of roughly 130 countries many of whom could conclude that they cannot afford to cross China.

A Chinese takeover of Taiwan is an unacceptably high risk for the U.S. economy. But would the U.S. fight for Taiwan? For deterrence to work, China must believe the American people would lend their support.

President Joe Biden, on numerous occasions, has suggested we would fight for Taiwan, but his staff confuses the issue by insisting that the U.S. policy has not changed. Although the American distrust of China explains support for Taiwan generally, that’s a far cry from public support for fighting China for Taiwan’s freedom.

The potential economic harm from a Chinese Taiwan takeover is very serious and the president and members of Congress should explain the stakes to the American people. Public support is fundamental to deterrence and without it, China could reasonably conclude that the American people would never fight a war over a faraway island thousands of miles away.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/if-china-conquers-taiwan-would-huge-blow-us-national-security-economy,N/A

64,What year was slavery abolished in the US?,"Slavery helped bring about the deadliest military conflict in the history of the United States – the American Civil War.

The Trans-Atlantic trading routes brought in more than 12 million enslaved Africans to the Western Hemisphere between 1525 and 1866. However, approximately 388,000 slaves were brought into North America with only 10.7 million surviving the voyage to the New World. The Abolition Movement was a key part of the fight to abolish slavery in the United States.

When was slavery abolished in the USA?

Slavery in the United States was officially abolished on December 6, 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment after it was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865. The amendment declares that ""neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""

Previously, the most significant effort to end slavery was made by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation which stated, ""all persons held as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free."" This, however, did not end Slavery because it only freed slaves in areas actively rebelling against the Union and not in the border states such as Kentucky or West Virginia. Therefore, Lincoln sought to make the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery the top priority of the Republican Party platform in the 1864 Presidential election.

HOW LINCOLN, DOUGLASS EMERGED TO REUNIFY AMERICA IN 'THE PRESIDENT AND THE FREEDOM FIGHTER'

Initially, the 14th Amendment passed the Senate but failed to pass in the House of Representatives in April 1864. However, after the 1864 election, the House voted in favor of the amendment with a vote of 119-56. In February 1865, Lincoln approved the resolution and submitted it for ratification in the state legislatures. Thereafter, the 14th and 15th Amendments soon joined the 13th in order to protect the civil rights of Americans in the aftermath of the Civil War.

JUNETEENTH: WHAT IS IT AND WHY DO WE CELEBRATE IT?

When did each state abolish slavery?

The 13th amendment was ratified by the necessary three-fourths of states in December 1865. Mississippi became the last state of the four that voted not to ratify it. In 2013, Mississippi officially ratified the amendment after failing to make it official by notifying the US Archivist when the state legislature originally ratified it in 1995.

65,"Winter storm moving across US results in warnings, cold weather alerts for more than 150 million Americans","A massive winter storm moving east across the United States is bringing bitter cold and life-threatening temperatures to dozens of states heading into Christmas weekend. A widespread flash freeze is forecast in the Midwest, East and South as heavy rain is accompanied by below freezing temperatures all the way to Florida.

Dangerous wind chills and accumulating snow are expected across a large swath of the U.S., leading to various warnings and cold weather alerts for over 150 million Americans, FOX Weather reported.

As of early Friday morning, blizzard warnings are in effect for more than 11 million people in the northern Plains, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, including Bismarck in North Dakota, Sioux Falls in South Dakota, Rochester in Minnesota, Des Moines in Iowa, South Bend in Indiana, Grand Rapids in Michigan and Buffalo in New York.

Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories have also been issued from the central and northern Plains eastward to the Midwest, Great Lakes, mid-South, central Appalachians and interior Northeast, including the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Kansas City in Missouri, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee.

‘BOMB CYCLONE’ TO IMPACT HOLIDAY TRAVEL WITH BLIZZARDS, COLD TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE NATION

The FOX Forecast Center reports the highest snowfall totals associated with the storm will likely be in the western Great Lakes region. More than a foot of snow could pile up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, western Lower Michigan and far northern Wisconsin.

Light accumulations of snow may also be seen as far south as northern Oklahoma, northern Arkansas and portions of Tennessee as an arctic cold front sweeps all the way to the Gulf Coast.

Heavy snowfall of up to 8 inches in less than 24 hours was already reported in Minneapolis-St.Paul Wednesday night, while the Denver metropolitan area recorded between 3 and 6 inches of snow.

A combination of snow and high wind gusts over 50 mph also caused near-whiteout conditions in parts of Colorado and Wyoming on Wednesday. In addition to the snowfall, FOX weather said weather observation sites in the Plains reported temperature drops of more than 30 degrees in under an hour as the arctic front moves east.

The winter storm is expected to reach its peak intensity on Friday over the Great Lakes. Blizzard conditions from eastern Wisconsin and far northeastern Illinois to portions of Michigan, northern Indiana, northern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York will experience blizzard conditions as heavy snow combined with intense wind gusts will accompany wind chills well below zero.

According to the FOX Forecast Center, high winds between 40 and 80 mph will likely knock out power to thousands of people across the Great Lakes and Northeast, potentially causing a life-threatening situation.

CHRISTMAS BLIZZARD, ICE STORM COULD LEAVE THOUSANDS ACROSS US WITHOUT POWER AMID BITTER COLD

President Biden confirmed Thursday the White House reached out to at least 26 governors in affected states and is prepared to provide federal assistance.

The president told reporters the storm is ""not like a snow day"" and those planning to travel for Christmas should leave early before a meeting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS).

'LEAVE NOW': BIDEN ISSUES DIRE WARNING ON MONSTER WINTER STORM SWEEPING US

The cold air will also surge south and east on Friday, sending record-breaking temperatures as far south as Florida into the holiday weekend.

Friday's morning low temperatures are expected to be in the teens and single digits in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Alabama and Georgia leading to Hard Freeze alerts for much of the South. Several other locations across the South may not get out of the teens or 20s on Friday, setting records for lowest maximum temperatures.

As of 4:40 a.m. Friday, 131,448 people were already without power in the southeastern states due to the approaching storm, with Georgia residents accounting for 99,976 of those outages.

DEADLY CHRISTMAS WEEK BLIZZARD INTENSIFYING INTO POWERFUL BOMB CYCLONE AS ARCTIC AIR SPREADS EAST

The freezing temperatures will likely be some of the coldest in at least five years for many areas east of the Mississippi River, and Wind Chill Advisories extended into the Gulf Coast. For parts of North Texas and Oklahoma, the Wind Chill alerts are the first issued in the area in 11 years.

""Areas like Oklahoma, Arkansas, northern Texas and northern Louisiana, and the Mississippi Delta – you have to be prepared for the cold as well as potential power outages as the wind gusts will be quite strong along with the potential for a freeze,"" said FOX Meteorologist Steve Bender .

FOX Weather reported Dallas Fort Worth International Airport may dip below 10 degrees Friday – likely its coldest December temperature since 1989. Nashville's expected low of around 10 degrees would be its coldest December reading since 2010. Houston will drop to around 17 degrees Friday morning and struggle to reach the freezing mark during the day.

66,US-China experts warn of 'bloody affair for both sides' if war were to start,"Any conflict between the U.S. and China would prove costly for both sides and resolve based on a few key points – and not necessarily in America’s favor, defense experts told Fox News Digital.

""If you were to rank them, I would put Taiwan first, South China Sea second, the Senkaku Islands third and then elsewhere in the world,"" James Anderson, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy during the Trump Administration, said, adding that the Sea of Japan could also serve as the flashpoint for conflict with China.

President Biden, in May, reiterated this stance when he told a reporter that defending Taiwan, even militarily, was ""the commitment we made.""

Fox News Digital spoke with former defense officials and experts.

UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WEIGHS ACCUSING CHINA OF ‘CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY’

Proximity to China would provide Beijing a significant advantage, similar to how Russia saw a swing in momentum during its Ukraine invasion once it shortened its supply lines to focus only on the territories just beyond its western border in the Donbas region.

PUTIN, XI TO MEET FACE TO FACE NEXT WEEK IN FIRST MEETING SINCE WAR IN UKRAINE

""The problem is that in the Indo-Pacific Theater, the closer you get to China, the more [China] can concentrate its military assets,"" Anderson explained. ""What is especially concerning to the United States and its allies are ballistic missiles and the fact that China is probably ahead of us with hypersonic weaponry,"" which could allow China to hit jet carriers and other surface ships hard and fast.

Even with that advantage though, China faces a significant conflict that Dr. John Lee, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former Senior National Security Advisor to Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said would prove ""a very bloody affair for both sides.""

""Over the past two decades, the U.S. and allies have been very passive, allowing the People’s Liberation Army to achieve air and sea dominance in this theater,"" Lee said. ""However, [they] are now becoming serious about developing long-range strike capabilities, hypersonic strike capabilities, asymmetrical capabilities … and the range of non-military measures which would include crippling economic and financial sanctions.""

""In short, the U.S. and allies have many good and powerful options to ensure the military and strategic balance is in their favor,"" he added.

SENATE COMMITTEE TO MEET THIS WEEK OVER BIPARTISAN TAIWAN DEFENSE BILL

Anderson also touted the U.S. military’s ability to counter missiles. However, that capability loses impact in the face of ""saturation attacks,"" which effectively aim to blanket a target with missiles and stretch defensive efforts.

The U.S. has, therefore, also focused on trying to strengthen Taiwan through the ""porcupine strategy,"" which would see nations supply the island nation with a large amount of anti-tank and anti-air weaponry to help close the gap in military superiority that China holds.

China holds a manpower advantage over the U.S., with China’s 2.8 million soldier army outranking the U.S. alone, according to Brookings Institution, but a naval and air combat operation would severely limit that advantage.

""At this stage, China has air and sea dominance over the Taiwan Strait but cannot land troops successfully on Taiwan,"" Lee said. ""If it achieves the capacity to do so, then China will see the military option as a more attractive one.""

PUTIN SAYS THE US AND WEST ARE FAILING, CLAIMS FUTURE LIES IN ASIA

Matt McInnis, of the Institute for the Study of War, noted that China’s goal will largely dictate its coordination and deployment: Any attempt to secure islands in the contested seas and straits would likely choke point the Chinese forces, leaving limited use for troop deployments.

""Depending on your objectives and what they aim to achieve through naval and air forces, you would potentially have some use for Marines to hold certain smaller pieces of territory and some smaller islands,"" McInnis said, adding that Beijing would only proceed with an invasion once it felt reasonably confident American forces could not deploy quickly enough to the region.

Anderson noted that China has closed the gap in other military domains, but has not yet overtaken the U.S., acknowledging that China has ""the largest number of ships in the world today,"" but that the U.S. still has the advantage in terms of quality, and the same holds true for a ""superior"" U.S. Air Force.

The U.S. also can rely on regional partners. China, on the other hand, has few allies to turn to, largely looking toward countries like Russia to help it ""deflect"" economic pressure that the U.S. and its allies, according to McInnis.

PENTAGON PAUSES F-35 DELIVERIES AFTER DISCOVERING JET COMPONENTS CAME FROM CHINA

""There will certainly be economic lines of effort … and I'm quite sure China is looking long-term at how Russia, as well as key energy suppliers like Iran, can help them manage economic fallout from a conflict with the United States,"" he said. ""But I don't think we're at the point in the relationship between countries, certainly including North Korea, where they would necessarily provide operational support or lethal aid directly to China.""

Lee believes that China’s position weakened since it tipped its hand and revealed ""broader intentions"" to ""dominate East Asia,"" a move that also has emboldened the U.S. and its allies to ensure they counter China’s ambitions.

""China seeks to prevail by convincing the US and allies that it is not ‘worth it’ to defend Taiwan, that the cost would be too great,"" he said. ""China’s problem is that it has revealed its broader intentions, which is to dominate East Asia: Hence, a successful Chinese seizure of Taiwan would embolden China to push further rather than lead to a more satisfied power.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-china-experts-warn-bloody-affair-both-sides-if-war-were-start,N/A
67,US Air Force's new F-15EX breaks key record as threats against America grow,"After two years of experimental testing the U.S. Air Force has found that its new F-15EX fighter jet exceeded expectations in terms of number and tonnage of weapons carried.

In early 2021 the Air Force received the first two F-15EX fighter-bombers it ordered in mid-2020 for $80 million each with the remaining 6 for Lot 1 being delivered this year. This is an upgraded F-15E that will replace elderly F-15Es that will soon have to be retired or flown a lot less because of heavy use during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The F-15EX has been tested carrying and launching up to 12 air-to-air missiles. Previously the most missiles carried suspended from the wings was eight and six was more common. The F-15EX can carry up to 13.6 tons of weapons, more than any other F-15 model.

The F-15EX is cheaper to buy and operate than the F-35 and, for missions that do not depend a lot on stealth, the F-15EX is cheaper and more capable than older versions of the F-35 with newer versions of the F-35 closing that gap at approximately $77 million.

EX improvements enable the two-seat F-15EX to perform the same bomber functions as the two-seat F-15E which allows it to last for 20,000 flight hours at a cost of $29,000 per hour in comparison to the F-35's $33,000 per hour.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/u-s-air-forces-new-f-15ex-breaks-key-records-threats-against-america-grow,N/A
68,Chinese spy balloon raises alarm bells over China buying up US land,"A Chinese balloon craft floating over the northern United States has re-energized concerns among experts and lawmakers over China's ongoing efforts to buy land across the U.S., with some voices observing a ""pattern"" of suspected espionage activities near American military sites.

China on Friday confirmed the balloon is Chinese, claiming it's a civilian research craft that was blown far off course by prevailing winds. However, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder described the craft during briefings on Thursday and Friday as a high-altitude surveillance balloon.

""Instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years,"" said Ryder. ""Once the balloon was detected, the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.""

The suspected spy balloon was spotted over Montana, home to one of the nation's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.

CHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER CENTRAL US, WILL BE IN US AIRSPACE FOR 'A FEW DAYS,' PENTAGON SAYS

U.S. officials have previously warned about Chinese companies, such as the telecommunications giant Huawei, purchasing land near critical infrastructure in Montana and potentially capturing sensitive information regarding intercontinental ballistic missiles under the direction of the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Base.

""Set against that destructive power is a completely serene and wide-open landscape. It's just wheat fields and big sky country,"" FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said in 2021 while describing a trip to the base two years earlier. ""Except for one thing: There are cell towers all around those Montana missile fields that have been running on Huawei equipment.""

The Chinese surveillance balloon has prompted Montana lawmakers to push for a ban on Chinese agricultural land purchases in the state.

""This really shows that there are nations out there that want to spy on us. Senate Bill 203 prevents those adversarial nations from purchasing our ag production land and our critical infrastructure,"" Montana state Sen. Ken Bogner told local outlet KTQV. ""The Ag production land hits issues of food security — we help feed the entire nation. And the critical infrastructure is things like oil refineries, telecommunication facilities. So, it's a plethora of things to make sure that we're protected as much as we can be here in the state.""

More broadly, experts told Fox News Digital that the balloon is indicative of a larger Chinese espionage effort.

CHINA EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM ON SPY BALLOON HOVERING OVER US: 'IT’S VERY DANGEROUS WHAT THEY’RE DOING'

""China has stepped up its espionage activities against sensitive military facilities,"" said Gordan Chang, author of ""The Coming Collapse of China and The Great U.S.-China Tech War."" ""This is clearly part of a pattern.""

Last summer, the Chinese company Fufeng Group, a food manufacturer, made headlines for purchasing 370 acres of land in Grand Forks, N.D., some 15 miles away from Grand Forks Air Force, a center for both air and space operations.

The Air Force this week denied Fufeng Group its building permits for a wet corn milling plant on the land, calling the project a ""significant threat to national security.""

In Texas, meanwhile, a Chinese company owned by a former Chinese soldier with ties to the ruling Communist Party bought 130,000 acres near Laughlin Air Force Base, where pilots are trained.

Texas Republicans and Gov. Greg Abbott are seeking to ban Chinese citizens and businesses from buying property in the Lone Star State.

STEFANIK, ROUNDS LEAD BIPARTISAN BILL TO PREVENT CHINA, FOREIGN ADVERSARIES FROM BUYING INTO US AGRICULTURE

Florida and Virginia are among other states where leaders have been backed similar bans.

""Whether this is actually part of plan or not, these purchases are suspiciously close to sensitive military facilities and therefore shouldn't be allowed,"" said Chang.

He argued that until the U.S. gets a hold of these suspicious activities on agricultural land, the U.S. needs to institute a prohibition on Chinese land purchases.

""No Chinese entity should own farm or ranch land in U.S., full stop, including land involved in food processing,"" said Chang. ""Chinese parties that own this land should either have it expropriated with compensation or, if there was criminal activity, forfeiture statues should be used to take it away.""

Beyond the states, lawmakers at the federal level have also been pushing to crack down on Chinese entities buying U.S. land.

AFTER CHINESE BALLOON ENTERS US AIRSPACE, BIDEN SECRETARY OF STATE POSTPONES TRIP TO CHINA

In the Senate, Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced legislation that would blacklist China and other ""foreign adversaries"" from investing in, purchasing, or otherwise acquiring land or businesses involved in agriculture.

In the House, Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.) introduced similar legislation to block China from purchasing American farmland.

""As more reports come in, it is becoming apparent the Chinese Communist Party is deliberately testing how the United States will respond to their provocative actions,"" Newhouse told Fox News Digital. ""This is yet another example of their alarming aggression. President Biden must act swiftly to confront this situation.""

""As a member of the House Select Committee on China,"" he continued, ""I am eager to further investigate the aggressive actions of the CCP and seek avenues to hold them accountable.""

Rodgers' office echoed those sentiments and the need to remain vigilant.

""The situation unfolding is worrisome. The congresswoman believes that under no circumstances should an aircraft operated by the Chinese government be flying in American airspace conducting surveillance,"" said Rodgers spokesman Kyle VonEnde. ""She continues to monitor the situation closely and is grateful to the servicemen and women of Fairchild Air Force Base, whose swift response once again demonstrates just how vital their strategic mission is to keeping our skies safe from adversaries in the Pacific arena.""

Both bills were introduced this week not long before the Chinese surveillance balloon became public.

European officials, speaking anonymously to Politico, accused the U.S. of ""profiting"" off of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and complained that green subsidies and taxes included in the Inflation Reduction Act have deteriorated relationships between the U.S. and European allies and partners.

""The fact is, if you look at it soberly, the country that is most profiting from this war is the U.S. because they are selling more gas and at higher prices, and because they are selling more weapons,"" a senior official told Politico.

""We are really at a historic juncture,"" the official added, arguing that U.S. policies have disrupted trade and that high gas prices are turning public opinion against aid for Ukraine. ""America needs to realize that public opinion is shifting in many EU countries.""

LITHUANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: ‘NO GREATER THREAT’ THAN RUSSIA, SEEKS TO PRESERVE ‘GLOBAL RULES-BASED ORDER’

Among Europe's complaints is that the electric vehicle tax credit included in the Inflation Reduction Act, a $369 billion spending and tax law signed by Biden, is ""protectionist"" and ""discriminatory"" because it imposes unfair competition on foreign manufacturers.

""The Inflation Reduction Act is very worrying,"" Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher said. ""The potential impact on the European economy is very big.""

At the same time, Putin has cut off energy exports to the rest of Europe, which has led EU countries to buy fuel from the U.S. at nearly four times the cost. These factors, combined with record high inflation, the threat of recession, and increased demand for energy as winter approaches have led European leaders to question whether Biden's administration is aware of the harm the president's policies have inflicted.

""Americans — our friends — take decisions which have an economic impact on us,"" the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell emphasized to Politico.

Biden’s visit comes after Monday's surprise trip to Ukraine, where he met with President Zelenskyy. All this happening just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, and Poland is looking for a little acknowledgment for the role it has played in aiding Ukraine.

""I think one of the purposes of President Biden's visit to Poland is actually to…emphasize support, U.S. support to Poland,"" Adrian Kubicki, Poland's Consul General in New York said. ""[It] is also important that President Biden listens to what we have to say in terms of how to enhance our security.""

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV, UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

Poland has been a top provider in defensive and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, alongside the U.S., since the war began.

Warsaw has not only taken in the greatest number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war-torn nation, but it has also led NATO negotiations to push for newer and faster equipment deliveries to Ukraine, including tanks earlier this year.

Nearly a dozen nations have pledged tanks for Kyiv, and Poland is now working with allied nations to review whether warplanes could be next on the defensive aid itinerary.

However, Kubicki pointed out that Poland, as well as all Baltic nations near Russia and Ukraine, are under threat from Russian aggression.

""We would like to see an increased presence, permanent presence, of U.S. troops right at the doorstep of the ongoing war – which is Poland,"" he said. ""U.S. troops should be present permanently in our countries given the situation…and what could potentially happen in the future if Russia is, God forbid, successful in Ukraine.""

RUSSIAN PLOT TO 'DESTROY' EUROPEAN COUNTRY THWARTED BY UKRAINE

Russia has threatened to push its aggression beyond Ukraine’s borders since the war began, setting its sights on Moldova, which is west of Ukraine and where a contingent of Russian sympathizers remain in an area known as Transnistria.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that Kyiv had thwarted a Russian plot to overthrow the Moldovan government – a claim the Moldovan government confirmed – which reignited concerns regarding Moscow’s overall aggression towards Europe.

Kubicki said that Poland believes Russia is incapable of overthrowing Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin originally intended, or of invading another European nation. However, he warned that Moscow is playing the long game.

71,US to start training Ukrainians on Patriot system on US soil next week,"U.S. armed forces will begin training up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers on the sophisticated Patriot missile system next week at Fort Sill, Okla., a defense official confirmed for Fox News Tuesday.

The training is expected to take several months, though it will still be an expedited process in comparison to roughly year-long program the Patriot missile system traditionally takes.

""The longer those troops are off the line – they're not actually engaged in combat – and so [the U.S. is] trying to work with Ukrainians to see what we can do to accelerate the training timeline,"" Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters.

US COMMITS $3B IN LARGEST DEFENSIVE PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE YET TO CHANGE 'DYNAMIC ON THE BATTLEFIELD'

Ryder said he was not aware of additional plans to send a second round of troops for Patriot systems training at this time.

""The Patriot will add to the air defense capabilities of Ukraine, as we've seen over the last number of months in particular, Russia has really intensified its aerial bombardment of Ukraine – really across the country,"" he said. ""The Patriot will contribute to the air defense capabilities that Ukraine already has.""

Ryder said the battery system will enable Ukraine to defend itself against ballistic missiles and ""adversary aircraft.""

""This is a part of a broader effort by the United States and the international community to provide Ukraine with air defense capabilities that it needs to defend its populations and its armed forces,"" Ryder added.

The U.S. first pledged to send the surface-to-air missile battery last month in a move that committed the most advanced air defense system from the West yet as the war in Ukraine continued for a 10th month.

72,"Biden admin quietly approves construction of U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma, Arizona","""Not another foot.""

Those were the words Joe Biden used as a mantra throughout his 2020 presidential campaign regarding the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. But on Thursday, the Biden administration approved a plan to complete a section of the border wall near Yuma, Arizona.

The plan includes filling four major gaps in the wall that continue to allow the Yuma area to be one of the busiest corridors for illegal immigration crossings.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized the new plan, which was started by the Trump administration, in an effort to ""deploy modern, effective border measures"" and improve ""safety and security along the Southwest Border,"" the agency said.

BIDEN ADMIN FORMALLY TERMINATED KEY TRUMP-ERA MIGRATION AGREEMENTS AT HEIGHT OF BORDER CRISIS

The project will be funded under Homeland Security’s 2021 budget, though it was initially planned to be funded by the Defense Department.

Yuma’s border sector remains an unsolved issue for the Biden administration as border patrol agents have already stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the sector this year.

The figure is nearly quadruple the number of migrant stops from last year and the Yuma sector remains the busiest migrant sector in the state of Arizona.

TEXAS REP. ARRINGTON SAYS BIDEN ‘SURRENDERED CONTROL’ OF SOUTHERN BORDER: ‘IT IS AN INVASION’

Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in South Texas were the only other sectors with more traffic along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

The Yuma sector was notably busy under former President Trump, who had portions of the border wall constructed or reinforced. There was also a plaque installed along the Yuma border in 2020, affirming Trump’s role in securing the wall.

prev Image 2 of 2

Biden’s decision to secure the border wall comes after Sen. Mark Kelly, D-AZ, has called on the president to secure the border. Republican lawmakers have made similar calls.

The Biden administration’s quiet approval of the wall’s construction also comes after Biden often used it as a means of contrasting his policies with those of the Trump administration.

In the past, Biden was repeatedly critical of Trump, his border wall, and his immigration policies — which he referred to as ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETURN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BORDER

In an op-ed published in the Miami Herald, Biden specifically wrote that the slogan ""build the wall"" was ""divorced from reality"" and a wall ""won’t stop the flow of illegal narcotics or human trafficking, both of which come primarily through legal ports of entry.""

""Nor will it stem the numbers of undocumented, most of whom over-stay legal visas,"" he added.

During an interview in August 2020, Biden told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro: ""There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1.""

Biden also ceased all new border wall construction after he took office and has told Congress to cancel funding for border wall construction.

He has since ramped up border security measures. Biden also continues to use billions of dollars Congress appropriated for the wall’s construction. He cannot legally refuse to do so — he is only permitted to pause border construction projects.

Republicans have repeatedly sued Biden for pausing the border wall construction.

73,US military ranked 'weak' for first time: Heritage Foundation report,"A Heritage Foundation report has ranked the U.S. military as ""weak"" for the first time in the annual assessment's nine-year history.

The conservative think tank's 2023 Index of U.S. Military Strength warned that the force is at a growing risk of ""not being able to meet the demands of defending America's vital national interests.""

""It is rated as weak relative to the force needed to defend national interests on a global stage against actual challenges in the world as it is rather than as we wish it were,"" the Heritage Foundation said.

It cited years of sustained use, underfunding, ""poorly defined priorities,"" ""wildly shifting security policies,"" ""exceedingly poor discipline in program execution"" and ""a profound lack of seriousness across the national security establishment.""

RUSSIA'S PUTIN DECLARES MARTIAL LAW IN 4 ANNEXED UKRAINIAN REGIONS

The Heritage Foundation said the index assesses the ease of operating in key regions, regional political stability, the presence of U.S. military and the condition of key infrastructure.

The condition of the U.S. military's power is measured in terms of modernity, capacity for operations and readiness for missions.

Highlighting acts from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran – including Russia's invasion of Ukraine – the index noted that the U.S. must be able to defend its interests in more than one region at a time ""no matter how much [it] desires that the world be a simpler, less threatening place.""

The Heritage Foundation added that its report is based on the ability of the military to defeat two major competitors approximately simultaneously.

The think tank said it acknowledges that, without a dramatic change in circumstances, administrations will allocate funds to domestic programs.

Ultimately, an evaluation of each military branch found the Marine Corps was ""strong"" while the Air Force was ""very weak.""

NATIONAL DEBT SPIKES TO $31T, BUT WE CAN STOP IT BEFORE IT NEARS THE ABYSS

The Navy and Space Force were ""weak,"" and the Army was ranked as ""marginal.""

The U.S. nuclear capability – which was treated as a separate entity – was found to be ""strong"" but trending toward ""marginal"" or ""weak.""

The Heritage report concluded that the military is at risk of not being able to meet the demands of a single major regional conflict while also operating elsewhere, noting that modernization programs suffer and that there have been reductions in the size of military units.

""Today, we agreed to deepen our defense cooperation in several important ways,"" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a press release on Tuesday . ""Based upon today's talks, we will increase rotational presence of U.S. forces in Australia. That includes rotations of bomber task forces, fighters and future rotations of U.S. Navy and U.S. Army capabilities.""

Austin explained during annual talks between American and Australian officials that China’s ""dangerous and coercive actions throughout the Indo-Pacific, including around Taiwan, toward the Pacific island countries and in the East and South China Seas, threaten regional peace and stability.""

While details still remain to be worked out, the Wall Street Journal reported that the two nations will place more munitions and fuel in Australia that will support U.S. military operations, as well as developing airfields in the northern part of the country where joint exercises between the two militaries can be held.

75,US Navy official says Iranian attacks in Middle East 'have the attention of everyone',"Iranian attacks in the waterways of the Middle East and elsewhere in the region ""have the attention of everyone"" as tensions rise over Tehran's advancing nuclear program, the head of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday.

Vice Adm. Brad Cooper also told The Associated Press that he's seen a rise in what he described as Iran's ""malign activities"" in the region over his two years leading the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet.

While Cooper pointed to recent seizures of weapons by American and allied forces in the region as a success, he acknowledged that Iran has been able to carry out drone attacks targeting shipping in the Mideast and other assaults in the region.

""We’re focused on expanding our partnerships,"" Cooper said on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi's International Defense Exhibition and Conference. ""The short answer is the Iranian actions have the attention of everyone.""

NAVY STOPS IRAN FROM TAKING US MILITARY DRONE IN ARABIAN GULF

Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over Cooper's remarks.

The 5th Fleet patrols the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil transits. Its region also stretches as far as the Red Sea up to the Suez Canal, the waterway in Egypt linking the Mideast to the Mediterranean Sea, and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait off Yemen.

Under Cooper's command, which will end with the upcoming arrival of Rear Adm. George Wikoff in Bahrain, likely later this year, the 5th Fleet vastly expanded its use of drones and artificial intelligence to patrol those waterways.

Cooper said the Navy has reached the halfway mark of his goal to have 100 unmanned drones, both sailing and submersible, operating in the region with America's allies. The Navy also conducted a drill Monday with the United Arab Emirates with the systems, he added.

But concerns about Iran have only grown in recent months as Tehran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels and has enough fissile material for several nuclear bombs if it chooses to build them.

There have been several Iranian attacks on commercial shipping the region, including a still-murky drone assault on the tanker Campo Square on Feb. 10 that's been cited by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Iran carried out that attack, which wounded no one on board, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

Iran has denied targeting the vessel, though it has denied other attacks attributed to it since the collapse of the nuclear deal following America's withdrawal from the accord in 2018.

""Obviously the nuclear component is all being handled via diplomatic means,"" Cooper said. ""I think over a two-year period, we have for sure seen an increase in the number of malign activities, much of which we’ve been catching just in the last 60 to 90 days.""

The United States has, however, interdicted a number of ships carrying weapons bound for Yemen's Houthi rebels from Iran, and France as well as seized one. A United Nations arms embargo has prohibited weapons transfers to the Iranian-backed Houthis since 2014.

'WARNING SIGN': IRAN'S MILITARY REPORTEDLY SENDING WARSHIPS TO BRAZIL, PANAMA CANAL IN CHALLENGE TO US

Cooper declined to say whether the increase in seizures represented new intelligence obtained by the U.S. or an increasing number of vessels heading to Yemen.

""I won’t be able to get to the intelligence piece of it other than to say it’s an area that we’re clearly focused on with our partners,"" Cooper said. ""We’ve had a lot of success and we’re our job is to just remain vigilant and keep at the mission.""

Iran also has briefly seized several of the American drones being tested in the region in late August and early September. However, Cooper said Iran hadn't made an attempt to do so again.

""The Iranian attempted seizures were flagrant. They were unwarranted. They were certainly unprofessional, but most importantly, they were a gross violation of international law,"" Cooper said.

""Since then, we’ve had six exercises of varying scale, bilaterally and multilaterally. We’ve had no issues with Iran attempting to do anything with the drones.""

Cooper added that with Israel now working directly with the U.S. military’s Central Command — as Arab nations in the region do — also offered additional support to counter Iran.

76,"Navy lieutenant sentenced in Japan causes outcry among family, US lawmakers","A U.S. Navy lieutenant and Mormon missionary living in Japan has been sentenced to what his family calls a ""shocking"" three years in prison after at least two people were killed in a traffic accident doctors said may have been caused by a medical episode.

The family of Lt. Ridge Alkonis, through information compiled by the Pipe Hitter Foundation (PHF), alleges several violations of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the U.S. and Japan, and some members of Congress are also speaking out against his confinement – which began Tuesday at 1 p.m. Japan Standard Time.

The PHF said in a document describing Alkonis' situation other military families are now ""acutely aware that this terrible situation could have been them"" and are in ""fear"" that SOFA may be allegedly violated again in the future.

Alkonis, who lived with his family in Yokosuka, had just finished a hike on the famed Mount Fuji shortly before he was scheduled to be deployed on the USS Benfold. Outside of his military duties, he was also part of a mission with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

TAIWAN LOSES MAJOR ADVOCATE WITH ASSASSINATION OF SHINZO ABE

While driving into the city of Fujinomiya, Alkonis lost consciousness and the family's vehicle drifted out of its lane and crashed into parked cars at a restaurant, killing a woman and her son-in-law.

The PHF said Alkonis was not immediately taken to a hospital, but instead arrested and detained in solitary confinement for nearly a month. Neurologists eventually diagnosed him with Acute Mountain Sickness, which can cause sudden fainting up to 24 hours after rapid altitudinal change.

The Alkonis family stated they also offered customary ‘gomenasai’ – or apology – and wrote condolences to the family in addition to negotiating a record $1.65 million gomensai settlement.

Gomenasai has a ""high value"" in the Japanese justice system, according to Alkonis' father Derek, who spoke to Fox News earlier this month. The Alkonises expected a suspended sentence, which the PHF said is considered ""the norm"" in such cases when remorse is shown – but Ridge was still sentenced.

Mother Suzi Alkonis told ""Fox News @ Night"" that prosecutors claimed Ridge fell asleep while driving, which was incorrect, she said: ""He wasn't tired. He never felt sleepy. He never said so. He was mid-sentence with his daughter when he slumped to the side unconscious – that's not falling asleep.""

AL GORE BLASTED AS ‘CLIMATE SHOCK JOCK’ AFTER LATEST GLOBAL WARMING COMPARISON

While the Japanese Supreme Court – which like the U.S. bench chooses its cases itself – could eventually hear Ridge's plea, Suzy Alkonis said it may be up to the Biden White House to secure a deal with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to bring her son home.

Alkonis' case has brought about rare bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, with some members of both parties calling for his release and condemning the actions of the Japanese judiciary.

One Senate lawmaker who has been prominent in advocating for Ridge Alkonis' release is Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who took to the Senate floor on Monday.

WESTERN JAPAN'S SAKURAJIMA VOLCANO ERUPTS

""I find it nothing short of inexcusable that an American who experienced a medical emergency should be treated so poorly by an Allied nation that he's protecting,"" Lee said.

""Clearly the Japanese judicial system is trying to make an example of Lt. Alkonis – perhaps stemming from a history of disputes over our Status of Forces Agreement,"" he said. ""He is being targeted because he is an American – and because he was in the unfortunate position of having suffered a medical emergency that resulted in tragedy.""

Lee said the case is ""no way for a friendly nation to treat a friendly nation"" – adding it is difficult to make such a pronouncement because of the otherwise important, positive relationship between America and Japan.

""We've been allies for a long time,"" Lee continued, going on to echo other Alkonis advocates and call on President Biden to make a priority out of Ridge's case.

77,China could invade Taiwan before the 2024 US presidential election: sources,"EXCLUSIVE: China could invade Taiwan within the next 18 months, current and former officials familiar with U.S. and allied intelligence told Fox News, suggesting a particularly ""dangerous"" window between the meeting of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party this November and the next U.S. presidential election in 2024.

Two former senior officials told Fox News that the intelligence suggests China sees the potential opportunity for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan in that time frame.

""We have always had and always been aware that China has an ever-present, ever-evolving plan for an amphibious assault and military invasion of Taiwan. If they are not successful in reunifying politically, then they will do so with force,"" one former senior intelligence official familiar with U.S. intelligence, and who has discussed intelligence belonging to a U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific, told Fox News.

""What is different now is, we have intelligence that this has gone from an indefinite, nebulous scenario, to a belief that there is a window of opportunity in the next 18 months,"" the official continued. ""I don’t think that’s a coincidence that window of opportunity is within a Biden administration.""

WHITE HOUSE: US 'DOES NOT WANT A CRISIS' BUT WILL 'MANAGE WHAT BEIJING CHOOSES TO DO' AMID PELOSI TAIWAN VISIT

A former senior Trump administration official told Fox News House Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan is being used as a ""pretext"" for increased Chinese aggression around Taiwan, but said it is ""not the real cause of it,"" and warned that the ""Davidson Window"" is ""closing.""

Former commander of American forces in the Indo-Pacific Adm. Philip Davison testified last year that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years—by 2027.

""The window is now between the Party Congress and the next U.S. presidential election,"" the official said noting that window could close by January 2025—at the end of the presidential transition period. ""I think we are in a very dangerous two-year window right now.""

The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is expected to take place in November, where Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to be re-elected.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told Fox News that the United States ""will not seek and does not want a crisis.""

""We are prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do. We will not engage in saber-rattling, and we're not looking to escalate,"" the NSC spokesperson told Fox News. ""At the same time, we're going to be steady and resolute. We will not be deterred from operating in the seas and skies of the Western Pacific as we have done for decades.""

The spokesperson added that the United States ""will continue to support Taiwan, consistent with our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act, and defend a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

""We're communicating closely with our allies and partners. And we are maintaining open lines of communication Beijing,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will keep doing what we are doing -- supporting cross-Strait peace and stability.""

However, the former senior Trump administration official told Fox News that ""the likelihood of invasion has increased dramatically with China perceiving the United States is in a weakened position,"" pointing to the Biden administration’s ""surrender"" of Afghanistan to the Taliban in August 2021 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted ""in only half-measure sanctions being put on the Russian Federation.""

PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME' BEFORE CHINA CAUSES 'MAJOR' INCIDENT IN INDO-PACIFIC REGION

The official also said Xi has been emboldened by U.S. ""domestic problems,"" including crime in cities across the nation, ""the lack of control"" at the Southern border, and the ""failures"" of the Biden administration’s energy policy.

The official stressed that the invasion could happen before the inauguration of the next president in 2025, saying China fears the election of ""another leader that could return to a more robust, ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy and stronger domestic policies.""

With regard to criticisms of the current administration's foreign policy and its withdrawal from Afghanistan, a Biden administration official told Fox News that China ""would love nothing more than for the U.S. government to still be bogged down in a 20-year war, still committing billions of dollars, U.S. troops, and have our military focused on another country's civil war.

""By being able to withdraw our forces from Afghanistan, we have been able to reposition them and refocus our efforts to other areas of the world,"" the official said. The official added that the Biden administration ""freed up resources"" and said leaving Afghanistan put the United States ""in a much better position on the geopolitical stage when it comes to our strategic competition with China or with any other important issues around the world.""

However, during an interview with Fox News Wednesday, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck said the United States ""has failed to deter adversaries within the last 18 months.""

""If anything, the United States has been deterred from forcefully supporting its partners and allies worldwide,"" Klinck said, adding that he has viewed 2024 as a ""particularly dangerous year.""

""The reason is because it is not only the election in the United States, but it is also the presidential election in Taiwan,"" Klinck said, stressing that he believes the People’s Liberation Army ""will move against Taiwan when the Chinese Communist Party tells it to, regardless of timing.""

""I view 2024 as being dangerous because I believe the CCP, particularly President Xi Jinping, will see it as a potential window of opportunity because of the U.S. election, and the fact that he probably perceives that the United States is going to shy away from an international crisis during a presidential election,"" he told Fox News.

Klinck, who also formerly served as a U.S. military attaché at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, currently serves as a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

""I also believe he perceives that the presumptive next Taiwanese president is going to move Taiwan closer to independence,"" he said.

CHINA POSES 'BIGGEST LONG-TERM THREAT TO ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY,' FBI DIRECTOR WRAY WARNS

Current Biden administration officials told Fox News that the situation is fluid and that they are monitoring closely as China gears up for ""potential escalation."" Officials said they are looking to see how the situation will play out over the coming months and how far China will go.

Officials say they are focusing on what the heightened threat could mean for Taiwan, for U.S.-Chinese relations, and for certain critical industries that could be impacted.

White House National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said Tuesday that even before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan this week, Beijing ""positioned itself to take further steps, and we expect that they will continue to react over a longer-term horizon.""

At this point, the Chinese have declared several closure areas around Taiwan for military exercises, and Klinck told Fox News that some of those closure areas ""encroach upon Taiwanese territorial waters.""

Klinck told Fox News that this is the first time the military exercises are taking place east of Taiwan.

MILLEY DIRECTS A REVIEW OF US, CHINESE MILITARY CONTACTS, AMID WARNING BEIJING POSES NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT

""The Chinese are trying to say to Taiwan, you don’t have any territorial waters because you belong to us, and they are going to make the point now by conducting exercises there, and they have never done that before,"" Klinck said. ""They have previously declared closure areas and conducted exercises there. They have never done it though on the east side of Taiwan.""

Biden administration officials have been warning for months of increased Chinese aggression, with one top Pentagon official last month sounding the alarm that it is ""only a matter of time"" before a ""major incident or accident"" occurs in the Indo-Pacific.

Assistant Secretary for Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said last month that the Pentagon has witnessed a ""sharp increase"" in aggressive behavior by the PLA in the Indo-Pacific, admitting that it has ""increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone.""

The warnings from the Pentagon come just days after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley directed his staff to collect information on interactions between the U.S. and Chinese militaries in the last five years.

79,Can the US catch China’s hypersonic missiles?,"It's been almost one year since China surprised the Pentagon and the world by carrying out a hypersonic glide vehicle test that traveled around the world and landed just two dozen miles from its target.

""The significance was it scared the hell out of everybody,"" Sen. Angus King told Fox News. ""If the thing is dwelling over Kansas City, you're talking you're reducing 15 to 20 minutes to two to three minutes. That's a qualitative change.""

Some officials in the Pentagon described it as a ""Sputnik"" moment because the Chinese leapfrogged the U.S. with a technology that could evade billions of dollars of missile defense, setting off an arms race.

Hypersonic weapons fly at speeds of at least Mach 5, are highly maneuverable, are able to change course during flight and can fly 100 feet above the ocean undetected.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Sen. King, I-Maine, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, said the U.S. still lags behind its adversaries.

The senator from Maine blames U.S. fear of failure, which is different from adversaries like China.

""We're probably, I think, five years behind in terms of where the Chinese are,"" King said. ""They don't mind failing in tests. We have this idea that we've got to get it exactly right and every test has to be a success. They have a series of failures, each one of which they learned something.""

King has asked the Pentagon in nearly every public hearing why it isn't investing more in hypersonic technology.

""Frankly, the Chinese and the Russians just plain got ahead of us,"" King said. ""If our strategy in the Pacific is based upon aircraft carriers, and an aircraft carrier is vulnerable to a 6,000-mile-an-hour missile, we're in trouble.""

GOP LAWMAKERS LAUNCH PROBE OF TIKTOK'S SHARING OF USER DATA WITH CHINESE PARENT COMPANY

The U.S. announced a failed weapons test in June. A full hypersonic system for a Common Hypersonic Glide Body atop a two-stage missile booster had failed to detach and reach Mach 5 speeds at a testing site at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii, the Pentagon announced.

But, on Tuesday, just days after the failed test announcement, the Pentagon made it a point to announce two recent successful hypersonic tests. One of them, conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in May, demonstrated the first flight test of the ground-based hypersonic boost-glide system to be launched from a standard military truck at White Sands Missile Facility in New Mexico.

More recently, the Air Force successfully tested a hypersonic missile off the coast of Southern California that could be released from under the wing of a B-52 strategic jet bomber.

Russian scientists mocked the failed U.S. hypersonic glide vehicle test last week, saying the U.S. design model for hypersonic weapons is ""too complex."" Congress is seeking $292 million dollars in the new defense bill to fund more research and development for hypersonics.

EUROPEAN NATIONS COORDINATE ON PROSECUTING RUSSIAN WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE

Sen. King compares hypersonic weapons to the introduction of the longbow, which helped the British beat the French when they were outmanned at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the stirrup, which allowed Ghenghis Khan's soldiers to steady their shot from atop a horse.

""Technological developments often determine the outcome of conflict,"" King said. ""And hypersonic, to me, are the game-changing strategic difference in any future conflict that this country is engaged in. And we're behind.""

At a confirmation hearing earlier this year, John Plumb, first assistant secretary of defense for space policy, agreed.

""It certainly appears that we are behind,"" Plumb said in response to Sen. King in January.

Outgoing Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman General John Hyten was the first to raise the alarm about the U.S. losing the hypersonic race in November.

The U.S. military, realizing the threat these weapons pose, has had to resort to using hot air balloons to provide an early warning system to protect the nation from hypersonic weapons that can now evade U.S. missile defense systems. Congress is requesting $27.1 million for this balloon defense in next year's defense budget

Pentagon officials have publicly pushed back on the narrative that the U.S. has ""fallen behind,"" pointing out that U.S. ballistic missiles and most of its vast nuclear arsenal are already hypersonic, meaning, by definition, they fly five times faster than the speed of sound. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked at a press conference in November whether the Chinese hypersonic test was a ""Sputnik"" moment.

Melissa Dalton, assistant defense secretary of Homeland Defense, and Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of U.S. North Command, held a press conference Sunday evening, hours after a U.S. fighter jet shot down an ""unidentified object"" over Lake Huron.

The object, believed to be the same tracked over Montana and monitored by the government the night before, was the fourth object shot out of the sky by U.S. fighter jets in eight days, along with ones over Alaska and Canada and a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

""In light of the People’s Republic of China balloon that we took down last Saturday, we have been more closely scrutinizing our space at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we’ve detected over the past week,"" Dalton said.

""These most recent objects did not pose a kinetic military threat but their path and proximity to sensitive DOD sites and the altitude that they were flying could be a hazard to civilian aviation and thus raised concerns,"" Dalton said.

U.S. authorities have made clear that they constantly monitor for unknown radar blips, and it is not unusual to shut down airspace as a precaution to evaluate them. But the unusually assertive response was raising questions about whether such use of force was warranted, particularly as administration officials said the objects were not of great national security concern and the downings were just out of caution.

Gen. VanHerck said NORAD detected a ""radar contact"" in Canada, approximately 70 miles north of the U.S. border, around 4:45 p.m. ET Saturday.

When it became clear it was an unknown object, NORAD scrambled F-15 fighters from Portland, Oregon and KC-135 tanker support from Fairchild Air Force Base Washington to investigate the object.

CHINA CLAIMS ‘UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT’ IN ITS AIRSPACE, PREPARED TO SHOOT IT DOWN

The object crossed into the United States sovereign space around 6 p.m. EST but as the evening waned on, officials lost track, VanHerck said. NORAD identified an ""intermittent radar contact"" in Montana hours later as it approached Wisconsin.

""It’s likely, but we have not confirmed the track that we saw in Wisconsin was the same track in Montana,"" VanHerck said.

The object was monitored as it passed over the Great Lakes region in Michigan. When NORAD assessed that it was no physical or military threat, officials shot down the object about 15 nautical miles east of the Upper Peninsula over Lake Huron.

Operations are underway with multiple agencies, including the Coast Guard, to gather the object’s remains and determine where it came from.

VanHerck said the U.S. adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects. ""With some adjustments, we've been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks now,"" he said, ""and that's why I think you're seeing these, plus there's a heightened alert to look for this information.""

HOUSE OVERSIGHT CHAIR: CHINA HAS ‘MASSIVE SPY RING’ IN US, SAYS PROBLEM IS A ‘LOT BIGGER’ THAN SPY BALLOON

VenHerck refused to classify the recent shot-down objects as balloons.

""We’re calling them objects for a reason. Certainly, the event off the South Carolina coast for the Chinese spy balloon, that was clearly a balloon,"" he said. ""These are objects. I am not able to categorize how they stay aloft. It could be a gaseous type of balloon inside a structure, or it could be some type of a propulsion system. But clearly they’re able to stay aloft.""

He cautioned reporters not to attribute the objects to any specific country as officials are waiting to get their hands on the remains and further assess and analyze what they are.

VanHerck said it was, to the best of his recollection, the first time in U.S. history that NORAD or the U.S. Northern Command ""has taken kinetic action against an airborne object.""

81,"ISIS leader killed in US Special Operations raid in Syria, Biden says","ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi was killed in a ""successful"" U.S. Special Operations counterterrorism mission in northwest Syria Thursday, President Biden and the Pentagon have confirmed.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said there were no U.S. casualties. Al-Qurayshi detonated a large amount of explosives during the raid, killing himself, his wife and some of his children, U.S. officials told Fox News.

""Thanks to the bravery of our troops this horrible terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said. ""Our forces carried out the operation with their signature preparation and precision and I directed the Department of Defense to take every precaution possible to minimize civilian casualties.""

WHO IS ABU IBRAHIM AL-HASHIMI AL-QURAYSHI, THE LEADER OF ISIS KILLED IN US RAID?

""We do know that as our troops approached to capture the terrorist, in a final act of desperate cowardice – with no regard to the lives of his own family or others in the building – he chose to blow himself up, not just with the vest, but to blow up that third floor rather than face justice for the crimes he has committed, taking several members of his family with him,"" Biden added.

U.S. senior administration officials told Fox News that planning for Thursday's operation in the village of Atmeh was on the level and scale of the 2011 raid on Usama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.

The officials said Al-Qurayshi never left his home, only going to his rooftop occasionally to bathe and lived on the third floor of the property, relying on couriers and a lieutenant who lived on the second floor to operate his global terror network.

Senior administration officials also told Fox News that the family who lived in the first floor of the building was not involved with ISIS and were unaware that its leader lived above them.

That family – which included a 10-day-old baby – left the property when U.S. forces asked them to do so, the officials added.

AMERICAN WOMAN, A FORMER KANSAS RESIDENT, ACCUSED OF LEADING ALL-FEMALE ISIS BATTALION

Residents in Atmeh, a village in rebel-held Idlib Province, told the Associated Press that there was a large ground assault, with U.S. forces using loudspeakers asking women and children to leave the area. They described the raid as the biggest operation since the October 2019 killing of Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Omar Saleh, a resident of a nearby house, told the Associated Press he was asleep when his doors and windows started to rattle to the sound of low-flying aircraft at 1:10 a.m. local time. He ran to open the windows with the lights off, and saw three helicopters. He then heard a man, speaking Arabic with an Iraqi or Saudi accent through a loudspeaker, urging women to surrender or leave the area.

""This went on for 45 minutes. There was no response. Then the machine gun fire erupted,"" Saleh said. He said the firing continued for two hours, as aircraft circled low over the area.

The area where the raid happened, which is near the Turkish border, is home to several top Al Qaeda operatives and other militant groups still fighting President Bashar Assad.

There was at least one major explosion. U.S. officials told Fox News that one of the helicopters in the raid suffered a maintenance issue and had to be blown up on the ground.

Residents and activists told the AP that there were multiple deaths near the home that was raided, which included civilians. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine people were killed, including two children. The White Helmets, a civil defense group in the country, tweeted that 13 people, including six children and four women, were killed.

The group said teams were able to enter the targeted building minutes after the fighting ended, at about 3:15 a.m., local time.

""Our teams rushed an injured child to the hospital,"" a statement read. ""The child's entire family was killed in the operation. The teams also rushed another person to the hospital who was injured in the clashes when he approached the scene to witness what was happening.""

The suicide detonation caused some civilian casualties, but the number of civilian deaths reported on the ground do ""not correspond with what U.S. officials say occurred on the ground last night,"" two U.S. officials told Fox News.

Reuters said it viewed a video taken by a resident that showed the bodies of two ""apparently lifeless children and a man in the rubble of a building at the location.""

Prior to Thursday's raid, the Islamic State group has been reasserting itself in Syria and Iraq with increased attacks.

Last month, it carried out its biggest military operation since it was defeated and its members scattered underground in 2019: an attack on a prison in northeast Syria holding at least 3,000 IS detainees. The attack appeared aimed to break free senior IS operatives in the prison.

It took 10 days of fighting for U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces to retake the prison fully, and the force said more than 120 of its fighters and prison workers were killed along with 374 militants. The U.S.-led coalition carried out airstrikes and deployed American personnel in Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the prison area to help the Kurdish forces.

A December 2021 report by the Wilson Center, noted that al-Qurayshi, also known as Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla, hasn’t shown his face and the group has released almost no biographical details about him.

""Al-Mawla has not even given an audio address in which Islamic State members might hear his voice—a sharp break in precedent,"" the report said. ""Some disaffected former members of the group have argued that it is contrary to the Sharia to pledge allegiance to a ghost, but that does not seem to have swayed opinion. If there was opposition to al Mawla’s ascension, it has not manifested on the battlefield.""

82,Ron DeSantis rips Biden's 'blank-check' Ukraine policy as US announces additional aid: 'Not acceptable',"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called out President Biden for his ""blank-check policy"" on Ukraine after the president traveled to Kyiv for an unannounced visit shortly before the one-year mark of Putin's assault.

DeSantis joined ""Fox & Friends"" Monday to discuss Biden's first visit to the war zone since the conflict started a year ago, and why the newly allocated half-billion dollars in Ukrainian aid is unacceptable without clearly defined goals.

""They have effectively a blank-check policy with no clear, strategic objective identified, and these things can escalate, and I don't think it's in our interests to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea,"" DeSantis said.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

""So I think it would behoove them to identify what is the strategic objective that they're trying to achieve, but just saying it's an open-ended blank check, that is not acceptable,"" he continued.

Biden met with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday to announce the additional U.S. aid.

It encompasses various military necessities including shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, and air surveillance radars.

Even though the additional assistance comes on the heels of billions of American tax dollars that have already funded Ukrainian efforts in recent months, the list does not include F-16s, which Zelenskyy has requested, or new advanced weaponry.

However, DeSantis argued the war may never have happened if Biden handled various transnational issues differently, notably the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the drug crisis fueled by an open southern border.

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

""I don't think any of this would have happened, but for the weakness that the president showed during his first year in office, culminating, of course, in the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan,"" DeSantis said. ""So I think while he's over there, I think I and many Americans are thinking to ourselves, okay, 'He's very concerned about those borders halfway around the world. He's not done anything to secure our own border here at home.' We've had millions and millions of people pour in, tens of thousands of Americans dead because of fentanyl, and then, of course, we just suffered a national humiliation of having China fly a spy balloon clear across the continental United States.""

""So we have a lot of problems accumulating here in our own country that he is neglecting,"" he continued.

Biden was previously scheduled to arrive in Poland on Monday per his public schedule, but instead, took a covert, 10-hour train ride to Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted during his visit to Ankara, Turkey, that there are growing concerns surrounding potential Chinese aid to Russia in the form of ""lethal assistance,"" and that could have a significant impact on U.S.-China relations.

His comments come on the heels of icy tension over Beijing's spy flight in American airspace.

""As President Biden said going back many months, when the aggression first took place, and he spoke to President Xi Jinping, he told him at that point that there would be real consequences in our own relationship were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia in this aggression against Ukraine,"" he said Monday.

Even as fears of a proxy war between Washington and Beijing loom, DeSantis noted that despite Putin's ongoing assault, the real threat to America does not originate from Moscow.

""The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all of that and steamrolling… that is not even come close to happening,"" DeSantis said. ""I think they've shown themselves to be a third-rate military power. I think they've suffered tremendous, tremendous losses.

""I got to think that the people in Russia are probably disapproving of what's going on,"" he continued.

""I don't think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons, so I think Russia has been really, really wounded here. And I don't think that they are the same threat to our country, even though they're hostile. I don't think they're on the same level as a China.""

According to the United Nations, more than 8 million Ukrainians have fled the country to other European countries since the war with Putin's invasion on Feb. 24 last year.

83,"Ukraine aid opened the floodgates for more Pentagon spending as US eyes Russia, China","America's aid campaign for Ukraine has opened the doors for a surge in domestic defense spending, both to refill stockpiles of weapons sent overseas and to bolster U.S. readiness against near-peer rivals.

President Biden requested $813 for the Pentagon for 2023, but Congress appears poised to pass an $858 billion budget plan. If passed, the money will go toward purchasing missiles for the Army, new weapons systems for the Navy and expanding ammunition plants, among other things, the New York Times reported Sunday.

The traditional measure of U.S. military readiness has been its capacity to supply and carry out two major conflicts in separate areas of the globe. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued last week that U.S. support for Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in that readiness.

""We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,"" Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes told NYT. ""So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.""

HOUSE REPUBLICAN DEMANDS WEST POINT CEASE CRITICAL RACE THEORY TRAININGS TO MILITARY CADETS

China's recent aggression toward Taiwan has also contributed to calls for more spending. Aid to the self-governed island has already been delayed, thanks in large part to the flow of weapons to Ukraine.

The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since February, so much that President Biden's administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used. The volume of U.S. aid to the country has given rise to some skeptics within the Republican Party, who are calling for greater accountability.

Nevertheless, funding conflicts with near-peer rivals is far more expensive than the asymmetric warfare the U.S. military has largely engaged in this century.

The potential $858 billion budget would represent a 4.3% annual increase over the past two years, according to NYT.

And the U.S. isn't the only one. Allies like Japan have also announced ramped-up military spending in the face of growing Chinese aggression. Sullivan congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on his administration's new Defense Buildup Program on Friday.

86,US military bases that housed Afghan evacuees suffered $260 million in damage,"A new Department of Defense (DOD) report found that the U.S. military bases that housed Afghan evacuees suffered $260 million in damages, with the Air Force saying the damage was ""unrepairable.""

The DOD inspector general reported last week that the eight bases housing the refugees in Texas, Wisconsin, New Jersey, Virginia, New Mexico and Indiana are asking for repair money after they sustained over a quarter-billion dollars in damage.

Over 17 days, 120,000 evacuees were taken to the U.S. amid the deadly, botched withdrawal that saw Afghanistan fall under Taliban control.

NEW MODEL TO ENLIST REGULAR AMERICANS TO RESETTLE REFUGEES

""A description of the damages from Air Force officials explained that the damage by guests was unrepairable,"" the Pentagon report reads.

""Air Force officials described tables, chairs and cots broken by guests and tents and cots ruined by spray paint, human biological matter and holes,"" it continues .

""The Air Force described materials as 'completely depleted, such that no materials remain available for other real world missions,'"" it adds.

Some of the damage to the buildings left them unusable for the military until the plumbing and walls are repaired.

""DoD installations reported that facilities and equipment were overused, damaged and remained in various degrees of disrepair, resulting in a costly maintenance effort,"" the report reads.

""DoD installations need to restore their facilities and equipment to a condition that enables them to conduct trainings, prepare for future events and return to normal base operations,"" it continues.

Some bases requested more money from the DOD than others. Fort Bliss in Texas, which housed 11,472 migrants, only asked for over half a million dollars in repair costs, while Fort McCoy in Wisconsin — which housed nearly the same number of refugees — asked for $145.6 million.

The DOD inspector general also raised questions about whether the money was solely being asked for repairs connected to housing evacuees.

In September, amid the system shock from the sheer number of evacuees headed to the U.S. from Afghanistan, the U.S. State Department, working with humanitarian organizations, turned to ordinary Americans to fill the gap. Neighbors, co-workers, faith groups and friends banded together in ""sponsor circles"" to help Afghans get settled in their communities.

They raised money and found the newcomers homes to rent, enrolled their children in schools, taught them how to open bank accounts and located the nearest mosques and stores selling halal meat.

Now the Biden administration is preparing to turn the experiment into a private-sponsorship program for refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and is asking organizations to team up with it to launch a pilot program by the end of 2022.

The move comes amid increasing pressure on President Biden, who vowed in a 2021 executive order to increase opportunities for Americans to resettle refugees and restore the U.S. as the world’s safe haven. The Trump administration decimated the refugee program, which traditionally tasks nine resettlement agencies with placing refugees in communities.

87,"US, Philippines announce new agreement to ramp up military presence amid China-Taiwan tensions","The United States intends to ramp up its military presence in the Philippines amid escalating tensions between China and the island of Taiwan, authorities for the U.S. and the Philippines announced Thursday.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has agreed to allow American military troops to be stationed at several bases on the Philippine islands to expand its presence in the region to ensure stability and to increase ""interoperability"" with regional allies.

Under the agreement, which was announced by the senior leaders at Camp Aguinaldo military headquarters in Manila, Philippines, U.S. forces will be granted access to four more Philippine military camps, giving them areas to provide troops, training and military resources as the countries look to deter an increasingly aggressive China.

During a joint press conference, Marcos commented on the ""complicated"" situation in the Pacific and said his country was reliant on the strength of the U.S. and the partnership between the two countries to prevent tensions from escalating into a potential military conflict.

DEFENSE SECRETARY AUSTIN 'SERIOUSLY DOUBTS' CHINA INVASION OF TAIWAN IS 'IMMINENT'

It is ""something we can only navigate properly with the help our allies and partners,"" he said.

Austin echoed these remarks, calling the Philippines ""a key and an important ally"" and said the American global policy was to continue strengthening this relationship in every way possible.

""And so from the defense perspective, we will continue to work together with our great partners to build and modernize your capability as well as increase our interoperability. So we are very, very happy to be here once again, and I look forward to a great discussion,"" the defense secretary said.

The Philippines and the U.S. also said in a joint statement that ""substantial"" progress has been made in projects at five Philippine military camps, where U.S. military personnel were earlier granted access by Filipino officials under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA.

""The EDCA is a key pillar of the US-Philippines alliance, which supports combined training, exercises, and interoperability between our forces,"" the U.S. and the Philippines said.

The joint statement continued: ""The addition of these new EDCA locations will allow more rapid support for humanitarian and climate-related disasters in the Philippines, and respond to other shared challenges.""

""The Philippine-US alliance has stood the test of time and remains ironclad,"" they added. ""We look forward to the opportunities these new sites will create to expand our cooperation together.""

Additional details concerning the location and size of additional Philippine camps where U.S. forces would be allowed to construct barracks, warehouses and hangars were not provided.

Austin noted the U.S. was not seeking a ""permanent"" presence at the bases.

Marcos Jr., who took office in June, has negotiated regional deterrence with leaders of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as China continues military operations in the Pacific.

China has also domineered waterways amid territorial disputes over the busy and resource-rich South China Sea.

Washington maintains no official claim over disputes in the South China Sea but has said it would defend against potential attacks on regional allies. President Biden said the U.S. would send troops to defend Taiwan, should China invade the semi-autonomous region, though the White House later refuted this statement.

The U.S. and most of the world recognize the One China Policy, which says Taiwan is not a country or independent of China. Instead, the policy says the democratic region falls exclusively under Chinese governance.

Del Toro said the Navy wasn’t ""quite there yet,"" but argued that the supply chain would be stressed if the conflict goes on for another six months.

""It’s obvious that … these companies have a substantial pipeline for the future,"" Del Toro said. ""They now need to invest in their workforce, as well as the capital investments that they had to make within their own companies to get their production up.""

Later clarifying on his remarks, Del Toro said the Department of Defense has been working ""very, very closely"" with the industry ""to motivate them to find out what their challenges or obstacles are, to be able to increase their own production rates.""

The Washington Post reported that ""more than 500 retired U.S. military personnel — including scores of generals and admirals — have taken lucrative jobs since 2015 working for foreign governments, mostly in countries known for human rights abuses and political repression.""

Citing documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the report added that in Saudi Arabia alone, 15 retired U.S. generals and admirals have worked as paid consultants for the defense ministry – led by bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler — since 2016.

Those who reportedly work as paid advisers for Saudi Arabia include U.S. Marine Gen. James L. Jones, a national security adviser to former President Obama, and retired U.S. Army Gen. Keith Alexander, who led the National Security Agency under Obama and former President George W. Bush.

NEARLY 100 NAKED MIGRANTS FOUND AT GREECE-TURKEY BORDER, PROMPTING UN TO DEMAND PROBE

In October 2018, journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a contributor to the Post and a long-term resident of the U.S., was murdered in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says a team of 15 Saudi operatives were flown in to kill or capture Khashoggi. The operation was directly approved by bin Salman to crush dissenters.

Since Khashoggi’s killing, others who work for Saudi Arabia allegedly include a retired four-star Air Force general and a former commanding general of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Retired military personnel have also reportedly worked as civilian contractors for the United Arab Emirates and other Persian Gulf monarchies.

The Post pointed to Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s intervention in Yemen’s civil war, which United Nations investigators say resulted in human rights abuses and the deaths of thousands of civilians.

Congress permits retired troops and reservists to be employed by foreign governments if they first receive approval from their branch of the military and the State Department.

The Post sued the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps and the State Department in federal court under FOIA for records on the purported practice long kept hush-hush.

Following a two-year legal fight, The Post said it received more than 4,000 pages of documents, including case files for about 450 retired soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. Delivering the newspaper a win in September regarding pay package details, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta described the government’s privacy arguments as ""unconvincing,"" saying, ""the public has a right to know if high-ranking military leaders are taking advantage of their stations — or might be perceived to be doing so — to create employment opportunities with foreign governments in retirement.""

""The documents show that foreign governments pay handsomely for U.S. military talent, with salary and benefit packages reaching six and, sometimes, seven figures — far more than what most American service members earn while on active duty. At the top of the scale, active four-star generals earn $203,698 a year in basic pay,"" the Post reports.

""In comparison, the government of Australia has given consulting deals worth more than $10 million to several former senior U.S. Navy officials. A consulting firm owned by six retired Pentagon officials and military officers negotiated a $23.6 million contract with Qatar, a Persian Gulf sheikhdom that hosts a major U.S. air base, though the proposal later fell through. In Azerbaijan, a retired U.S. Air Force general was offered a consulting gig at a rate of $5,000 a day,"" according to the newspaper.

Besides retired general and admirals, records reportedly show other former enlisted personnel collect big.

""Saudi Arabia hired a former Navy SEAL to work as a special operations adviser for $258,000 a year,"" The Post reports. ""The UAE gave annual compensation packages worth more than $200,000 to helicopter pilots and $120,000 to aircraft mechanics. In Indonesia, a government-owned mining firm employed a retired U.S. Marine master sergeant as a transportation consultant at a rate of $500 a day, plus living expenses.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the State Department regarding the Post's investigation.

""Following review and approval from the applicant’s respective military service, the Department of State reviews applications for employment with a foreign government by reservists or military retirees in accordance with 37 U.S.C. § 908,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""We refer you to DoD for further details on the Foreign Government Employment process.""

In response to a Fox News Digital request for any information regarding the Post's investigation, a Department of Defense spokesperson said, ""As private U.S. citizens, retired service members are free to seek employment at their discretion. These individuals remain bound by the laws governing the non-disclosure of any non-public Government information; including: classified information, information they may have obtained through Federal employment, and other information protected by The Privacy Act.""

91,Chinese spy balloon enters US airspace: What we know,"The U.S. has detected a Chinese balloon craft currently flying over the United States, potentially sparking a major diplomatic incident ahead of a now-canceled visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing.

Here is what we know so far:

When was it detected?

The Pentagon announced on Thursday that it had detected the craft flying over the continental U.S. A State Department official said Friday that once it was detected the government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.

""The United States government has detected and is tracking a high-altitude surveillance balloon that is over the continental United States right now,""

TRUMP JOINS CALLS FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO ‘SHOOT DOWN’ SUSPECTED CHINESE SPY BALLOON

""The U.S. government including Norad, continues to track and monitor it closely. The balloon is currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,"" the Pentagon said on Thursday.

A well-placed senior U.S. official told Fox News that the government has been tracking the balloon for ""some time"" and said it entered U.S. airspace a ""couple of days ago."" It is currently over the state of Montana.

Beijing admits the craft is Chinese

The Chinese Communist regime on Friday admitted that the balloon was Chinese, but said that it is a civilian research craft that was blown far off course by prevailing winds.

It also said that it regrets the incident.

""The airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed Friday. ""Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course.""

GOP RIPS BIDEN AFTER SUSPECTED CHINESE SPY BALLOON FOUND FLOATING OVER THE US

""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure. The Chinese side will continue communicating with the US side and properly handle this unexpected situation caused by force majeure.""

Pentagon doubts the Chinese explanation

A senior defense official told Fox News that the balloon was launched from mainland China and the Pentagon does not believe that this was a weather balloon that flew off course.

""This was intentional,"" a senior U.S. official told Fox News.

Fox is told that it is a bold decision by the government to fly an aircraft over U.S. territory and the U.S. does no fly spy planes or balloons over mainland China.

U.S. does not shoot the balloon down, despite GOP calls

Some, including Republican lawmakers from Montana have called on the federal government to shoot the balloon down.

""SHOOT DOWN THE BALLOON,"" former wrote in a Friday morning post to Truth Social.

CHINA CONFIRMS BALLOON IS THEIRS, AS SPOKESPERSON CLAIMS IT IS CIVILIAN RESEARCH AIRSHIP

""Shoot down the balloon. Cancel Blinken’s trip. Hold China accountable,"" Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley wrote in a tweet. ""Biden is letting China walk all over us. It’s time to make America strong again.""

However, a senior U.S. official warned that the balloon is carrying heavy equipment and is the size of at least two school buses and would hit the ground at significant speed if shot down, raising the possibility of civilian casualties and other collateral damage.

So far the balloon is still in the air, at approximately 60,000 feet.

Blinken cancels trip to Beijing

Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to travel to Beijing this weekend to discuss the Russia-Ukraine war with Chinese officials and meet with President Xi.

Top Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee demanded that Blinken confront Xi over the spy balloon during his trip, calling it an ""unacceptable"" violation of U.S. airspace and American sovereignty.

Other Republicans went further, with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., saying, ""Secretary Blinken should cancel his trip to China.""

On Friday senior officials said that Blinken would not be attending in the wake of the balloon’s presence over the U.S.

92,US Army falls 25% short of recruiting goal,"The Army fell about 15,000 soldiers — or 25% — short of its recruitment goal this year, officials confirmed Friday, despite a frantic effort to make up the widely expected gap in a year when all the military services struggled in a tight jobs market to find young people willing and fit to enlist.

While the Army was the only service that didn't meet its target, all of the others had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry applicants, which will put them behind as they begin the next recruiting year on Saturday.

The worsening problem stirs debate about whether America’s fighting force should be restructured or reduced in size if the services can't recruit enough, and could also put added pressure on the National Guard and Reserve to help meet mission requirements.

According to officials, the Marine Corps, which usually goes into each fiscal year with as much as 50% of its recruiting goal already locked in, has only a bit more than 30%. And the Air Force and the Navy will only have about 10% of their goals as they start the new fiscal year. The Air Force usually has about 25%. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details on the recruiting totals that have not yet been released.

US ARMY FIRES JAVELIN ANTI-TANK MISSILES FROM ROBOTS IN KEY TECH TEST

""In the Army’s most challenging recruiting year since the start of the all-volunteer force, we will only achieve 75% of our fiscal year 22 recruiting goal,"" Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""The Army will maintain its readiness and meet all our national security requirements. If recruiting challenges persist, we will draw on the Guard and Reserve to augment active-duty forces, and may need to trim our force structure.""

Officials said the Army brought in about 45,000 soldiers during the fiscal year that ended Friday. The goal was 60,000.

The Air Force, meanwhile, was able to pull enough recruits from its delayed entry pool to exactly met its goal to bring in 26,151 recruits this year.

""Using Air Force lexicon, I would say we’re doing a dead stick landing as we come into the end of fiscal '22, and we’re going to need to turn around on the first of October and do an afterburner takeoff,"" Maj. Gen. Edward Thomas, head of the Air Force Recruiting Service, said at a conference last week. ""We’re going to be starting 2023 in a tougher position than we started 2022.""

NORTH CAROLINA SHOOTING LEAVES ARMY PARATROOPER DEAD

Military leaders used increased enlistment bonuses and other programs to try and build their numbers this year, but they say it's getting more and more difficult to compete with private industry in the tight labor market. And as they look to the future, they worry that if the declining enlistment trends continue, the Pentagon may have to reassess its force requirements and find ways to make the military a more attractive profession to the eroding number of young Americans who can meet mental and physical requirements for service.

Early this year, military leaders were already braced for a bad recruiting season. The Army, for example, announced several months ago that it would have to adjust the expected size of its total force this year from 476,000 to about 466,000. The large recruiting shortfall was offset a bit by the Army's ability to exceed its retention goal — keeping 104% of the targeted number of troops in the service.

The causes for the recruiting struggles are many and varied.

2 US MILITARY VETERANS AMONG 10 RELEASE BY RUSSIA-BACKED SEPARATISTS AS PART OF PRISONER EXCHANGE

Two years of the pandemic shut off recruiters' access to schools, public events, fairs and other youth organizations where they often find prospects. Moving to online recruiting — as in-person meetings closed down — was only marginally successful. And some of the in-person access has been slow to open up again.

At the same time, companies like McDonalds are now wooing workers with tuition benefits and other increased perks that for years made the military an attractive profession. Military leaders say that they are suffering from the same labor shortage that has restaurants, airlines, shops and other businesses desperately scraping for workers.

Exacerbating the problem is the fact that according to estimates, just 23% of young people can meet the military's fitness, educational and moral requirements — with many disqualified for reasons ranging from medical issues to criminal records and tattoos.

""We remain committed to maintaining our standards, investing in America’s youth, and emphasizing quality over quantity,"" Gen. James McConville, chief of staff of the Army said.

It's unclear how much the debate over the COVID-19 vaccine is playing in the recruiting struggles. So far, the Army has discharged a bit more than 1,700 soldiers for refusing to take the mandated vaccine. That's a tiny fraction of the overall force size.

At the same time, the patriotism that fueled the rush to military service in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks has dimmed. Some may look around and see no more wars and terrorists to fight so they look elsewhere. And others see lucrative hiring campaigns by private industry and know the salaries will be better than military pay, and they will be less likely to end up wounded or killed in those jobs.

The services are grappling with a number of new programs and other changes to beef up recruiting but face lingering questions about how best to convince young people that military life is a viable option for them.

During a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the recruiting challenges, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., challenged the services to ""think outside the box, creating new career paths, offering innovative pay and incentive structures, and realigning some capabilities from military to civilian workforces should all be on the table.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-army-falls-25-percent-short-recruiting-goal,N/A
93,Warning from US embassy in China signals lockdowns are likely to intensify amid protests,"The U.S. embassy in China released a statement Monday morning calling on U.S. citizens in the country to ""keep a 14-day supply of medications, bottled water, and food for yourself and any members of your household.""

""The People’s Republic of China (PRC) authorities have expanded COVID-19 prevention restrictions and control measures as outbreaks occur. These measures may include residential quarantines, mass testing, closures, transportation disruptions, lockdowns, and possible family separation. Ambassador Burns and other Mission officials have regularly raised our concerns on many of these issues directly with senior PRC officials and will continue to do so,"" the statement reads.

David Tafuri, a former State Department official and foreign policy adviser to the Obama campaign, says the State Department is trying to get ahead of the situation and prevent citizens from being caught up in a tense situation inside China.

PROTESTS RATTLE CHINA AS PEOPLE SAY ENOUGH TO COUNTRY'S DRACONIAN COVID LOCKDOWN POLICIES

""I think this is a message to U.S. citizens in China that the State Department believes the combination of further anti-COVID measures and a potential crackdown on protesters by China could result in further lockdowns and travel bans that could put U.S. citizens at risk for arrest if they leave their homes,"" Tafuri said.

Tumultuous protests broke out in several Chinese cities over the country's ""zero-COVID"" policy and a deadly fire in a high-rise building that cost 10 people their lives.

The building, located in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, had been in partial lockdown for nearly two months.

CHINESE POLICE GET VIOLENT AS COVID-19 LOCKDOWN PROTESTS SWEEP ACROSS THE COUNTRY

Miles Yu, a senior fellow and director of the China Center at Hudson Institute, told Fox News Digital that the burning death of 10 people was a trigger for social uprisings, making them different from previous ones in the country.

""The previous [protests] are mostly people from the lower part of the social stratification — that is, the migrant workers. They are the social dispossessed. This time primarily is led by what you might call middle-class people who own properties,"" said Yu. He added that the recent protests ""have a much broader base on the society.""

CHINA REPORTS RECORD NUMBER OF NEW DAILY CORONAVIRUS CASES IN BEIJING, OTHER CITIES

Tafuri says that ""it’s very rare for there to be protests in mainland China over human rights, so this is worth watching to see if it catches on and results in sustained civil disobedience and demands for China to improve human rights.""

Videos posted online showed police attacking and carrying away some protesters, but there seems to be no immediate response from President Xi Jinping or the Chinese Communist Party.

Tafuri predicts that the demonstration might result in some minor concessions by the CCP, but ""ultimately, China is a police state with more than sufficient means and resources to put down these protests. My guess is that they will crack down on them before they let them spread further.""

Yu warns that ""it could be dangerous because it could give the protesters a false sense of triumph and so on … also it [could] lead the Chinese government to gather its strength and marshal means or assets.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/warning-us-embassy-china-signals-lockdowns-are-likely-intensify-amid-protests,N/A

The court found Monday that ""being vaccinated does not prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting COVID-19."" New York City Mayor Eric Adams claimed earlier this year that his administration would not rehire employees who had been fired over their vaccination status.

NYC fired roughly 1,700 employees for being unvaccinated earlier this year after the city adopted a vaccine mandate under former Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Many of those fired were police officers and firefighters.

NYC MAYOR OFFICIAL EXEMPTS ATHLETES, PERFORMERS FROM COVID VAX MANDATE

FDNY-Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro and FDNY-Uniformed Fire Officers Association President Lt. James McCarthy condemned Adams earlier this year after the mayor allowed an exception to the vaccine mandate for athletes and performers, even as firefighters were still being fired over their status. The pair called on the city to expand the exception to all New Yorkers.

""We're here to say that we support the revocation of the vaccine mandate that the mayor announced on Thursday,"" McCarthy said. ""We think that it should be extended as well.

""This launch showcases the redundancy and reliability of our strategic deterrence systems while sending a visible message of assurance to allies,"" said Col. Christopher Cruise, 377th Test and Evaluation Group commander.

""This multilateral team reflects the precision and professionalism of our command, and our joint partners,"" Cruise added.

The test launch comes days after the U.S. government shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina. The balloon, which traveled across the continental United States before it was taken out, has been linked to a surveillance program run by the People's Republic of China military.

It also follows a show of force from North Korea's military, which paraded up to 12 individual Hwasong-17 ICBM launchers, Politico reported.

Officials said the launch was planned months in advance across multiple Air Forces agencies.

Bernstein emphasized Sunday that while inflation and gas prices are still a concern, they declined over the past year, which he attributed to actions from Biden.

Politico reports, citing various sources familiar with the issue, that U.S. officials told NATO allies during a closed-door meeting that an upgraded B61-12 air-dropped gravity bomb initially scheduled to be transported to Europe next Spring, will now arrive this December.

Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told the outlet the ""modernization of US B61 nuclear weapons has been underway for years and plans to safely and responsibly swap out older weapons for the upgraded B61-12 versions is part of a long-planned and scheduled modernization effort.""

""It is in no way linked to current events in Ukraine and was not sped up in any way,"" he said of the process, but not the accelerated timeline.

The B61 nuclear gravity bomb was first entered into the service in 1968 and has undergone multiple modifications, including improvements to its safety, security, and reliability in recent years.

The latest life extension program replaced old models to be more accurate and compatible with newer aircraft, according to the National Nuclear Security Administration, which falls under the Department of Energy.

""The B61-12 LEP is refurbishing, reusing, or replacing all of the bomb’s nuclear and non-nuclear components to extend the service life by at least 20 years,"" the NNSA said in December last year.

""The B61-12 LEP is critical to sustaining the Nation’s air-delivered nuclear deterrent capability. It will be air-delivered in either ballistic gravity or guided drop modes and is being certified for delivery on current strategic aircraft (B-2A) and dual capable aircraft (F-15E, F-16C/D & MLU, PA-200) as well as future aircraft platforms."",

""The number of deaths on the United States-Mexico border last year is significantly higher than in any year prior, even before COVID-19,"" Edwin Viales, author of the report, said. ""Yet, this number remains an undercount due to the diverse challenges for data collection.""
