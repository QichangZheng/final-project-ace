DC crime engulfs local news after city council voted to lower sentences for criminal conduct,"Washington, D.C., saw a bleak start to the new year with violent crimes plastered across the front pages of local news after the city council voted to lessen sentences for some criminal conduct.

In a 12-1 vote, the D.C. Council voted last Tuesday to override Mayor Muriel Bowser's decision to veto a gigantic remodeling to the city's criminal code.

The overhaul of the city's criminal code includes:

Reduced maximum sentences.

The elimination of nearly all mandatory minimum sentences.

Expanded rights to jury trials by those accused of misdemeanors.

Opponents of the new provisions have expressed concern over a rule allowing Washington inmates to ask for early release 20 years into their sentence, even those accused of violent crimes, including murder.

DC DEMOCRAT FIGHTS OWN PARTY OVER VIOLENT CRIME RESPONSE: 'TRULY PUZZLING'

On Monday, the top local stories in the Post all related to crime, including a man fatally shot at a metro station, another man shot in a building, two people found dead following a fire and a body was found just two blocks from the White House.

NBC4 News' top stories also included the recent local shootings and a story about a city police officer stabbed in the face.

ABC 7's top local stories included fentanyl overdoses, a call to hire more police officers to address a rise in illegally parked cars, a woman arrested after assaulting a police officer and a shooting.

Washington, D.C., already began the new year with a slew of serious crimes before the city council's decision.

WASHINGTON, D.C. MAN WHO HELPED PASS CRIMINAL CODE OVERHAUL SHOT AND KILLED

Washington police statistics show that compared to this time in 2022, thefts from cars are up 30%, and car thefts are up 113%. Robberies have increased by 57%, and overall property crimes, such as burglary and arson, have risen 42% over the same time last year.

A shooting outside the Navy Yard Metro station on Jan. 7 was one of six for the first week of the year, bringing first-week homicide numbers to twice that of the first week of 2021.

Carjackings in the city increased 46% in April 2022 versus the same time in 2021.

Homicides and severe assaults in 2022 dropped from 2021; however, juveniles were more likely to be victims of violent crimes than in years prior.

SWEEPING DC CRIMINAL CODE OVERHAUL PASSED BY COUNCILMEMBERS

Bowser vetoed the Revised Criminal Code Act earlier this month after the council, which lacks a single Republican member, voted unanimously to adopt it in November.

D.C. City Council's Tuesday decision sends the bill to Congress, where federal lawmakers will have 60 days to review it.

If enacted, the revisions will go into effect in 2025.

"Gianno Caldwell rips soft-on-crime policies in Chicago, NYC: Even liberals know 'this has gone too far'","Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell, whose brother was recently killed in Chicago, said Friday that liberal district attorneys have ""gone too far"" and criminals no longer fear punishments.

Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City and other U.S. cities are consumed in crime as homicide, assault, robbery and other violent crimes reach alarming rates.

""Across the country, whether it be Los Angeles or San Francisco… even liberals are recognizing that these progressive policies are endangering the lives of their families and friends,"" Caldwell argued on ""The Faulkner Focus"" Friday.

JULY 4TH VIOLENCE: US CITIES REPORT DOZENS OF SHOOTINGS, DEATHS

New York City was rocked this week by the news of the fatal stabbing of Austin Simon by local bodega worker Jose Alba. Many have criticized the murder charges saying it was an act of self-defense after Simon berated and pushed Alba behind the counter of a Manhattan deli.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg faced calls to resign prior to this incident, and critics argue his soft-on-crime policies are enabling more aggressive activity and prompting civilians to take their defense into their own hands.

""We have years of a woke progressive D.A.,"" New York City councilman Joe Borelli said on ""Fox & Friends"" Friday. ""And the net result is that we have lawlessness in this city where people who are doing their job working day in and day out feel they have no recourse from the justice system, from the police department, and they're forced to take matters into their own hands.""

In addition to New York City, Chicago has also been a hub for increased crime. Caldwell's brother, Christian, was murdered in Chicago, and there has been little effort toward justice for the 18-year-old. Caldwell said he reached out to Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office but has not received a response about the case.

FOX NEWS ANALYST GIANNO CALDWELL REMEMBERS BROTHER, 18, FATALLY SHOT IN CHICAGO: ‘ALL I WANT…IS JUSTICE’

""[Criminals] don't fear the police. They don't fear being charged,"" Caldwell argued. ""And that's the sentiment that continues to ring true here in the city of Chicago. And this has caused my little brother to be murdered in the city that I grew up in and the city that I love.""

Chicago has seen a 34% increase in criminal activity while New York City saw a 31% increase since last June. Liberal district attorneys across the country are facing growing pressure to resign or face a recall vote as criminal activity surges.

"Houston-area crime wave being fueled by policies of Democratic county leader, says GOP challenger","EXCLUSIVE - A heated race is underway in the Houston area pitting Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo against Republican challenger Alexandra del Moral Mealer, who told Fox News Digital the Democratic incumbent's policies have contributed to a crime wave in the city.

The West Point graduate and Harvard JD/MBA touted her plan to combat crime, support law enforcement and criticized her opponent's record on coronavirus restrictions and alleged corruption within her office.

""Houston has always been that great American city. We just need to go back to the fundamentals of good governance,"" Mealer said.

HOUSTON CRIME STOPPERS ENDS ANNUAL READING OF MURDER VICTIMS NAMES: ‘CAN’T DO THAT ANYMORE… WOULD TAKE HOURS

Mealer said the ""egregious COVID response"" and the rise in crime initially inspired her to run for county judge.

""My toddler was masked and this wasn't my choice as a parent.""

Mealer blamed Hidalgo for her role in bail reforms, which she argued are contributing to the rise in crime by letting repeat offenders return to the streets.

""What we've done to the criminal justice system, we have instituted the most radical version of bail reform, where in Harris County for misdemeanors, the majority of people don't even see a judge. Lina's the person that took away that discretion.""

Mealer described what is behind the crime wave as a twofold issue that is ""legal and financial.""

""Over 80 percent of law enforcement funding requests have been denied,"" said Mealer.

""Now the county has seen a 65 percent rise in homicides,"" she added, describing how this has taken a toll on law enforcement in the county.

Mealer said there is ""low morale"" among law enforcement in the third-most populous county in the United States.

""If you're not keeping pace with that crime wave, you really have an overworked, overstressed, overburdened law enforcement,"" said Mealer.

""We have federal courtroom monitors in our courts right now. We are the only county that has something called general order bonds. You actually don't see a judge,"" said Mealer. ""We just say a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor and there are no consequences.""

TEXAS MURDER SUSPECTS OUT ON BOND ARRESTED FOR KILLING OF HOUSTON DEPUTY, AUTHORITIES SAY

Mealer pointed to the number of murders committed by suspects who were let out on bond. Victims' advocates said there were 156 such killings from 2018-2021.

Additionally, Mealer provided a plan to combat crime and touted her endorsements from ""every law enforcement organization."" She said that there has been a lot of funding for public safety under Hidalgo's administration, but not enough funding for police and discussed a plan to hire 1,000 law enforcement officers.

Mealer said public safety entails to the Hidalgo administration includes ""social workers, streetlights and bike trails"", but not enough funding for full-time law enforcement positions.""

According to Texas constable Glenn Hegar, in 2022, aggravated assaults in Harris County increased by 11%, and murder and manslaughter have increased by 24% compared to 2020.

Hidalgo faced accusations from Hegar, Gov. Greg Abbott and other state Republicans in recent months of trying to defund law enforcement in the county.

Hegar said the decision to end rollover savings, where funds leftover from one fiscal year would automatically roll over to the next, resulted in more than $3 million being taken away from the Constables Office.

TEXAS' HARRIS COUNTY HAS MORE THAN 700K OPEN MURDER WARRANTS, 25K OPEN FELONY WARRANTS: REPORT

Abbott said in a statement that the loss of resources would ""endanger public safety.""

""Harris County continues to show complete negligence for public safety, as the same county whose revolving door bail program releases dangerous criminals back onto the streets to commit more violent crimes like murder.""

Mealer pushed back on the decision, accusing Hidalgo of operating under ""anything but"" transparency.

""When you have crime and the level of violence we do, I don't understand why you wouldn't want to increase resourcing. And what we've seen is really this anemic funding at best,"" said Mealer.

Hidalgo denied that she attempted to defund law enforcement, touting budget increases for law enforcement during her tenure.

""We're about two months away from my re-election, and they're throwing everything—including outright lies—at the wall to see what sticks,"" she said in August.

Joe Gamaldi, vice president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said Hidalgo's tenure has been ""nothing short of horrific"" as Houston's crime surge has mirrored other big American cities.

""Under her leadership, or lack thereof, murders in Harris County have spiked to the tune of 65%,"" said Gamaldi, calling liberal bail reform policies ""an unmitigated disaster.""

""Now, in another blatant attempt to harm law enforcement, she is cutting much-needed roll-over funding, which will lead to less officers on the streets, when we need them the most, and only exacerbate the violent crime wave in Harris County. All the while she refuses to debate her opponent in November on these issues. It is despicable and the people of Harris County deserve better.""

Hidalgo's office was also rocked by a corruption scandal in April when two of her former aides and her chief of staff were named in felony indictments in connection with an investigation into an $11 million contract for COVID-19 outreach. The three men were charged with misuse of official information and tampering with records.

Nancy Pelosi says NY Democrats whiffed on crime: 'The governor didn’t realize soon enough',"Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the New York Times that the Democrats wouldn't have lost the House if New York politicians recognized that crime was a top issue in the state.

Pelosi also said in an interview with New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd that Gov. Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., did not realize the crime issue ""soon enough.""

""That is an issue that had to be dealt with early on, not 10 days before the election,"" Pelosi told the New York Times. ""The governor didn’t realize soon enough where the trouble was.""

Hochul defeated Republican Lee Zeldin in the state's gubernatorial race in November after Zeldin gained some ground and made crime in New York a key issue for his campaign.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CLASHES WITH GOV. KATHY HOCHUL OVER CRIME IN NEW YORK: ‘WE DON’T FEEL SAFE'

Hochul claimed Zeldin was trying to scare people on crime ahead of the November midterm elections and said it was part of the Republican playbook.

She also called Republicans ""master manipulators"" on crime and claimed the GOP was pushing a ""conspiracy"" with the crime issue.

""These are master manipulators. They have this conspiracy going all across America trying to convince people that in Democratic states that they’re not as safe. Well guess what? They’re also not only election deniers, they’re data deniers,"" she said in November.

Hochul acknowledged a crime problem days later and said she had been working on crime throughout her time as governor.

Dowd also asked Pelosi if she believed the president, who would be 86 at the end of his term, should make way for new leadership as well.

The former House speaker said that President Biden had done a great job but added that age was not a ""positive thing"" for him.

New York crime wave: GOP gov nominee Lee Zeldin says first act will be firing Alvin Bragg,"After the Empire State's crime wave got right up to his Shirley, N.Y. home, Republican gubernatorial nominee Lee Zeldin doubled down on his plan to quash the criminality running rampant in New York.

Zeldin, currently a Republican congressman on Long Island, told Fox News on Monday he would immediately fire New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg, one of several high-profile DAs linked to left-wing billionaire George Soros that are viewed as soft-on-crime.

In New York City, where only one county – Richmond – has had a Republican district attorney within the last several decades, crime has spiraled out of control, Zeldin said.

The lawmaker and candidate also blamed his opponent, Democratic Gov. Kathleen Hochul – who ascended to the post upon the resignation of Andrew M. Cuomo – for failing to take action against the crime spree.

""I'm not in this race to come in second. I'm all-in. I'm over 18 months into this race, campaigning all throughout this entire state. One of the reasons why I got into the race was because of these pro-criminal laws that have been getting passed out of Albany,"" Zeldin said, a day after two individuals were shot in a suspected gang hit within mere feet of his twin daughters inside their home doing homework.

One victim was under Zeldin's porch and another in nearby bushes, the lawmaker said.

Zeldin and his wife had been away in Morris Park, Bronx participating in the borough's Columbus Day parade when the incident occurred at their home.

Zeldin told Fox News that Suffolk County authorities believe his home nor his family were an intended target, and that politics were not involved in the shooting incident.

He went on to criticize Bragg and Hochul's respective purported roles in allowing crime to spiral out of control in New York, viewed only a few years ago as one of the safest large cities in America, under mayors like Republican Rudolph Giuliani.

""From cashless bail to less is more releasing people early from prison. The HALT Act, which has resulted our correctional officers and other prison staff being assaulted more since the April 1st implementation. We've seen it with district attorneys like Alvin Bragg refusing to enforce the law, the defund movement, targeting our law enforcement,"" Zeldin added.

""I believe that Albany needs to break this one party rule, have a balance of power, start unapologetically backing our men and women in law enforcement again, giving judges discretion away dangerousness.""

He concluded by citing the gubernatorial ""constitutional authority"" to dispatch with elected prosecutors in any of the state's 62 counties.

""And that's what that's why I say my first action, the first day I'm in office is, turning to the Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, to let him know he's being fired,"" Zeldin said, accusing the Democrat of repeatedly failing to enforce laws on-the-books.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-crime-wave-gop-gov-nominee-lee-zeldin-first-act-firing-alvin-bragg,N/A
NYC crime surge leaves former NY gov 'extremely worried' businesses will flee 'frightened' city,"Former Democrat New York Gov. David Paterson expressed concern Wednesday that surging crime in New York City is driving businesses out of the Big Apple.

Paterson joined ""America's Newsroom"" to discuss the city's crime crisis after a man went on an ax-wielding rampage inside a Manhattan McDonald’s over the weekend.

""I'm extremely worried about that. Businesses are closing. Businesses are locking up all the supplies,"" Paterson said.

""You would think you were going into Fort Knox when you go into a Rite Aid.""

CRIME, EMPLOYEE SHORTAGES FORCE NYC TO RAMP UP SURVEILLANCE, SOME BUSINESSES TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS

The city has seen a 34% increase in total crime since 2020 with robbery up 38%, burglary up 32% and assault up 18%, according to the New York City Police Department.

Paterson argued the COVID-19 lockdowns were a major contributor to an increase in criminal activity among young people.

""This is the reaction that we feared… they had no school to go to. They had no park to go to,"" Paterson said. ""They had no place else to go but into negative situations like gangs and crimes.""

With crime a foremost issue ahead of the midterm elections, leaders are eager to address the issue and find policies to get control of rampant criminal activity.

LEE ZELDIN ON RISING CRIME: NEW YORKERS ARE HITTING THEIR BREAKING POINT

""We have to take back our streets,"" New York GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin said on ""Fox & Friends."" ""Our streets should belong to law-abiding New Yorkers instead of being turned over to criminals.""

While Paterson disputes Zeldin's push to repeal cashless bail, he acknowledged the need for stronger penalties to keep repeat offenders off the street and send a message to criminals.

""There really isn't that many people who are committing the crimes, it's just they're committing so many of them,"" Paterson said.

Seattle reverses course on defunding police as crime ravages locals: 'A huge crisis',"Seattle residents Victoria Beach, Eli Hoshor and Jonathan Choe said police shortages have left their city in dire straits in the aftermath of officials' anti-law enforcement rhetoric.

Homicides skyrocketed by 24% while motor vehicle thefts climbed by 30% in the city last year. Overall crime ticked up by 4%.

Mayor Bruce Harrell pushed for increased police presence to curb the issue Tuesday, saying, ""We need immediate action and innovation to respond to our public safety issues… Seattle saw a 4% rise in reported crime last year… We need more officers to address our staffing crisis.""

Still, some residents' outlook is less than optimistic.

OPINION: SEATTLE'S CRIME SURGE SPREADS STATEWIDE THANKS TO DEMOCRATS' PROGRESSIVE POLICIES

""Right now, I don't have a lot of hope,"" Beach told Todd Piro Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends First.""

""I think the mayor is on the right track, but Seattle is in a huge crisis. Our city has been destroyed, and we're not going to get it back anytime soon,"" she added.

Beach said she agrees that the city needs more police to help cut back on crime, saying the situation is currently a ""free for all.""

""If you want to commit a crime, move to Seattle,"" she said.

SEATTLE HOMICIDES ROSE PRECIPITOUSLY IN 2020 AS LIBERAL LEADERS DEMANDED POLICE BE DEFUNDED

Piro reported data from Seattle's city's budget office showing funding for law enforcement increased for the first time since a major slash was made in 2020.

Hoshor, another resident, says the uptick is not enough to reduce crime.

""The crime is just getting worse and worse,"" he said. ""There's a homeless encampment that's right next to my son's school that's been there for over a year, and it's doubled and tripled in size.

SEATTLE TIMES COLUMNIST IRKS PROGRESSIVE READERS WITH FOCUS ON SOARING CRIME AFTER GOVERNMENT DEFUNDED POLICE

""It's ridiculous that that's even possible.""

Choe, a reporter from the area, slammed the ""Defund the Police"" movement for being behind the crime rise as well as the ""woke"" activist class who he said are perpetuating the problem.

""[It's] a failed social experiment,"" he told Piro. ""They're still standing by this and doubling down on it…""

He added that seeing how ""Defund the Police"" supporters respond to Harrell's push for more police and the uptick in funding for the department should be ""interesting.""

Seattle Times columnist irks progressive readers with focus on soaring crime after government defunded police,"A liberal Seattle Times columnist says he's annoyed some of his readers with a relentless focus on rising crime in the city and other disastrous consequences after its government defunded police in 2020, but he's sticking with it because the facts are the facts.

Danny Westneat noted Saturday a ""share of readers"" felt his focus on crime had been akin to ""poverty porn,"" as though he was ""exaggerating fears in a blue city to make liberals, or liberal policy goals, look bad.""

""But both violent and property crimes really are up markedly — to the highest levels citywide in Seattle in more than two decades. Through July, property crime is up 25% compared with two years ago. Violent crime is rising still faster, up 35%. Shootings are up 100%,"" he noted.

Westneat contrasted Seattle's approach to Denver, which increased spending on police for its 2022 budget and created a new program called STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) to have social workers respond to crimes without violence or weapons, and saw a corresponding decrease in such crimes. However, more serious crimes continued apace.

SEATTLE BAR SHOOTING CAUGHT ON CAMERA AS VIOLENT CRIME PLAGUES CITY

""It looks like we still need the cops,"" he wrote.

Fox News Digital reported last week on the surge in homicides and shootings in Seattle after the municipal government slashed the police budget in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. The increase in crime has been accompanied by police staffing shortages, and the deep-blue city – Joe Biden won 75 percent of the vote in Seattle's King County in 2020 – saw voters last year elect more centrist candidate over liberal, pro-defund the police ones for mayor, city council and city attorney.

Seattle became a subject of national scorn when its police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) in the downtown area in 2020 became a nest of violence, danger and vandalism.

Seattle's crime issues have thus dominated Westneat's opinion pieces on issues affecting Seattle and the Puget Sound. Last week, he highlighted the closing of an Amazon Go store in 2020 for safety reasons, in a part of downtown Seattle now beset by violent crimes. He argued it showed both a need for more police and social workers.

SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNER CALLS FOR ACTION AGAINST CRIME CRISIS AFTER TWO BREAK-INS: ‘YOUVE GOT TO HAVE POLICE’

In June, he put a spotlight on the struggles of Seattle police responding promptly to 911 calls.

""Now, with police ranks depleted, and at least a portion of Seattle’s political class hostile to the idea of policing, they seem to be instituting white-flag waving as a regular part of the system,"" he wrote.

That same month, one of his columns was headlined, ""The awkwardness of a liberal city awash in guns,"" where he identified as being on the political left and wondered how Seattle could handle the rising black market of weapons without more police. He added he always gets ""progressive pushback"" for talking about rising crime.

""I realize it’s awkward for Seattle and the liberal project right now that crime here is soaring. But it is. Acting like it isn’t is no better than when right-wingers in Idaho pretended last year that their hospitals weren’t triaging medical care,"" he wrote, adding, ""How are we liberals going to go after guns if we also instinctively oppose sending police after them?""

""Seattle’s botched experiment with defund the police keeps getting worse,"" reads a headline from June 4, that talked about the ""tailspin"" of police since the 2020 budget cuts and an ensuing parking ticket refund fiasco. Sexual assault cases, he added, weren't being investigated due to understaffing.

JASON RANTZ: ‘I FEAR WE’RE IN FOR A SUMMER OF HISTORIC VIOLENCE' DUE TO LIBERAL CRIME POLICIES

""Violent crime is doing a lot more than not slowing down – it’s escalating, in rapid and unusual ways that Seattle seems unprepared for, despite a renewed focus on fighting it,"" he wrote April 6. In February, he noted the spike in aggravated assaults in the city that demanded a strong law enforcement response.



Westneat didn't reply to a request for comment.

Seattle radio host Jason Rantz wasn't surprised the columnist had experienced pushback for his writings.

""Whenever anyone – left, right or center – even slightly criticizes an approach or policy adopted by Seattle's progressive activists, it generates outrage,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Seattle progressives operate as bullies, silencing opposition and ensuring that they get their way. It's why we keep seeing such massive failures on crime, homelessness, drug addition and cost of living. Residents see and experience Seattle deteriorating but are terrified to say anything.""

Texas salon owners consider closing shop after crime crisis leaves them waiting up 'to an hour' for police,"Texas salon owners Laura North and Erin Mutschler said the crime crisis in Austin is making them consider closing shop. But, unsure of where to turn if they lose their livelihood, they continue to weigh their next steps.

""[Crime] is plaguing our entire city,"" Mutschler told Ashley Strohmier Monday on ""Fox & Friends First.""

Moving anywhere within the city would be expensive for the duo, who said relocating wouldn't be ""cost-effective"" for their small business.

Still, North said facing four years of disturbances – which she noted have escalated within the last six months – continues to wreak havoc on the property and drive away customers.

""It comes and goes in waves. Sometimes it gets cleaned up, and it gets a little better, but I would say definitely the last six months are the worst that we've seen,"" she said.

One incident caught on camera showed a man charging the storefront with a pole as the shop owners waited for police to arrive.

""This was the third incident we'd had just that week,"" North said. ""We'd started to see this man acting kind of erratically in our parking lot. People were starting to get frightened, so we asked him to leave politely. When we asked him to do that, he actually charged Erin, and she ran inside and began to call the police, and it just escalated from there.""

""I couldn't put a number on the amount of times we've had to call them in just the last year,"" North told Strohmier. ""It usually takes them anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour to arrive when we make multiple phone calls for threatening incidents like this.""

"WaPo skewers Mayor Bowser's ‘unclear’ crime policies after NFL player shot, DC crimes increase '89%'","After the Sunday night carjacking and shooting of Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr., who is currently hospitalized for his injuries, Washington Post reporters Emily Davies and Omari Daniels wrote a piece criticizing D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's crime policies, especially after she vowed to disrupt criminal activity in the city.

The report noted that it is ""unclear"" how Bowser’s policy to cut crime in the district is working, considering that the high-profile NFL player was shot, and that ""violent crime is up 89 percent"" in parts of the city.

Published Monday, the piece opened with Bowser’s explicit ambitions to stop crime in her city juxtaposed with the current state of crime in Washington, D.C. It read, ""Two months after D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser launched a program to disrupt ‘patterns of violence’ at three city nightlife hubs, a Washington Commanders running back was shot and injured during an armed robbery on one of those thoroughfares.""

Naming the NFL player and describing the grisly incident, the report noted, ""Brian Robinson Jr., who was on track to earn a significant role in the upcoming season, was attacked in broad daylight Sunday in the heart of the H Street corridor, a 1½-mile stretch in Northeast Washington full of popular restaurants and bars.""

WAPO COLUMN QUOTES EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS WHO SAY AMERICA IS 'SHORTHAND FOR DEMOCRATIC DECLINE AND DISINFORMATION'

The authors added that ""The shooting has drawn national attention to gun violence in D.C. and raised questions about whether the city is doing enough to keep its residents safe — including in the areas where officials have invested additional resources to curb crime.""

The piece explained that the carjacking and shooting of Robinson Jr. is part of a crime rate that has nearly doubled in the H Street corridor. ""Along the H Street corridor, violent crime is up 89 percent compared with the same time last year, according to data provided by the city.""

Further detailing this crime wave, Davies and Daniels wrote, ""Robberies, including carjackings, are up more than 100 percent, from 13 at this time in 2021 to 28 so far this year. And there have been eight reported assaults with a dangerous weapon — an increase from five at this time in 2021.""

The report turned back to Bowser’s ""plan"" to keep residents safe. ""In June, not long after a 15-year-old was killed and three others wounded in a shooting at an event in the U Street area, Bowser (D) told residents that she had a plan to keep them safe in the busiest entertainment hubs.""

This included her vow to ""station teams of police officers, transportation officials and other agency employees on H Street, Connecticut Avenue and the U Street corridor on weekend nights through Labor Day.""

However, the piece declared, ""Two months later, the effectiveness of that strategy is unclear. The mayor’s nightlife teams, which are in service from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, were not active when Robinson was shot.""

Robinson Jr. wasn’t even the only person attacked in the area that evening. The Post reported that he was ""one of three people shot at or stabbed this weekend along the H Street corridor, police said.""

And local residents told the paper ""that they have come to expect occasional violence in their neighborhood and that the events of the weekend did not seem particularly unusual.""

Though the deputy mayor for public safety Christopher Geldart implied city officials are doing their best keeping crime at bay, stating, ""There are going to be times when incidents do happen. But I do believe the strategies we have in place and what we have been able to show in our U Street, H Street and Connecticut Avenue corridors have been a success.""

WASHINGTON POST EDITOR DENIES ANY DONALD TRUMP, HILLARY CLINTON DOUBLE STANDARD

Other critics of Bowser’s policies slammed the mayor after the attack on Robinson. Conservative commentator Greg Price wrote, ""Washington Commanders running back Brian Robinson was just shot in an attempted carjacking on H Street in DC. DC has become a crime-ridden cesspool and Muriel Bowser is too busy denying an education to half the city's black children to stop it.""

He urged the mayor, ""Fix your damn city @MayorBowser.""

Breitbart reporter Jacob Bliss partially blamed Bowser for the shooting, tweeting, ""Another shooting just a few blocks from my apartment under Democrat mayor @MurielBowser.""

America's crime problem is real. Tackling it requires respect for cops,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In law enforcement, our most fundamental duty is to ensure people can live free from fear—a task that has become more challenging over the past few years. FBI crime statistics released in October showed that in 2021, for the second year in a row, violent crime remained at alarmingly high levels. From conversations I routinely have with police chiefs and sheriffs every week, those violent crime trends have continued throughout 2022.

The top concern I hear from local law enforcement leaders is gang and gun violence — whether it’s gangs terrorizing a community, juveniles graduating from carjackings to even worse violence, or traffickers moving drugs through a neighborhood and inundating it with crime. Even major corporations are seeing the same thing and are having to make difficult decisions about where they operate.

While the specific drivers can be as varied and diverse as the communities we serve, in far too many instances, we’re seeing repeat or dangerous offenders end up back on the streets. For hardworking law enforcement officers, the only thing more frustrating than having to arrest a violent criminal who should be behind bars is having to arrest that same person over and over again.

The men and women of law enforcement are working tirelessly to tackle the threat. In 2022, across the nation, the FBI with our partners arrested more than 20,000 violent criminals and child predators – an average of 55 per day, every day. In the process, we seized more than 9,600 guns from those criminals, cut into the capabilities of 3,500 gangs and violent criminal enterprises and completely dismantled 370 more – arresting their leadership and seizing their assets.

US MURDER RATE CONTINUED GRIM CLIMB IN 2021, NEW FBI ESTIMATES SHOW

These efforts and others like them are making a real difference in communities plagued by violence and drugs, but the numbers and our lived experiences make clear there’s a lot more work to do. And at the FBI, we’re committed to working with our state and local partners to leverage our resources to combat these stubborn rates of homicides, carjackings and non-fatal shootings.

The answer is, of course, not to cut resources from over-worked, under-resourced departments. As it is, police departments and sheriffs’ offices across the country are struggling to recruit officers to replace those they’ve lost in recent years to a wave of retirements and resignations. Policing is already a tough job, and it’s even tougher when departments with fewer hands to do the work have to make hard decisions about how to prioritize their limited resources. On top of that, the job is becoming more and more dangerous at a time when officers are being called to take on increasingly complex challenges. In 2022, an average of one brave law enforcement officer was feloniously killed in the line of duty nearly every six days, marking the third-highest total in more than 20 years.

For our part, the FBI is working shoulder-to-shoulder with our state and local law enforcement partners through more than 300 violent crime task forces made up of close to 3,000 members. Through these task forces, we’ve built a strong and resilient ship capable of sailing through any storm. We're using intelligence to drive proactive investigations to identify and target the most violent offenders. And we’re working to build capacity and deploy additional resources to some of the hardest-hit cities where that support is most needed.

Based on past successes in lowering violent crime, we know what works. It takes law enforcement agencies sharing intelligence and resources to dismantle the worst gangs and take — and keep — the most violent offenders off the streets. It means steering young offenders away from violence before they move on to more serious offenses. And it requires law enforcement agencies to better engage with the communities we serve to earn their trust and cooperation.

The campus crime surge colleges don't tell parents about,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

""RUN, HIDE, OR FIGHT"" screamed the headlines, regarding a recent shooting near NYU’s Brooklyn campus. The quote was culled from an urgent text school officials broadcast to students during the incident.

Which must’ve felt all-too familiar to many; as reported by NYU’s own student newspaper, a month earlier a woman was shot dead in front of one of the school’s dorms (University Hall, $17,908 a year for a shared double).

It’s not just NYU. Across the country, as urban crime rates rise and woke prosecutors pursue illusory ""criminal justice reforms,"" a wave of violence has beset some of our nation’s premier universities. It’s a phenomenon playing out in headlines around the nation – but which has gained little media notice.

SLAIN UCLA STUDENT BRIANNA KUPFER'S ALLEGED KILLER PLANS TO REPRESENT HIMSELF AT TRIAL

One need not look far for a trend – let’s roll on from NYC, south and west:

Poughkeepsie, NY: ""Father of Marist College student is fatally shot at NY hotel during school’s ‘family weekend’""

Atlanta, GA: ""Three students among those injured in shooting near CAU’s campus homecoming weekend""

Chicago: ""College Student Shot Near 65th and Stony Island""

Denver: ""Juvenile shot, killed near DU campus in Denver""

Washington State: ""4 injured in University District shooting were UW students""

Berkley, California: ""Man killed in shooting near UC Berkeley campus identified""

Vague language and the predictable bureaucratic wranglings in Washington have left the well-intentioned legislation a poor source for determining school danger.

I could go on. And that’s just October.

Concerns about campus crime are nothing new. What many do not realize – unless perhaps your kids are heading off to college – is that college-related crime in America has been, for some time now, tracked. The 1990 Clery Act, passed after a student was raped and murdered 2 in her college dorm room, was designed to force colleges to provide an annual snapshot of criminal activity in and around their campuses.

The problem, however, has been in the interpretation of the Act. Vague language and the predictable bureaucratic wranglings in Washington have left the well-intentioned legislation a poor source for determining school danger.

In many instances, the reported numbers simply defy logic. For instance, Columbia University reported that the school had no aggravated assaults in 2021, and only 4 in the last three years. But NYPD’s CompStat numbers in fact show that the 26th Precinct, which encompasses most of Columbia University, had 130 felony assaults last year alone. Two Columbia University students have in fact been murdered in separate incidents since December of 2019 – with neither incident appearing in the school’s annual Clery reports.

Similarly, the top five colleges in Philadelphia have reported no murders for last year – despite the fact that the city set an all-time murder record in 2021.

While these schools may be in technical compliance with the Act’s reporting requirements, clearly, these numbers are missing something. They just do not give parents an accurate portrait of where their children will be attending school.

Edward Davis, former Police Commissioner of Boston, a city almost indistinguishable from the many colleges it contains, describes the Clery Act as ""confusing and muddled"" and the implementation of the Act as ""disconnected from its original design."" It’s no wonder most parents have never even heard of the law.

A better metric for campus safety is a simple review of the crime trends in the relevant areas – and the growing reactions from parents, public officials, and the schools themselves.

According to the Chicago PD, in a single week in October, there were four shootings and 15 robberies in the district immediately south of the University of Chicago campus (in a state set to implement a ""no cash bail"" policy). At the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, police have reported over 250 ""shots fired"" incidents in the city so far this year – on track to likely double 2021 numbers.

In Baltimore, things have reached a point where Johns Hopkins University has elected to form its own police force. While awaiting its implementation, one of the medical school’s professors of surgery was carjacked and shot on his morning commute. (Nonetheless, students have protested vociferously against an increased security presence).

In fact, just during the writing and researching of this article, there were literally daily reports of campus-related shootings: Monday, October 24, University of Cincinnati; Tuesday, Marshall University, (West Virginia), San Diego State University, and Agricultural & Technical University (North Carolina); Wednesday: Northern Virginia Community College. Five incidents in three days.

And as we begin the new month? November 1, a woman shot and killed – The University of Cincinnati again.

What on earth is going on?

Parents are asking the same question. In response to a reported 45% crime surge surrounding the campus, a group of 1,800 parents from the University of Minnesota formed what is in effect an ad hoc public watchdog group to oversee security.

In liberal Berkeley, The Berkeley Scanner reports that parents have organized a pressure group to force university and local officials to do more about campus crime. As a result, the school – hardly a bastion of aggressive policing – just hired a private security firm.

And a parent group at Philadelphia’s Temple University has likewise hired a private security company to help keep their kids safe – footing the bill themselves.

In Baltimore, things have reached a point where Johns Hopkins University has elected to form its own police force.

Clearly, the schools are feeling the heat. Around the country, many are taking steps like increasing public safety personnel, instituting escorts for students, adding neighborhood watch programs, and installing cameras and better lighting. Many also seek closer working relationships with local police – even as their students call for police defunding.

It’s a necessary response to a trend that, if left unchecked, could allow the college experience that is the foundation of adult education in this country to slip away; just another victim of the progressive ""defund"" movement so in vogue in our cities.

Crime in New York killing city's comeback,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Protecting the safety and freedoms of a citizenry is the first principle of any government, and from that principle derive all other benefits a society confers. Like the freedom to go to a bar and get hammered without getting shot on your way home.

Freedoms like that are under threat in New York, as worsening street conditions have become a significant drag on the city’s famed nightlife. It’s another downstream effect of rising crime and homelessness – and one which won’t help the city’s looming budget problems.

The scenario is not restricted to New York – nearly all the nation’s major municipalities are in the same boat. But if our leaders ever hope to return our cities to the beacons of freedom and commerce they once were, recognizing the effect street disorder is having on the critical hospitality sector can no longer be ignored.

In New York, the result has been that ""the city that never sleeps"" is getting plenty of rest.

ILLINOIS POLICE REFORM ACT WILL ELIMINATE CASH BAIL AND MAKE OUR STREETS LESS SAFE

""Yeah, I’m closing earlier than I ever did,"" says Nick Zippilli, owner of The Westside Steakhouse in Hell’s Kitchen. ""The later it gets, the whackier it gets out there. It’s dangerous and it’s unpredictable. Homeless guys all over. Where’s all this money they’re spending on shelters going?""

Another neighborhood bar owner, Michael Younge of The Landmark Tavern (founded in 1868, it’s literally a landmark), backs him up. ""Yeah, there’s been a change,"" he says. ""We’re closing earlier, because we can’t get the staff for two shifts."" Younge acknowledges the effect of deteriorating street conditions. ""It’s not just the homeless. It’s homeless who are mentally disturbed. One of my servers used to go home by the Port Authority. She can’t go near the place now.""

On the east side, Adam, manager of The Auction House, a neighborhood institution for 30 years, is seeing much the same. ""We’re not running late anymore,"" he says. ""We used to run until 2 a.m. Now we’re closing by midnight. People are not going out late. And nobody wants to sit outside.""

Recent crime numbers support the notion that the city is becoming less hospitable. New York crime, at this writing, is up 33% overall. But significantly, there’s been a 36% jump in robberies and a 16% jump in felony assaults.

These are crucial metrics, because robberies and assaults are the crimes most likely to occur on the street, in areas where tourists and others are out and about. Add a relentless stream of emotionally disturbed homeless, and it’s no wonder the city’s going dark early.

Johnny Barounis is a well-known veteran of New York’s nightlife industry. One of his bars, The Back Room, is an historic ""speakeasy"" on the lower eastside – located just a block from the infamous McDonald’s ""hatchet incident.""

""There’s definitely a different vibe in town,"" Barounis says. ""Yes, we’re closing earlier. The market dictates it."" A critic of New York’s ""bail reform"" laws – like many other business owners around town – Barounis doesn’t blame the police. ""There are no consequences for crime anymore. I’m seeing fewer outer-boroughs people. Just turn on the news. Would you take your girlfriend on the subway?""

Barounis hits a key point: the subway is crucial to the city’s hospitality industry. In addition to carrying customers around town, it’s also how most hospitality workers get to and from work. And if there is a common refrain among them, it’s that they won’t take the subway late night. Because while arrests may be up in the transit system – crime is also up 42%.

""I bought a cheap motorcycle and I commute, rain or shine,"" says Alejandro, a waiter in midtown. ""But it costs me. The tolls, parking, wear and tear on the bike…. But leaving work at 2 in the morning, you don’t know if you’re even getting home anymore.""

His colleague Nicholas agrees. ""I live only four or five stops away from work, but I don’t care. I take a cab every night. I used to take the train, but I would get hassled all the time. Threatened. It’s not worth it."" For most hospitality workers, however, a daily cab or uber ride is beyond their means.

It’s a perennial problem, growing worse. Restaurant workers are targeted because experienced criminals know they often carry cash. Many are also illegal migrants who may be fearful of going to the police. So these are robberies which may not even show up in the city’s crime statistics. In fact, in the same restaurant where Alejandro and Nicholas work, one of the dishwashers was robbed on the subway just the night before.

This fear of the subways puts pressure on owners to close earlier, makes full-staffing harder to achieve, and hurts their bottom line – impacting tax revenues New York can ill-afford to lose.

""The problem is two-fold,"" says Andrew Rigie, director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance. ""It’s actual crime, but it’s also about the narrative, the perception of being unsafe in the city."" And once again, Rigie points to street conditions. ""There’s a lot of mentally ill, bothering people outdoors and just walking into places. We need better treatment, better street lighting. There’s vacant storefronts…. Because it’s also about what the city looks like.""

The bottom line: as New York learned the hard way in the 1990s, without safety, they won’t come. No one will.

Rigie notes that the city’s hospitality industry still employs 50,000 fewer workers than in 2019, despite the pandemic’s wane. And tourism is way down. ""We’re still a vibrant, exciting city. And we’re working to bring back the 70 million foreign visitors that used to come. But it’s a challenge.""

"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris created this crime wave, now they must fix it","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As a former prosecutor, FBI Special Agent and Chair of the North Carolina Crime Commission it is heartbreaking to witness the Biden administration's swift reversal of over 30 years of crime control and violence reduction strategies. According to FBI data, the 2021 murder rates were just slightly lower than the rates in 1996 during the crack epidemic. Many cities such as LA, Chicago and New York hit levels not seen since the 1990s. Jen Psaki’s breezy dismissal of this crime epidemic in a recent podcast shows the Biden/Harris administration still doesn’t get why Americans don’t feel safe.



As they shelter behind their gates, guards and guns, the rest of the country fend for themselves in the face of skyrocketing violent crime rates. Every day, senseless violent assaults and homicides are committed by recidivist offenders who should be in prison, yet Biden panders to a progressive base who undermine law enforcement by defunding police, implementing ""no cash bail"" and refusing to prosecute lawbreakers. These policies have deprived police of the strategies and tools necessary to actually prevent crime.



Biden was mute as the leftist DA in LA published his list of crimes he would not prosecute. Following suit, the Manhattan DA undercut police by refusing to prosecute a litany of crimes, including resisting arrest, thus inviting offenders to resist. Such policies contributed to a record 73 officers murdered in 2021, even as a cop shooter with a prior arrest for a gun crime was released on bond in NYC. In the words of the widow of slain NYPD Detective Jason Rivera: ""The system has continued to fail us. We are not safe anymore.""

Recall the ""summer of love"" riots, supported by progressives as their cities were ravaged, looted and burned. The Major City Police Chiefs Association reported criminals torched 97 police cars and committed 624 arsons. Over 2,000 officers were assaulted with bricks, water bottles, fireworks and Molotov cocktails which the alt-left dismissed as ""civil unrest"" triggered by systemically racist policing. Meanwhile, our Vice President promoted a fund to bail out these criminals and prosecutors declined to prosecute them. As violent crimes rates soared it was clear we had a problem.

This was the silver bullet Biden and the Mayor, who dubbed himself ""the Biden of Brooklyn,"" hawked at the recent Kabuki press event in New York City. They simply could not bring themselves to hold the criminal actors accountable.



In a move reminiscent of Biden’s border policies, the hapless Jimmy Carter in 1980 allowed Fidel Castro to empty his prisons into the U.S., creating a devastating drug-fueled crime wave that metastasized across the country. I served on the front lines in Miami in the mid-80s as an FBI agent eager to make a difference. Violence was so rampant that refrigerator trucks were used as makeshift morgues.



Gangs converted $40,000 kilos into crack rocks, a marketing innovation that made the highly addictive drug accessible to anyone who could score $10 by whatever means, mostly crime. Disillusionment set in as violence spread like a virus and devastated urban neighborhoods.

Later, as the head of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, I was part of an evolution in law enforcement strategies based on data and real-life experiences that showed a relatively small percentage of repeat offenders were committing a disproportionate share of violent crimes. The over 200 ATF and FBI gang task forces collaborated with community leaders to simultaneously provide an array of federally funded services to high-risk youths and recidivists offenders while making swift arrests if they made the wrong choice.

Instead of focusing exclusively on interdiction of drugs and guns, the task forces focused on the criminals themselves and provided the deterrence of certain incarceration if they chose crime over rehabilitation. Every violent, recidivist offender arrested prevented multiple crimes. Violent crime rates decreased dramatically. Some cities, like High Point, North Carolina, under Chief Louis Quijas, reduced homicides to zero. As for guns: Confiscating them resulted from targeting the repeat offenders who used the guns. These strategies proved that attacking the root causes of crime was not incompatible with proactive law enforcement.

Any progressive wind can blow this President. The prevailing winds demagogue the guns, the cops, the racist criminal justice system, Trump, even the victims.

Channeling Jimmy Carter, this administration opened our borders to transnational criminals, drug-toting cartel mules, human smugglers and terrorists even as the reformers pull back on arrests and prosecutions, creating the perfect storm. Biden’s DHS transports young male illegals into the heartland becoming a taxpayer-funded human smuggling organization. Under open borders, drug smuggling, including the lethal opioid, Fentanyl, is now at record levels fueling an epidemic in overdoses. Opioids cause over 205 deaths per day. Over 100,000-drug overdose deaths were recorded between April 2020 to April 2021, twice the number of gun deaths.

Biden says the COVID Relief Bill funded more officers. Not true. The bill rained cash on cities to do whatever they chose with the windfall. There were no earmarks for more officers. And now COPS and Byrne Grants, which were originally designed to equip and fund new officers, are now laden with social spending largesse for non-law enforcement positions while imposing restrictions that have little to do with actual law enforcement.

Liberals cite reductions in some crimes due to their social reform policies. Not so fast: when arresting criminals became an exercise in futility police pulled back from arresting certain offenders. When no arrests are made, no crime is recorded. Problem solved!

New York City can expect to see more brazen crime this year,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Editor’s note: The following column was first published in City Journal.

Less than a week ago, New Yorkers closed the book on a year that saw 485 murders—a slight rise over 2020, which saw a massive increase over 2019. Along with marking the end of Bill de Blasio’s tenure as mayor, 2021 also became the fourth consecutive year in which Big Apple homicides increased. Four straight years of homicide increases: that has never happened in my lifetime.

Depressing as the crime data have been as of late, many Gothamites rang in the New Year with optimism about new mayor Eric Adams, a former cop who ran on an explicitly anti-crime platform. But New Yorkers are quickly learning that last year’s election outcomes weren’t universally anti-crime.

MANHATTAN DA: 'I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PUSHBACK' TO LIGHTER PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS

On January 3, newly minted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg distributed a memo setting out a number of radical changes to the office’s approach to law enforcement.

For starters, he was doing away with the whole ""enforcement"" thing for a host of offenses: fare evasion, trespass, traffic infractions, resisting arrest, prostitution . . . the list goes on. With some exceptions, these offenses (among others) will no longer be prosecuted in Manhattan. Many other misdemeanors will now be met with diversion into ""programs,"" completion of which will also trigger non-prosecution.

More serious charges, like robbery and burglary, will be downgraded in many cases, according to the memo. If someone robs a convenience store with an empty gun, a Manhattan prosecutor must now charge the offender with petit larceny (a Class A misdemeanor) instead of robbery in the first degree (a Class B felony). Never mind that in a situation like that, the clerk, if armed, would be well within her rights to shoot the crook dead—such conduct is no longer deemed serious enough to warrant the kind of prison sentence that would normally accompany a robbery conviction.

These policies reflect several misapprehensions on Bragg’s part. Among them is his focus on offenses rather than offenders.

As I’ve written before, criminals often commit a wide range of crimes throughout their offending careers, which means that you can’t treat someone as ""non-violent"" just because their most recent arrest was for a non-violent crime.

MANHATTAN DA'S HALT TO PRISON SENTENCES FOR MANY CRIMES WAS BACKED BY JERRY NADLER, OTHER PROMINENT DEMOCRATS

Today’s low-level drug possessor can be tomorrow’s shooting suspect. A better approach would be to conduct a more holistic risk assessment when making charging and bargaining decisions. This would consider the offender’s criminal history, gang involvement, and other factors to determine whether the public would benefit from his incapacitation—and incapacitation, despite Bragg’s comments on deterrence, is the primary function that prison serves. Blanket policies like Bragg’s ignore this reality in favor of the fiction that pursuing even relatively minor charges against high-risk offenders brings no benefits.

If all this were not bad enough, the Bragg memo also establishes presumptions of both pretrial release and non-carceral post-conviction sentences. In other words, if you get arrested in Manhattan, there’s a good chance your case won’t get prosecuted—even if it is, there’s a good chance you’ll be charged with a less serious offense than the one you committed. Plus, the likelihood of spending any time in pretrial detention is now much lower—while the likelihood of being sentenced to probation instead of hard time is now much higher.

Is this really the message voters want New York City to send to criminals in the middle of a crime spike? Most voters would say no. A Manhattan Institute poll of likely voters published last summer showed a majority (52 percent) of respondents citing ""public safety and crime rates"" as one of their top two concerns—12 percentage points higher than ""the economy,"" which came in second. That concern goes a long way toward explaining how Adams rose to the top of a crowded field of Democratic mayoral candidates with more-progressive bone fides.

But there is a disconnect between Adams and Bragg. The day after Bragg distributed his policy memo, Mayor Adams and his new police commissioner were touting a gang takedown with New York’s other ""progressive"" prosecutor, Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez, who, to his credit, seems to have recommitted to targeting gangs last year.

That Adams and Bragg seem to be speaking different languages raises a question: How does a city end up handing electoral victories to an explicitly anti-crime mayor AND an explicitly anti-prosecution DA?

The answer can probably be found in a combination of the district attorney’s race being a down-ballot contest in an off-cycle election in a city with few viable Republicans. Those factors translate to little attention being paid to these races, consequential as they are.

It’s been the case in DA elections across the country.

Consider Philadelphia. Homicides have risen significantly every year since District Attorney Larry Krasner took office (and set a new city record in 2021), but he sailed to reelection last November—with just 21 percent of registered voters turning out.

In California, recall efforts have been launched against the district attorneys in Los Angeles (George Gascón) and San Francisco (Chesa Boudin)—a heartening sign, even if it suggests that a substantial portion of voters were genuinely surprised to learn about their anti-prosecution approaches, about which they were quite open, and which almost seemed designed to destroy the quality of life in those cities.

Anyone following the news has surely seen the stories of unsanitary tent communities, open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, and bands of retail thieves wreaking havoc in California’s progressive enclaves.

The question is whether, with the election of Alvin Bragg, New Yorkers can now expect the same. The answer: it’s hard to say, given how different a city New York is. But the best guess is that Manhattan will be worse off than it otherwise would have been, had a more traditional practitioner of law enforcement been elected DA.

Manhattan can probably expect to see more visible public disorder—fare evasion, open-air drug use and dealing, and brazen shoplifting; an increase in the number of offenses committed by those with active criminal-justice statuses (i.e., those with open cases, and on probation or parole); and, at least in the Upper Manhattan neighborhoods more susceptible to it, a substantial increase in serious violence.

Even if all this comes to pass over the next few years, it’ll be hard to say just how much of it is Bragg’s fault, since the city council and state legislature have already been supporting the decarceration and depolicing policies that Bragg advocates.

What can New Yorkers do to push back? The answer is two-fold. Mayor Adams can use his bully pulpit to pressure Bragg, and the NYPD can try to refer more cases for federal prosecution—assuming the newly appointed U.S. Attorneys for New York’s Eastern and Southern Districts are interested. But that’s about it.

Let us be clear: the heinous crime wave sweeping our country has nothing to do with COVID-19, as White House spokesperson Jen Psaki has suggested, but everything to do with progressive Democrats throttling law enforcement in our major cities.

This. Must. Stop.

It must stop especially because policies to reduce what Democrats call ""mass incarceration,"" which have included no-cash bail and looser enforcement of misdemeanors like shoplifting, are largely promulgated on a lie.

AMERICA'S CASH BAIL SYSTEM HAS MANY FLAWS, HERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION

The Left would have us believe that hundreds of thousands of people, disproportionately individuals of color, are unfairly locked up for nonviolent crimes. Further, activists argue that releasing such offenders poses no threat to the public.

Neither of these statements is true. First, while some people in state and federal prisons are there for crimes categorized as ""nonviolent,"" that is not necessarily because they were arrested for a nonviolent crime. It is often because they have pled down to a lesser offense. Some 94% of people in jail have not been tried by a jury but have agreed to a plea deal.

A criminal charged with armed robbery, for instance, could plead guilty to possession of a deadly weapon, seeking a lesser sentence. A drug dealer might plead down to possession of an illegal substance. One 2015 study reveals that in the smaller federal prison system, which in 2020 housed 226,000 people, over 99% of those sentenced for drugs were accused of trafficking, not just possession. That’s how the system works.

In any event, most people in jail are there for good reasons. Of the 1.3 million individuals incarcerated in the state prison system in 2020, more than half – 713,000 – were locked up for violent crimes, including 183,000 in for murder and 165,000 in for rape and sexual assault. Only 45,000 were in for drug possession.

We must stop this craziness by electing candidates who promise to protect law-abiding citizens.

As to the wisdom of releasing people accused of violent crimes, we know that recidivism is huge; nearly every day someone already charged with a violent crime, like the accused in the Waukesha killings, commits another monstrous misdeed. We have one of the highest recidivism rates in the world; 76.6% of prisoners are rearrested within five years.

It is undoubtedly the case that some people are in jail for the wrong reasons or are serving excessive sentences. It is also true that keeping people in jail because they cannot afford bail can be unfair; prosecutors and judges must do a better job of distinguishing between those who are a danger to society and those who are not.

The Waukesha driver, let out on $1,000 bail, had a history of violence, and had recently been arrested for running over the mother of his child. Someone’s head should roll for allowing him back on the streets.

Our entire criminal justice system is being turned on its head to protect what is almost certainly a small portion of individuals mistakenly accused or who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The drive to eliminate cash bail – even for some homicides – and to no longer arrest people for misdemeanors like urinating in public means our streets are dirtier and less safe.

We must stop this craziness by electing candidates who promise to protect law-abiding citizens. That may be happening already.

In New York City, one of the first cities to dumb down law enforcement and experience soaring crime, newly elected Mayor Eric Adams, a former cop, defeated his progressive challengers by running on a promise to restore public safety. Among other policies, he championed ""stop, question and frisk,"" saying done properly, the approach would drive down crime.

Similarly, Atlanta’s citizens recently elected in a landslide a come-from-behind candidate who promised to address that city’s crime surge by increasing the number of police officers and going after gangs. Homicides are up 59% over 2019 in Atlanta; voters said, ""Enough!""

These are promising outcomes, and we hope more will follow. But public policy should also address the real ""root causes"" of our country’s crime problem. And make no mistake – we do have a problem.

Widespread looting in our big cities is an outrage and will drive up prices as businesses pass along the high costs. The thievery has nothing to do with poverty resulting from the pandemic, as Psaki implies; retailers report these are well-orchestrated attacks on businesses by increasingly violent gangs who know they will suffer little harm if they are caught.

Homicides are also out of control.

The murder rate in the United States is five times what it is in Germany, and that was based on 2018 statistics. U.S. murders rose 29% in 2019. In 2019, the city of Baltimore had a murder rate of 58.3 per 100,000 residents. The murder rate in Nigeria, a country that our State Department declared too dangerous to visit? 34.5.

It is true that African Americans and to a lesser degree Hispanics are disproportionately jailed in the U.S. That’s because they commit more violent crimes. To bring about change, we must address some serious shortcomings, including the obvious: education.

In many cities, our public schools fail to educate minority children. As Eric Adams said recently: ""Sixty-five percent of Black and Brown children don’t meet proficiency in the Department of Education."" How can we expect minority kids to become self-reliant and productive members of society when they cannot read or do math?

Seattle’s crime surge spreads statewide thanks to Democrats’ progressive policies

Thanks to a Democratic legislature that codified the radical defund police proposals into laws, plus light-on-crime judges, the crime surge hitting Seattle is spreading across the state. And there is no sign that the crime explosion will slow; in fact, it’s getting worse.

Seattle has averaged more than one homicide a week so far this year. Gun violence has nearly doubled, with 95% more shots fired and a 171% increase in gunshot victims compared to last year. Drug dealing is rampant, homeless shoplifters are destroying local businesses, and random, brutal assaults are all too common.

Unlike Las Vegas, what happens in Seattle doesn’t stay in Seattle.

SEATTLE IS IN ‘A CRIMINAL AND HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY,’ BAKER SAYS AS RAMPANT CRIME FORCES BUSINESSES TO CLOSE

In nearby Tacoma, the homicide rate is just as bad as Seattle. Robberies in the city hit 219 through March 13. Compare that to last year’s 83 at that point last year. Yakima, located in central Washington, has seen a spiraling domestic violence epidemic with 1,592 domestic violence incidents since last July.

Meanwhile, car theft in the mid-size border city of Bellingham is up over 300%, already surpassing the total number of thefts from 2019. On the east side of the state, Spokane is experiencing similar problems with a 90% spike in car thefts.

Where did this all come from? The left’s assault on policing and the courts after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Fringe activists demanded changes and like-minded Democrats lawmakers obliged.

Democrats passed legislation preventing cops from using force -- including detention at the scene of a crime -- unless probable cause exists for an arrest. They even banned most vehicular pursuits, which means criminals can quite literally drive off from the scene of most crimes without fear that they’ll be chased and detained. Cities like Seattle went one step further, banning most traffic stops altogether.

The use-of-force bill was somewhat fixed this last legislative session to allow police use force if a suspect flees the scene of a crime. But the standard is still probable cause -- much higher than reasonable suspicion.

WASHINGTON SWAT DEPUTY SHOT IN LINE OF DUTY HAS DIED

This matters because criminals know these new laws work in their favor and they’re taking advantage.

Smash and grabs continue to wreak havoc. Crooks break into various retail stores, usually driving a car (but sometimes a forklift) into a storefront, before physically removing the ATM. Due to the cash-only nature of pot shops, they are also being targeted, with some 200 robberies this year and many of them are armed.

In many of the cities where this is occurring, especially Seattle, police are so understaffed they can’t arrive in time to catch the criminals. If they arrive as the thieves drive off, they wouldn’t likely have probable cause that a violent crime occurred and would be barred from pursuit.

If the new ""police accountability"" laws weren’t bad enough, we have politicians and judges who treat criminals like the victims.

According to a leaked draft ordinance, the King County Council is considering legislation mandating police connect a suspect with a public defender before they can consent to a search of their person or property. The suspect can’t even waive their rights -- they must first speak with a lawyer. This effectively stops most police investigations, while hampering them with extra work.

When the suspects are teens, there’s almost never juvenile detention thanks to left wing judges. Perhaps that’s behind the rash of teen criminals endangering the lives of residents? They know they won’t be punished seriously.

Four kids between the ages of 11 and 16 were arrested after a recent drive-by shooting on I-5 in Pierce County. A group of teens as young as 14, one armed with a gun, carjacked a victim in Burien, Wash. four days later. The suspects in a Tacoma pot shop murder are 15 and 16. They had just been previously placed on home arrest following charges connected to a violent armed robbery that included an alleged pistol-whipping.

When some mayors objected to the soft-on-violent-crime approach to juvenile suspects, a King County prosecutor told them to ""get used to it."" This is the new reality.

Anyone even casually reviewing the new laws, the defunded and understaffed police departments, and soft-on-crime judges and prosecutors would be able to connect the dots. But with woke, one-party rule in Washington, we get little more than lip service that barely even acknowledges the crisis.

This is what Democrats’ soft-on-crime insanity does to American families,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Public safety is the foundation of any free society. In the United States, our families deserve to live in safe communities without the constant fear of violent crime and lawlessness threatening their personal security.

Unfortunately, due to Democrats’ soft-on-crime, defund-the-police agenda, too many Americans have been victimized by violent criminals who are allowed to walk free because Democrat prosecutors won’t even charge them with a crime.

In our Commitment to America, House Republicans pledged to hold criminals accountable for their actions, support our police departments, and uphold the rule of law across our nation. Safety and security are what the American people expect and deserve from their elected officials.

AUSTIN, TEXAS RESIDENTS 'LIVING IN FEAR' AS CRITICS BLAME STREET RACING CHAOS ON POLICE STAFFING 'CRISIS'

Despite what Democrats claim, our growing concerns about public safety are not unfounded. Crime is skyrocketing in major U.S. cities nationwide because Democrats have defunded their police departments, ended cash bail and allowed violent criminals back on our streets to terrorize communities with no more than a slap on the wrist.

Naturally, these dangerous policies have consequences. More than 15 U.S. cities – including Atlanta, Austin, and St. Paul – saw their 2021 homicide numbers break previous records.

According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association’s 2022 crime report, homicides have increased by 41% in Chicago, 45% in Philadelphia, and 236% in Portland since 2019. These alarming statistics should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats to reevaluate their failed agenda. However, in our nation’s capital, pro-criminal policies are the extreme left’s gold standard.

In Washington, D.C., just this year, sexual abuse is up 100%, motor vehicle theft is up 111%, and homicides have increased by 18%. But, just weeks ago, even despite the liberal mayor’s veto, the Washington, D.C. City Council approved legislation to slash prison sentences for the worst offenders, eliminate penalties for a slew of violent crimes, and release scores of dangerous criminals back onto our streets. Sadly, this is the Democrats’ blueprint for America – right in President Joe Biden’s back yard.

In response to this serious dereliction of duty, both Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to condemn this pathetic law and overturn this dangerous endorsement of criminal behavior. If big-city liberals think they can endanger law-abiding Americans without any pushback, they are gravely mistaken. Republicans will not be silent.

Amid rising crime and increasing threats against our police, Republicans will always stand with the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities and keep our families safe.

This is especially vital as we face a war against police officers in our country. Last year, 331 police officers were shot in the line of duty, 62 of whom died from their wounds. We have also seen a 32% increase in police officers killed by gunfire compared to 2020.

This is unacceptable, and it needs to end.

Unlike Democrats, Republicans are committed to protecting our families and standing up to the lawlessness that has plagued our cities. Instead of defunding the police, we will give local law enforcement the tools and resources that they need to hire additional officers, which will bolster public safety and reduce crime. Instead of demonizing police, we will praise them for their bravery and resolve. Instead of accepting the Democrats’ soft-on-crime agenda, we will fight it.

According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association’s 2022 crime report, homicides have increased by 41% in Chicago, 45% in Philadelphia, and 236% in Portland since 2019. These alarming statistics should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats to reevaluate their failed agenda. However, in our nation’s capital, pro-criminal policies are the extreme left’s gold standard.

From Louisiana to Iowa, the ""Thin Blue Line"" protects us all from lawlessness and crime, and Republicans will always back the men and women in blue from the left’s radical, pro-criminal policies. Because criminals do not control our streets. We do.

No one trusts media's spin on America's crime wave,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Crime is out of control. Not just in our cities but in our news media. Journalists lost control of the narrative before, during, and after the election. They are furious that social media allows voters to see attacks on citizens, hate crimes and huge mobs robbing stores.

The legacy press tried to suppress the crime narrative leading up to Election Day. Then just 19 days after the vote, The Washington Post admitted, ""During the last three years, homicides nationwide have reached their highest levels in decades.""

That should have resulted in a come to Mencken moment for the political press. Instead, they either ignored it or tried to rationalize it.

The Post’s own ""National Columnist"" Philip Bump followed up that news report in his own newspaper with, ""The overblown, heavily political fear of American cities."" (Worth noting that when reporters become columnists at major news outlets, it typically reflects the reporter’s inability to even pretend neutrality. Like Bump.)

Bump actually had the nerve to compare crime in 1990 to now. The birth rate has been near 4 million a year since that time. So more than 120 million weren’t even born then, not counting new immigrants – legal and illegal. Still Bump argued, ""Crime in New York City is up — but it has been far worse."" Wow, comforting. Your coworker was just murdered on the subway, but, hey, 32 years ago it was more dangerous! You just won a free subway token.

The legacy press has come full circle. They can’t stand that people don’t trust their spin on crime. It was the same leading up to the vote.

CNN’s Jake Tapper tried to blame the 2020 crime spike not on liberals looting, burning and violently attacking others in an orgy of rioting instead on … then-President Donald Trump. ""Between 2019 and 2020, the Trump years, the U.S. homicide rate rose about 30 percent. That's the highest increase recorded in modern history.""

Jake’s smugness comes through even when you read his comments. He continued, ""If you don't feel safe, if you or someone you care about has been accosted or assaulted, that's your experience. Fear is primal. It's a crucial emotion."" In other words, don’t be irrational, don’t listen to worries about crime. Be like common man Jake, worth $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

NYPD HATE CRIMES UNIT ARRESTS SUSPECT IN BB GUN ATTACK ON JEWISH MAN, SON IN FRONT OF KOSHER MARKET

NBC’s Lester Holt tried the same strategy right before the election. He brought on ""civil rights attorney"" Alec Karakatsanis who blamed conservatives, ""I see an attempt by the right-wing to scare people into unwinding certain very small reforms,"" he claimed.

Get back to me the next time you see a bunch of legacy media elites risking their lives on the New York subway.

It was the same on Election Day. The Atlantic was worried about crime: ""The pollster Stan Greenberg has found that worry about rising crime under Democrats is a more potent fear than any other issue this cycle."" The article added more feelgood numbers about crime. ""FBI data released in October show that violent crime was roughly flat last year (with a drop in robberies canceling out an increase in murders).""

Ah, yes, murders and robberies always just cancel each other out in that great Excel spreadsheet in the sky.

The same time, NPR ran a rationalization about why crime really isn’t so bad, headlined, ""Stories about crime are rife with misinformation and racism, critics say."" You are stupid or racist if you worry about being mugged.

Republicans won the House of Representatives, in large part because of New York seats the GOP gained tied to its anti-crime campaign. Then came the Post article, admitting, ""Even now, as the bloodshed has slowed, the homicide rate outpaces pre-pandemic levels.""

But the Post buried its lede. It profiled nine cities ravaged by murder, admitting, ""Victim data collected from each city profiled here show Black people made up more than 80 percent of the total homicide victims in 2020 and 2021.""

Can you imagine a major news outlet hiding something so horrible to people of color? Unless, of course, journalists were worried the problem might cause African-Americans to vote Republican.

But the news gets out. The New York Post reported, ""Felony crimes — including murder, rape and robbery — have surged on the subway system by 40 percent so far this year compared to 2021, according to newly released NYPD stats.""

Those were the kind of stories even CNN reported early this year. Like, ""New York man arrested in connection with 7 separate attacks against Asian women."" Or, ""Horrified by the surge of anti-Asian violence, she’s giving her community tools to protect themselves.""

The left and their buddies in the legacy press can’t hide crime anyone. People are going to see videos and get reports about assaults and murders, homelessness, drug use and the horrific decline of our once-great cities. And no amount of government propaganda or media spin can stop it.

"AOC challenger calls out NYC's crime crisis, puts blame on defund the police and 'woke' prosecutors","Winning the Republican primary with 67% of the votes, a challenger to ""Squad"" member Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., wants to take down the progressive firebrand because she's fed up with crime in New York City.

Congressional candidate of New York’s 14th district Tina Forte told Fox News Digital that people are afraid to be out at night because of the city’s rising crime.

She added that she spoke with constituents directly about crime by going to their homes, businesses, and even on the streets of New York.

""They don't come out at night anymore like they used to,"" Forte said.

NYPD OFFICER OF 40 YEARS: I'VE NEVER SEEN NYC CRIME AS BAD AS IT IS RIGHT NOW

Forte went on to say, ""They tell me personal stories to be honest with you.""

""I grew up here, I own a business here, I raised my family here. I see the difference. I see stores closing earlier than when they normally do. You have a grandma and grandpa who don’t come out for a cappuccino at night anymore. They don't want to come out or if they are out, they head home because it's getting dark. People are afraid to be out at night. Those are the things I am getting back from people as I meet with them.""

Although Big Apple murder rates were similar this year compared to last, other major crimes have surged. Police statistics and polls show that New Yorkers are fed up, Fox News Digital reported earlier this month.

Ocasio-Cortez has been one of the most vocal and high-profile lawmakers to demand the defunding of American police departments. In her own district, major crime has climbed steadily over the past two years.

SAN FRANCISCO DEFUNDED THE POLICE BEFORE REVERSING COURSE NEXT YEAR AMID CALLS FOR ‘ACCOUNTABILITY’

According to Paul Mauro, an attorney and former NYPD inspector, key major crimes to watch are robberies and burglaries — highly invasive profit-motivated crimes that often involve repeat offenders.

In police precincts that are located in Ocasio-Cortez’s middle- and working-class district, those crime numbers have also increased.

In the NYPD’s 43rd Precinct, covering the Southeast Bronx, robberies soared 70% between the start of the year and Aug. 7, the most recent date for which statistics are available.

Burglaries were up more than 30%. To the north in the 45th Precinct, robberies were up more than 12% this year compared to last but more than double the 2020 total. In the 49th, robberies also climbed, but burglaries were down significantly — 20% lower than 2021 and almost 30% lower than 2020.

In the 114th, a relatively safe area that covers parts of Astoria, Woodside and Jackson Heights in Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional district, year-to-date robberies were up nearly 20% compared to 2021 and more than 56% higher than in 2020. Burglaries were up 7% and 30.2%.

In the 108th, which covers parts of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituency as well as the affluent Long Island City neighborhood, which is outside of her congressional district, robberies climbed by 71% and 84.4% over the past two years. Robberies were up more than 75% in the neighboring 109th precinct, near the Mets’ Citi Field.

DO AOC'S CONSTITUENTS BACK HER CALL TO DEFUND POLICE AS VIOLENT CRIME SURGES IN THE DISTRICT?

Forte argued that the cause of rising crime is ""immunity"" being lifted off of police officers, ""bail reform,"" and ""woke"" district attorneys.

""They have handcuffs on our police but they don’t want to keep the handcuffs on our violent criminals. That’s the problem and that’s what needs to be fixed. Especially in this district,"" Forte said.

Experts claim it is not only defunding the police that impedes the NYPD’s ability to address crime. It’s a combination of low morale, officers retiring early or taking jobs in smaller departments, and bail reforms that put repeat offenders back on the streets, sometimes within hours of their arrests.

Even progressive New York City Mayor Eric Adams called the state’s bail reform laws ""insane"" and ""dangerous."" The statements prompted liberal Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to push back.

Adams criticized the fact that many crimes in the city are being committed by repeat offenders. Of the 2,400 shootings since last year, 716 suspects were responsible for 30% of them, he said.

AOC-BACKED NEW YORK DEMOCRAT CELEBRATES PRIMARY VICTORY BY DECLARING ‘SOCIALISM WINS’

""We have the criminals that are being released immediately due to the AOC-supported bail reform,"" Forte said. ""Not to mention, we have the highest tax burden in America in New York City. We have nothing to show for it except crime, high unemployment, bad school, and leaders who behave like the very third-world dictators they admire.""

Furthermore, Forte vowed to ""refund"" the police force, hire more police officers, and give police officers their ""immunity"" back if elected.

""I will hold back federal funding if you do not put more police on the street and if you do not pay them what they deserve to be paid because they're the real hero, not a baseball player, not the elite; They're not heroes to me. Our heroes are our policemen.""

Forte is also a supporter of school choice.

The 14th District includes the eastern part of the Bronx and part of north-central Queens, which is currently helmed by progressive firebrand Ocasio-Cortez.

Biden calls supporting 1994 crime bill a 'mistake' during ABC town hall,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden conceded Thursday it was a ""mistake"" to support a now-controversial crime bill that critics say laid the groundwork for mass incarceration, but the former longtime senator still defended parts of the 1994 legislation.

Asked by ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos during a televised town hall in Philadelphia whether supporting the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was a mistake, Biden said: ""Yes, it was.""

But the former vice president blamed the worst effects of the law on how individual states chose to implement it.

BIDEN'S COURT-PACKING 180, SAYS HE WILL NOW TELL VOTERS HIS STANCE BEFORE ELECTION

""Here's where the mistake came,"" he said. ""The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally — you remember George, it was all about the same time for the same crime.""

He also defended the legislation as indicative of its time, noting it had the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and Black mayors across the country. Still, he acknowledged the country's attitude on racial justice issues has shifted dramatically since President Bill Clinton signed the law.

“Things have changed,” he said.

BIDEN PRESSED ON 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' COMMENT DURING TOWN HALL

The candidate has previously said elements of the legislation were a ""big mistake"" because of its effect on the Black community.

Biden's comments come amid a reckoning in the U.S. on racial justice following a summer of protests over police brutality against Black Americans.

President Trump has repeatedly tried to tie Biden to unrest in American cities -- which began in the spring following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in custody of a Minneapolis police officer -- and to the ""defund the police"" movement, a push to reallocate funds from police departments toward other government programs intended to reduce crime and expand social welfare.

BIDEN SAID IT'S 'ABSOLUTELY' OK TO RAISE TAXES DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

""He's talking about defunding the police,"" Trump said during the first presidential debate. ""He doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.""

A group of more than 175 current and former law enforcement officials endorsed Biden at the beginning of September, calling Trump ""lawless.""

Biden has repeatedly distanced himself from defunding the police and has instead called for reforms to law enforcement, like giving additional funding for community policing. He pushed back against Trump's criticisms.

“Yes, I’m in favor of law and order,"" he said one month ago. ""Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.""

"Lee Zeldin, Gov. Kathy Hochul duke it out over crime in fiery debate amid surge in New York violence","New York's Republican gubernatorial hopeful, Lee Zeldin, wrangled with incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in a primetime debate Tuesday over rising crime and the ongoing surge of violence plaguing the state's citizens.

Zeldin opened the debate by declaring New York was ""in a crisis"" because of Hochul's leadership, and blasted policies like cashless bail and said soft on crime approaches have resulted in New Yorkers feeling unsafe.

""We need to make our streets safe again. I'm running to take back our streets, and to support, unapologetically, our men and women in law enforcement,"" Zeldin said when asked about his crime policy.

Zeldin brought up the same point later in the debate and stated that Hochul didn't believe there was a ""crime emergency"" in the state. Hochul dismissed Zeldin's focus on crime and bail policies as a political scare tactic.

""Anyone who commits a crime under our laws, especially with the change they made to bail, has consequences. I don't know why that's so important to you,"" Hochul said at one point, before stating that to reduce crime the state should increase gun control.

LEE ZELDIN BLASTS NEW YORK GOV. KATHY HOCHUL OVER BEING LATE ON CRIME: ‘WE HAVE TO SAVE OUR STATE’

Hochul accused Zeldin of trying to keep New Yorkers ""scared"" about crime and claimed she had policies that were ""making a difference"" in addressing the issue.

She didn't directly address rising crime across New York, but cited Monday's shooting at a school in St. Louis, Missouri, that killed two people as a reason for increased gun control measures.

""There is no crime fighting plan if it doesn't include guns — illegal guns,"" she said before claiming Zeldin refused to talk about gun reform, and calling for an ""assault weapons ban for teenagers.""

NY GOVERNOR'S RACE: ZELDIN CUTS INTO HOCHUL'S LEAD, GAINING AMONG INDEPENDENTS

Zeldin hit back, arguing crime expanded far beyond instances where a firearm was used.

""Unfortunately, Kathy Hochul believes that the only crimes that are being committed are these crimes with guns. And you have people who are afraid of being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars. They're being stabbed, beaten to death on the street with hammers,"" he said.

""Go talk to the Asian-American community and how it's impacted them with the loss of lives, Jewish people targeted with raw, violent antisemitism on our streets. It just happened, yet again. We need to be talking about all of these other crimes, but instead Kathy Hochul is too busy patting herself on the back,"" he added.

Zeldin then called for the state legislature to open a special session to address crime by overhauling cashless bail and what he called other ""pro-criminal laws.""

Moderator Errol Louis noted the drastic increases in crime in the New York City subways, including its rise by more than 57% this year alone, as well as an increase of more than 100% in the homicide rate from last year.

NEW YORK TIMES ENDORSES KATHY HOCHUL FOR GOVERNOR, CONDEMNS LEE ZELDIN'S ‘LOYALTY TO TRUMPISM’

Hochul said she understood the fear New Yorkers felt over the rise in crime, and touted what she claimed was an increase in funding for law enforcement, but didn't speak to the specific rise in crime mentioned.

""It's amazing that we're going to be able to go through the entire crime conversation of this debate, and we're still waiting for Kathy Hochul to talk about actually locking up criminals,"" Zeldin interjected.

DC council softens penalties for violent crimes by overriding mayor's veto of criminal code rewrite,"The District of Columbia City Council voted to force through revisions of the district's criminal code that will soften penalties on violent crimes, overriding a previous veto from the mayor's office.

Ward 2 Councilmember Brooke Pinto, who voted to overturn the veto, argued Tuesday that ""allowing the veto to stand would be a significant step back in our work to modernize the criminal code, negating years of work, compromise and engagement by the council.""

The overhaul of the city’s criminal code includes reduced maximum sentences, the elimination of nearly all mandatory minimum sentences, and expanded rights to jury trials by those accused of misdemeanors.

Criminal justice reform advocates say the bill is necessary to modernize the law, which was written in 1901, and ensure that punishments are proportionate to the crimes being committed .

""It is a long overdue overhaul of our criminal code, which was first handed down to us from Congress back in 1901, a Congress that, if you can believe it, is even more dysfunctional and unrepresentative the District Columbia than what we have today,"" said Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen.

But opponents have sounded the alarm on provisions that would allow D.C. inmates to ask for early release 20 years into their sentence, even those accused of violent crimes like murder or sexual assault.

""Anytime there's a policy that reduces penalties, I think that sends the wrong message. That takes the focus off using guns or possessing guns, and I think that's the wrong way to go,"" Bowser previously wrote about her decision to veto.

She continued, ""I'm also very concerned the courts have the resources to keep up with the law. And we are just now seeing the courts really get going full force post-pandemic, and what this law would suggest is that the number of trials would skyrocket.""

The D.C. City Council's Tuesday decision sends the bill to Congress, where federal lawmakers will have 60 days to review it.

Within that period, Congress may enact a joint resolution disapproving the council's act. If President Joe Biden approves the resolution, the act will be prevented from becoming law.

If enacted, the revisions will go into effect in 2025.

DC Democrat fights own party over violent crime response: 'Truly puzzling',"There are times when K. Denise Rucker Krepp wonders if she is the only elected Democrat in Washington, D.C., who cares that violent criminals are making the city unsafe.

Krepp, an advisory neighborhood commissioner representing some 2,500 Capitol Hill residents, has been fighting for tougher prosecution of criminals for nearly a decade. She is unpaid, has no staff, and is armed with little more than a Twitter account. But as the city's Democratic leaders push for a controversial revision of the criminal code – reducing sentences and giving murderers and rapists an opportunity for early release – she has tirelessly fought the measure, calling attention to the city's violent crime problem and demanding accountability from those in power.

""We're in the middle of a crime surge,"" Krepp told Fox News in an interview. ""I've had in the past year: Two murders, multiple armed carjackings, stabbings, shootings, and now home invasion. Not good, not good at all. And by the way, armed carjacking in front of my house. That really pissed me off.""

The home invasion happened Thursday, when police said four armed suspects broke into a residence in Krepp's Ward and made off with nearly $20,000 in stolen property. The thieves allegedly presented themselves as FBI agents and forced their way in with a crowbar, the Metropolitan Police Department said.

""Good morning DC Council. The Revised Criminal Code which you passed last month enables the burglars who bound up my residents this morning to be released early from prison,"" Krepp tweeted Thursday. ""You call the bill progress. I call it a failure.""

Last month, the D.C. Council voted unanimously to adopt a sweeping overhaul of the city's criminal code. Among the proposed reforms were reduced maximum sentences, the elimination of nearly all mandatory minimum sentences, and expanded rights to jury trials by those accused of misdemeanors.

Criminal justice reform advocates say the bill is necessary to modernize the law, which was written in 1901, and ensure that punishments are proportionate to the crimes being committed.

""Many members of Congress in 1901 were former slave holders. When we have a criminal code like that, it welcomes bias,"" Councilman Charles Allen said in October. ""We have a disproportionate, outdated hot mess of a criminal code right now."" As head of the District's Judiciary and Public Safety Committee, Allen was an architect of the legislation and a driving force behind its passage.

But opponents have sounded the alarm on provisions that would allow D.C. inmates to ask for early release 20 years into their sentence, even those accused of violent crimes like murder or sexual assault. Police Chief Robert Contee has publicly raised concerns over reduced penalties for gun crimes. And U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves's office, which is responsible for prosecuting crimes in the District, said in October that while reform was ""sorely needed,"" they ""still have concerns with multiple aspects of this bill and believe that some provisions, while well-intentioned, could undermine community safety and impede the administration of justice in our courts.""

Krepp, a former federal agency chief counsel, believes the proposed law will deprive prosecutors of the tools they need to fight crime.

""I really don't understand why they just seem to be so gung ho on helping individuals who committed rape, and murder, and armed carjacking, stabbing, shootings, robberies, whatever,"" she told Fox News. ""It's truly puzzling to me.""

The bill is currently in the hands of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has said she is ""disappointed with several provisions."" Her office did not respond to a request for comment on whether she will sign the bill, veto it, or permit it to become law without her signature.

If the revised code makes it past the mayor's desk, it will next head to Congress, where federal lawmakers will have 60 days to review it. Within that period, Congress may enact a joint resolution disapproving the Council's Act. If President Biden approves the resolution, the act will be prevented from becoming law.

Krepp has asked Congress to do this. On Dec. 12, she wrote to congressional leaders pleading with them to reject the revised code, writing that it would ""hurt victims of violent crime.""

""I asked the DC Council to amend the Revised Criminal Code Act because it creates a new right for convicted rapists - the right to petition for early release. They said no so I’ve asked Congress to disapprove it,"" she tweeted on Wednesday.

Browse Krepp's official ANC account and you will find hundreds of such posts condemning violent crimes and urging action from Democratic officials who run the city. ""Good morning D.C.,"" she tweeted Saturday morning. ""We're ending the week w/ 464 carjackings … and [U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves] doesn't know how many carjacking cases his office prosecuted this year, last year, or in the past 10 years.""

Though at times she seems like the lone tough-on-crime Democrat in a city turning against police, Krepp is not desperate. She is determined. A former Coast Guard officer and Obama administration political appointee, Krepp is no stranger to standing up against powerful foes.

In 2011, while serving as Chief Counsel for the U.S. Maritime Administration, Krepp requested an Inspector General (IG) investigation into a ""credible report"" of multiple sexual assaults being covered up by the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, one of five federal service academies. She says that instead of completing an investigation, her superiors accused her of being disloyal to the Obama administration and forced her to resign, while sexual assaults continued at the school.

Now, as an ""itty bitty locally elected official,"" Krepp continues to be a fierce advocate for victims. She sued the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution data in 2016 after her neighbor was assaulted by a serial rapist, demanding to know how many rapes in her ward were prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's office each year.

As violent crime increased over the years, Krepp submitted Freedom of Information Act requests for additional prosecution data in 2021, only to find that the U.S. attorney did not have that data readily available. Ever persistent, when U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves briefed Advisory Neighborhood Commission 6B at a public meeting on March 8, 2022, Krepp confronted him and demanded to know how many crimes his office has prosecuted. He was unable to answer, telling her that his office uses ""antiquated"" case management systems and did not have that data ""on demand.""

In response, she has hammered away at the U.S. attorney on Twitter and sent multiple letters to lawmakers requesting that Congress instruct his office to start tracking crimes prosecuted in D.C. each year, making this information available to the public.

The U.S. attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""I have found over eight years that it's abnormal to do what I'm doing, which is being very public and expressing frustration at the situation,"" Krepp told Fox News.

So far, D.C. leaders have mostly ignored her efforts opposing the revised criminal code. ""If they paid attention, and they acknowledged what I was doing, then they'd have to acknowledge that there's a crime problem, and they don't want to do that. If you don't ask the questions I'm asking, then you can say, everything's great,"" Krepp says.

D.C. officials have acknowledged that city residents feel unsafe, but they've pointed to data that shows crime has fallen in recent months. ""We’re at a 4% overall reduction in crime,"" police Chief Robert Contee told the D.C. Council in October, comparing 2022 crime data to the year before.

The Metropolitan Police Department website is regularly updated with crime statistics. Though homicides have fallen 10% in the last year to date, data shows murders are still up nearly 18% since 2019, before the pandemic. Motor vehicle theft has also increased 4% in 2022 over 2021. Total violent crime is down 7%, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.

However, the D.C. Police Union has sounded off on rising crime, tweeting on Dec. 1 that carjackings were up 16% year to date and robberies up 3%.

""We are still short 100s of cops and the responsible policing that used to address this has been prohibited by misguided legislation,"" the union said.

Krepp agrees. She says that if officials want to get serious on crime, they need to prosecute criminals and lock them up.

""I think for too many years people have said, 'oh, we're not gonna prosecute, let's look at stopping crimes before they happen.' And so, that may have a role in it. But if you don't prosecute the individuals who’ve already committed the crimes, the folks behind them are looking and going, ‘okay, nothing happened, I'm gonna just do that myself.’ There's gotta be some strong signal sent and that just hasn't happened,"" Krepp says.

She also thinks the D.C. Council needs to increase their support for police.

""They've trash talked them,"" Krepp told Fox News. ""We’ve got a D.C. police force that nobody wants to go to, the Council saying everybody is awful. Well then, who joins a force when the D. C. Council says they're awful?""

If her fellow Democrats are unresponsive to her pleas, Krepp says she'd welcome Republican support.

""I wrote the letter to Congress because I didn't get any help in the council, and I don't want to leave office knowing that a rapist could get a new right simply because the council did what it did. I mean, I sought help. And so, if somebody is willing to help me, I don't really care what party they belong to, I just want their help to make sure that rapists stay in jail. So, if that means standing beside Republicans, happy to do it. Does that mean saying thank you to Republicans? Happy to do it. Rapists have got to stay in jail.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dc-democrat-fights-own-party-violent-crime-response,N/A
"Democratic mayors under fire as crime, violence plagues Chicago, New York, Philadelphia","Democratic mayors are raising eyebrows with their responses to the rising crime plaguing major cities like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.

The U.S. murder rate rose 30% between 2019 and 2020, according to FBI data – the largest annual increase on record, with Chicago topping the list. At least 12 major cities, including New York, have already set historical murder records in 2021. Robberies and assaults are also on the rise, and retailers in major cities across the country are reporting an uptick in organized smash-and-grab crimes during the busy holiday shopping season.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot faced criticism last week after she responded to the recent flood of robberies in her city by blaming retailers for not better protecting their merchandise.

LEFT'S PHILOSOPHY ON CRIME IS ON FULL DISPLAY IN BLUE STATES AS DEMOCRATS PROMOTE 'CHAOS': PAVLICH

""We also got to push retailers,"" she said during a Dec. 6 event. ""I'm disappointed that they are not doing more to take safety and make it a priority. For example, we still have retailers that won't institute plans like having security officers in their stores, making sure that they've got cameras that are actually operational, locking up their merchandise at night. Chaining high-end bags, these purses seem to be something that is attracting a lot of attention on these organized retail theft units.""

Lightfoot's comments were blasted by retailers as misinformed.

In New York City, one of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s last acts as mayor before he hands over the reins to Mayor-elect Eric Adams is instituting a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses in the city, claiming it’s his ""job"" to ""protect"" New Yorkers.

The mandate gave businesses only three weeks to comply before it goes into effect on Dec. 27, just four days before de Blasio leaves office.

During an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" over the weekend, de Blasio defended the mandate and claimed the city is ""much safer"" now than it was when he took the reins eight years ago, despite the fact that murders in the city skyrocketed last year and have remained high so far in 2021.

""Eight years I’ve been mayor, index crimes, major crimes in New York City down 11% over eight years. And we did it bringing police and community closer together,"" the mayor said. ""The bottom line is that there is today in New York City, a much safer city than we were eight years ago.""

""I have confidence and the NYPD has confidence that we’re going to get back to the prepandemic levels soon, and then surpass, and become even safer,"" he added. ""And the statistics show it in most of the city; there are a few places where we’re struggling.""

BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING ON CRIME TANKS AMID RISE IN SMASH-AND-GRAB ROBBERIES

In Philadelphia, where police have reported a 13% increase in homicides compared to 2020, District Attorney Larry Krasner sparked a backlash this week after he claimed the city does not have a crime problem.

""We don’t have a crisis of lawlessness, we don’t have a crisis of crime, we don’t have a crisis of violence,"" the district attorney told reporters Monday. ""It’s important that we don’t let this become mushy and bleed into the notion that there is some kind of big spike in crime. There isn't. There is not a big spike in crime. … There is not a big spike in violent crime. Neither one of these things is true.""

Krasner later walked back his comments but fell short of making an apology or changing his remarks.

""I know that some inarticulate things I said earlier this week have offended people. The message conveyed through media sound bites is not at all what I meant,"" Krasner said Thursday. ""Complete answers based on data aimed at solutions to gun violence will be edited down to sound bites. It’s my job to make sure even those sound bites are careful. As someone whose strong support is owed in part to the fact that I don’t communicate or make decisions like a career politician, it is my obligation to do better.""

Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon also recently came under fire amid a surge in violent smash-and-grab robberies in his city. Critics blamed Gascon's zero-bail policies for releasing 14 suspects who were allegedly involved in 11 smash-and-grab robberies last month hours after their arrest.

Gascon defended himself during a press conference last week, blasting what he described as ""fearmongering and misinformation"" regarding crime in L.A. County, The Los Angeles Times reported.

"Fox News Poll: High concern about crime and illegal immigration, two of Biden’s weak spots","As violent crime continues to rise in cities across America and the surge of migrants at the southern border shows no sign of slowing, the latest Fox News Poll finds majorities concerned about these issues. Not coincidentally, majorities disapprove of President Biden on these same issues.

The poll, released Thursday, finds that over 8 in 10 registered voters are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about violent crime (81 percent). Only inflation (86 percent) and political divisions (83 percent) are more worrying. Health care tracks closely behind crime (78 percent).

A second tier of concerns includes China’s growing power (73 percent), unemployment (71 percent), the federal deficit (70 percent), coronavirus (69 percent), opioid addiction (69 percent), illegal immigration (66 percent), and racism (66 percent).

Six in ten are concerned about climate change (60 percent) and attacks by Islamic terrorists (58 percent).

Both Democrats and Republicans share concerns when it comes to certain issues such as inflation (78 percent of Democrats vs. 94 percent of Republicans), violent crime (78 vs. 86), political divisions (84 vs. 83), unemployment (71 vs. 71), and opioid addiction (71 vs. 70).

But the partisan divide still exists in several other areas, as Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be concerned about COVID-19 (92 percent among Democrats vs. 49 percent among Republicans), health care (88 vs. 68), climate change (88 vs. 31), and racism (87 vs. 44). Across the aisle, Republicans are more worried about illegal immigration (89 percent among the GOP vs. 44 percent among Democrats), China (86 vs. 63), the deficit (84 vs. 59), and terrorist attacks (71 vs. 49).

FOX NEWS POLL: HIGH CONCERN OVER HIGHER PRICES

Crime, Police & BLM

When asked if there is more or less crime in their local area compared to a year ago, over half of voters say there is more (57 percent), up from 54 percent in May. Nineteen percent say there is less crime and 20 percent think it’s about the same.

That likely explains why, when it comes to reducing funding for police departments, 63 percent are opposed -- nearly twice the number who are in favor (34 percent). White voters (69 percent) are more likely than Black voters (43 percent) and Republicans (87 percent) more likely than Democrats (39 percent) to oppose reducing police funding.

In addition, almost 8 in 10 voters view their local police favorably (77 percent), up slightly from last summer (74 percent). Majorities across the board feel this way, including Republicans (90 percent), Democrats (66 percent), Hispanic voters (66 percent) and Black voters (60 percent).

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF OF VOTERS ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY

At the same time, the Black Lives Matter movement saw a significant drop in positive views. Sixty-seven percent had a favorable opinion of BLM last June; that number has decreased 18 points, to 49 percent today.

That shift comes mostly from Republicans (44 percent favorable in 2020 to 15 percent today, for a 29-point drop), White evangelical Christians (-27), men (-24) and suburban voters (-18).

Illegal Immigration

As the flow of migrants at the border continues with seemingly no end in sight, voters disapprove of the Biden Administration’s policy to get at its ""root cause"" by increasing U.S. financial support to Central American countries to make conditions there better: 53 percent oppose this, while 38 percent favor it.

This is a reversal from two years ago when 49 percent favored sending money and 44 percent opposed (June 2019).

FOX NEWS POLL: 83% WORRY ABOUT INFLATION, MAJORITY SAYS BENEFITS HURTING ECONOMY

Do people blame the border crisis on the fact that Joe Biden was elected president? Fifty-five percent say his election is ""mostly"" or ""completely"" responsible for the influx, while 20 percent say ""a little"" and 22 percent say ""not at all"" responsible.

Biden’s Ratings

Considering the level of voter concern on these issues, it is not surprising Biden’s worst job ratings are on crime (39 percent approve vs. 51 percent disapprove) and immigration (35-57 percent).

His ratings are better on the economy (47-49 percent) and his best are on coronavirus (54 -42 percent).

Voters are also troubled, to a slightly lesser degree, about taxes (71 percent), the deficit (69 percent), coronavirus (68 percent), and being able to pay bills (63 percent).

While an overwhelming majority are concerned about crime nationally, that falls to about half when asked about criminal activity in their neighborhood (48 percent concerned vs. 51 percent not concerned). That is relatively unchanged from the September and October Fox News surveys (each with a 50-49 percent split).

The pandemic remains the top concern for Democrats (81 percent) followed by inflation (75 percent) and higher crime rates (67 percent) while for Republicans inflation (91 percent), crime rates (84 percent) and taxes (83 percent) round out their top three.

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE UNION: MAYOR'S CRIME CRACKDOWN IS ‘ACKNOWLEDGMENT’ THAT DEFUND POLICE WAS ‘MISTAKE’

What do voters think is causing rising crime rates? When asked to choose from a list of factors, 1 in 5 voters select a ""breakdown of moral values"" (21 percent). There are mixed views among an array of other reasons driving crime; weaker criminal penalties (15 percent), the availability of guns (13 percent), decreased police funding (12 percent), effects of the pandemic (11 percent), and mental health issues (10 percent). The lack of good jobs and more illegal immigration (6 percent each) are less likely to be seen as the primary cause of increased criminal activity.

Democrats are most likely to cite the availability of guns (26 percent), while for Republicans the top reason is the breakdown of moral values (27 percent).

All of this helps explain the 6-point increase in disapproval for President Biden’s job rating on crime: 57 percent disapprove now vs. 51 percent in August.

Democrats (+11 points), seniors (+11), women (+10), and rural voters (+10) are just some of the groups more likely to disapprove of Biden’s performance on crime now compared to August.

""The resurgence of crime as a political issue is a problem for the Democrats,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox polls along with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.

"Josh Shapiro bets tough message on crime, economy will outrun red wave in Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro is leaning into crime and the economy in his campaign for governor this year, even as other fellow Democrats find themselves playing defense on the issues.

Shapiro, who has led nearly all public polling in the race, told Fox News Digital during an interview Thursday that his campaign was tailored toward issues important to voters in the Keystone State.

""I take my cues from Washington County, Pennsylvania, not Washington, D.C.,"" said Shapiro, invoking a heavily Republican county in the southwest part of the state. ""I don't pay a lot of attention to that national stuff, I'm really focused on Pennsylvania and trying to grow our economy here, create jobs here.""

Part of that strategy entails confronting the issues of crime and the economy head on. Polls show that voters across the country are concerned about 40-year high inflation and spiking crime rates in America's cities.

DEMOCRAT JOSH SHAPIRO RECEIVES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS IN PENNSYLVANIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE

In Pennsylvania, in particular, the economy continues to struggle with the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which saw businesses shutter — many never to reopen. As of July, Pennsylvania's unemployment rate was higher than the national average.

The Keystone State has also seen an explosion in violent crime, especially in its most populous city of Philadelphia. As of early August, more than 1,400 people had been shot within the city's limits alone.

FOX NEWS POLL: MORE VOTERS PUT TRUST IN REPUBLICANS TO HANDLE INFLATION, CRIME

Shapiro, who has served as Pennsylvania's chief law enforcement officer since 2017, is not ducking either issue. The attorney general's campaign is championing policies to address both the economic and public safety crisis.

""I want to be a governor that creates jobs in Pennsylvania,"" said Shapiro. ""There's a couple of ways you got to do that. Number one, you got to invest in workforce development … and you have to create an aggressive business environment, which requires us to cut taxes.""

Shapiro specifically is proposing to slash the state's nearly 10% corporate tax rate to 4% by 2025. Pennsylvania's legislature passed legislation earlier this year that would lower the corporate tax rate to 4.99% by 2031, but the attorney general says that does not go far enough quickly enough.

""We have the second-highest business taxes in the nation,"" said Shapiro. ""I want us to be amongst the lowest.""

Having presided over the state's law enforcement infrastructure for nearly six years, however, Shapiro argued that economic growth cannot happen without addressing the rising crime rate.

""We could do great things on education, great things on workforce development and growing the economy,"" he said. ""But if it's not a safe place to live, none of those things are going to take root.""

To bolster public safety, Shapiro is pledging to boost funding for law enforcement and add more than 2,000 police officers across Pennsylvania. The attorney general says that investment must come with accountability measures and a commitment to community policing.

""The more police officers we hire, the more opportunities we have for them to get out of their patrol cars, walk the beat, learn the names of the kids in the communities,"" said Shapiro. ""We [can] create a level of humanity and cooperation between the police and the community that's going to help make us safer.""

G. Terry Madonna, a senior fellow of political affairs at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, told Fox News Digital that Shapiro was triangulating his positions to appeal to conservatives without losing support from fellow Democrats.

""They've looked at the political environment and know that crime and the economy are vulnerable issues for Democrats,"" said Madonna. ""But Shapiro is not letting Republicans own those issues, he's co-opted the tough on crime message.""

Although it is unclear if Shapiro's tactics will succeed in neutralizing GOP attacks on crime and the economy, the strategy seems to be working as several high-profile Pennsylvania Republicans have endorsed him for the governorship.

""I'm a long-time conservative Republican,"" said Jim Schultz, a former Trump White House associate counsel. ""I'm excited about the GOP's chances nationally and in the Senate race here in Pennsylvania, but I also think Josh [Shapiro] has laid out policies that give Republicans a lot to feel good about in supporting him.""

Support for Shapiro from some segments of the Republican base is also due to his GOP opponent, state senator Doug Mastriano.

A retired U.S. Army colonel and military historian, Mastriano has been labeled as far-right by many in the media. The impression is largely because of Mastriano's efforts after the 2020 presidential election to decertify President Biden's victory in Pennsylvania over claims of fraud.

Mastriano even helped organize transportation for protesters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Although in Washington at the time of the incident, Mastriano never breached the Capitol himself.

Shapiro says that Mastriano's actions surrounding the 2020 election and January 6 make him unfit to be governor of Pennsylvania, let alone criticize anyone on the issue of crime.

""He went to the [U.S.] Capitol on January 6, participated in the riot, and understand why — to stop the votes and Pennsylvanians from being counted,"" said Shapiro. ""This guy loves to talk a good game about law and order, but he can't follow the rules.""

Mastriano dismisses such criticism, saying that Shapiro's record as attorney general is the only thing voters have to consider when it comes to weighing which candidate will be better on combating crime.

""We are the 12th highest in the nation when it comes to statewide homicides, eighth highest in overdose poisonings,"" Mastriano told Fox News Digital. ""He's done nothing about these statistics, except they've gotten worse every year on his watch.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-shapiro-bets-tough-message-crime-economy-outrun-pennsylvania-red-wave,N/A
NY Gov. Hochul acknowledges 'there is a crime problem' after calling Republicans 'manipulators' on issue,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday acknowledged that ""there is a crime problem"" in her state as the election looms less than a week away.

Speaking on NY1 ""Mornings On 1,"" Hochul pointed to coordinated efforts by her and New York City Mayor Eric Adams to address mental health issues, tighten security on subways and get guns off the streets to further clamp down on crime.

Hochul has ramped up her tough stance on lawlessness as the election nears, though her Republican opponent, Lee Zeldin, continues to blast her on New York crime rates.

NEW YORK'S TIGHT GOVERNORS RACE MAY BE DECIDED BY DISILLUSIONED DEMOCRATS, ZELDIN SAYS

""I acknowledge there is a crime issue. It’s not new to me because it’s election time, I’ve been working on this throughout my entire time as governor,"" she said.

It is a shift in tone since Hochul appeared on Al Sharpton's MSNBC show Sunday and called Republicans ""master manipulators"" on crime.

""They have this conspiracy going all across America trying to convince people that in Democratic states that they’re not as safe,"" she said. ""Well guess what? They’re also not only election deniers, they’re data deniers.""

The governor went on to argue that violent crime was actually down in her state.

""The data shows that shootings and murders are down in our state by 15% in New York City, down 20% on Long Island where Lee Zeldin comes from,"" she said,

Hochul argued that Zeldin’s stance on guns is counter-productive when it comes to fighting crime.

""He thinks it's all right for 18-year-olds to buy an AR-15,"" she said, adding she changed that law following the Buffalo massacre. ""He thinks it’s OK to not have background checks. He opposes what we call the ‘red flag’ laws.

Lawlessness has been a top talking point for Republicans looking to take Democratic seats in not only gubernatorial campaigns, but throughout congressional races.

Hochul said New York’s high crime rate was a problem she inherited after taking up the governorship following Andrew Cuomo’s early resignation last year.

""Murders and shootings down 15 percent since I’ve been governor,"" she pointed out, adding that she is now to counter property crime, like car theft, is up.

The governor has ramped up her messaging when it comes to tackling crime and ended her latest campaign ad by looking into the camera and saying, ""You deserve to feel safe, and as your governor, I won’t stop working until you do,"" first reported Politico.

The GOP hope Cuomo’s scandals, COVID policies and high crime rates will be enough to persuade New York voters to elect the first Republican candidate to the governor’s office in 20 years.

If elected, Hochul would become the first female candidate voted in as New York’s governor.

Hochul's campaign did not immediately respond for comment.

'PANDEMIC OF VIOLENCE': Lightfoot's record on crime at the forefront of Chicago mayoral election,"The Chicago mayoral election, set to take place early next year, comes amid an unprecedented spike in crime as incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot seeks to defend her post in the mayor's office against numerous challengers.

Several individuals have announced their candidacy in the race ahead of the Nov. 28 filing deadline and will face off in the Windy City's nonpartisan mayoral election slated for Feb. 28.

While there are a number of issues in focus ahead of the election, crime is a central priority for both candidates and voters. Homicides in the deep-blue city rose to their highest number in 25 years in 2021, according to police department records, outpacing New York City and Los Angeles.

Several candidates who aim to serve as Chicago's 57th mayor told Fox News Digital they believe that Lightfoot has not fulfilled promises to make the city a safer environment as they stressed the importance of supporting police and tackling crime head on.

CHICAGO MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT BLASTED OVER CITY'S VIOLENCE AFTER DECRYING COLORADO SHOOTING

""Chicago needs a leader who understands our city, its people, its history and its character. It needs someone who is a consensus builder, someone who is willing to work with everyone from across the city, who doesn’t get into feuds and has a thick skin. None of those things describe our current mayor,"" said Roderick Sawyer, the son of former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer.

Looking to follow in his father's footsteps as mayor, Sawyer, a current member of the Chicago City Council who was elected to represent the South Side’s 6th Ward in 2011, insisted that a ""role such as mayor requires someone who has a history of working on budgets, passing legislation and finding practical solutions.""

""We have a public safety crisis that I won’t claim is entirely the fault of our current mayor, though she certainly hasn’t helped,"" Sawyer said. ""We need to address public safety and crime from a wide variety of angles. We have a level of crime anxiety that affects everyone, even those who don’t live in our most crime-affected areas.""

""Police reform is an important and frequently misunderstood component of crime reduction,"" he added. ""We need a strong police force, but a police department is strongest when it is respected and welcomed in all communities, not feared in some. Reform is not a tool to weaken police but to empower them.""

Sawyer believes that Lightfoot ""does not play well with others"" and ""chooses petty feuds over leadership and her priorities are puzzling at best."" Regarding Lightfoot's ability to lead, Sawyer, who noted that he grew up in a part of Chicago with a high crime rate, said the current mayor ""is not respected or liked by the police department, and yet she has stood in the way of one of her primary campaign promises — meaningful police reform.""

""I have a very positive working relationship with the police in my ward and all over the city — they know me as someone who has been here all of my life and wants to make our department stronger and more effective,"" he said.

Similarly, Frederick Collins, a 29-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department, told Fox that he believes Chicago needs ""a leader who will not only listen to its citizens and their needs, but take charge of the immediate issues plaguing our city and get real results.""

CHICAGO CRIME FRUSTRATIONS MOUNT AGAINST STATE'S ATTORNEY KIM FOXX AS 'MASS EXODUS' CONTINUES: SOURCE

""The citizens of this great city are sick and tired of this unprecedented crime wave, which has now touched neighborhoods like nothing before,"" Collins stated.

Collins, who made an unsuccessful ran for mayor of the city in 2015, said his experience as a law enforcement officer has prepared him with the ability to lead Chicago and ""deploy tactics and methods that would help curb crime and get criminals off our streets.""

""These politicians in this race only have theories and political wish lists on how to deal with crime and no real experience,"" he said. ""Chicago has a litany of problems in need of an immediate resolution, but if we don't get this issue of crime under control, we will not have much of a city left.""

If elected, Collins said one of his first priorities in office would be to ""take the handcuffs off the police and allow them to do their jobs effectively and get rid of the so-called no-chase policy."" Additionally, Collins said he would ""deploy stop and frisk, considering police have body camera technology which would allow greater transparency into justifying why the individual(s) were stopped for reasonable cause.""

Asked about Lightfoot's leadership of the city and whether he believes she has been an effective leader, Collins said, ""No! And here's why. When I speak to potential voters on their doorsteps or at a local grocery store, I ask them what they can point to that made their lives better in this city now than four or five or years ago. They can't name one, and this is no lie.""

""Mayor Lightfoot has her shortcomings, but the voters know this, so I'm not going to focus on her. This is a job interview, and what I will demonstrate to the voters is the time is now to ditch the politicians and hire a public servant who believes in serving the people and not the other way around.""

State Rep. Kambium Buckner, a Democrat who represents the 26th District in the Illinois House of Representatives, is also making crime a focus in the race. ""We need a leader who will fight for Chicago, not against everyone else. We need a leader who is from this city and knows its people. We need a leader who understands how government works on all levels and has the experience to back it up,"" Buckner told Fox.

CHICAGO BLOODY WEEKEND SEES 15 SHOT, INCLUDING GIRL FATALLY STRUCK IN HEAD WHILE ON SIDEWALK

Asked about the most pertinent problems facing Chicago, Buckner said his ""4-Star Plan,"" detailed on his website, will work toward ""a safer and more just Chicago, improved education for all, economic opportunity and recovery, and stabilizing Chicago’s finances.""

""Chicagoans need both increased public safety and increased public security,"" Buckner said. ""Public security is about making sure our law enforcement officers have what they need to protect communities from crime, and public safety is about making sure communities have the resources they need: a quality education, affordable housing, healthcare, and good paying jobs.""

Buckner, a former intern for Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, said Lightfoot ""has not delivered on her promises"" after she ""promised us a safer Chicago and greater investment in the root causes of violence.""

""People across this city have not been this afraid since the crime spikes in the 90s. Not only has the Mayor not delivered, but she has no plan,"" he said. ""I, on the other hand, have a plan and the track record to back it up. I was instrumental in banning ghost guns in Illinois, making us the first state in the Midwest to do so.""

""Chicago is suffering a horrifying pandemic of violence,"" Buckner added. ""Crime, and homicides in particular, is the worst it’s been since 1996. In 2021, a staggering 797 people were murdered, and shootings have gone up 53% since 2018. Carjackings — happening in neighborhoods across the city — have increased over 200% from 2019.""

Buckner said he will address the crime wave in the city with a ""Safer 77 plan,"" which includes ""specifics about improved community policing, co-responder models for mental health crises, and increased security on the CTA to protect both passengers and employees.""

Candidates seeking to run for mayor in Chicago are required to collect at least 12,500 petition signatures from registered voters in the city in order to appear on the ballot. Lightfoot previously told reporters that she would be submitting her signatures on the final possible day to submit petitions in an attempt to garner the final spot on the ballot.

""We will be filing on Nov. 28,"" she said. ""There’s no magic to it, but we’ll wait til the 28th to file, the last day to file, as we did four years ago.""

Under Chicago law, candidates who file on the final day are entered into a lottery for the last spot on the ballot, and candidates who file on the first possible day are entered into a lottery to appear first on the ballot. Candidates who file on those days hope to stand out by appearing at the top or bottom of the ballot in a crowded field of challengers.

Though the numbers of people shot or killed across the city are down this year, there has still been a 35% increase in all reported crimes in 2022, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Despite the rise in crime, Lightfoot has defended her record on the issue as mayor and touted a ""multitiered strategy"" to curb gang and gun crimes in August

San Francisco crime victim celebrates recall of progressive DA: 'A feeling of validation',"A San Francisco crime victim is celebrating the successful Tuesday recall of progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin stemming from backlash over his policies that, some argued, contributed to a massive increase in crime rates across the city.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, John Marble detailed the treatment he said he received from Boudin's office following the alleged crimes perpetrated against him, and expressed gratitude to the voters of San Francisco for opting to make a change.

""I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried last night,"" Marble said, describing the emotion he felt as he watched the election results being reported. ""I think for me, and a lot of victims, it was a feeling of validation, that the things we went through, not only in the crimes we experienced, but in the treatment from the district attorney's office, were real.""

""And I was just so extremely grateful that voters felt that as well,"" he added.

TWITTER REACTS TO PROGRESSIVE DA CHESA BOUDIN BEING OUSTED IN SAN FRAN RECALL: SIGN OF ‘RED WAVE COMING’

Marble, a neurodiversity and autism employment expert who previously worked as a White House staffer in the Obama administration and subsequently on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, detailed parts of his experience of domestic abuse in an opinion piece for the San Francisco Chronicle last week, but told Fox that he was poorly treated by Boudin's office as a witness.

""Throughout nearly two years of interacting with the DA, the considerations were always on the person being prosecuted and not on the safety of the victim,"" he said. ""I was constantly told that it would be better for the DA's case load if I forgot things and forgot prosecution and simply moved.""

Marble explained that his decision to ultimately support the recall came as a result of the ""wrongdoing"" he said he experienced when Boudin's office denied him ""reasonable accommodation as a witness,"" as well as rights he was entitled to as a victim under California's Marsy's Law, or the state's Victims' Bill of Rights.

He specifically cited his denial of safe housing by the Victim Services Division of San Francisco, part of Boudin's office, and said that when he raised questions with prosecutors over such treatment, they threatened to drop all charges against his abuser in an attempt to ""intimidate"" him.

OUSTING CHESA BOUDIN, SAN FRANCISCO'S PROGRESSIVE DA, IS ‘BITTERSWEET,’ RECALL ACTIVIST SAYS

Marble said he made a complaint anyway, that the charges against his abuser were subsequently dropped, and that he was forced to flee his home over fear for his life.

He explained that he was then able to find accommodation in a hotel thanks to a crowdfunding effort.

Marble stated that, as a Democrat, he was ""hesitant"" to openly support Boudin's recall because he had friends who worked for him, but ""thankful"" Democrats were the ones leading the effort.

He expressed hope following the recall that more attention would be paid to the actions of the DA's office and that it would lead to more accountability.

""If we want to make progress, we've actually got to do the work in making that progress,"" Marble said. ""You can believe in criminal justice reform, but you have to marry it with reality and public safety.""

Former Trump adviser Ja'Ron Smith launches public safety coalition to reduce violent crime,"EXCLUSIVE: A former top adviser to President Donald Trump launched a public safety coalition Wednesday that is aimed at reducing violent crime in major cities and lower-socioeconomic communities across the country.

Ja’Ron Smith, who served as special assistant to the president for domestic policy, said he launched the coalition in partnership with center-right organizations and leaders to advance criminal justice reform without enacting soft-on-crime policies pushed by the Defund the Police movement.

""I’ve traveled through many communities that have been plagued by violence and crime,"" Smith said in a statement. ""No one in those communities want to defund the police. They want law enforcement to focus on preventing and solving violent crime.

""Our approach to addressing the current rise in violent crime is comprehensive – adequately fund law enforcement, build upon the smart-on crime reforms enacted during the Trump Administration, and forge partnerships between communities and law enforcement like we’ve seen in Dallas,"" he said. ""These are proven solutions.""

SIX MAJOR CITIES ON PACE TO PASS HISTORIC 2021 CRIME TOTALS HALFWAY THROUGH 2022

The coalition will adhere to four principles outlined in its ""Statement of Principles on Violent Crime,"" which was exclusively provided to Fox News Digital. The first principle is to ""properly fund the police,"" which includes ""clear and transparent"" budget appropriations so that police departments don’t have to rely on bringing in revenue through fines, fees, and forfeitures.

""By ‘defunding’ or making significant cuts to police budgets, law enforcement agencies will be limited in hiring more officers or keep current staffing levels, will likely have to reduce or eliminate certain training or continuing education programs, and will not be able to attract better candidates or maintain these officers due to lack of financial incentives,"" the principle reads.

""We must fund law enforcement through means that do not distort their objectives because every minute they spend on revenue-generating activities is a minute they are not spending on solving or preventing serious crime,"" it adds.

The coalition’s second principle is to ""focus law enforcement time & resources on preventing and solving serious crime."" It argues that police officers are too often bogged down with non-criminal calls, traffic-related incidents, and mental health-related incidents that it prevents them from focusing their time and resources on combating violent crime.

""Instead, proper investment in services that would help treat people with these issues would significantly reduce the time, energy, and resources currently required of law enforcement while providing more successful alternatives that solve the root causes of many individuals’ criminal actions,"" the principle says.

The coalition’s third principle is to ""focus on evidence-based policies that reduce violent crime,"" which promotes the practice of ""focused deterrence,"" targeting specific geographic locations and social networks combined with increased support services in those areas.

""The city of Dallas, Texas has recently implemented many of these strategies, including ‘hot spot’ policing, focused deterrence, ‘clean and green’ strategies, increased social services, and violence interrupters,"" the principle states. ""While most American cities saw increased rates of homicides in 2021, Dallas was able to decrease their homicide rate by 13% from 2020-2021. Additionally, arrests went down 11% during that time period; showing that focusing on the highest risk individuals, rather than strategies casting a wide net amounting to more arrests is a more effective route.""

The coalition’s fourth and final principle is to ""continue to enact smart on crime policies that increase public safety and criminal justice system success,"" which it says will limit unnecessary contact with the criminal justice system for people who pose little to no threat to public safety.

""For example, when a person is charged with a crime, their freedom prior to trial routinely rests on whether they have the means to pay financial bail, rather than their risk to society,"" the principle states. ""This allows those who are a public safety threat to buy their way out of jail, while low-risk defendants stay incarcerated prior to trial simply due to lack of ability to pay even a small amount of bail.""

""States should look to change their constitutions and statutes to provide judges greater discretion to detain pre-trial defendants who pose a serious threat to our communities,"" it adds. ""Additionally, courts should limit unnecessary pre-trial detention for those who pose little to no threat to public safety and simply cannot afford to pay bail.""

The statement of principles is meant to provide a ""blueprint"" for policymakers and law enforcement to reduce violent crime at the local level.

The statement has garnered more than a dozen signatories, including Lazaro ""Larry"" Cosme, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Timothy Head, the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, Emily Seidel, the CEO of Americans for Prosperity, and Alice Johnson, the CEO of Taking Action for Good, whose prison sentence was commuted and eventually pardoned by Trump in August 2020.

Smith, who received the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Award in 2017, was a key architect of the bipartisan First Step Act signed by Trump in 2018. Trump, who received the Bipartisan Justice Award in October 2019 for the First Step Act, thanked Smith for his involvement in the bill during his acceptance speech.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-adviser-jaron-smith-launches-public-safety-coalition-reduce-violent-crime,N/A
"Trump says Durham probe exposing 'the crime of the century,' predicts it's 'just the beginning'","EXCLUSIVE: Former President Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Tuesday, offered fresh reaction to the latest filings from Special Counsel John Durham, predicting the developments are ""just the beginning"" of what’s to come.

Trump was reacting to Durham’s Feb. 11 court filing in which he alleged that ""Tech Executive-1"" and his associates, including a lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign ""exploited"" internet traffic pertaining to a ""particular healthcare provider,"" Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building and the Executive Office of the President of the United States in order to ""establish ‘an inference’ and ‘narrative’"" to then bring to federal government agencies tying Trump to Russia.

CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAWYER SUSSMANN ASKS COURT TO 'STRIKE' DURHAM'S 'FACTUAL BACKGROUND' FROM LATEST FILING

""It looks like this is just the beginning, because, if you read the filing and have any understanding of what took place, and I called this a long time ago, you’re going to see a lot of other things happening, having to do with what, really, just is a continuation of the crime of the century,"" Trump told Fox News. ""This is such a big event, nobody’s seen anything like this.""

Durham alleged in the filing that Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann, who has been charged with making a false statement to a federal agent as part of the special counsel’s investigation, brought Trump-Russia allegations—which Durham said ""relied, in part"" on the ""traffic"" that had been ""assembled"" from the servers—to the FBI, and a second government agency, which has since been identified as the CIA.

Durham, in the section of the filing labeled ""Factual Background,"" states that individuals involved were ""mining"" traffic ""and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.""

Trump told Fox News that he ""didn’t have any"" insight into the allegations included in Durham’s Feb. 11 filing until it was made public.

""Who would think a thing like this is even possible?"" Trump said. ""Durham is also coming up with things far bigger than anybody thought possible—Nobody ever thought a thing like this would be even discussed, let alone an act like this committed.""

Trump added: ""This is treason at the highest level.""

The only individual referenced in Durham's Feb. 11 filing that has been charged as part of the investigation is Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty.

Meanwhile, Trump explained that ""people were suspicious that something was going on"" during the campaign.

""You have experts that do this, but they used experts to do it, and to think they could even think about doing that is not believable and, think—if they do it, foreign countries can do it,"" Trump said, referring to the mining of data from servers. ""What kind of a security system do we have?""

DURHAM PROBE: 'TECH EXECUTIVE-1' SAYS ALLEGATIONS TYING TRUMP TO RUSSIA SHARED WITH CIA

Trump went on to say the arrangement outlined in the filing was a ""stage 1 crime.""

""This is as bad as it gets,"" Trump said.

Late Monday, lawyers for Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty, demanded that the court ""strike"" the ""factual background"" section of Durham’s filing, arguing it will ""taint"" the jury pool ahead of his trial.

""Total nonsense,"" Trump told Fox News. ""They got caught and they’re trying to figure out what to say to dim it a little bit.""

Durham’s indictment against Sussmann, says he told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not doing work ""for any client"" when he requested and held a meeting in which he presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which has ties to the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, Trump said, ""based on what everyone is seeing, Durham may go down as a great hero in this country that will be talked about for years.""

""I gained great respect for John Durham, that he was able to do this, and that he would put it out, because other people knew it and it wasn’t coming out—it just wasn’t coming out,"" Trump said. ""And to think, we went through a whole Mueller scam, and nothing was said.""

CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID TO INFILTRATE TRUMP TOWER, WHITE HOUSE SERVERS TO LINK TRUMP TO RUSSIA, DURHAM FINDS

When asked if he thought Mueller, who investigated whether Trump and his presidential campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election for more than two years, knew about the allegations against individuals tied to the Clinton campaign, Trump said the investigation was focused on ""one side.""

""They weren’t going after it, certainly,"" Trump said. ""They were only going after the one side—they weren’t going after the other.""

Trump added that Mueller’s team ""definitely had blinders on.""

""It’s sad,"" Trump said.

Mueller’s investigation concluded in 2019 and yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.

Meanwhile, Trump criticized the press coverage of Durham's filing.

""Another crime is being committed—and that's the crime of the media,"" Trump said. ""The media is absolutely not—they refuse to talk about it and yet it is 10 times bigger than Watergate.""

He added: ""The press is corrupt and they don’t like to cover it. They’re sort of being forced. It is such a big story, I don’t know that they can play the game much longer.""

Over the weekend, after Fox News first reported on filing, Trump first likened Durham’s allegations to Watergate.

DURHAM PROBE HAS 'ACCELERATED,' WITH MORE PEOPLE 'COOPERATING,' COMING BEFORE GRAND JURY

""It is no different than Watergate, except a much more important location,"" Trump said. ""It is the same theft—just modern day.""

He added: ""It is not even believable.""

At this point, Durham has indicted three people as part of his investigation: Sussmann in September 2021, Igor Danchenko on Nov. 4, 2021 and Kevin Clinesmith in August 2020.

Danchenko was charged with making a false statement and is accused of lying to the FBI about the source of information that he provided to Christopher Steele for the anti-Trump dossier.

Kevin Clinesmith was also charged with making a false statement. Clinesmith had been referred for potential prosecution by the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which conducted its own review of the Russia investigation.

Specifically, the inspector general accused Clinesmith, though not by name, of altering an email about Page to say that he was ""not a source"" for another government agency. Page has said he was a source for the CIA. The DOJ relied on that assertion as it submitted a third and final renewal application in 2017 to eavesdrop on Trump campaign aide Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

A source familiar with the probe told Fox News that Durham's investigation has ""accelerated,"" and more people are ""cooperating"" and coming before the federal grand jury than has previously been reported.

The source told Fox News Monday that Durham has run his investigation ""very professionally,"" and, unlike Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, his activities, and witness information and cooperation status are rarely, if ever, leaked.

""Durham does this right and keeps it a secret,"" the source said, adding that there has been ""much more activity"" in Durham’s investigation ""than has been visible to the public.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-durham-probe-exposing-crime-century-just-beginning,N/A
An aspiring congressional candidate unveils novel campaign slogan: 'Make crime illegal again',"EXCLUSIVE: Washington state congressional candidate Matt Larkin is running on a tough-on-crime platform based on supporting law enforcement in an effort to ""make crime illegal again"" amid skyrocketing crime and failed liberal leadership in Seattle.

Larkin, a Republican who lost his bid for Washington state attorney general to the incumbent Democrat in 2020, plans to challenge sitting Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier for the seat representing the 8th District of Washington.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Larkin said that skyrocketing violent crime, rising homelessness and the growing number of assaults on police officers motivated him to jump into the race.

""There is an astounding failure of left-wing prosecutors to pursue charges against criminals and it makes us all unsafe. They refuse to prosecute crime, and I’m running on a platform to make crime illegal again,"" Larkin told Fox News.

""I can only pray we don’t see another ‘summer of love,’"" said the congressional hopeful.

KANSAS CITY LEADERS PROPOSE DEFUND THE POLICE MEASURE AMID SKYROCKETING CRIME

Last summer, Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan received heavy backlash for her comment referring to a violent occupy protest, known as the ""Capitol Hill Occupied Protest"" (CHOP), in the east precinct of Seattle as a harmless ""summer of love.""

When asked about the rioters in Seattle and in Portland, Oregon, over last summer -- many who attacked courthouses, assaulted police officers and have gone without trials -- Larkin called it a problem, but said he is ""not surprised."" He said that 89% of arrests for all crimes in the city of Seattle go without any resolution.

""Our Seattle city prosecutor refuses to prosecute crime and is making it easier and easier to commit crime,"" said Larkin. ""If crimes go without any resolution, people think they can get away with anything. If you give an inch, criminals will take a mile.""

'SQUAD' DEMS MAY UNRAVEL POLICE-REFORM DEAL IN PUSH TO END QUALIFIED IMMUNITY: 'WEAPON OF STRUCTURAL RACISM'

Violent crime, including murders and kidnappings, has significantly gone up in Seattle over the last few years.

Larkin specifically pointed to troubling statistics revealing that the frequency of human trafficking incidents in Washington state have increased nearly 2,000% over the last few years.

Larkin also told Fox News that Biden's hypocrisy was revealed by the administration's decision to put violence caused by rioters in Seattle over the summer on the backburner, while actively pursing cases against the U.S. Capitol rioters.

This is a ""typical liberal double standard,"" he said. ""If [the democrats] were intellectually honest, they would want to be investigating Portland, they would want to be investigating Seattle, they would want to be investigating the riots all over the country we saw and the anarchy and violence we saw.""

Larkin elaborated, ""These are real violent instances that happened, and to ignore one and actively pursue another, is not leadership. It's sad to see this by the Biden administration, but I am not surprised.""

PORTLAND POLICE SEEKING 5 TEEN SUSPECTS BEHIND BRAZEN BROAD DAYLIGHT ATTACKS

Support for funding the police, not defunding or stripping away resources, is also close to Larkin's heart.

Larkin said that especially over the summer, law enforcement officers were being abused by rioters who were ""literally trying to burn them alive in precincts across Seattle.""

""They threw a flaming spear into the window of an occupied police car and tried to burn the officer alive. These things are real, these are not stories for dramatic effect, these things are really happening,"" said Larkin.

""Law enforcement needs our help, especially since Seattle is still slashing the police budget."" Larkin continued, ""When crime is skyrocketing, that is not the time to cut your law enforcement budget. It is going to exacerbate the problem.""

The 8th district of Washington is a swing district bordering bright blue Seattle. It had been ruled by Republicans since the 1980s until Schrier flipped the seat to the Democrats' column in 2018.

Larkin won the 8th district by over 51% of the vote during the AG race in 2020, and the Washington conservative points to the figure as evidence that the seat can be won by a Republican.

Larkin told Fox News that running for congress is ""a heart mission"" and an unique opportunity to enact real change in the state and across the country.

The longtime Washington native, resides in the state with his wife and four young children. He received his law degree from Gonzaga University and previously worked in the George W. Bush White House and as a criminal prosecutor.

"Alex Murdaugh trial: Video illustration shows crime scene where Paul, Maggie were murdered","Warning: Details in this report contain graphic content.

WALTERBORO, S.C. – A video from 3D imaging company FARO depicts a visual representation of dog kennels on Alex Murdaugh's 1,700-acre hunting estate known as Moselle in Islandton, South Carolina, where his wife and son were murdered on June 7, 2021.

The 3D property representation was presented in court Wednesday to depict the scene of the double murder.

Alex Murdaugh is accused of shooting his son, Paul, ad his wife, Maggie, that evening using two different firearms. Murdaugh claims he was never at the family's dog kennels that evening and was napping during the time of the murders.

Maggie Murdaugh's body was found near a single dog house on the property and Paul Murdaugh's body was found next to a row of dog kennels nearby, where he had recorded a video of a chocolate lab just minutes before his death, according to prosecutors.

AELX MURDAUGH TRIAL: CURCIAL VIDEO COULD COMPLICATE DOUBLE MURDER DEFENSE

Prosecutors argue that the voices of Alex Mudaugh, Maggie Murdaugh and Paul Murdaugh can be heard in a video that Paul took at 8:44 p.m. at the dog kennels on the night of the murders. Prosecutors presented the video in court several times on Wednesday.

ALEX MURDAUGH TRIAL WRAPS TUESDAY WITH TESTIMONY ABOUT MAGGIE MURDAUGH'S PHONE CALLS

Paul's friend, Rogan Gibson, testified that he was 100% sure he can hear Paul's, Maggie's and Alex Murdaugh's voices in the video.

Aelx Murdaugh appeared to cry in the Colleton County courtroom when the video was played aloud and visible to the jury for the first time.

AOC's 'defund the police' report card flunks statistics test as NYC crime spike rattles communities,"This is the fourth part of a Fox News Digital series about ""defund the police"" politicians and crime in the areas they represent.

Even with Big Apple murder rates similar this year compared to last, other major crimes have surged, police statistics show — and polls find New Yorkers are fed up.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been one of the most vocal and high-profile lawmakers to demand the defunding and dismantling of American police departments, including in her own district, where major crime has climbed steadily over the past two years.

When former Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed slashing the NYPD’s budget by $1 billion in 2020, she called it a ""disingenuous illusion"" and doubled down.

SAN FRANCISCO DEFUNDED THE POLICE BEFORE REVERSING COURSE NEXT YEAR AMID CALLS FOR ‘ACCOUNTABILITY’

""Defunding police means defunding police,"" she said at the time. ""It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.""

But public safety costs money, according to experts, and residents are concerned for their own welfare.

DO AOC'S CONSTITUENTS BACK HER CALL TO DEFUND POLICE AS VIOLENT CRIME SURGES IN THE DISTRICT?

""When you don’t have the funding to put enough people in your detective bureau to investigate and clear those serious crimes like homicide, of course your clearance rate is going to be abysmal,"" Betsy Brantner Smith, a retired police sergeant and spokesperson for the National Police Association, told Fox News Digital. ""Also, look at programs like community policing: the better relationship you have with your community as a police department the more info you’re going to get out of your citizens when it comes to serious crime.""

According to Brantner Smith, the progressive narrative that police officers are ""terrorizing"" minority communities is a dangerous myth. The NYPD, in particular, has a majority of its roster made up of minority officers.

‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ ADVOCATE ILHAN OMAR'S CITY EXPERIENCES SHARP INCREASES IN MAJORITY OF CRIMES, DATA SHOWS

""Her safety’s never in jeopardy, but all those crime victims in her district, they have to worry about their safety,"" Brantner Smith said. ""If all these defund the police politicians had to walk the same streets as their constituents they would sing a very different tune, but they don’t.""

""Bellwether"" Crimes

New York City's homicide rate has remained relatively flat over the past two years. But after the slaying of George Floyd in Minneapolis fueled a national ""defund the police"" campaign, which Ocasio-Cortez endorsed, NYPD statistics show dramatic increases in other major crimes.

According to Paul Mauro, an attorney and former NYPD inspector, key major crimes to watch are robberies and burglaries — highly invasive profit-motivated crimes that often involve repeat offenders.

MOUNTED NYPD OFFICER CHASES DOWN ROBBERY SUSPECT IN TIMES SQUARE, VIDEO SHOWS

""Particularly robberies, as a robbery is essentially larceny plus violence,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Rising robbery numbers are very detrimental to a sense of street safety. Someone is taking your stuff, and they're willing to hurt you to do it — and they're doing it right on the street in your neighborhood.""

He wrote a recent Fox News Digital opinion piece on the ""defund"" movement.

Citywide crime statistics show that major crimes have increased by more than 36.64% so far this year over 2021 and increased another 37.35% since 2020. Robberies and burglaries, Mauro’s bellwethers, climbed by 39% and 32%, respectively.

In precincts that police portions of Ocasio-Cortez’s middle- and working-class district, the numbers have also increased.

In the NYPD’s 43rd Precinct, covering the Southeast Bronx, robberies soared 70% between the start of the year and Aug. 7, the most recent date for which statistics are available.

Burglaries were up more than 30%. To the north in the 45th Precinct, robberies were up more than 12% this year compared to last but more than double the 2020 total. In the 49th, robberies also climbed, but burglaries were down significantly — 20% lower than 2021 and almost 30% lower than 2020.

NEW YORK CITY FATHER ATTACKED IN FRONT OF 5-YEAR-OLD SON IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, VIDEO SHOWS

In the 114th, a relatively safe area that covers parts of Astoria, Woodside and Jackson Heights in Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional district, year-to-date robberies were up nearly 20% compared to 2021 and more than 56% higher than in 2020. Burglaries were up 7% and 30.2%.

In the 108th, which covers parts of Ocasio-Cortez’s constituency as well as the affluent Long Island City neighborhood, which is outside of her congressional district, robberies climbed by 71% and 84.4% over the past two years. Robberies were up more than 75% in the neighboring 109th Precinct, near the Mets’ Citi Field.

""As Willie Sutton said, he robbed banks because 'that's where the money is,'"" Mauro told Fox News Digital. ""Recidivist robbery, burglary and larceny felons do what they do where they do it because that's where the money is. If you look at AOC's district — which encompasses comparatively safe commands — a major reason you see crime rising there is because for many perps that's where the money is.""

NEW YORK CITY MAN STABS CHASE BANK SECURITY GUARD IN NECK, POLICE SAY

These types of crimes can’t be countered with mental health services and social workers as ""defund"" supporters have suggested, according to Joseph Giacalone, an adjunct professor at New York City’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the former commanding officer of the NYPD’s Bronx Cold Case Squad.

""The social workers are only designed to deal with emotionally disturbed people, bring in the homeless,"" he said. ""They're not there to help fight crime.""

MAN IN NYC CAUGHT ON CAMERA TRYING TO SNATCH FRENCH BULLDOG FROM OWNER IN UPSCALE OFFICE BUILDING

Well before the ""defund"" movement took off in 2020, experts said well-funded police departments performed better on tackling crime, maintaining community relations and reducing use of force compared to their cash-starved counterparts.

""While there are always better ways to allocate police resources, cutting budgets means fewer cops and detectives, less money for equipment and computer applications, less money for civilian crime analysts, less ability to promote deserving officers, more reliance on overtime, etc.,"" Mauro said. ""It is downward pressure on the efficacy of any department. How anyone could believe massively defunding police departments would somehow lower crime beggars belief.""

And it’s not just defunding that’s hurting the NYPD’s ability to tackle crime, according to the experts. It’s a combination of low morale, officers retiring early or taking jobs in smaller departments, and bail reforms that put repeat offenders back on the streets, sometimes within hours of their arrests.

""Somebody needs to show me where the word reform is synonymous with good,"" Giacalone said. ""Murders are down, but the other six [major] crimes are absolutely awful. We’ve lost about 20 years’ worth of gains in New York City.""

But Ocasio-Cortez in September co-signed a letter calling on New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to shut down the city’s Rikers Island jail and release everyone inside.

""The people of New York City have to wake up and vote these people out,"" said Giacalone, who added that he typically avoids discussing politics. ""I don't care how much you like them — they've done nothing for you but create misery.""

What do New Yorkers want?

While Ocasio-Cortez has kept mum about the ""defund"" movement on Twitter since December 2020, her endorsement of a pro-""defund"" New York State Assembly candidate earlier this year prompted the incumbent Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, D-Harlem, to state flatly, ""My community opposes defunding the police,"" the New York Post reported in May.

She won her primary, fending off the Ocasio-Cortez-backed progressive challenger.

The latest Spectrum News NY1/Siena College New York City Poll found in June that only 5% of New Yorkers thought the city was doing an excellent job fighting crime, compared to 45% who said they thought the city was doing a poor job.

Just 9% of the respondents said they thought the city was doing an excellent job ""transforming the NYPD into a force that serves and protects all New Yorkers,"" compared to 33% who viewed the progress poorly.

The same poll found that 70% of New Yorkers felt less safe than they did at the start of 2020, and a combined 76% were very or somewhat concerned that they could become a victim of a crime.

Election statistics compiled by FiveThirtyEight after the Democratic mayoral primary last year show Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain and the most prominent pro-police candidate at the time, surged to victory with the support of some of the city’s most crime-stricken communities in the South Bronx and Brooklyn North.

""I think Adams really cares — but he's fighting half the city council who's against him every step of the way. He's got senators and congressmen against him, and he's got the Albany crowd totally against him."" said Giacalone, who wrote about the mayor's struggles last year. ""None of these people live in the areas that are affected most by the crime.""

"As Walmart CEO warns of crime wave's impact on retail, reports show how thieves brazenly rip off stores","Businesses across the country have been battered by crime this year, including retail behemoth Walmart. As shoppers flock to stores this holiday season, even Walmart’s CEO warned this month that the uptick in crimes need to end or consumers could see higher prices and even stores shutting down.

""Theft is an issue. It’s higher than what it has historically been,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" earlier this month. He added that if the crime wave is not halted soon and if prosecutors don't bring charges against shoplifters, ""prices will be higher, and/or stores will close.""

Crime has weighed heavily on retailers across the country this year, ballooning to a $100 billion problem, the National Retail Federation reported earlier this year. Walmart competitor Target reported this year that shoplifting incidents have ​​increased 50% year over year, causing $400 million in losses.

Some criminals, however, have gotten even more creative and bolder than shoplifting just a few items in well-known and relied upon stores such as Walmart, reports show.

WALMART CEO DOUG MCMILLON SAYS THEFT IS 'HIGHER THAN WHAT IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN'

This month, a pair of Pennsylvania residents were busted by police for participating in a multi-state Walmart crime spree that has left the store with at least $25,000 in losses.

Police were called to a Walmart location in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, on Dec. 5 and arrested 37-year-old Tammi Koch, who is accused of repeatedly filling shopping carts with items ranging from baby clothes to computer accessories and brazenly walking out the doors of the stores. Police also arrested ​​21-year-old John Setser in the scheme, and authorities say there are other suspects in the case.

""They are converting stores to more self-checkouts with less employees. Self-checkout is where most theft happens.""

Koch would allegedly fill a shopping cart with goods, then pass the cart off to Sester in the self-checkout line to subvert security at the stores and then simply walk out with the merchandise.

WALMART EMPLOYEE IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA, KILLS 6 WITH PISTOL, POLICE SAY

In another case last month, a couple managed to confuse a Walmart cashier and stole more than $6,000 in merchandise and gift cards, according to authorities. They allegedly went to the checkout line with a cart full of expensive merchandise, and tricked the cashier into believing they paid by using multiple credit cards and then asked the cashier to use the ""cash"" button to ostensibly make a credit card work. The sale was then rung up as a cash payment so that no card was charged.

In Texas, a man described as a ""magician"" by local police managed to steal $2,700 from Walmart cashiers with ""a quick-change scheme"" in two separate incidents in January and February.

The scheme is when criminals use large bills for inexpensive products at checkout, and when the cashier hands back the change, the criminal will slip some of the money into their pocket and tell the cashier they miscounted. The cashier will then recount the money and make up the difference that the thief has already taken.

GEORGIA COUPLE TRICKS WALMART CASHIER, EASILY WALKS OUT OF STORE WITH THOUSANDS IN MERCHANDISE: POLICE

Walmart employees and customers have recently pointed to self-checkout lanes as helping fuel the theft surges. Dishonest people are reportedly using the lack of supervision at self-checkout lanes to slip unpaid merchandise into their carts and walking out of the stores.

""Theft is horrible at my store,"" an anonymous Walmart employee in Spokane, Washington, told Insider this month. ""If corporate actually visited at the store level and spoke with actual employees that deal with the theft, they might see how to fix the problem.

""They are converting stores to more self-checkouts with less employees. Self-checkout is where most theft happens.""

A Walmart representative told Insider the store is ""continually exploring effective ways to protect merchandise, keep prices low and provide a safe environment for the millions of customers we serve weekly.""

Thefts aren’t the only crimes that unfold at Walmarts.

""You need to be very careful when you go in there, especially this time of year. Take those extra few seconds to look around. Familiarize yourself with your environment and who and what is out there.""

FLORIDA MAN BUSTED AFTER TRYING TO STEAL FROM WALMART FILLED WITH COPS: 'BAD IDEA, BRAD'

There have been at least three shootings at Walmart locations in the last month, including a mass shooting carried out by a Walmart employee.

Chesapeake, Virginia, Walmart supervisor Andre Bing shot and killed six employees at the store in November. The big box store had investigated Bing two years prior to the tragedy for his odd behavior.

""Andre did a lot of weird things,"" former co-worker Nathan Sinclair said, according to the New York Post. ""Andre was an aggressive person.""

Days after the shooting in Virginia, a 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in a Walmart parking lot.

On Dec. 7, shots rang out at a suburban Atlanta Walmart near the store’s automotive repair center. Two groups of people reportedly got into a dispute at the Walmart, leading to one person getting shot.

A security consultant and former police chief, Mike Jones, told WRIC following the fatal shooting of the 17-year-old in Virginia that ""parking lots are the Wild West of the retail market.""

""You need to be very careful when you go in there, especially this time of year,"" Jones said. ""Take those extra few seconds to look around. Familiarize yourself with your environment and who and what is out there.""

STUART VARNEY: WALMART’S WARNING ABOUT SHOPLIFTING SHOULDN’T COME AS A SURPRISE

Fox News Digital reached out to Walmart about its security measures, but did not receive a response by time of publication.

Walmart has a slew of security measures in place to prevent theft and violence, according to a review of its website. The company has teams of security analysts who work to identify threats and vulnerabilities in their stores, as well as investigators who look into crime and fraud and security risk managers who assess the stores.

""We’ve got safety measures, security measures that we’ve put in place by store location. I think local law enforcement being staffed and being a good partner is part of that equation, and that’s normally how we approach it,"" Walmart CEO McMillon added in his interview with CNBC.

Bodycam footage released in Murdaugh trial shows grisly crime scene,"A sniffling Alex Murdaugh can be seen standing in between the bodies of his wife and son, which are blurred out, in newly released body camera footage shown at his double murder trial.

Corporal Buford ""Chad"" McDowell, with the Colleton County Sheriff's Office, was the second first responder to arrive at the sprawling hunting estate in Islandton, South Carolina, June 7, 2021.

He was responding to a hysterical 911 call placed minutes earlier by Murdaugh, who had reported finding his wife and son ""badly shot.""

Once on the property, McDowell walked by the dog kennels and the body of 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh, who had been fatally shot twice with a shotgun.

ALEX MURDAUGH: TIMELINE OF ONCE-POWERFUL SOUTH CAROLINA LAWYER'S SPECTACULAR DOWNFALL

His mother, Maggie Murdaugh, 52, can be seen to McDowell's right about 30 feet away, as the incessant sound of barking dogs can be heard in the background.

""Her name is Maggie Murdaugh,"" Alex Murdaugh, choking back tears, can be heard saying to Sgt. Daniel Greene, as McDowell approached.

""How are you doing?"" the once revered attorney, who worked as a volunteer prosecutor at the time, asked McDowell.

The 40-minute video was shown to jurors when McDowell testified Jan. 26 but was only released to the public Monday.

ALEX MURDAUGH'S LEGAL DREAM TEAM STRATEGIZES AT LUXE SOUTH CAROLINA ESTATE

Murdaugh is accused of gunning down his wife and son to create a diversion, so his alleged theft of nearly $9 million from his law firm and clients wouldn't be exposed, according to prosecutors.

In the footage, deputies can be seen placing a pink sheet over both bodies. McDowell told them that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) was on the way and not to disturb the scene.

McDowell can also be seen identifying shell casings on the ground. At one point, McDowell asked the other deputies, ""You all familiar with this family?""

""I wasn’t until you told me the names,"" Greene responded.

""I’ll fill you in later,"" the deputy replied. He later theorized that the crime has got to be ""retaliation"" against the powerful family.

Later in the video, McDowell and other deputies can be seen lifting the sheet from Paul's body, which was face-down, to check for a weapon. The door to the feedroom can be seen splattered with blood.

ALEX MURDAUGH'S STEERING WHEEL TESTED POSITIVE FOR BLOOD, INVESTIGATOR SAYS

""I don't think he put that phone back on his behind,"" McDowell said of Paul's iPhone, which was resting on top of his back pocket. Murdaugh told investigators he had put the device there after picking it up.

Toward the end of the video, McDowell can be heard theorizing with other deputies about what happened.

""His brain matter is on the ceiling in there, so he was shot at an upward angle with a shotgun wad laying on the floor that would point to suicide,"" McDowell suggested. ""That doesn’t explain her (Maggie).""

Monday marked the fourth week of Murdaugh's trial. The day was dominated by testimony from forensic scientist Sara Zapata, of SLED's DNA department.

"California saw increase in killings, violent crime in 2021, according to released report","California saw an uptick in violent crime in 2021, including an increase in homicides, according to data released Friday by state officials.

The figures are part of the California Criminal Justice Statistical Report released by state Attorney General Rob Bonta.

""While crime rates remain significantly below their historical highs, property and violent crimes continue to have devastating consequences for communities across the state,"" he said in a statement. ""Gun violence in particular remains a consistent and growing threat.""

According to the data, California saw a 7.2% increase in homicides 2,202 in 2020 to 2,361 in 2021. The latest figure is far from the state's historical high of 4,095 murders in 1993. Around three-quarters of the killings involved a firearm, Bonta's office said.

HALF-NAKED MINNESOTA LAWYER BEAT EX-WIFE TO DEATH IN FRONT OF HORRIFIED CHILDREN: CRIMINAL COMPLAINT

Homicide arrests dipped by nearly 3% but remained above the 10-year average of 1,478.2 homicide arrests per year, the report said.

Among California counties with populations of 100,00 or more people, Kern County, just north of Los Angeles County, had the highest murder rate of 9.5 killings. Placer County experienced the lowest rate and Napa and Shasta counties reported no killings at all.

Violent crime in general increased 6.7% in counties with populations of 100,000 or more. The property crime rate increased 3% while arrest rates decreased from 7.3% last year. Several parts of the state were plagued last year with escalating crime rates.

The Los Angeles and San Francisco areas saw a steep rise in retail thefts caught on social media, prompting concerns from business groups and corporations.

Of the 19,355 juvenile arrests made last year, nearly 50% were for felony offenses, while 77% of the suspected offenders were referred for probation.

The report comes as certain areas of the state continue to be plagued by violent crime. Los Angeles County continues to combat follow-home robberies in which victims are followed by suspects from one location to another. Much of the crime began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and continued as many cities adopted criminal justice reform policies like zero-bail and slashed funding to police departments.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-increase-killings-violent-crime-2021-report,N/A
California violent crime tripled as suspects walked free without bail: reform study,"A new study comparing California repeat offenders who posted bail with those who were let out with low or no cost under ""Zero Bail"" policies found that the latter group reoffended more often, more quickly and were accused of 200 times more violent crimes.

""The impacts of zero bail on violent crime are obvious, and they're horrific,"" said Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig, whose office published the study. ""I mean, we have more people being shot at, stabbed, assaulted, robbed, beaten. These are real victims – and the numbers are staggering under zero bail.""

Under an emergency zero-bail rule at the height of the coronavirus pandemic meant to minimize jail crowding, bail costs were ""dramatically reduced,"" often to $0, according to the study.

After looking at the results, Reisig told Fox News Digital that they show ""zero bail is a completely failed policy"" and said his goal is for lawmakers to have the data compiled and available to them as the state's legislative session resumes.

CALIFORNIA MEN ACCUSED OF COMMITTING RAPES, MURDER AFTER BEING RELEASED ON BAIL

""It was really important to do this study to have data available to those lawmakers in California who continue to believe that this is the answer to all of the problems in the criminal justice system, that zero bail is somehow going to make things better,"" Reisig said. ""And it's not. It's just going to make everything more dangerous.""

The new study comes as a follow-up to an August examination of crime in Yolo County, which Reisig said received criticism for not having a control group. So this time, the analysis compared bailed out individuals with zero-bail suspects.

Key findings from the study indicate suspects released without bail were rearrested on 163% more charges than those who posted bail, and they reoffended 70% more often. Those reoffenses resulted in felony charges 90% more often – and they were accused of three times as many violent crimes.

""We saw violent crime going up as soon as zero bail was implemented in our county by court order,"" Reisig said. ""And despite all of our best efforts to try and stop the practice, we were forced to continue to do the zero-bail system, and we saw our communities suffer as a result.""

No-bail suspects also, on average, were arrested on new charges within 129 days – 56 days sooner than those who posted bail. And domestic violence suspects in particular also saw a shocking spike in recidivism.

""Every single individual and every case should be evaluated by a judge, an independent magistrate, who can look at that person's criminal history, look at the facts of the current case and make an informed decision about what their risk level is and what's it going to take to make sure that they don't go out and harm somebody again,"" Reisig said. ""That needs to happen in every case.""

Suspects who post bail have a financial stake in both their own freedom and their cooperation with the court, Reisig noted.

""It is also psychologically much harder to plead guilty and surrender to serve time when you’re out of custody and enjoying freedom,"" said Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles trial attorney and former federal prosecutor. ""That’s why criminal defendants in custody plead and accept responsibility at a higher percentage than those out on bail.""

Jailed suspects also get credit for time served, he said.

""Many of us saw this coming and sounded the alarm,"" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""All we got for it was the label 'fear-mongerer.'""

The Yolo County study indicates those fears may be well placed. And so does the story of Mary Kate Tibbitts, who was killed in her own Sacramento home in 2021.

""These politicians have blood on their hands, much blood, and including the blood of my sister."" — Dan Tibbitts, brother of Mary Kate Tibbitts, whose suspected killer was out on zero bail

In September of that year, police accused Troy Davis, now 54, of murder, rape, malicious maiming of animals and arson after they say he broke into the 61-year-old woman's house, attacked her, killed her dogs and lit the building on fire.

Davis had gone free without bail months earlier on a car theft charge and skipped at least one court date before the attack, records show. Sacramento police arrested him a day after the slaying and revealed he was also an ex-con out on parole with outstanding felony warrants.

Dan Tibbitts, the victim's brother, told Fox News Digital that California's Propositions 47 and 57, which reduced certain crimes to misdemeanors and lowered the number of inmates in state prisons, led to Davis' prior early release.

""These politicians have blood on their hands, much blood, and including the blood of my sister,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""They are doing this pushing their social justice agenda. They are attempting to victimize the criminals and are ignoring the true victims, those who suffer at the hands of the criminals, innocent people like my sister.""

Chicago crime crisis: 7 carjackings reported in 1 hour on West Side,"In just one hour, seven carjackings were reported on Chicago’s West Side on Friday morning, police confirmed to Fox News Digital.

The victims were held at gunpoint in some of the alleged carjackings, which took place on several streets, including North Campbell, North Rockwell, North Hoyne, North Damen and North Claremont, Chicago Police said in a statement.

No arrests had been made by Saturday afternoon but the suspects were described as dark-skinned men aged 18-30 wearing black clothes and ski masks and in one case a blue skull cap.

"Nation's capital grapples with violence, juvenile crime as DC leaders look for answers","Crime has been rising in Washington, D.C., since the spring of 2020, as local officials continue to disagree over the root causes of the violence.

""You'll get a group of kids that steals a car at gunpoint. And there could be violence there, where they assault somebody or pistol-whip somebody,"" Gregg Pemberton, chair of the D.C. Police Union, told Fox News Digital. ""We see people shot during armed carjackings. Then, they'll take the car and use the stolen car to commit other crimes. They'll drive to other neighborhoods, rival neighborhoods, and they'll shoot people. Then they'll leave. They'll commit robberies of gas stations or convenience stores.""

Pemberton says politics has gotten in the way of public safety. Other local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have blamed the rising crime trend on ""the easy access of weapons."" Officials have also pointed to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Statistics

In 2021, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) reported 226 homicides — the highest annual murder count seen in the nation’s capital in nearly 20 years. Only 42% of those homicide investigations were closed.

In 2022, homicides are down 6% year-to-date, with 59 reported so far this year compared to 63 at this time last year. The number of assault incidents with deadly weapons remains unchanged, with 457 reported this year compared to 455 reported last year, and robberies are up 54%, with 803 incidents reported this year compared to 521 at the same time last year.

DC HOMICIDES COST TAXPAYERS $1.53M PER MURDER, NEARLY $1B PRICE TAG FOR ALL SHOOTINGS LAST YEAR: STUDY

Total violent crime is up 25%, and property crime is up 7%.

Examples

On April 22, four people were injured in a shooting in D.C.'s Van Ness neighborhood after suspect Raymond Spencer fired an estimated 200 rounds from an apartment window before killing himself, according to authorities. The shooting occurred less than two weeks after four people were injured in a shooting near Nationals Park.

""Unfortunately, I had to look in parents' eyes tonight who are terrified, and they were terrified thinking of what might happen to their children,"" Bowser said during an April 22 press conference after the shooting. ""And we have experienced this too much in our country — the epidemic of gun violence. The easy access of weapons has got to stop. People should not be scared taking their children to school.""

Motor vehicle theft, theft from auto and ""other"" auto incidents are also up compared to last year, and experts say auto-related incidents often lead to violence. Juveniles have made up the majority of carjacking suspects over the last two years.

MPD has arrested multiple juveniles between the ages of 13 and 15 in recent weeks ranging from unarmed and armed carjackings to armed robberies. On April 21, authorities announced the arrest of a 13-year-old boy charged in connection to two stolen auto incidents, two assaults, two unarmed carjackings and three armed carjackings, one of which included an assault with a hammer.

D.C. City Council candidate Nate Fleming became the victim of an armed carjackin g that occurred in broad daylight at a gas station in January.

DC ALLEGED ‘SNIPER' FIRED MORE THAN 200 ROUNDS FROM 5TH FLOOR, SET UP CAMERAS TO WATCH COPS: POLICE

""I’m shocked, angry and a bit embarrassed,"" Fleming said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""To be threatened at gunpoint is shocking, but I am not surprised to have been attacked given the crisis we are facing with carjackings and violence in general in our city. Increasing public safety is at the heart of why I’m running for a citywide Council seat.""

In February, an armed suspect carjacked a vehicle near Capitol Hill with the victim and her 11-month-old child still inside. The victim told police the suspect said, ""Keep screaming and I'm gonna stab you,"" according to a police report.

Guns

Mayor Bowser and President Biden have blamed gun violence and ghost guns for rising crime in not only the nation's capital but in other major U.S. cities, as well.

Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) after being recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations— which the White House said is a ""ten-fold increase"" from 2016. In D.C., specifically, the number of ghost guns recovered from the streets jumped to a record high in 2021. District authorities recovered 25 ghost guns in 2018, 116 in 2019, 282 in 2020 and 313 in 2021, according to NBC 4 Washington.

BIDEN ANNOUNCED RULE MAKING ‘GHOST GUNS’ ILLEGAL AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE GUN CRIME STRATEGY

Biden on April 11 announced that the Justice Department had issued its long-awaited final rule to rein in the proliferation of ""ghost guns,"" making it illegal for a business to manufacture firearms without serial numbers. The president has also recently called for ""universal background checks,"" an ""assault weapons"" ban and a ban on ""high-capacity magazines.""

Bowser on April 25 announced a new Violent Crime Impact Team comprised of local and federal partners to help recover illegal firearms and apprehend criminals.

""We cannot allow people to terrorize our communities with guns,"" Bowser said in a statement at the time. ""This is about using a whole-of-government approach, but it’s also about focusing our attention and resources on exactly where we know the problem is. Our message is clear – we will continue to offer people in our city a better path forward, but if people choose to engage in violence, then they will be held accountable.""

Bowser had also introduced a plan for the MPD to reach 4,000 sworn-in MPD officers through her 2023 Fair Shot Budget, which invests $30 million for hiring, recruitment, and retention incentives for the department.

Politics

While Pemberton, chair of the D.C. Police Union, agrees that part of the issue of rising crime in D.C. is the lingering impact of the pandemic, he also blames the trend on politics.

When police question juveniles ""about their involvement"" in a crime, the juveniles ""are telling the detectives that they know there's no penalty, so they don't care,"" Pemberton explained, naming D.C. District Attorney Karl Racine's Restorative Justice Model as a reason why.

The model allows juveniles charged with violent crimes to take part in a restorative program that includes connecting with victims and therapy instead of being prosecuted with the goal of decreasing the likelihood that the same juvenile offender will commit future crimes. The office of the attorney general is the sole prosecutor for juvenile offenses.

""There's just this lackadaisical sort of laissez-faire attitude about committing these crimes because they know that even when they go in front of a judge in D.C. Superior Court, and even if they're convicted, it's likely not going to be any significant penalty,"" Pemberton said.

Pemberton also blames D.C. City Council policies introduced since the May 2020 killing of George Floyd — a tragedy that occurred shortly after COVID-19 swept across the U.S. and led local and national lawmakers to hastily introduce police-reform bills.

2 VICTIMS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT AFTER ENTERING CAR THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR RIDESHARE IN DC

Such policies ""have multiple consequences,"" one of which includes officer retention rates, Pemberton said.

""We've seen almost 700 officers leave over the past two years, and that's a significant number of them,"" the union chair said. ""… Right now, it's our total strength in sworn-in police officers is right around 3,500. The mayor is saying that we need 4,000. The chief agrees with that. The union agrees with that. I think … the minimum that we should have is 4,000.""

The D.C. Police Union directly blames increasing D.C. crime on City Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, as well as Judiciary and Public Safety Committee Chairman Charles Allen, in a new advertisement campaign. Allen introduced the"" Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Act"" in 2020, and Mendelson introduced the ""Strengthening Oversight and Accountability of Police Amendment Act"" in 2021.

Pemberton specifically took issue with Mendelson's bill, introduced in July of last year, which publicizes an officer's entire personnel record for the entirety of that officer's career. It also makes public certain victim and witness information.

""Wat it does is it takes the Office of Police Complaints [OPC], which is a civilian agency outside of the MPD … that handles complaints, and just completely gives them carte blanche to investigate any police officer about any issue,"" Pemberton said. ""This is [a] very biased agency that comes up with some pretty ridiculous allegations against our officers. And of the allegations they make against our officers … only 8% of the complaints that come in are sustained against our members.""

Pemberton added that the council is ""not willing to listen"" to police, who want accountability within the MPD but do not want policies that will make police recruitment and retention more difficult.

D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee said during an October 2021 hearing that Mendelson's bill ""goes too far,"" not because he does not want ""police accountability"" but because it treats MPD officers, ""the overwhelming majority of whom serve our community faithfully, unfairly.""

""It is because it will bog the Department down in endless bureaucracy that will prevent the agency from effectively and efficiently serving the city. And it is because it does not protect the privacy interests of everyone who is victimized by crime or chooses to work with the Department,"" Contee said at the time.

Mendelson's office shared a statement from the chairman last month saying the legislation ""would strengthen police accountability.""

DC MEN CHARGED WITH IMPERSONATING FEDERAL AGENTS PLEAD NOT GUILTY

""This has nothing to do with public safety, as they’ve alleged. Creating a Deputy Auditor of Public Safety, and making it harder for the [fraternal order of police] to defend one of their own for excessive use of force does not increase carjackings or homicides,"" the council chairman said. ""Moreover, the legislation says nothing about the number of officers, nor the police budget. What it does is makes sure DC Police are held accountable. I am not against an increase in Police officers, I want more police. But I want the kind of police who can be held responsible for wrongdoing.""

The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital. Allen and several other councilmembers also did not respond or declined comment.

Impact

D.C.'s population fell by about 3%, representing a loss of more than 20,000 residents, in 2021, the D.C. Policy Center reported on March 25, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The percentage represents a record-high exodus from the District over the last two decades, the Policy Center reported.

Additionally, D.C.'s population growth rate is -2.9% compared to the national rate of 0.12% and the Washington metropolitan area rate of 0.46%.

""The District had the lowest rates of domestic and net migration among all states, and though its birth, international migration, and natural growth rates ranked second, third, and fourth respectively, those gains were not at all enough to compensate the losses,"" the Policy Center said in its report.

Pemberton said victims of crime are being left out of the conversation.

""People who have been raped or robbed or shot or burglarized or whose families have been murdered — those are the voices that get silenced in this debate,"" he said. ""It's really just an issue between activists on one side that say policing is aggressive and all of the other rhetoric that gets spewed out. And police officers who are saying, ‘Hey, we need to be able to do our job to protect these communities.’ That's the debate. But what you're not hearing is all of the individuals who've been victimized by crime is traumatized.""

Crime and inflation deal devastating one-two blow to inner city communities,"Crime waves swept major cities across the country two years ago amid the summer of 2020’s protests and riots and the coronavirus lockdowns that upended society. Crime has continued raging in many cities while residents cope with a heavy cost that has been compounded by record-high inflation.

""As a purely factual matter, prices do tend to be higher -- and the quality of service and products lower -- in stores in low-income neighborhoods,"" economist Thomas Sowell wrote in an opinion piece in 2006.

He said that many ""ghetto stores"" charge higher prices for a bevy of reasons, including ""crime, shoplifting, vandalism and riots have raised the costs, both directly and by causing insurance rates and the costs of security to be higher.""

Sowell's words have proven true in recent years. Commercial insurance rose in 2021 following the George Floyd protests and riots of the summer prior, which marked ""the first civil disorder catastrophe event to exceed $1 billion in losses to the insurance industry,"" according to the World Economic Forum. Battered stores in cities have taken extra security measures and even cut operating hours to help curb rampant shoplifting.

SIX MAJOR CITIES ON PACE TO PASS HISTORIC 2021 VIOLENT CRIME TOTALS HALFWAY THROUGH 2022

Crime has ravaged major cities over the last two years, with murders nationally spiking by 30% in 2020 when compared to 2019. Those spikes were even more steep in cities like New York City, which recorded a 44% increase in homicides compared to the year prior, Seattle, which saw their homicide rate increased by 61% in 2020 and by 40% in Philadelphia when compared to 2019.

Property crimes and thefts have also seen increases, including at businesses within cities. Most notably in California, cities such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area were ravaged by smash and grab crimes last year that have carried over into 2022.

Rampant shoplifting caused stores such as Walgreens and other chains to close in cities throughout the Golden State. Convenience stores in Philadelphia have been ""closing left and right"" this year while a couple of pharmacies in New York City closed up shop after reports they were repeated targets of shoplifting.

PHILADELPHIA BUSINESSES 'CLOSING LEFT AND RIGHT' OVER INCREASE IN SHOPLIFTING: 'VERY DANGEROUS'

For many people living in those cities, a store closure means a disruption of how people get things as simple as bread or milk, and can add additional transportation costs.

""If you're middle class or upper class, if Walgreens closes, it's not that big of a deal, maybe a minor inconvenience. But you can probably pretty easily drive an extra couple miles to the next closest store,"" Heritage Foundation legal fellow Zack Smith told Fox News Digital.

However, ""if you're someone who is one of the poorer members of our communities, that Walgreens closing or a grocery store having reduced hours, that's a big deal. You may not be able to walk the extra few miles, you may not be able to get public transportation to go the extra few miles. If you're working, reduced hours can impact your availability to get basic needs met,"" he added.

Historically, people living in cities have carried heavier costs at local grocery stores and bodegas. A government study published in 1997 found that low-income households are less likely to live in suburban areas where food prices are typically cheaper.

""Suburban supermarkets typically have the lowest food prices and widest selection, but poor people tend to live in central cities and rural areas. Grocery stores in central cities have higher operating costs and tend to be smaller and unable to take advantage of economies of size,"" the study found.

JULY FOURTH FIREWORKS: BIDEN'S INFLATION MEANS EVERYTHING IS SKY-HIGH FOR AMERICANS THIS YEAR

Additionally, there are unseen costs to Americans living in crime-riddled cities that have an incalculable impact.

""The impact is almost immeasurable,"" the Heritage Foundation’s Amy Swearer told Fox News Digital when asked about the cost crime has on communities in cities.

""You can measure it in some terms of … stores that are leaving [cities]. But there's sort of the immeasurable impact: Kids who are afraid to walk to school. How do you measure PTSD? How do you measure fear? How do you measure people deciding not to go to a store today?""

While crime has loomed large over cities and its communities, inflation has also dealt a heavy blow.

Inflation is at a 40-year-high, and estimates show it cost the average American household about $635 in June alone. Studies have found inflation often hurts low-income families, minority communities and Americans in rural parts of the nation the most. Low-income households are often ""exposed"" to items hit the hardest by inflation, such as energy and food, while lower levels of savings and incomes are unable to easily absorb the higher costs compared to wealthier households, a Bank of America study published in November found.

For many, inflation is a financial double whammy. Coronavirus lockdowns destroyed businesses across the country and workers were laid off or had hours cuts, which left many Americans financially struggling before inflation set them further back.

WALGREENS CLOSING 5 MORE SAN FRANCISCO STORES DUE TO THEFT

For some city residents who rely on their local grocers, they have been driven to tears by inflation and store closures.

""I have seen tears and laughter,"" Tony Moore, who runs a group home in central Kenosha, Wisconsin, recently told Kenosha News of inflation squeezing his neighborhood. ""I’ve seen people cry, because what are we going to do? And I see people laugh because what can we do?""

In California, residents of San Francisco have relayed that the closures of Walgreens have been devastating.

""That Walgreens was essential, at least for my family,"" Gina Mullins said of a Walgreens closing in the Mission District last year, according to the Guardian.

"Massive crime spike stems from social unrest, COVID lockdowns destabilizing communities: expert","Massive social upheaval spurred by the coronavirus pandemic is in large part to blame for the national surge in violent crime — not guns, an expert told Fox News Digital.

""We have crime because we have people,"" said Amy Swearer, a legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""Crime is a very complex subject.""

From the early 1990s through 2019, there was a national decline in violent crime, but the pendulum swung back in 2020, she said.

""We’ve seen across the nation unprecedented spikes in homicide rates and other types of violent crime,"" she said.

Homicide spike

The homicide rate shot up by 30% in 2020 compared to 2019 — the sharpest one-year increase in the nation’s history — and the upward trend has continued into 2021, according to FBI and other data. About 4,000 more Americans were murdered in 2020 compared to the prior year, Swearer said.

CRIME WAVE 2020: THESE CITIES SMASHED HOMICIDE RECORDS AMID NATIONWIDE CRIME SPIKE

Widespread rioting and social unrest over racial injustice in addition to COVID-19 shutdowns destabilized communities, she said.

Gang violence intervention programs, schools and other vital community services were shuttered, Swearer noted.

Although shootings are up in many big cities, Swearer said eliminating guns isn’t a realistic goal when there are 400 million privately owned firearms in the U.S. This figure doesn’t include police or military weapons.

""The cat is already out of the bag,"" she added. ""There are more privately owned guns than people in this country. You have to take that into account when you talk about combating gun violence.""

Black market

Most people who commit gun crimes are obtaining their weapons on the black market, not through official channels, so broad, federal gun control laws largely aimed at law-abiding citizens won’t stop the killings, she explained.

""There are more privately owned guns than people in this country. You have to take that into account when you talk about combating gun violence."" — Amy Swearer, Heritage Foundation

BLACK LA RESIDENTS LACK ACCESS TO GUNS AS WEALTHY RUSH TO BUY FIREARMS AMID CRIME WAVE

Banning assault weapons, implementing universal gun purchase permits and universal background checks target people buying guns lawfully, Swearer noted.

""When you crack down on these official channels you’re not actually addressing the bulk of gun violence or how those offenders obtain those guns,"" she said. ""Tougher gun control is a talking point that sells well to certain politician’s constituents, but it isn’t effective policy.""

Cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles face a unique dilemma. It is incredibly difficult for residents to obtain a gun permit while criminals are roaming the streets with illegal firearms.

""You end up with this problem where there are a number of otherwise law-abiding citizens who can’t obtain concealed carry permits who are told they have no reason to be afraid, but they carry anyway because they are afraid,"" Swearer said. ""These residents tend to be people of color from poorer neighborhoods who are most likely to be victims of violent crime.""

In New York City, anyone caught with a loaded firearm faces a second-degree criminal possession of a weapon charge, which carries a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years and a maximum of 15 years.

MURDER IN LA COUNTY JUMPS OVER 95% SO FAR THIS YEAR, CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS ON THE RISE: SHERIFF

The Black Attorneys of Legal Aid, along with other public defender groups, wrote a legal brief last year arguing that ""New York’s licensing regime criminalizes the exercise of the Second Amendment"" and unfairly devastates the lives of minorities in poorer neighborhoods who fear for their safety.

Gun control racist?

Political activist Maj Toure, who founded Black Guns Matter to educate Black Americans on the use of firearms and their Second Amendment rights, agreed.

""All gun control in America is racist,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Many people on the left don’t want Black people to have the right to defend their lives from Democratic tyranny.""

In California, he said, the issue rate for concealed carry permits by zip code reveals glaring racial disparities.

""By design, the people who are most affected by violent crime are having their constitutional rights violated the most,"" he said. ""If you live in Compton, you’re not getting a license.""

""By design, the people who are most affected by violent crime are having their constitutional rights violated the most."" — Maj Toure, Black Guns Matter

Swearer said data shows that concealed carry permits in restrictive counties in California are given to ""overwhelmingly rich, white, well-connected people.""

Amid a Los Angeles crime wave, wealthy residents are rushing to buy guns while Black residents are often denied the same privilege due to their ZIP code and the complicated process involved in getting a concealed carry permit, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Professor Jeffrey Butts, the director of John Jay College’s Research and Evaluation Center, said that in some respects conservatives and liberals are on the same page with gun control.

""The far left and the far right are actually pitching the same story,"" he said. ""The right is saying this is America, and you should be able to have a gun to protect yourself, and the far left is saying when you crack down on gun possession you create racial disparity in cities where it is a criminal offense to have a gun.""

But, he said, he doesn’t endorse Swearer’s opposition to federal gun control laws that would impose restrictions on the entire country. To combat illegal guns, he said we need a federal approach because many illegal guns come from states with less restrictive gun laws.

The announcement came after an August that County Executive Angela Alsobrooks said was the ""single-deadliest"" in county history and that juvenile crime arrests have more than doubled since a year ago. During a Monday press conference, Alsobrooks justified the curfew by pointing to past government programs aimed at helping youths that do not appear to have worked in the county, which borders Washington, D.C.

""The government alone cannot solve this problem,"" Alsobrooks said. ""Somebody has got to take responsibility for these armed and dangerous children, and it is not just the police and not just the government.""

Alsobrooks stated that as the number of local carjackings has gone up, many of those offenses have been committed by children. This, despite past efforts to help the community such as an employment program where the government got summer jobs for more than 6,000 people between the ages of 16 and 22, as well as new mental health and addiction facilities.

JUVENILE CRIME HURTING YOUNG VICTIMS ACROSS MAJOR US CITIES: ‘A VICIOUS CYCLE’

Alsobrooks led to the curfew announcement by pointing out that many crimes are being committed by children at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.

""No summer job or government program is going to help that,"" she said.

With that in mind, Alsobrooks pointed to families to step up and do their part.

""At this point, these kids don’t just need a hug, they also need to be held accountable,"" she said. ""I know this isn’t a popular thing to say, but the truth of the matter is it’s a fair question: Where are their parents? Where are the aunties, where are the uncles, and other family members who are responsible for them?""

The curfew will be enforced under existing law and calls for children under the age of 17 to be home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, and between 11:59 p.m. and 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Violation will result in parental notification. If a parent or guardian does not respond, child services will get involved.

Additionally, Alsobrooks said that owners of establishments that let children stay during curfew hours will face fines of $50 for a first offense, going up incrementally for subsequent offenses up to $250.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/dc-area-maryland-county-enforce-youth-curfew-juvenile-crime-more-doubles,N/A
Democrat-run tourist town sees 200% surge in break-ins amid violent crime spike: 'Wildly frustrating',"Break-ins in Asheville, North Carolina, saw a 200% monthly surge in January amid a violent crime spike in the Democrat-run tourist town that has hemorrhaged police officers in recent years.

The Asheville Police Department, which serves a town of approximately 90,000 people, responded to 41 break-ins throughout 2022 and has already fielded 11 reports of break-ins in 2023 as of Feb. 1, according to local ABC affiliate WLOS.

Chris Faber, whose bar in downtown Asheville was targeted twice last month within a span of a few days, told the outlet that a suspect broke into his establishment and stole about 20 bottles of whiskey and up to $800 in cash.

The suspect was then reportedly recorded on surveillance video breaking into a neighboring business and stealing from its cash register.

""It’s wildly frustrating, and mostly for me it’s frustrating because I’m not comfortable leaving my bar by itself when it happens that frequently,"" Faber told the local outlet. ""We just don’t know what to do as a preventative measure, other than what we’re already doing.""

POLICE IN NORTH CAROLINA TOURIST TOWN REVEAL WORSENING VIOLENT CRIME STATS FOLLOWING FOX NEWS REPORT

Chuckie McKelvey, who also owns a bar in downtown Asheville, said a suspect broke into her business on Jan. 18 and made off with alcohol and a cash register filled with $7 worth of quarters.

""I feel like we’re all suffering the problem, but none of us really have a great solution,"" McKelvey told WLOS. ""Of course, if more police presence were there, that would be a helpful deterrent. But I understand that that’s just not an option right now.""

APD senior officer Robert Crume told the outlet that some businesses are not even reporting break-ins. ""They just report the loss to their insurance and move on. They’ve become so frustrated with the situation,"" he said.

The break-in surge comes amid a violent crime spike in the historic mountain town, which has seen an influx of people moving in from out of state during recent years. Violent crime in Asheville increased 31% per 100,000 people between 2016 and 2020 – nearly double the national average and 18-percentage points higher than North Carolina's 13% increase statewide during the same period.

According to statistics released by APD in September, such trends have continued, rising 34% year-to-date compared to 2021 and 29% over 2020. The department noted that aggravated assaults are mostly responsible for the increase.

""Of course, if more police presence were there, that would be a helpful deterrent. But I understand that that’s just not an option right now."" — Asheville bar owner Chuckie McKelvey

APD Chief David Zack told Fox News Digital last fall that his department lost more than 100 sworn officers since May 2020, and that the force is struggling to maintain visibility while ""operating at almost 42% down every single day.""

El Paso Walmart shooting suspect pleads guilty to 90 federal hate crime and firearm charges,"Patrick Crusius, the Texas man who allegedly shot and killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, pleaded guilty to 90 hate crime and firearm charges in federal court on Wednesday.

The guilty plea comes after federal prosecutors notified the court last month that they would not pursue capital punishment in the case.

Crusius, 24, drove from his home in Dallas to the border city of El Paso and opened fire at a Walmart on Aug. 3, 2019, in what prosecutors described as a racist attack.

He had posted a manifesto online that said the shooting was ""in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,"" and told police after surrendering that he was targeting Mexicans, according to an arrest warrant.

CALIFORNIA MASS SHOOTING: WHO IS SUSPECT HUU CAN TRAN?

His attorneys wrote in court filings that Crusius ""has been diagnosed with severe, lifelong neurological and mental disabilities,"" which they argued should be a ""red flag"" for prosecutors considering whether to pursue the death penalty.

Crusius has pleaded not guilty to separate state capital murder charges in Texas, where he could still face the death penalty if convicted.

Elusive crime wave data shows frightening toll of illegal immigrant criminals,"The federal government can tell you how many ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders"" stole a car, the precise number of ""American Indian or Alaska Natives"" who were arrested for vagrancy or how many whites were busted for counterfeiting in any given year. But the government agencies that crunch crime numbers are utterly unable -- or unwilling -- to pinpoint for the public how many illegal immigrants are arrested within U.S. borders each year.

In the absence of comprehensive data, FoxNews.com examined a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics that revealed a wildly disproportionate number of murderers, rapists and drug dealers are crossing into the U.S. amid the wave of hard-working families seeking a better life. The explosive figures show illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their 3.5-percent share of the U.S. population would suggest. Critics say it is no accident that local, state and federal governments go to great lengths to keep the data under wraps.

""There are a lot of reasons states don’t make this information readily available, and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,"" said former Department of Justice attorney J. Christian Adams, who has conducted exhaustive research on the subject. ""These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.”

“They should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.” — Jessica Vaughan, Center for Immigration Studies

Adams called illegal immigrant crime a ""wave of staggering proportions."" He and other experts noted that the issue has been dragged into the spotlight by a spate of cases in which illegal immigrants with criminal records killed people after being released from custody because of incoherent procedures and a lack of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement officials. The murders, including the July 1 killing of Kathryn Steinle, allegedly by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco, have left grieving loved ones angry and confused, local and federal officials pointing fingers at one another and the voting public demanding secure borders and swift deportation of non-citizen criminals.

“Every one [of the recent cases] was preventable through better border security and enforcing immigration laws,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. “They should have been sent back to their home country instead of being allowed to stay here and have the opportunity to kill Americans.”

A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement told FoxNews.com that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrant crime are not available from the federal government, and suggested contacting county, state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally, a process that would encompass thousands of local departments.

FoxNews.com did review reports from immigration reform groups and various government agencies, including the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Sentencing Commission, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Government Accountability Office, the Bureau of Justice Statistics and several state and county correctional departments. Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants.

There are approximately 2.1 million legal or illegal immigrants with criminal convictions living free or behind bars in the U.S., according to ICE's Secure Communities office. Each year, about 900,000 legal and illegal immigrants are arrested, and 700,000 are released from jail, prison, or probation. ICE estimates that there are more than 1.2 million criminal aliens at large in the U.S.

In the most recent figures available, a Government Accountability Office report titled, ""Criminal Alien Statistics,"" found there were 55,000 illegal immigrants in federal prison and 296,000 in state and local lockups in 2011. Experts agree those figures have almost certainly risen, although executive orders from the Obama administration may have changed the status of thousands who previously would have been counted as illegal immigrants.

Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals are being deported. In 2014, ICE removed 315,943 criminal illegal immigrants nationwide, 85 percent of whom had previously been convicted of a criminal offense. But that same year, ICE released onto U.S. streets another 30,558 criminal illegal immigrants with a combined 79,059 criminal convictions including 86 homicides, 186 kidnappings, and thousands of sexual assaults, domestic violence assaults and DUIs, Vaughan said. As of August, ICE had already released at least 10,246 criminal aliens.

David Inserra, a policy analyst for Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at The Heritage Foundation, said letting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes go free while they await deportation hearings is putting the public at risk.

“While it is not certain how many of these individuals were here illegally, most of these individuals were in deportation proceedings and should have been detained or at least more closely supervised and monitored until their deportation order was finalized and executed,” Inserra said.

Adams opened a rare window into the dearth of public data when he obtained an internal report compiled by the Texas Department of Public Safety and revealed its contents on his Pajamas Media blog. The report showed that between 2008 and 2014, noncitizens in Texas -- a group that includes illegal and legal immigrants -- committed 611,234 crimes, including nearly 3,000 homicides. Adams told FoxNews.com that other states have also closely tracked illegal immigrant crime, especially in the wake of 9/11, but said the statistical sorting “is done behind closed doors.” States closely guard the statistics out of either fear of reprisals from the federal government or out of their leaders' own insistence on downplaying the burden of illegal immigrant crime, he said.

""There are a lot of reasons states don’t make this information readily available and there is no clearinghouse of data at high levels,"" Adams said. ""These numbers would expose how serious the problem is and make the government look bad.""

A smattering of statistics can be teased out of data made public in other states heavily impacted by illegal immigration, although a full picture or apples-to-apples comparison remains elusive.

■ In Florida, there were 5,061 illegal immigrant inmates in state prison facilities as of June 30, but neither the state Department of Corrections nor the Florida Department of Law Enforcement track the number in county prisons, spokesmen for those agencies told FoxNews.com.

■ In Illinois, where state prisons house 46,993 inmates, some 3,755 are illegal immigrants, according to Illinois Department of Corrections figures. Once again, state officials do not compile figures for county jails, although a Cook County official estimated that nearly 6 percent were illegal immigrants.

■ In Arizona, neither state public safety officials nor the governor’s office could produce figures showing the number of criminal illegal immigrants held in county jails, but state prison figures released by the Arizona Department of Corrections show out of 42,758 prisoners held in state facilities in July, about 10.8 percent were illegal immigrants.

■ In California, there were 128,543 inmates in custody as of Aug. 12, but the state, which has been criticized for its leniency toward illegal immigrants, no longer keeps track of the citizenship status of inmates. As of July 31, 2013, the last time figures were documented, there were as many as 18,000 “foreign-born” citizens in California state prisons of 133,000 incarcerated. The Board of State and Community Corrections provided figures to Fox News from 2014, showing there were 142,000 inmates in 120 county prisons, but while everything from mental health cases to dental and medical appointments are closely tracked, the number of illegal aliens -- or even non citizens -- is not.

“Frankly, this is something every state should track, but they don’t. Not even ICE publishes this much information on offenders and immigration status,” Vaughan said.

Several pro-immigration groups contacted by FoxNews.com declined to comment on the outsize role illegal immigrants play in the U.S. criminal justice system. One group that did insisted that even illegal immigrants provide a net benefit to the U.S.

“Immigrants, regardless of their legal status, make valuable contributions to our economy as workers, business owners, taxpayers and consumers,” said Erin Oshiro, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. “We need an immigration system that that keeps families together, protects workers, and prioritizes due process and human rights.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/elusive-crime-wave-data-shows-frightening-toll-of-illegal-immigrant-criminals,N/A
"FBI's national crime data for 2021 incomplete, lacks data from nearly 40% of police nationwide","The FBI released its national crime data for 2021 this week, but it lacks data from nearly 40% of police departments nationwide, including massive forces in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.

""I don't think you could get national numbers, at least not useful national numbers, from this data,"" Jacob Kaplan, criminologist at Princeton University, told the Marshall Project earlier this year. ""It's going to be really hard for policymakers to look at what crime looks like in their own community and compare it to similar communities.""

The FBI switched to a new recording program at the start of January 2021, called the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The new reporting method was rolled out to provide a more thorough snapshot of offenses, such as what weapons were used in an incident, types of property stolen, and more detailed demographic information on victims and perpetrators of crimes.

But nearly 40% of police departments nationwide did not provide full data sets on 2021 crime to the FBI by the March deadline of this year.

US MURDER RATE CONTINUED GRIM CLIMB IN 2021, NEW FBI ESTIMATES SHOW

Most departments in Florida, California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania failed to report data, according to the Marshall Project, which has been tracking the data for months. The two most populated cities in the country, New York and Los Angeles, also failed to deliver full reports to the FBI last year.

Only 52% of law enforcement departments nationwide sent full, 12-month reports of crime data to the FBI for last year. Roughly 9,700 law enforcement agencies did not provide full data sets, Reuters reported.

​​""We're certainly not saying it's a wash,"" a senior official from the Bureau of Justice Statistics told reporters Tuesday, according to CBS News. ""We have all the confidence in the world about these estimations. It's not that we don't have confidence in what they're producing. There's just a certain level of uncertainty around the estimates.""

PHILADELPHIA POLICE UNDERREPORTED CRIME DATA TO FBI FOR CITY'S BLOODIEST YEAR ON RECORD

The data for 2021 shows there was an estimated 4.3% increase to murders compared to 2020’s wildly bloody year, at about 22,900 murders last year to 2020’s 22,000.

Murders spiked by nearly 30% in 2020, as the pandemic upended society in unprecedented ways and protests and riots demanding the police be defunded erupted during the summer that year. The data marked the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

The FBI data for 2021 show violent crime overall fell by 1% in 2021 compared to 2020, at 1,326,600 reports in 2020 to 1,313,200 last year. And robberies fell by a notable 8.9% in 2021 compared to the year prior.

When compared to 2019, overall violent crimes increased by roughly 9% in 2021. Murders rose by roughly 39% when comparing the estimated 16,425 murders in 2019 to the estimated 22,900 last year.

""While a large number of agencies were successful in making the transition to NIBRS, many others, including agencies with populations greater than 100,000, faced challenges and were unable to modify their systems to begin submitting NIBRS data in time to meet the required cut-off date of March 14, 2022, for inclusion in the annual release of crime data for 2021. These are agencies that would normally have been included in the national view, but now will not be represented with 2021 data,"" the FBI later told Fox News Digital when approached for comment on the incomplete data.

The data’s incomplete status has some experts concerned.

""The overwhelming lack of law enforcement participation presents a challenge when assessing the true state of nationwide crime in America,"" said Jillian Snider, the policy director for the R Street Institute’s criminal justice and civil liberties team, told the New York Post. She added that people should ""proceed with caution"" when using the data for policy purposes.

The Department of Justice said on Wednesday that the data included estimates based on partial-year data from law enforcement departments, and federal officials were able to produce state-level estimates for 40 states.

""While the FBI did utilize methods for estimation to try to combat gaps in the data, it is fundamentally challenging to do so when such a large swath of data is not present,"" Rachael Eisenberg, the senior director of liberal think tank the Criminal Justice Reform at the Center for American Progress, told CBS News.

The FBI told Fox News that as of Septemeber of this year, ""12,381 of the nation’s 18,806 law enforcement agencies have been able to successfully transition to NIBRS.""

Former NYPD commissioner reveals exact moment politicians 'created' crime crisis in NYC,"New York City’s former Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said that four years ago was the city’s ""safest year,"" before New York's politicians ""created"" the current crime wave.

""2018 was New York’s safest year. Fewer than 100,000 serious crimes, 300 murders. The next year Albany’s criminal justice reform screwed it up. Today’s crime wave is blamed on New York politicians. They created it,"" Bratton said in a New York Post opinion piece published Sunday evening.

Bratton, who has twice served as the city’s police commissioner, singled out Manhattan’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, for not putting criminals behind bars. New York lawmakers passed sweeping changes to the state's bail laws in 2019 that restricted crimes where judges can set bail, which many local leaders have partially blamed for the recent uptick in crimes.

""And Manhattan’s DA doesn’t want to put criminals in jail. He’s risking the rest of the population by giving them chances. Sorry, you’re caught with a gun committing a crime? You should go to jail!""

FORMER NYC TOP COP SAYS HIS OWN WIFE WAS ASSAULTED IN MANHATTAN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AMID RISING CRIME

New York City has been rocked by skyrocketing crimes in recent years. In 2018, New York City notched its lowest crime rates in the modern era, with 1,207 fewer crime incidents across the board compared to 2017, according to the NYPD. Shootings were down more than 4% compared to 2017, burglaries down nearly 4%, robberies down 7.7%, while murders fell below 300 for the second consecutive year.

NYC SOARING CRIME RATE IN FIRST MONTHS OF 2022 FUELED BY REPEAT OFFENDERS

But by 2020, when the pandemic’s lockdowns upended society in unprecedented ways and protests and riots raged across the country following the death of George Floyd, violent crimes such as murders and shootings spiked.

Shootings jumped 97% that year compared to 2019, recording 1,531 shootings in 2020, according to the NYPD’s year-end crime data. Murders increased by 44% compared to 2019 data, with the NYPD reporting 462 murders in 2020 compared to 319 in 2019.

2020 was a bloody year across the country, with the FBI reporting murders spiked by nearly 30% compared to 2019. It marked the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

The crime trend has continued two years later, with New York City recording increases in nearly every major crime category in 2021 compared to 2020. Felony assaults jumped by 9.8% compared to 2020, car thefts jumped by 15%, robberies were up 5.1% and murders jumped by 4%.

MOST NYC RESIDENTS SAY CITY IS LESS SAFE SINCE PANDEMIC, FEAR BEING VICTIM OF VIOLENT CRIME

Six months into 2022, New York City has recorded a 25.8% jump in violent crimes as of mid-June compared to the same time in 2021. Rapes are up roughly 15% in the city this year compared to last, while robberies are up 39.7% and felony assaults are up 19.6%.

However, homicides in the city have fallen this year compared to the same time period in 2021 by about 13%.

Bratton was quoted in the New York Post piece advising that police officers in the city need more training, and the department overall needs more cops.

""Officers need training. It’s like not wanting a doctor to give too much chemo or radiation. You want just the right amount to cure you. Same in terms of our risk. You don’t make the patient sicker — just what’s correct. Stop-and-frisk, a great tool, can be moderated. Done away with — but it’s an essential tool. You can’t police without it. The challenge is to do it constitutionally. Within the law. Moderated up and down depending on the crime, but it must be here to stay. When I ran the department in the early ’90s we had even more crime.""

Additionally, amid the rising crime over the last few years, combined with the pandemic and support for the defund the police movement, the NYPD saw an exodus of cops as resignations and retirements began piling up, and fewer people tried to join the force.

Former prosecutors call Manhattan DA's soft-on-crime policies 'definition of insanity',"Former prosecutors turned defense attorneys called the new Manhattan District Attorney’s soft-on-crime policies the ""definition of insanity"" and ""shocking.""

Alvin Bragg released a memo on his third day in office, ordering prosecutors not to seek prison sentences for a slew of crimes and to downgrade charges – including for robberies and commercial burglaries.

MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALVIN BRAGG BLASTED BY CRITICS OVER LIGHTER PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLENT CRIMINALS

Daniel Bibb, who worked as a Manhattan assistant district attorney for 24 years, said he’s never seen an approach like this.

""Imagine you’re a clerk in a bodega and are the victim of a knifepoint robbery, not only could the guy not go to jail, he could get charged with a misdemeanor,"" Bibb told Fox News. ""That is the definition of insanity.""

The memo says that the robbery charge should be downgraded to a petit larceny if the brandishing of the weapon ""does not create a genuine risk of physical harm.""

The DA also said he will no longer prosecute many crimes – including some trespass offenses, resisting arrest and fare evasion.

MANHATTAN DA GIVES MANY MISDEMEANORS A PASS EVEN AS NEW MAYOR VOWS TO COMBAT GROWING CRIME

""I’m a criminal defense attorney,"" Bibb said. ""My job is to try to keep people out of jail, but this is basically saying that he’s going to ignore the law. This is absurd on its face.""

In an interview with Fox News, Bragg defended his office’s agenda, which has sparked widespread backlash.

""We’ve laid out a path that is going to reduce incarceration, reduce violent crime, get people services, are neighborhoods safer, get New York City back up on his feet,"" he said. ""It’s the road forward and the pathway to safety and justice.""

Mark Bederow, who also once worked as a Manhattan prosecutor before switching gears and becoming a criminal defense attorney, disagreed with Bragg’s assessment. He called the prospect of downgrading armed robberies to petit larcenies ""the most shocking policy"" that could increase lawlessness.

""This will encourage would-be robbers to bring weapons to their crimes as they won’t be punished any worse than if they didn’t bring weapons,"" Bederow said.

NYC THIEF POSING AS UPS DELIVERYMAN ROBS COUPLE AND GRANDKIDS AG GUNPOINT, STEALS PIGGY BANK SAVINGS

""Let's say somebody puts a gun in your face and threatens to blow your brains outs, if the gun is unloaded, presumably there is no ‘genuine risk of physical harm,’ which under the memo would appear to be subject to prosecution as a petit larceny,"" the attorney said.

Although the memo does not clarify this, Bragg told Fox News in a statement, ""If you use a gun to rob a store or any armed robbery it will be prosecuted as a felony."" He did not say whether that would also apply to an unloaded or imitation gun.

The new policy recommends that commercial burglaries in certain buildings, like some of the smash-and-grabs plaguing high-end retailers in many major cities, be downgraded.

""Commercial burglaries will be subjected to a lax standard of prosecution, which hopefully will not encourage criminals to descend upon Manhattan to engage in the flash mob burglaries that have all but destroyed business in San Francisco,"" Bederow said.

NEW YORK MAN ROBS WOMAN AT KNIFEPOINT, IS RELEASED WITHOUT BAIL, STEALS FROM ANOTHER WOMAN HOURS LATER: POLICE

He also pointed out that the decision not to prosecute turnstile jumping on the subway ""in essence turns paying your fare into an honor system.""

Bragg’s memo stresses that his office would only seek jail time for homicides; a class B violent felony in which a deadly weapon causes ""serious physical injury""; domestic violence felonies; certain serious sex offenses; public corruption and major economic crimes. He also vows to cap sentences at 20 years, even for murder convictions.

The bar for ""serious physical injury"" under New York law is high. It requires the loss of a limb, a traumatic brain injury or some other permanent disfigurement, Bederow said.

Bragg does say in the memo that these sentencing policies are not set in stone and prosecutors can depart from them in ""extraordinary circumstances based on a holistic analysis of the facts.""



An NYPD lieutenant who has worked three decades on the force, mostly in Manhattan, said Bragg is violating his oath by not prosecuting crimes. ""You’re not the legislature,"" said the officer, whose name has been withheld as he’s not authorized to speak on the record. ""If you want to change the laws, go to the legislature.""

NYC POLICE ID ROBBERY SUSPECT WANTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT BEAT DOWN OF ELDERLY WOMAN CAUGHT ON CAMERA

He said if a stranger enters your house and walks out with your TV, prosecutors will not ask for jail time. ""That would normally be charged as second-degree burglary, a c violent felony, because the law recognizes the sanctity of your home,"" he said.

The memo also says that the immigration status of defendants will be considered for sentencing to prevent ""immigration consequences.""

""You’re basically creating a whole special class of people who are noncitizens or here illegally, and you’re going treat them more favorably than American citizens,"" the lieutenant said.

In separate statements, the Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch and NYPD Detectives’ Endowment Association, Paul DiGiacomo, blasted Bragg’s reforms and said they would only increase crime.

But his agenda also has many supporters. The Legal Aid Society, which represents indigent defendants in New York, praised the initiatives.

Civil rights lawyer Ron Kuby called it a ""sensible policy"" and accused people of ""dreaming up crazy scenarios to argue against it.""

""This is worth a try because the system we’ve had in place for 50 years has not been successful,"" he said. ""Look at the Rockefeller Drug Laws that imposed the toughest sentences but did nothing to stop the crack epidemic.""

He said that Bragg is ""attacking the entire carceral structure that has been built up at great cost to black and brown lives.""

Putting people in prison at a cost of $450,000 a year per inmate, the attorney said, is not a good strategy.

Kuby added that the public outcry over Bragg’s memo is unwarranted given that he ran for district attorney on this progressive platform. ""People are shocked that he’s actually keeping his word, which admittedly is rare for any politician,"" he said.

"George Soros says liberal prosecutors not to blame for crime spike, vows continued support","Liberal mega donor George Soros pledged that he has ""no intention"" of slowing down his donations to progressive district attorneys and dismissed the notion their policies were to blame for crime spikes nationwide.

""Some politicians and pundits have tried to blame recent spikes in crime on the policies of reform-minded prosecutors,"" Soros wrote in an op-ed published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal. ""The research I’ve seen says otherwise. The most rigorous academic study, analyzing data across 35 jurisdictions, shows no connection between the election of reform-minded prosecutors and local crime rates.""

Soros attempted to make the case that policies implemented by prosecutors he has donated millions of dollars to, including New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon, have been ""popular"" and ""effective.""

""This agenda includes prioritizing the resources of the criminal-justice system to protect people against violent crime. It urges that we treat drug addiction as a disease, not a crime. And it seeks to end the criminalization of poverty and mental illness​,"" Soros wrote, adding, ""​The goal is not defunding the police but restoring trust between the police and the policed, a partnership that fosters the solving of crimes.""

WHAT GEORGE SOROS DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT CRIME AND TRUE JUSTICE

Soros also claimed that the ""idea that we need to choose between justice and safety is false"" and argued that public safety will improve if people ""trust the justice system.""

Soros not only defended progressive prosecutors across the country, but also pointed the finger at Republican leaders and suggested they are to blame for higher murder rates.

MOMS SAY GEORGE SOROS' FOUNDATION USING TERM 'BIRTHING PEOPLE' IS 'DEHUMANIZING': 'WOKE IMPLOSIVE INSANITY'

""In fact, violent crime in recent years has generally been increasing more quickly in jurisdictions without reform-minded prosecutors,"" Soros wrote. ""Murder rates have been rising fastest in some Republican states led by tough-on-crime politicians.""

Soros’s article comes as violent crime has surged in recent years in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other areas where he has supported progressive district attorneys.

GEORGE SOROS QUIETLY BACKED TWO FAR-LEFT PROSECUTOR CANDIDATES IN IOWA AND MAINE, FILINGS REVEAL

Voters in San Francisco recently voted to recall District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who was financially backed by Soros, amid a spike in both crime and homelessness in recent years.

Voters in Los Angeles are primed to hold a recall election for Gascon as violence, particularly by suspects who have been released back onto the streets due to Gascon's policies after committing other crimes, continues to plague the city.

Hate crime hoax: Idaho police say 'White Power' graffiti on high school created by 'rival' Hispanic gangs,"An Idaho police department determined that ""White Power"" graffiti found at a local high school was not an act of hate, but an ""act of intimidation"" between two ""rival Hispanic criminal street gangs.""

""At this time, detectives no longer believe the incident to be motivated by hate but rather an act of intimidation between two rival Hispanic criminal street gangs from Caldwell,"" the Caldwell Police Department said on Facebook.

""Detectives are basing this off of evidence, video, and other factors discovered in the course of the investigation.""

The words ""White Power"" were found spray-painted on the side of Caldwell High School last Thursday, two days after the high school held a ""Brown Pride"" protest, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Tuesday protest was held in support of a student who was told to remove a hooded sweatshirt reading ""Brown Pride"" because other people reportedly found it ""racist,"" the outlet reported.

NATION’S MOST POWERFUL DEMOCRATS TOOK JUSSIE SMOLLETT’S HATE CRIME HOAX AS GOSPEL BEFORE STORY CRUMBLED

School officials reportedly compared the phrase to a ""white pride"" shirt, according to the student who was told to remove the shirt, Brenda Hernandez. She ultimately turned the hoodie inside-out so the phrase could not be seen while she was on school property.

Caldwell High School principal Anita Wilson said at the time that the school has a strict dress code ""compared to other school districts because Caldwell has had a gang problem before, and 'Brown Pride' is associated with gangs.""

After the graffiti was found Thursday, the police chief denounced what at the time appeared to be an act of hate, saying ""we will not tolerate hate in our city and will ensure that whoever is responsible for this will be held accountable for their actions.""

CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIAL SAYS RACIST GRAFFITI NOT A HATE CRIME: 'PRANK THAT WENT SIDEWAYS'

On Friday, police provided an update that the graffiti vandalism is believed to be a ""diversion tactic"" used by one of the Hispanic gangs in the area to avoid being caught by police, and ""was possibly done to exploit the recent protest at Caldwell High School.""

""It is common for gang members to vandalize property in their attempt to create fear and intimidation within the community,"" the department said in its Facebook update on the case Friday.

Police posted screenshots of surveillance footage from the night the school was vandalized, showing individuals wearing black masks and hoodies standing near a wall while holding what appears to be spray paint. Police said they believe two groups of four people, or a total of eight suspects, arrived in two separate cars on Thursday to graffiti the school.

Caldwell Chief of Police Rex Ingram lauded his department for its investigation and vowed to track down those responsible.

ANOTHER HOAX? MISSOURI SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS RACIST GRAFFITI WAS PAINTED BY NON-WHITE STUDENT

""I am proud of the investigative effort given by our detectives in this matter, who quickly determined this incident to not be a hate crime,"" Ingram said. ""Unfortunately, this incident has already affected the lives of many in our community.

""This appeared to be an organized act of violence by cowardly members of a local criminal street gang who attempted to cause panic, fear and intimidation,"" he went on. ""I promise that when we catch the suspects, the public will be able to see who they are because they won’t be able to hide behind a hood or mask in a booking photograph.""

A police spokesperson further clarified to Fox News Digital Monday that the department believes the vandalism is gang related as it is ""consistent with gang activity and we’ve identified the tagging as consistent with gangs in the area."" The spokesperson added that the department has additional evidence, but is not releasing the details as the investigation is ongoing.

Homicides down but violent crime up in major US cities as midterms approach,"A midyear report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, an association of police executives from the largest cities in the U.S. and Canada, found that violent crime in the U.S. continues to rise despite a slight drop in homicides as the midterms approach.

""While MCCA member agencies continue to develop new and innovative strategies to address rising violent crime, there is a distinct need to have a robust conversation regarding the driving factors and systematic failures that have contributed to the current state of affairs,"" the MCCA said in a press release that accompanied the report last month.

Surveying over 70 major U.S. law enforcement agencies, the report found that violent crime has increased by over 4% in 2022 when compared to 2021 numbers. Robberies and aggravated assaults have outpaced the increase in 2021, rising 13.1% over 2021 totals and aggravated assaults rising 2.6%.

However, the report found that the surge in homicides the country has experienced since 2020 may show signs of slowing, with homicides falling 2.4% in 2022 when compared to where they were midyear 2021. Rapes have also seen a decrease in frequency this year, falling 5.1% compared to the same point in 2021.

LARA TRUMP ON RISING CRIME IN DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES: 'HOW DO YOU EXIST WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE?'

""Compared to 2019 midyear figures, MCCA member cities have experienced a 50% increase in homicides and a roughly 36% increase in aggravated assaults. These shocking numbers demonstrate how the sustained increase in violent crime has disproportionately impacted major urban areas,"" the MCCA release said.

The report comes as November's midterm elections loom, with the rise in crime likely to be in the minds of voters as they cast their ballots. According to a FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos analysis, gun violence and crime ranks only behind inflation as the most important issue to voters ahead of the elections. The issue has also consistently ranked among the top issue to voters since April, when it passed political extremism as the second-highest priority for voters.

Experts have blamed pandemic restrictions and growing anti-police sentiment for the recent surge in crime, noting that law enforcement agencies have pulled back on enforcement as calls to defend police department have spread across the country.

""Certainly the pullback of the police as a result of first COVID, then George Floyd, then to the defund the police movement and the actions of far progressive prosecutors has definitely contributed to the increase in violence that we see on the streets of our major cities right now,"" Former Philadelphia Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Sullivan told Fox News Digital earlier this year.

While Sullivan noted he understands the concerns some people have about police tactics, he warned that some policies have gone too far.

""We want to make sure that we're policing in a constitutionally correct way, but we do need to return to proactive policing,"" he said. ""We can't continue on a path where we ignore all minor crimes because when you do that it just creates an atmosphere of chaos and disorder that does lead to more serious offenses.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/homicides-down-violent-crime-up-major-us-cities-midterms-approach,N/A
Idaho murders: How does criminology student leave crime scene with blood-dripping knife?,"The Idaho student murders suspect may not have forgotten the Ka-Bar knife sheath found in a bed with two of the four victims – it may have been planted there in an effort to mislead investigators, according to a criminal profiler who has been following the case.

""If you took a pistol out of your holster, wouldn't you put it back in?"" said John Kelly, a psychotherapist with experience interviewing serial killers, in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""I don't know anybody who wouldn't, and if I went fishing and had to take my knife out, I would put it back in the sheath.""

It's a reflexive action, he said, adding that a vegan like murder suspect Bryan Kohberger likely put the knife away somewhere in order to keep the blood from contaminating his clothes or vehicle.

""You're such a clean vegan who's obsessive-compulsive about what you eat and everything else, just the hygiene of carrying a bloody knife around, wearing it somewhere on your person as you get out of the house,"" he said.

IDAHO MURDERS: BRYAN KOHBERGER'S TRASH MAY BE KEY IN MASSACRE PROBE

The answer may hinge on what a surviving housemate, the only eyewitness, saw that night.

A police affidavit states that she heard noises, including whimpering and crying, and then saw a masked man with ""bushy eyebrows"" leaving through a sliding door. It makes no mention of seeing an intruder carrying a weapon.

""This is staging 101."" — John Kelly, criminal profiler

""The girl didn't say anything about seeing a knife,"" Kelly said. ""Did he put it in his clothes somewhere and have blood all over?""

Kelly said the sheath may have been left intentionally – after being wiped clean of fingerprints but not thoroughly enough to remove the touch DNA evidence that police found on the snap.

The attacker could have put the knife in a different sheath or some other sealed container and left the ""USMC""-stamped sheath behind in an effort to cast suspicion on someone with ties to the military, Kelly said.

""This is staging 101,"" he continued. ""They're going to look at this, and they're going to think it's a military guy that did this – some guy with some kind of training who lives up the road.""

INSIDE IDAHO MURDERS SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S UNUSUALLY LONG ROUTE HOME TO PENNSYLVANIA

However, police recovered DNA on the snap that they later said matched a familial sample taken from the trash at Kohberger's parents' house 2,500 miles away in Pennsylvania.

""He may have thought this was the perfect ruse. Again, he's no genius; his ruse and staging set him up to get caught,"" Kelly said.

If he had simply forgotten the knife, police may have found more DNA on the sheath along with fingerprints, Kelly said. As of a gag order on Jan. 3, police had still not recovered the murder weapon.

""That could have precipitated the question: ‘Who else did you arrest?’"" Kelly continued, referencing a rumored statement that Kohberger made to police when they took him into custody on Dec. 30. ""I think he had to believe that that was going to lead them to somebody, some direction, with the sheath there.""

There were no signs of forced entry at the victims' residence, which was known among neighbors as a loud party house for U of I students, but the crime scene was very bloody when police arrived shortly after receiving a 911 call reporting an unconscious person at 11:58 a.m. that morning.

"Crime in big cities may be worsened by inflation, researchers find","With inflation hitting a 40-year high in the U.S., criminologists from the University of Missouri-St. Louis are now finding a link to some higher crime rates in major U.S. cities.

Their research showed that inflation has driven up so-called ""acquisitive crime,"" a type of crime done for financial gain – for example, robbery, burglary and theft.

So far, crime rates across the country have supported this research. In Orlando, commercial robberies have doubled so far in 2022 compared to the same time period in 2021, according to police. Now, business owners across Florida are on edge.

INFLATION SURGES 8.5% IN MARCH, HITTING A NEW 40-YEAR HIGH

""The alarm sounded, and I learned two people broke into my store. I'm worried about how much damage was done, how much they actually got away with,"" said Bo Larson, the owner of Bohemian Lair, a Central Florida smoke shop.

Robbers targeted the store back in March. Surveillance video showed two people shattering the front door to steal thousands of dollars in cash, vapes and other products.

STUART VARNEY WARNS OF RECESSION AS INFLATION HITS 40-YEAR HIGH

""I took it very personal. It's like if your house was ever broken into, you know, your personal space was violated. And that's the same thing as a business, your space, everything you worked hard for became violated. And then you got to come in and clean up the mess that other people made., between all of the damage and the items that they took, and somewhere between $7,000 and $9,000,"" Larson added.

Criminologists are speaking about on their claim that inflation has been the motivating factor behind the rising crime rate.

NYC SOARING CRIME RATE IN FIRST MONTHS OF 2022 FUELED BY REPEAT OFFENDERS

""I think inflation is a public safety concern. What the research suggests is that as prices rise, crimes, especially those crimes committed to obtain something of value, rise as well,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""There's evidence out of New York City suggesting that the impact is present and that it's quite sizable. For example, to date from the beginning of this year through mid-April, homicides are actually down by about 11% in New York City. But property crimes and robbery are way up over the same period last year. So for example, robberies are up 48%, burglaries are up 32% And larcenies are up 57% These are the kinds of crimes we would expect to increase as the result of a large rise in inflation, which of course we've been seeing in the United States now for many months.""

According to Rosenfeld's research, crime rates skyrocketed during periods of high inflation for the last half-century. ""In U.S. history, in the 1970s and through the early 1980s, there was a very major rise in inflation. Inflation rates were picking out at about 15% per year, and that was also a period of pretty dramatic crime rises in the United States.""

Juvenile crime hurting young victims across major US cities: 'A vicious cycle',"A handful of teenage boys' tragic killings have made local and national headlines recently as a result of violent crime incidents in Philadelphia; Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; Chicago and other cities or metropolitan areas.

Sean Toomey. James McGrath. Jasmine Brunson. Ethan Liming. Blu Bryant. Robert Yocum. Christian Beamon.

While their names may look familiar, there are hundreds of teenagers — particularly teenage boys — who have been impacted by violent crime trends, often at the hands of other juveniles or young adults, in recent months.

Victims

McGrath and Liming were beaten to death. Toomey, Brunson, Bryant, Yocum and Beamon — the 18-year-old brother of Fox News contributor Gianno Caldwell — were fatally shot. Suspects have been named in less than half of their cases.

FOX NEWS ANALYST GIANNO CALDWELL REMEMBERS BROTHER, 18, FATALLY SHOT IN CHICAGO: ‘ALL I WANT…IS JUSTICE’

""The defund the police movement has created chaos. People talk about studies saying there is no correlation between defunding the police and the increase in crime. But that’s absolutely not true. I don’t care about the studies you're referring to. It’s a mentality,"" Caldwell told Fox News Digital about crime impacting juveniles in Chicago, where he grew up, and other major cities.

He added that the ""defund"" movement has ""created a mentality where the criminals"" get away with burglary and other property or non-violent crimes and eventually turn to more violent offenses. Once they do commit violent crimes, such as taking another person’s life, they ""forfeit"" their own ""right to life,"" he said.

""You lose your right to live because either, one, you're going to jail, or two, eventually you get murdered,"" Caldwell said when asked if he had a message for violent offenders. ""That's when it automatically becomes a vicious cycle. My family's paying the price.""

Violent crime

It is true that violent crime and juvenile crime have decreased in the United States since the 1990s and early 2000s.

It is also true that violent crime has increased in certain major U.S. cities or metropolitan areas over the past two years since the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated hardships for Americans across the country and rhetoric regarding law enforcement shifted.

Families living in those major U.S. cities are witnesses to — and victims of — those increases in crime, and they have concerns for youth growing up in those areas.

""I was born and raised in this area,"" Sean Toomey’s father, John Toomey, said of Philadelphia in an interview last week. ""Nothing like this ever happened before. … I’m not simply talking about my son's shooting. … I just had my truck stolen two weeks ago. It was parked on the side of the street.""

He added that he is hearing ""terrible news"" about ""carjackings"" and other violent crime not only in Philadelphia, but in other cities like Chicago.

""The sad thing is, it's something government can't fix. It's for the family,"" he continued. ""It starts with these kids. I would put a lot of money on the fact that none of them have fathers. They all come from a one-parent background. They’re not brought up right.""

In Chicago and Philadelphia, homicides are down this year, even though they saw increases in homicide in 2020 and 2021.

CHICAGO 5-MONTH-OLD BABY GIRL DIES AFTER BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD: ‘A DISGRACE’

In Philadelphia, total homicide numbers are down about 5% year-over-year, but there has been a rise in violent crime driven by a nearly 61% uptick in armed robbery. Property crimes in the city are up 30% on average, with every category of property crime increasing since last year. Commercial burglary is up about 53%, theft from a person is up about 64%, theft from auto is up nearly 48% and auto theft is up 16%.

In Chicago, total homicides have decreased year-over-year from 336 in 2021 to 204 this year, other forms of violent crime, including robbery, aggravated battery, burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft have increased since the same time period last year. Total violent crime in has increased 34% so far this year.

Juvenile crime

Juvenile crime also increased in major cities. Carjackings, armed robberies, assaults and burglaries involving juveniles has risen in cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and others since about 2019, with carjackings being the most prevalent among juveniles.

CARJACKINGS IN CITIES LIKE NYC, PHILADELPHIA JUMP OVER 200% — OFTEN WITH KIDS BEHIND THE WHEEL, OFFICIALS SAY

Carjackings have soared by 286% in New York City from 2019 to 2021, while Philadelphia saw the second-highest increase, 238%, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) president and CEO David Glawe. Chicago followed with the third-highest increase, 207%, from 2019 to 2021, then Washington, D.C. with a 200% increase and New Orleans with 159%, Glawe previously told Fox News Digital.

Chicago officials have cited data showing carjacking offenders are most often between the ages of 15 and 20.

In Washington, D.C., homicides are up 14% and robbery is up 29% so far this year. Instances of motor vehicle theft, theft from auto and ""other"" auto incidents are relatively unchanged since last year, when auto theft and theft from auto had increased since 2020. Juveniles have made up the majority of carjacking suspects over the last two years.

In Hinds County — home to Jackson, Mississippi — Sheriff Tyree Jones said in a May discussion that he has ""been in law enforcement for nearly 23 years,"" and ""within the last year or two, it has been the worst"" he has ""ever seen it regarding our youth,"" according to WLBT .

Experts have previously told Fox News Digital that carjacking incidents can often lead to violent crime.

PHILADELPHIA MAN, 2 MINORS CHARGED IN BEATING DEATH OF ELDERLY MAN DURING CARJACKING

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw told Fox News Digital in a June interview the ""pandemic exacerbated a lot of the social inequities that we saw around access to health care, access to housing, access just to food, when…the administration shut down the schools because of COVID.""

""[W]e lost a lot of our warm touchpoints, specifically around young people, because we're seeing that our shooters have gotten younger, and our shooting victims have also gotten younger,"" she said.

So far this year, at least 104 shooting victims in Philadelphia are under the age of 18, according to the Officer of the Controller .

Preventative measures

Maria Tcherni-Buzzeo, associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, pointed to the prevalence of firearms in major cities as part of the current juvenile crime issue, which she noted has decreased over the last three decades.

""There is this natural instinct to say, ‘Oh, kids are out of control. What is happening?’ … But whatever is driving this trend in homicide — it's clearly different from the trends in other violent crime because every almost every other violent crime has been down,"" she said. ""And so there must be something that is different about homicides specifically. And actually another category of crime that has been going up is mass shootings. And so my guess is that it probably has something to do with guns, because why do we see other violent crimes not affected as much?""

""It takes a village,"" including services and opportunities, as well as treatment and counseling, to prevent juveniles from committing crimes and keep them safe in their communities, Tcherni-Buzzeo continued.

Renee Williams, executive director at the National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC), said juvenile victims of crime need to receive adequate support after a violent encounter to ensure that they do not fall into a cycle of violence.

""It is a learned behavior,"" she said. ""It is not something that is natural for the juvenile.""

Williams added that it is ""a pretty high statistic of juvenile offenders that have gone through children's services and then become offenders.""

While different services for victims of crime differ jurisdiction by jurisdiction, Williams suggested crime victims seek therapy, victim advocates that are often offered by prosecutors or law enforcement offices, and centers that offer help to those who have been subject to violent crime. Additionally, NCVC’s free hotline connects crime victims with specialists trained to help victims ""identify services"" and compensation applications to ease the recovery process.

"Lightfoot says Chicago making progress on crime despite continued violence, businesses leaving","Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city is making headway on addressing violence, despite data showing the city continues to see violent crimes and businesses are packing up and leaving over the violence.

""Our data-driven strategy recognizes that that's where we need to put the lion's share of our investments, our time, our education, our outreach,"" Lightfoot said Wednesday of efforts focusing on guns, gangs and investing resources in dangerous areas of the city. She noted that the city is making ""progress"" on fighting crime.

Chicago police released crime statistics this week showing the number of people shot in the city is down 20% this year and homicides are down 16%, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

The media asked Lightfoot if the numbers only reflect a national trend following the pandemic, similar to the same crimes dropping in cities such as New York and Los Angeles this year. The mayor instead argued the drops are due to a ""multitiered strategy"" to curb gang and gun crimes.

SKYROCKETING CHICAGO CRIME HAS SMALL BUSINESSES, CORPORATIONS PACK THEIR BAGS: 'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH'

Homicides skyrocketed in Chicago in 2020, following a drop in violence for the three previous years. The Windy City recorded nearly 770 homicides in 2020, up 50% compared to 2019. Last year, the city broke a 25-year record when it surpassed 800 homicides, the Chicago Tribune previously reported.

Though the number of people shot and the number of people killed across the city is down this year, there has still been a 35% increase in all reported crimes in 2022, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

CHICAGO DEMOCRATS TIGHT-LIPPED ON PLAN TO ADDRESS LOWEST NUMBER OF ARRESTS IN 20 YEARS AMID SURGING CRIME

Additionally, shootings, murders, car thefts and other thefts are all up this year in two police districts patrolling the city’s downtown area. Lightfoot acknowledged the increases in the downtown area and on the North Side, but said the people carrying out the crimes ""don’t live in those communities"" and violence is often around 45 businesses with liquor licenses that remain open until 4 or 5 a.m.

​​""We’re seeing people coming out of these late-night establishments and getting into something, and that leads to a shooting,"" she said.

Lightfoot didn’t elaborate on how she would curb crime around establishments that are open until the early morning hours, but did say she’s willing to lose revenue from bars ""because frankly, I’m more concerned about loss of life. She added that she will engage in ""a serious conversation"" with bar owners about the matter.

Lightfoot said that major corporations recently moving to the city or expanding illustrate that the efforts to cut crime are on the right track. Google, for example, purchased the James R. Thompson Center in downtown Chicago this summer.

ARRESTS IN CHICAGO PLUMMET TO HISTORIC LOWS AS CRIME RISES AND POLICE ADMITTEDLY PULL BACK: 'NO WAY'

Fox News Digital, however, reported earlier this summer that small business owners and even corporations have been leaving the city due to the rampant crime.

""We would do thousands of jobs a year in the city, but as we got robbed more, my people operating rollers and pavers we got robbed, our equipment would get stolen in broad daylight and there would usually be a gun involved, and it got expensive and it got dangerous,"" Gary Rabine, founder of the Rabine Group and owner of 13 businesses, told Fox News Digital in June of why he pulled his road paving company from the city.

Billionaire Ken Griffin announced in June that he was moving his hedge-fund firm Citadel out of Chicago after citing crime as a major concern over the past few months.

""If people aren’t safe here, they’re not going to live here,"" Griffin told the Wall Street Journal in April. ""I’ve had multiple colleagues mugged at gunpoint. I’ve had a colleague stabbed on the way to work. Countless issues of burglary. I mean, that’s a really difficult backdrop with which to draw talent to your city from.""

Lightfoot’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on businesses leaving the city.

POSH CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOOD GRAPPLES WITH VIOLENCE, CRIME

The city’s efforts to combat crime comes as the police department made a record low number of arrests last year and faces low morale among the ranks.

Chicago police made arrests in 12% of crime cases in 2021, the lowest rate since 2001, as sweeping changes have been made in recent years as to how the department patrols the streets, including restricting their vehicle pursuit policy and ending foot pursuits if a suspect runs from an officer or if someone commits a minor offense.

Retired Chicago Police Department Chief of Detectives Eugene Roy told Fox News Digital last month that morale in the department is low in part due to officers believing that elected officials don’t have their back.

""There’s a fear among police officers that if they do the right thing, politics or other considerations, racial considerations might come into play and they might end up getting jammed, fired, criminally charged for doing the right thing,"" Roy said at the time.

Chicago PD is also facing staffing issues, with the department recording 13,300 officers in May 2019, when Lightfoot took office, to roughly 11,600 officers now, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Lightfoot called for more officers during her remarks Monday.

Police in North Carolina tourist town reveal worsening violent crime stats following Fox News report,"City police in Asheville, North Carolina, recently released new statistics that show rising violent crime trends in the Democrat-led tourist town have continued, increasing 34% year-to-date compared to last year and 29% over 2020.

""The Asheville Police Department takes this very, very seriously,"" Capt. Joe Silberman of the Asheville Police Department (APD) said Wednesday, according to local outlet WLOS. ""Our staff is working around the clock to follow up on instances of reports that have been taken.""

APD released the latest statistics to WLOS after Fox News Digital published a report last week about how violent crime in the historic mountain town skyrocketed 31% per 100,000 people between 2016 and 2020 — nearly double the national average and 18 percentage points higher than North Carolina's 13% increase statewide during the same period.

The new violent crime numbers, which include a 59% year-to-date spike in armed robberies compared to 2021, come as two suspects made local headlines this week, allegedly beating a man with a baseball bat and robbing him along a heavily trafficked avenue that runs north from downtown Asheville.

DEMOCRAT-RUN TOURIST TOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA SEES VIOLENT CRIME SPIKE AS POLICE DWINDLE: ‘PERFECT STORM’

Much of Asheville's violent crime trend can be attributed to aggravated assaults, according to an APD spokesperson.

Asheville, a city of about 90,000 people in the mountainous western region of North Carolina in Buncombe County, has also been hemorrhaging both city and county police officers in recent years.

FORMER DEMOCRAT SHERIFF BLAMES ANTI-COP RHETORIC, BAIL REFORM FOR CRIME SURGE IN POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION

APD Chief David Zack recently told Fox News Digital that his department is down more than 100 sworn officers since May 2020, and that they are struggling to maintain visibility while ""operating at almost 42% down every single day.""

Multiple local law enforcement sources who recently spoke to Fox News Digital attributed some of the mass exodus to the city's liberal leadership and to left-wing activists who undermine police.

Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan, who retired as sheriff and left the Democratic Party in 2018, recently told ""Fox & Friends First"" co-host Todd Pirro that local ""anti-law enforcement sentiment"" has contributed to the problems with police retention.

""Even though we were making good strides in the community and reducing the crime rate, we still saw ourselves coming in as a negative in the community in the eyes of some of the leftist politicians that were getting elected at that time,"" Duncan said.

TUCKER CARLSON: WE'RE LOOKING AT A WAR ON THE POPULATION

""So when officers have to work under those conditions, when they're out there really serving the community well, and we see high dismissal rate with the district attorney, low cash bail or no bail for these folks who are just being turned back loose into the community, it becomes very frustrating for the officers,"" he continued.

Democratic Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by time of publication.

Los Angeles crime spike: Will 'progressive' prosecuting cause an increase in crime for other U.S. cities?,"As of April, shootings in Los Angeles are up by 69% since 2020. Violent crime is up by 7.2% when compared to last year. Robberies are up by 18.5% when compared to last year. Car thefts are up by 40% when compared to 2020, according to the Los Angeles Times.

This is what Los Angeles is experiencing, and there's a growing fear that if progressive Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon isn't recalled, the recent crime wave will only continue to increase.

As district attorney, Gascon has implemented a progressive wish-list of policies, which many view as adding fuel to an increased rate of crime in Los Angeles.

Included in the massive policy changes implemented when Gascon took office in 2020, a directive was sent to all deputy district attorneys to decline pressing charges or outright dismiss charges before arraignment for several misdemeanors, such as trespassing, criminal threats, drug possession, resisting arrest, and more. There are exceptions, and under certain circumstances, charges can be prosecuted.

LOS ANGELES DA GEORGE GASCON WALKS BACK CLAIM ABOUT SHERIFF'S INVOLVEMENT IN HIT-AND-RUN PROSECUTION

Among the changes Gascon implemented is a diversion program for juvenile criminals charged with felony burglary, assaults without firearms or extensive injuries, vehicle theft, robbery, grand theft person, sexual battery, and arson. The program, titled ""Restorative Enhanced Diversion For Youth Pathway,"" moves juveniles from incarceration into rehabilitation. Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Hatami calls the program a ""slap on the wrist,"" adding that ""Diversion means that we're not charging anybody.""

Two recent high-profile cases handled by Gascon's office have sparked national outrage, and are making some supporters of the progressive district attorney re-consider their decision in a potential recall election.

One of those cases involves a 17-year-old who recently pleaded guilty to driving a car into a woman walking her child in a stroller in Venice, California while on probation and was sentenced to five to seven months in a juvenile probation camp. According to prosecutors, the camp is ""less than a military school and a little bit tougher than a summer camp.""

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office declined to charge the teenager with assault with a deadly weapon or attempted murder, and sources tell Fox News that the decision was made in accordance with Gascon's policies.

In another incident, comedian Dave Chappelle was allegedly attacked by Isaiah Lee, 23, while performing at the Hollywood Bowl on May 3. Lee was only charged with four misdemeanor counts but was later charged with attempted murder in an unrelated case dating back to December.

Hatami told Fox News Digital that he believes these incidents are contributing to the number of people making the decision to ditch Gascon.

""I can tell you there's quite a lot of people who have told me that they believe for a Gascon, they're sorry. They looked at the ballot, they saw that he was a police officer for 30 years. They saw that he was a district attorney for eight years. And they thought maybe he wouldn't be bad and he could help Los Angeles. And they feel so ashamed now, because I think he tricked a lot of people,"" Hatami said.

Hatami is also concerned that Gascon's style of ""progressive"" prosecuting will expand elsewhere in the United States beyond Los Angeles, stating that it has already affected areas such as New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, and more.

""We have a great country where people don't realize is that this progressive prosecutor movement has affected a lot of different areas of the United States,"" Hatami said. ""And so what happens is that, you know, it really can deteriorate our great country by allowing people to terrorize or hurt innocent people.""

The so-called ""progressive"" prosecutor movement is no longer confined to large American cities and is expanding to smaller cities and towns in the United States.

""They feel so ashamed now, because I think he tricked a lot of people.""

In Cumberland County, Maine, where just under 300,000 people reside, a political action committee backed by billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, spent over $172,000 in promoting the campaign of Jackie Sartoris, who is running for district attorney, according to WMTW. Cumberland County includes Portland, Maine.

Sartoris' campaign website states that, if elected, she would ""enhance the use of restorative justice"" and ""begin to shift young adult consequences towards greater non charging and alternatives that lead to dismissals.""

She also advocates for the closing of Long Creek Youth Development Center, which is a juvenile detention center, and states that she will push for the ""creation of more appropriately scaled and community-focused alternative facilities.""

On Los Angeles' doorstep, Pete Hardin, who has been endorsed by a local Democratic Party, is running for Orange County District Attorney.

LOS ANGELES DA GEORGE GASCON ‘OVERSTATES HIS AUTHORITY,’ CAN’T IGNORE CALIFORNIA LAW, COURT RULES

Hardin's website states that he will end the practice of prosecuting children as adults, and also ""advocate for diversion programs and specialized programs"" for young adults, adding that he will ""seek alternatives to incarceration for teenagers where possible and appropriate.""

When asked if he would be in favor of a policy similar to Gascon's policy of not prosecuting certain misdemeanors, Hardin told Fox News Digital that his opponent hasn't focused on violent crime enough.

""I will enhance the use of restorative justice, and begin to shift young adult consequences towards greater non charging and alternatives that lead to dismissals.""

""I'll work hand-in-hand with law enforcement to combat violent crime by prosecuting offenders and investing in violence reduction programs that are proven to stop crime before it happens,"" Hardin said.

Hardin's opponent, incumbent Todd Spitzer, frequently tweets ""#NoLAinOC,"" and highlighted a left-wing PAC that supports Hardin.

In Chicago, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, does not prosecute thefts that are under $1,000. In many low-level shoplifting and drug cases, Foxx's office has diverted them to counseling and treatment.

""I guess that’s the big question. If a cop responds to a storeowner who wants a drunk person off the sidewalk, what’s the alternative?"" Foxx told the Sun-Times. ""And I think as we talk about repeat offenders, we have to evaluate whether our interventions are making situations better or worse.""

The progressive prosecutor movement has suffered setbacks recently, including in Oregon, where former prosecutor and public defender Brian Decker lost his bid for Washington County district attorney. Washington County includes a portion of the Portland metropolitan area.

Decker's platform included a proposal to ""divert people away from courts and into robust services that save public funds.""

In an interview with the Sherwood Gazette, Decker proposed ""maximizing"" the use of ""rehabilitation alternative programs.""

""I will focus on the prevention of crime and rehabilitating non-violent offenders away from criminal behavior — not just prosecuting after crimes have already been committed and hoping, despite evidence to the contrary, that the toughest sentences will solve problems. That means maximizing our use of rehabilitation alternative programs where appropriate — getting more people into them, and getting people into them earlier on in the court process,"" he said.

Decker also wanted to ""foster the development of a restorative justice program as an alternative to traditional criminal court where appropriate.""

His platform also argued that the current system ""relies too much on costly incarceration,"" stating that ""a punishment should fit the crime, regardless of whether the defendant pleads guilty or expects a full trial.""

Patricia Wenskunas, founder and CEO of Crime Survivors Inc., a California-based organization focused on helping victims of violent crime and their family members, friends, and loved ones, told Fox News Digital she ""can't imagine"" why Gascon is offering support to criminals, rather than victims and survivors of crime.

She said that people in Los Angeles are beginning to wake up to the realization that Gascon's policies are making the city unsafe.

""People can't even walk down the street wearing their nice watch, or drive their nice car, or have boxes delivered to their homes. The violence is just reached such a significant level that I think people are like, well, I want to live here because I thought it was a safe community. I want to raise my children here and send them to schools to get educated without fear,"" Wenskunas said. ""So I think that the communities and the families and the parents and the elderly and everybody has just reached their max capacity and said enough is enough.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/los-angeles-crime-spike-progressive-prosecuting-movement,N/A
Los Angeles DA George Gascon defends record on crime: 'I know how to keep communities safe',"Progressive Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon defended his record against critics who have accused him of being soft on crime as violence in the city continues to surge.

""Yeah, in some areas it is,"" Gascon told KTLA-TV on Saturday when asked if he believes Los Angeles is safer because of policies he has implemented. ""I think it’s important to start out by saying that I was a police officer for many years before I was the district attorney. I know how to keep communities safe.""

Gascon explained that he believes his Community Violence Intervention Unit has been successfully locating repeat offenders and making ""good arrests"" and bringing in ""a lot of guns"" off the streets. Gascon also said that his office has increased the number of prosecutions of sexual assaults which is an area he says his administration has done ""really well"" on.

Gascon also said that his team has improved the ""filing system"" to make the process more efficient and that he has been successfully pushing for more ""integrity"" in the legal system.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA GEORGE GASCON POLICY BLAMED FOR CALIFORNIA MAN'S KILLING

When pressed by KTLA anchor Lynette Romero on critics who say that Gascon’s policies have made crime in the city worse, Gascon pointed to the coronavirus pandemic.

""We’re coming out of the pandemic that has had a tremendous impact not only on L.A. County but throughout the nation,"" Gascon said. ""The reality is that crime is up around the nation, in fact some of our neighboring counties per capita are having higher levels of violence than we are.""

LOS ANGELES DA GEORGE GASCON BRUSHES OFF CONCERN FROM MOTHER OF SLAIN OFFICER: 'WE DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL'

Gascon added there is ""no question"" the pandemic has impacted violent crime and homelessness.

""There are a lot of things that are not working,"" Gascon said. ""I see them. I’m frustrated as much as the next person. It is a national problem. It’s not just an L.A. problem. But L.A. in many ways is actually beginning to come out of it.""

Gascon explained that he walks through the streets ""every day"" and is ""frustrated"" by what he sees.

RECALL GASCON CAMPAIGN FORCED TO EVACUATE LA OFFICE OVER SUSPICIOUS WHITE POWDER IN ENVELOPE

Gascon was asked by KTLA anchor Mark Meester about the families of two slain police officers in El Monte, California who have blamed the district attorney’s policies for the deaths.

""The reality is there was no predictability that he was going to get involved in violence,"" Gason said about the gang member that killed the officers who was on probation for a weapons charge after he received a lenient sentence through a plea deal. A Gascon policy allowed Flores to plead no contest to being a felon in possession of a firearm and receive a light sentence despite having a strike on his criminal record already.

""We have to understand that we’re never going to get it 100% right,"" Gascon said.

Gascon is facing a recall effort in response to rising crime in the city that organizers say has reached the necessary amount of signatures to be on the ballot in November.

""This is a Republican power grab,"" Gascon said when asked about the recall. ""If this is about crime, there are many jurisdictions near us where crime is higher that are Republican controlled. You don’t see Republicans trying to recall Republican district attorneys.""

"As LSU reels from Madison Brooks alleged rape and death, crime torments college town","BATON ROUGE, La. – The same night LSU sophomore Madison Brooks died, a ride-share driver said he drove two ""muddy, bloodied and bruised"" LSU students home who were mugged across the street from the bar where Brooks was last seen alive.

Brooks, 19, was allegedly raped in a car on Jan. 15 and left on the side of a busy highway about 3.5 miles from Reggie's bar in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, according to court documents.

Her death shined a lot on a decades-old crime problem inside and around Tigerland, a sparsely lit, party hotspot for LSU students that's populated by several bars, mini-marts, a liquor store and a smoke shop.

The streetlights along the five- to 20-minute walk from the bars to the university housing are either burnt out or non-existent, the street lines are faded, and there are no emergency call buttons or sidewalks.

The path home is a stark contrast to the bright lights of Tiger Stadium, about a mile away, which ""can light up the moon,"" as one area resident put it.

TIMELINE OF MADISON BROOKS' ALLEGED RAPE AND DEATH

""That area has become a war zone,"" said Blake Daniel, a former bartender who lives and grew up in Baton Rouge near Tigerland.

""You have underage sorority chicks, frat boys, LSU football player types and now gangsters all coming together and getting wasted,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I heard cops won’t even work security there for beaucoup money, because it’s just too dangerous.""

Kurt Mikesell picked up the two LSU students who were attacked around 2:15 a.m. on Jan. 15, which was about 35 minutes before Brooks was hit by a car.

""That night was the busiest non-football game night that I've ever seen,"" Mikesell said. ""It was raining all night on and off, and it was raining when the bars closed at 2 a.m. There was a mass exodus of hundreds of kids, with upwards of 20 to 30 Uber and Lyft vehicles in area. . . . It's chaotic.

""You're on a constant round loop from about 1:45 a.m. to 2:45 a.m., picking up students and dropping them off. . . . I see hundreds of kids walking home, walking in the street. There's a bike path that's not lit, in the middle of nowhere, and girls will walk by themselves along that path. It's really out of control.""

LSU PRESIDENT RIPPED FOR MADISON BROOKS 'VICTIM BLAMING' AFTER STUDENT'S ALLEGED RAPE, DEATH

A mom of a LSU student, who went to the same high school as Brooks, told Fox News Digital that her daughter had been tased and beaten by a random woman in May 2021.

The mom, who wished to remain anonymous because she is afraid that her daughter will become a target, said that a confrontation quickly escalated after the attacker nearly ran over her daughter and her friends on their way home from the bars.

One of her daughter's friends yelled at her to slow down, the mom said, and then the woman pulled over and chased them with the Taser.

She said that they had reported the incident and sent Fox News Digital pictures of the injuries, but that nothing had ever come of it.

Calls and emails to East Baton Rouge police weren't returned.

SUSPECTS IN LSU STUDENT MADISON BROOKS CASE RELEASED FROM BATON ROUGE JAIL, RECORDS SHOW

The LSU administration messages students when there are known crimes happening in the area. Here are a few alerts that were shared with Fox News Digital:

On Jan. 24, 2022, there was a ""suspicious incident"" that ""required"" students to ""use caution"" in the area.

On Halloween 2022, there was an aggravated assault.

On Nov. 17, 2022, there were report of shots fired.

On Nov. 20, 2022, there was an armed robbery.

""No one knows that my daughter was tased, so how many other crimes don't we know about?"" her mom said. ""What else happens that we don't see?""

Some crimes made headlines, like last May when a man was fatally shot, and his body was found behind Reggie's, or last September, when 21-year-old LSU student Allie Rice was fatally shot near the train tracks near campus.

AFTER MADISON BROOKS DEATH, SLAIN LSU STUDENT ALLIE RICE'S FATHER SAYS ‘SOMETHING’S GOT TO CHANGE'

Authorities still don't have a suspect in Rice's shooting death , due to a lack of evidence, including security footage, in her case.

On Sunday, Jan. 22, 12 people were injured in a mass shooting in Baton Rouge's Dior Bar & Lounge, which is less than three miles outside Tigerland.

Paul Rice, Allie's father, told Fox News Digital on Tuesday, that ""something's got to change"" in Baton Rouge.

""We can't put it all on the police,"" Rice said. ""Police aren't the ones committing the crimes here. It's going to take community effort. It's going to take all of us to get involved and say enough is enough.""

MADISON BROOKS DIED FROM 'TRAUMATIC INJURIES AFTER GOOD SAMARITANS TRIED TO SAVE HER

Baton Rouge has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country.

""Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is among the U.S. cities with the highest homicide rates,"" according to a 2021 report in the Center Square, a nonprofit that tracks city data. ""There were a total of 102 murders reported in the city in 2020, or 46.5 for every 100,000 people -- well above the national homicide rate of 6.5 murders per 100,000.""

Tigerland sticks out from the rest of Baton Rouge because of its connection to LSU, which bills itself as an elite university with a reputation for excellence, where the cost of attendance can top $50,000 a year.

LSU athletics – especially football – reign in the area. There are murals all over Baton Rouge, storefronts are covered with the LSU tiger logo, there are football schedules in hotels and bars, and the stadium towers over the city.

SLAIN LSU STUDENT MADISON BROOKS DIED ‘A HERO,’ DONATED KIDNEYS, HEART

During the weekdays, especially during the football offseason, Tigerland is quiet. Crowds start to flock to the bars on Thursday and get larger Friday, Mikesell said.

By about midnight on Saturdays, the area turns into a weekly spring break, with hundreds or thousands of people, stumbling drunk, vomiting and even passing out.

Mikesell said he usually sees between two and four police officers in the area, and they're usually hands-off.

Following Monday's announcement that four men had been arrested and charged in connection with Brooks' rape, LSU President William Tate IV made a lengthy statement about making an aggressive push to curtailing underage drinking.

That was met with backlash from student groups and parents, who said that Tate's remarks were ""victim blaming"" and didn't address the core issue of sexual assaults and creating a safe environment for students.

LSU STUDENT MADISON BROOKS CASE: FOUR PEOPLE CHARGED IN ALLEGED RAPE BEFORE SHE DIED AFTER BEING HIT BY CAR

Tigerland is technically municipal property and not an official extension of LSU, requiring several city entities, multiple law enforcement agencies, LSU and the bars to coordinate with each other.

It's a layered, complicated problem with no easy, quick-fix solutions, but there's already been fallout from Brooks' death after the state Alcohol and Tobacco Control issued an emergency suspension of Reggie's.

""Honoring Madison’s life requires us to take every possible step to protect students,"" Cody Worsham, the interim vice president of LSU's Office of Communications and University Relations, told Fox News Digital in an email.

""Coming down hard on bars that are serving minors in our community is one of many strategies the president is proposing. We invite the entire Baton Rouge community to join us as we unite against all forms of violence and develop further strategies toward its prevention.""

BATON ROUGE JUDGE SAYS SUSPECTS ‘CALLOUSLY’ LAUGHED AT LSU STUDENT SHORTLY BEFORE DEATH

Kris Perret, the attorney who represents Reggie's Bar, said that business owners had contacted Tate directly on Wednesday ""and look forward to meeting with him and his team soon to work together to address the issues that he has raised.

""When asked what their plan was and how LSU proposed to partner with local businesses and stakeholders, and what assistance and suggestions they might provide, LSU’s response to us was to thank us for reaching out and that they would get back to us in the coming weeks.,"" Perret said in a statement Thursday. ""We look forward to hearing back from President Tate and his team soon.""

Meanwhile, the three adult suspects arrested in Brooks' case have been released from the Baton Rouge jail , records show.

Kaivon Washington, the 18-year-old suspect charged with third-degree rape, posted $150,000 bond and was released from Louisiana's East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office lockup on Thursday, records show.

Casen Carver, 18, and Everett Lee, 28, both of whom were charged with being principals to third-degree rape, posted a combined $125,000 bond and were released on Tuesday. Lee is Washington’s uncle, records show.

The second third-degree rape suspect, a 17-year-old whose identity has not been released, is not due in court until February.

"Violent crimes on the rise in 2022, following previous unprecedented spike in murders","Violent crimes are on the rise in major cities across the country this year following 2020's already skyrocketing national murder spike that bled into the following year.

Fox News Digital examined crime data from Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., and found violent crimes have increased anywhere from nearly 5% to up to 40% compared to the same time frame in 2021. Violent crimes are typically defined as reports of rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault and murder.

Violent crimes have reached unprecedented numbers in the last two years, with murders increasing by nearly 30% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to FBI data. By 2021, homicides continued to rise in major American cities across the country, with the Council on Criminal Justice releasing data in January showing a 5% increase in homicides compared to 2020’s wildly bloody year.

New York City has so far seen the largest increase in violent crimes out of the cities reviewed by Fox News, with a 40.6% increase compared to 2021. The city has recorded 43,244 violent crime incidents since May 15, compared to 2021’s 30,754 recorded during the same timeframe.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

Though violent crime is up in the city, data show murders and shooting incidents have ticked down compared to 2021. There have been 150 murders in the city as of May 15, compared to 170 last year. Shooting incidents have decreased by 7.6% in the city this year, at 447 compared to 484 this time last year.

Chicago shows similar data detailing an increase in violent crimes as of May 8 compared to 2021 during the same timeframe, but fewer homicides and shooting incidents. There have been 17,597 reports of violent crimes in the city from the start of the year to this month, which is a 35% increase compared to last year’s 13,026 violent crimes during the same time period.

Chicago has recorded 194 homicides as of May 8 compared to 207 in 2021 during the same timeframe. Shooting incidents in Chicago have also ticked down by 13% compared to 2021, with 779 shooting incidents recorded this year.

FBI DATA SHOWS LARGE INCREASE IN MURDERS IN 2020 NATIONWIDE

Violent crimes skyrocketed across the country in 2020 as social justice protests and riots ignited following the death of George Floyd. The protests that summer came at a time when the coronavirus and lockdowns upended society in unprecedented ways.

Some experts have pinned the cause of the crime spikes in 2020 on the coronavirus and warned about it at the beginning of the pandemic. Though others have pointed to the Ferguson effect - when police pull back during times of increased crime - as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and defund the police protests.

2020’s ""violent-crime increase—call it Ferguson Effect 2.0 or the Minneapolis Effect— has come on with a speed and magnitude that make Ferguson 1.0 seem tranquil,"" the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald wrote during the crime spike that year in 2020. ""George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May was justly condemned — but the event has now spurred an outpouring of contempt against the pillars of law and order that has no precedent in American history.""

MURDERS ROSE 5% IN 2021 COMPARED TO 2020; 44% COMPARED TO 2019: STUDY

Data from other cities reviewed by Fox News show that not only have violent crimes ticked up in 2022, but so have murders or homicides as well as shooting incidents.

Violent crimes in Seattle have shot up by 23% so far this year, with 1,815 incidents recorded as of April 30, compared to 1,474 recorded during the same timeframe last year. Homicides have increased by more than 54% compared to 2021, while citywide shootings and shots fired increased by 82% at 237 incidents recorded.

Los Angeles has also seen crimes rise in all three categories as of May 7. Violent crimes shot up by 6.7% so far this year, with 10,484 reports recorded. Instances of homicides increased by 1.6%, with 130 homicides recorded, and shoots fired increased by 1.5%, at 1,172 instances.

More of the same has unfolded in Baltimore. Violent crimes have increased by 8% compared to 2021, with 3,068 incidents recorded as of May 7. Homicides are up by 5% so far this year and non-fatal shootings have increased by 14%.

While in Washington, D.C., total violent crimes have increased by 21% as of May 16 compared to 2021, and homicides increased by 4% with 72 recorded so far this year. Data on city shootings was not available.

Philadelphia kicked off the year by outpacing 2021’s historically bloody records but has since seen a 15% decrease in homicides as of May 15 compared to the same timeframe last year. Violent crimes have meanwhile increased by 4.7% compared to 2021 and a 2.2% increase in shootings so far this year.

"Minneapolis crime spills into neighboring towns, 'under attack' by 'mobile' criminals: mayor","Crime is spilling into Minneapolis’ suburbs, putting the neighborhoods ""under attack from mobile criminals,"" one local mayor said.

""Our town, and our neighboring towns, have had their security and serenity under attack from mobile criminals who are coming into Edina and other nearby communities to steal private property and in some cases injuring people who resist or assist a victim,"" Edina Mayor Jim Hovland said in an email to residents of the town Sunday, Fox 9 reported . ""Edina residents have become angry and fearful. The peace and tranquility of our community has been disrupted. At a time when we should be celebrating peace in our families, communities and places of worship, we all worry what each day will bring in the way of criminal activity.""

Hovland said he will meet with mayors, city managers and police chiefs of neighboring towns to discuss how to combat the recent increase in crimes.

""Whatever resources our Police Department wants available, we will facilitate on behalf of our residents,"" Hovland continued. ""Our Police Department has responded and has been working around the clock on not just responding to emergencies involving criminal behavior, but also working with Police Departments in neighboring cities to share information and security strategies to combat and catch these criminals.""

Carjackings in Minneapolis have spiked this year. More than 500 carjackings have been reported so far this year, which is 100 more than 2020, CBS Minnesota reported . The crime has spilled into the suburbs, including an attempted carjacking in Edina on Thursday night.

The city is offering a $5,000 reward for information on four suspected teenage boys who tried to carjack an occupied vehicle. The crime was thwarted by Good Samaritans who intervened.

Three people were injured during the incident, one seriously, and the suspects were able to flee the area.

In the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, the Edina Police Department investigated at least three vehicles stolen from homes during the day and repeated thefts from cars, Fox 9 reported. The crimes sparked police to increase patrol of the neighborhoods where the theft occurred.

We will look at the latest in technology to see how it can assist us in this effort and we will work closely with our neighboring communities to end this outburst of crime,"" Hovland added in his message to residents.

St. Paul also broke a record on homicides this year . The city has recorded 35 homicides, which beats the 1992 record of 34. Minneapolis has recorded at least 91 homicides this year, nearly reaching the 1995 record of 96.

Netflix’s ‘Crime Scene: The Texas Killing Fields’: Could multiple murderers be involved in decades-long cases?,"For decades, young women have been turning up dead in a rural field off a dirt road in League City, Texas – and one grieving father is determined to seek answers.

Netflix has recently dropped a three-part docuseries titled ""Crime Scene: The Texas Killing Fields,"" which explores the unsolved murders of four Texas women that occurred between the ‘80s and ‘90s. Oscar-nominated and Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Joe Berlinger serves as executive producer as Emmy Award-winning director Jessica Dimmock follows the story of Tim Miller, whose daughter Laura Miller's remains were found in 1986.

""Tim is a person with so much determination,"" Dimmock told Fox News Digital. ""When his daughter went missing in the ‘80s, it put him on a new life path forever. He’s determined to not let his daughter’s case remain cold forever, but he also doesn’t want any other family to be in this pain and in this position… He has become a champion and an ally for other families with missing loved ones… He’s so committed to helping any family member who’s going through this in any way he can. And it turns out he’s quite good at it.""

According to the FBI, Miller’s daughter vanished in 1984 after she left her family’s League City residence to use a pay phone at a local store to call her boyfriend. Her family’s phone was not yet connected. She never returned home, and police assumed she was a runaway. Her body was discovered 17 months later, not far from where the body of another woman was also discovered. Heidi Fye, a local bartender, was last seen in 1983. Her remains were found in 1984.

A third body was discovered, and it turned out to be Audrey Lee Cook of Memphis, Tennessee, who was last seen in December 1985. Cook, who is believed to be around age 30 at the time of her death, worked as a mechanic and lived in the Houston area. Then, in 1991, a fourth body was found. It was Donna Gonsoulin Prudhomme, who was believed to be around age 34 at the time of her death. It would take more than two decades to identify both Cook and Prudhomme.

The bodies were disposed of by either a serial killer or multiple murderers in the desolate space, which has become known as ""The Killing Fields"" or ""Texas Killing Fields."" The FBI has brought significant resources to the cases and numerous leads have both come and gone. However, the murders remained unsolved. According to the FBI, there are no known witnesses to any of the killings and no common person connects all four.

""There are a few things that contribute to this area being kind of a hotbed for not only murder but also for people being able to get away with murder,"" Dimmock explained. ""The first is these are old cases, so just in general there’s the lack of technology and DNA testing. Then you’ve also got the landscape and the weather. Galveston County and Southern Texas get a lot of hurricanes. It gets a lot of flooding. Water effects evidence. Not only does it mean that evidence can disappear, but it also means that criminals know that evidence will disappear. Getting rid of bodies in water or places that might flood is a great way to cover your tracks.""

""But there are other factors,"" Dimmock continued. ""There was an oil boom in Houston that led to a rise of new developments and new residents looking for opportunities. And so, you have this culture of new developments clashing with… [more] rural communities. With that came a lot of new territories. Jurisdictions were separated. Police departments weren’t necessarily communicating with one another… And the final thing these crimes have in common is that there’s a highway that runs from Houston down to Galveston. That provides a way for people to get in and get out quickly and easily. People could come into this territory, dump a body and then get back on the highway, never to be seen again. That became a huge contributing factor.""

NETFLIX’S ‘I AM VANESSA GUILLEN’ SHEDS LIGHT ON ARMY SPECIALIST’S MURDER, SISTERS SAY: ‘HORRIFYING INJUSTICE’

Since the ‘70s, 30 bodies have been found either in or around the land between 1971 and 1999. The majority of the victims are young girls and women aged between 12 and 25 years old.

""The cases [from] the ‘70s really in some ways, struck me the most,"" said Dimmock. ""They are very important. The reason that we include them in our series is that they provide the first glimpse. They’re like the harbinger of what’s to come… How could a pattern not be seen and detected? A lot of the cops were telling families, ‘Oh, she’s just a runaway,’ or, ‘She’s going to come back.’… These girls were not runways. Their parents were right to be concerned. And those cases went unsolved… I think it’s kind of a dark cloud that hangs over that community that has allowed some of these other crimes to happen in their wake.""

According to the FBI, multiple killers cannot be ruled out. Additionally, they likely have roots in the area. In 2000, Miller founded and became the executive director of Texas EquuSearch, a non-profit that searches for missing people. In the 22 years since its founding, the group has assisted more than 2,000 cases, helping recover 428 missing persons alive and the remains of 326 deceased victims, according to its website.

NETFLIX'S 'KILLER SALLY' DETAILS WHY SALLY MCNEIL SHOT HER BODYBUILDING CHAMP HUSBAND: 'A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE'

Dimmock suspects that the killers are both from the area or have at least heard of ""The Killing Fields.""

""… It was easy to get in and out,"" she said. ""Evidence could be destroyed quickly. There wasn’t a lot of surveillance… I think one of the things that's unique to this story is that it’s very rare for multiple serial killers to kind of work in the same territory. But I think that’s what’s happening here.""

The FBI is still actively looking for new tips. Its behavioral experts have also created a profile of a possible killer. The area has also developed significantly since the ‘80s and ‘90s. According to the FBI, the area now has a paved road and is across the street from a housing development. A local church also owns the land and has worked with community members to create a memorial.

In July of this year, Miller was granted more than $24 million in a wrongful death lawsuit over the cold case abduction and murder of his daughter.

NETFLIX’S ‘OUR FATHER’: FILM EXPLORES TRAUMA CAUSED BY INDIANA FERTILITY DOCTOR WHO IMPREGNATED HIS PATIENTS

Although no suspect has been charged in Laura’s death, Miller sued Clyde Edwin Hedrick, a convicted killer and the man he believes is responsible. The original petition alleged that Hedrick ""abducted and killed"" the teenager. Hedrick has been convicted of numerous other crimes over the years, including manslaughter in the 1984 death of Ellen Ray Beason, court records showed.

After Hedrick failed to show up for the civil trial, the judge granted a default judgment in Miller’s favor for damages and other costs, according to authorities. Galveston County District Attorney Jack Roady, who prosecuted the manslaughter conviction in 2014, said the investigation into Laura's death remains open and active.

""The FBI task force that was formed has [taken] positive steps in the area to make sure that this type of pattern doesn’t happen again,"" said Dimmock. ""Does that mean no crime will ever be committed again? Absolutely not. But I think that through the work of Tim Miller and EquuSearch… I think there is a much stronger sense of community of how to get the police to respond quickly.""

Dimmock is hopeful that her docuseries will help ensure that the victims will not be forgotten, and perhaps will encourage those with any leads to come forward.

""I think one of the things that struck me in so many of these cases, going back to the ‘70s and then up to the ‘90s, is that the families knew something was wrong and were told by the police in a lot of the cases that they were wrong,"" she said. ""And I think in these past few years… we’ve understood what it means to believe women [and families]… it doesn’t matter what a normal pattern might look like.""

""Of course, that could be informative, but you can’t make a pattern of what normally happens in a crime take over what a family knows to be true,"" she shared. ""When a family member says, ‘My daughter hasn’t come home, and she wouldn’t do this,’ in all of these cases, that turned out to be true. And these families were told, ‘No, she’s a runaway. She just needed a break.’ I think that allowed critical time to go by.""

New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell facing recall effort amid criticism of crime rate and her travel,"New Orleans residents unhappy with the way direction their city is going are seeking to recall Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who called the effort a Republican-backed ploy to undermine the city's first Black woman mayor.

Organizers told local media Tuesday they had 2,100 registered voters sign a petition to get the recall question on the ballot.

The petition was filed in Baton Rouge by Eileen Carter and Beldon ""Noonie Man"" Batiste. Carter once worked for the city as a social media manager, according to a March 2021 social media post from Cantrell's office.

""I’m glad to see everyone coming together. It’s not about Democrat or Republican, it’s about the City of New Orleans and the people,"" organizer Shannon Assaf told Fox 8. ""New Orleans deserves better leadership, for sure.""

Organizers have 180 days to collect 53,500 signatures, or about 20 percent of registered voters in New Orleans. The move comes as violent crime continues to plague the city. Cantrell has also been criticized for her extensive travel, such as a $47,000 trip to the French Riviera.

If the required number of signatures are verified, a special election would be called by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards.

Cantrell's support for a suspected carjacker in juvenile court outraged many, the news outlet reported. The 17-year-old suspect allegedly shot a man while carjacking him in July.

In a statement, Cantrell called the effort a GOP-backed play by those with a political agenda.

""It fits into a long history of taking away our vote and our voice. That’s why we have reason to believe a conservative DC firm has signed on to lead the effort,"" she said. ""That’s why many GOP organizations in the city is encouraging people to sign the petition. That’s why Fox News is leading the propaganda charge.""

New Orleans nonprofit runs largest network of community crime cameras,"In a two-story building at the University of New Orleans, over 10,000 video feeds from communities across the country are streaming at the speed of light.

A small staff is watching these feeds, studying gang members and tracking drug deals in small towns and major cities.

It's called Project NOLA, the largest network of community crime cameras in the U.S., and the only nonprofit in the security industry.

""Just like the Red Cross and CrimeStoppers, we are in the business of helping people,"" said Executive Director Bryan Lagarde. ""Because we aren't focused on turning a profit, people trust us with their privacy, and we are effective.""

The project started in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to help the police department at a time when crime was surging and officers' homes were destroyed. Today, it's expanded to a nationwide operation.

""The cameras are literally coast-to-coast,"" Lagarde said. ""From California, Florida, New Jersey and many points in between.""

With agencies struggling for manpower all over the U.S., Project NOLA's security cameras are able to fill in the gaps by putting more eyes on high crime areas.

""The job is tough,"" Lagarde said. ""We see some of the worst that humanity has to offer, but part of what makes it worth it is knowing that we're helping justice be served.""

Using AI, the cameras alert Project NOLA if they pick up illegal activity and Project NOLA can inform law enforcement. Authorities can also review video after a crime is committed to find suspects and use as evidence in court.

""The cameras don't lie,"" Lagarde said. ""If someone says I didn't commit this crime, I was at my mom's house, the camera says no you did commit this crime and you weren't at your mom's house.""

Through donations, Project NOLA provides high-end security cameras to homeowners, businesses, schools, churches, etc. for free. Clients only have to pay an annual fee of about $300 for cloud storage.

""Business owners and residents are realizing the importance to help their local law enforcement,"" Largarde said. ""It's a community effort, especially with manpower issues right now in law enforcement, it's virtually impossible for them to do alone.""

This year, Lagarde says the cameras have already helped law enforcement on hundreds of cases. With New Orleans claiming the title of ""Murder Capital of America"" for 2022, business owners say the cameras are crucial.

New York City crime surged 38.5% overall in the first month of 2022,"New York City saw a 38.5% surge in overall crime last month, according to data released by the NYPD on Thursday, the same day that President Biden visited the city to discuss strategies for reining in crime.

While citywide shootings and murders have decreased 24% and 32% year-over-year, respectively, six of seven major crime incident categories have reached a 21-year high, New York Police Department (NYPD) executives announced Thursday.

That increase is driven by a 41% rise in grand larceny, a 36% uptick in robbery and a nearly 34% increase in burglary. All arrests are up 26% over last year — a 21-year high for the seven major crime categories — but the incarceration conservation rate has dropped.

NYPD leaders emphasized that they are frequently re-arresting known offenders who are then let back onto the streets to commit more crimes.

""We're arresting the same people over and over again,"" NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said during a Thursday news conference.

Many suspected shooters are involved in other criminal activity prior to shooting incidents.

NYPD Chief of Crime Control Strategies Michael Lipetri noted that 25% of burglary suspects and 20% of grand larceny suspects ""go on to commit a new felony"" within 60 days. Five years ago, that rate was 7% for burglary suspects and 6% for grand larceny suspects, he said.

""Who are we arresting? The same people that we've been arresting for the past couple of years.

An estimated 22% of all gun arrests involve a previously convicted felon, and 60% of all gun arrests involve suspects with open felonies.

""You would think that those people would be incarcerated today. Well, they're not. Only approximately 20% of all gun arrestees are incarcerated today. When we talk about our seven major arrests at a 21-year-high, the incarceration conservation rate is actually even lower than 20%. It's approximately 18%. Those are individuals who walk around the streets of New York today,"" he continued.

Lipetri said the NYPD is in communication with district attorneys' offices ""every single day,"" noting that judges also play a large role in determining which suspects are released on bail.

Additionally, gang- or crew-related motives accounted for 40% of shootings in New York City last quarter. Narcotics and robbery-related motives accounted for a combined total of 18% of shootings.

While murders resulting from shootings decreased to 66%, murders resulting from stabbing incidents increased to 28%.

Lipetri also noted that NYPD has seen a quarterly increase of about 6,000 incidents related to larceny, grand larceny, robbery and shoplifting incidents ""gone bad,"" meaning the incidents started as property crimes that escalated into violence.

"NYC Mayor Eric Adams still burdened by crime one year in office, despite drop in murders and shootings","New York City Mayor Eric Adams vowed crack down on surging crime in the Big Apple – but results have been mixed a year into his first term in office.

The Democrat and police leadership have celebrated that shooting and murder numbers have fallen, but other crimes are still trending upward as several high-profile crimes have critics calling for more to be done.

""He's the boss because the buck stops with him,"" said Charles Fain Lehman, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. However, ""it's not exclusively him,"" Lehman told Fox News Digital in a recent interview after Adams told a local publication he gave himself a B+ grade for his first year in office.

""From an executive agency perspective, I think you can place some blame at the feet of Albany Democrats. I think you can place some blame at the feet of the city council, they really do hamstring him,"" he added. ""There are other policymakers involved.""

Adams was sworn in as mayor in 2022, with crime already spiraling during former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s tenure and amid scrutiny over statewide criminal justice reforms that critics said resulted in dangerous criminals walking free.

Adams and the NYPD recently touted that shootings had decreased 17% in 2022 and murders fell 11% when compared to 2021 data. However, as those violent crimes fell, robberies, burglaries, felony assault, grand larceny and other crimes continued in the city, spurring major crimes to increase by 22% compared to 2021.

""I wanted to go after violent crime in general, but specifically, homicides, shootings, gun crimes, those crimes were terrorizing our city,"" Adams told the news site The City last month.

""People just felt that every time [they] heard a gunshot, or heard about another person being shot — it was traumatic.""

The mayor added that he would give himself a ""solid B+"" grade for the work he has done in his first year, according to The City.

Adams' workload is massive to cut down on major crime, experts said, adding the mayor still has a long way to go before New York has crime at pre-pandemic levels.

""All of the above,"" Lehman said when asked what the biggest crime challenges Adams is facing this year.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

The year 2020 was a wildly violent year for New York - as well as many areas all across the country - with murders and shootings skyrocketing by 44% and 97%, respectively.

It was also a historically bloody year for the entire country. Murders spiked in 2020 as COVID-19 lockdowns upended daily life, and protests and riots swept the nation following the killing of George Floyd during an interaction with Minneapolis police. Murders increased by nearly 30% in 2020 compared to the prior year, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the FBI began tracking such crimes.

The murder spike of 2020 has been attributed to a handful of variables, according to experts who previously spoke to Fox News Digital, including: anti-police rhetoric voiced by Black Lives Matter and defund the police proponents; the pandemic; a culture of lawlessness promoted by liberal district attorneys; and the ""Ferguson effect"" — when police pull back, violent crimes spike.

The spike in New York City’s murders and shootings that year occurred under de Blasio’s administration and at a time criminal justice reforms were being rolled out. Bail reform, most notably, went into effect in 2020 and eliminated cash bail options for most nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors. Adams has slammed bail reform as failing to protect victims, and creating a revolving door of criminals being apprehended by police only to be released onto the streets soon after.

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NYC HAS 'NO MORE ROOM' FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS

Adams is a former transit officer who then rose the ranks of the NYPD to captain before he was elected Brooklyn Borough president and then mayor of the city. He vowed on the campaign trail to crack down on crime, saying in July 2021 that New York had "" thrown up our hands "" and ""surrendered our city"" to the violence.

""It’s time for us to ensure our city is for the working-class, everyday people,"" he said at the time.

Jillian Snider, a retired NYPD officer and current John Jay adjunct lecturer, said that Adams’ one year in office ""is not that much time"" when assessing how he’s handled crime, highlighting he took over ""at a really bad time in history.

""He came in after COVID, crimes a mess, unemployment up. And we can't place blame on him for that,"" Snider told Fox News Digital. ""But I think that he came in trying to come up with novel ideas, but really he wasn't. He was recycling things of days past.""

Snider pointed to the public safety team working to get illegal guns off the street, saying it was an ""old anti-crime model"" that Adams brought back and ""threw a uniform on them."" She said that bringing back the plainclothes unit that de Blasio did away with at the height of the ""Defund the Police"" movement, was ""smart"" but not anything ""novel.""

When asked about his campaign promises to drop the hammer on crime, Lehman said Adams is heading in the ""right direction,"" but needs to ""​go much further"" and he’s ""not where he needs to be.""

ERIC ADAMS ADMITS HE WAS 'SHOCKED' AT 'HOW BAD' NYC WAS BEFORE TAKING OFFICE

Among the issues Lehman said Adams needs to address is increasing the rate of police officers stopping and arresting individuals suspected of breaking a law. He commended Adams for reversing the de Blasio-era decision that did away with the NYPD’s plainclothes unit and beefing up enforcement within the subway system that has been rocked by repeated violent crimes that have left some New Yorkers fearful.

He also noted Adams advocated for more mental health resources; and has not being quick to support the closure of the city's detention facility Rikers Island.

Snider said that Adams is working on his campaign promises of making the subway system safer and came through on his promise to bring back the plainclothes anti-crime unit.

""I'm not saying he successfully executed that plan yet,"" Snider said of Adams making the subway safer, but said a decline in crimes is already evident and ridership is increasing.

NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ERIC ADAMS TO APPOINT ‘GUN VIOLENCE CZAR’ AS SHOOTINGS, KILLINGS PERSIST: REPORT

Snider, however, is taking issue with Adams’ relationship with the NYPD, characterizing it as oversized and him being too involved, which she says is ultimately hurting the NYPD.

""I just feel like police commissioners and mayors in the past, they've always had a very workable relationship. And that the police commissioner, obviously appointed by the mayor, is going to take some guidance and suggestions. But I don't even feel like that's where it's at right now,"" said Snider, who is also the policy director for R Street’s Criminal Justice and Civil Liberties team.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS PROMISED TO CRUSH CRIME BUT IS BEING THWARTED BY REMNANTS OF HIS PREDECESSOR, EXPERT

Snider said that despite Adams having a strong leader in NYPD Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell and bringing back the position of deputy mayor for public safety for the first time since the 1990s, Adams is ""too much involved.""

""I feel like he's just going in dictating how he wants stuff done and expecting her to execute and deploy as he says. And I don't think that he's affording her the opportunity to maybe come up with some ideas on her own. He takes credit for everything.""

Snider said that it looks as if Commissioner Sewell is ""put off to the sidelines"" during press conference, despite the community wanting to hear from her.

Snider argued that the mayor’s involvement with the NYPD is ""hurting"" the department, because officers are questioning how much power Sewell holds despite generally liking her as a leader.

""I also think that for cops, it's one thing, but the community when they're watching television, and they just see a police commissioner who's standing on the side and a mayor who's doing all the talking. I think that makes the community - who doesn't really understand the nuances of mayor, deputy mayor, police commissioner - I don't think most people understand all that. They most probably think he is the police commissioner and the mayor,"" Snider said.

Fox News Digital reached out to the mayor’s office for comment, but did not immediately receive a reply.

"NYC violent crime, homelessness causes massive drop in subway ridership: 'Crime is out of control'","The leader of New York City's transportation agency, MTA, said Wednesday that the increased violent crime and pervasive homelessness seen in the subway system can largely be attributed to the drastic drop in ridership between December and the first few weeks of the new year.

During a meeting Wednesday, MTA Chairman Janno Lieber, an appointee of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, recognized that despite added police presence in the subway system, he still witnessed ""drug use and disorder"" during a recent visit to Penn Station, a major metro hub for commuters.

""Our riders are letting us know that they don’t feel safe,"" Lieber said. ""Our workforce is scared in addition to our passengers. Our workforce is scared because they’re feeling vulnerable.""

NYC WOMAN KILLED IN SUBWAY SHOVE AT TIMES SQUARE

His remarks come two weeks after Deloitte employee Michelle Alyssa Go was fatally pushed in front of a subway train at Times Square by a mentally ill homeless man, according to police.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) data shows roughly 2.5 million riders used the subway system on Monday, representing a 36% drop over the last month compared to the about 3.4 million riders per weekday recorded in the second week of December, NY Daily News reported.

During Wednesday's meeting, MTA chief customer service officer Sarah Meyer shared photos she's received from customers so far this month, as her department fields through complaints about ""people behaving erratically on the train on the platform, and who are making them feel uncomfortable of even unsafe.""

That includes people smoking and doing drugs in train cars and on platforms, aggressive panhandling, especially without mask wearing, she said. Lieber shared a picture he took while riding the Q train last week showing that homeless people have been camping out not only in stations but also in train cars.

MICHELLE ALYSSA GO: ACCUSED NYC SUBWAY SHOVER HELD WITHOUT BAIL AS COPS PROBE FOR RACIAL BIAS

""Every day the pictures keep rolling in,"" Meyer said. ""Our customers care about our city, our transit system and their fellow New Yorkers. And it breaks all of our hearts to see pictures like this.""

""At several stations, we have so many used needles on the tracks, that we have to send out tracking cleaning every other day,"" she said. ""When I look at these pictures, when you look at these pictures, there is no doubt, that there are people in need. And help can’t come soon enough.""

""I cannot believe that I'm the only person who believes the New York City subway crime level is out of control,"" according to one customer's complaint read by Meyer in the meeting. ""Most of my colleagues avoid taking the subway because of crime, violence and mentally ill people.""

Days before the high-profile subway shoving of Go, the governor, joined by New York City Eric Adams, vowed to send additional law enforcement and social workers into the subway system.

""The governor and the mayor stepped up and said specifically that they were taking on responsibility for the law enforcement side of this and the mental health side of this,"" Lieber said Wednesday.

MTA Board member Vincent Tessitore Jr., who represents union workers for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), called for more enforcement for the law intended to protect transit employees.

""We have to do something to make people more accountable when they do get caught,"" Tessitore said, according to Newsday. ""The leading reason why our employees are getting hurt is because they say to someone, very respectfully, ‘You need to put a mask on.’ In today’s world, that gets you smacked.""

"One out of every 179 Americans will eventually be murdered if crime rate continues, study finds","A study examining murders in 2021 based on death certificate data projects that one out 179 Americans will eventually be murdered over the course of their lifetimes if the country’s murder rate remains at 2021 levels.

""That means if you're in the United States, you live here, you're born and you spend your life here, your odds of your life ending by murder are one in 179 over your life. Not over a year or any other timeframe.""

""It's just somebody's gonna murder you before you die of natural causes, an accident, suicide, whatever it may be,"" Jim Agresti, president and co-founder of Just Facts, a nonprofit research institute, told Fox News Digital. Agresti also authored the study.

Just Facts undertook a massive project to examine how many people were murdered in 2021 after weeks of news outlets and experts reporting there is no definitive figure for 2021 murders due to newly-released FBI data for that year being incomplete and based on estimates.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

America was throttled by violent crimes in 2020, when murders spiked by nearly 30% compared to the prior year. It marked the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking crimes. Experts who have previously spoken to Fox News Digital pointed to calls to defund the police, the riots of 2020, the Ferguson effect — when police pull back amid a spike in violent crime and unrest — and the COVID pandemic for contributing to the bloodshed of 2020.

The FBI switched to a new recording program at the start of 2021 called the National Incident-Based Reporting System that aims to provide a more thorough snapshot of offenses, such as what weapons were used in an incident, types of property stolen and more detailed demographic information on victims and perpetrators of crimes.

But nearly 40% of police departments nationwide did not provide complete data on 2021 crime to the FBI by the March deadline of this year.

US MURDER RATE CONTINUED GRIM CLIMB IN 2021, NEW FBI ESTIMATES SHOW

The FBI estimates that between 21,300 to 24,600 people were murdered last year, but that data is buried within its report, Just Facts outlines in its study, ""As Murders Soar, FBI Buries the Data.""

Some outlets, such as NewsNation, have reported the murders were much lower, at 14,677, and heralded it as proof murders are on a downward trend.

But as Just Facts points out in its study, the number released by the FBI does not fully capture the actual number of murders in 2021. The 14,677 figure is accompanied by caveats that only 11,794 of 18,806 law enforcement agencies in the country actually reported the crime data to the FBI and noted that the decrease was due to ""an overall decrease in participation from agencies.""

FBI DATA SHOWS LARGE INCREASE IN MURDERS IN 2020 NATIONWIDE

""So where did NewsNation obtain the much lower figure of 14,677 murders in 2021? From an easy-to-access webpage on the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer. Specifically, NewsNation linked to a page that can be accessed by clicking the first prominent link on the home page of the Crime Data Explorer and then clicking on ‘Expanded Homicide Data,’"" the study states.

The reporter who wrote the article for NewsNation told Fox News Digital he used data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and noted that his report ""also mentioned the incompleteness of FBI data in it.""

""Buried"" within the FBI data is another data set showing an estimate of between 21,300 to 24,600 people who were murdered, the study shows.

At Just Facts, Agresti and his team examined death certificates to find a more concrete figure beyond FBI estimates and its incomplete figure, a method even the Department of Justice touted just years ago.

EIGHT TIMES THIS CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK WAS AHEAD OF MEDIA, HEALTH OFFICIALS ON KEY COVID-19 FACTS

The Department of Justice, under which the FBI operates, released a study in 2014 highlighting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System, which relies on birth and death certificate data, provides ""more accurate homicide trends at the national level than"" the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports due to a multitude of reasons.

The 2014 study notes that reporting death certificates at a national level is ""mandatory,"" as opposed to the FBI’s system to which police departments voluntarily submit data. The death certificate data also include homicides that ""occur in federal jurisdictions,"" and homicides caused by the deliberate ""crashing of a motor vehicle, but this category generally accounts for less than 100 deaths per year,"" Just Facts notes of the 2014 DOJ report.

After wading through the 2021 death certificate data from the CDC, Just Facts was able to determine that about 24,493 people were murdered in 2021. The number was determined after adjusting for the average number of justifiable homicides by civilians, which are not defined as murders; some justifiable homicides by police; and miscoded cases.

""For decades, the FBI has undercounted murders, while death certificates have overcounted them. Starting with data from death certificates and removing justifiable homicides provides a more reliable estimate of murders,"" Just Facts' study concludes.

FBI CRIME REPORT SHOWS MURDERS ROSE OVER 2020'S HISTORIC NUMBER AS MIDTERMS APPROACH

Just Facts was then able to ""provide a sense of scale for this [2021] bloodshed"" and found that one out of every 179 Americans will eventually be murdered.

The number is quite a shock, which both Agresti and the study note, but Just Facts said it's ironclad.

""Even in previous years, when murders were much less common, the lifetime likelihood of murder was so shocking to some people that they sent repeated emails to Just Facts insisting it was wrong. Yet, the methodology used by Just Facts to compute this figure was developed by a licensed actuary, double-checked by a Ph.D mathematician and triple-checked by a Ph.D biostatistician,"" the study says.

"Oregon sheriff warns of surging violent crime in Portland: 'Without action, we can expect worse to come'","Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese penned an open letter to the residents of Portland and the surrounding area this week, warning that violent crime is reaching record heights and may only get worse as the summer approaches.

""I continue to be deeply concerned about current trends in community violence,"" Sheriff Mike Reese wrote Friday.

There were 102 people in jail for murder or attempted murder at the beginning of April, the most since the mid-1990s.

Cities across the country have seen a spike in homicides in recent years, but Portland's homicide rate has surged at a far higher rate.

The city has already seen 25 homicides in the first three months of the year, setting itself up to break last year's mark.

At the same time, the number of people in Multnomah County jails for serious felonies like kidnappings, robberies, and sex crimes has also gone up.

""This is not the only serious threat to public safety, however,"" Reese wrote. ""Record-high levels of traffic fatalities and overdose deaths are jeopardizing personal safety and devastating families and social support networks.""

Other parts of the United States have been dealing with the same problems. More than 31,000 people died in car crashes in the first nine months of 2021, which was most in the first nine months of any year since 2006, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Meanwhile, the CDC's provisional data shows at least 105,000 drug overdose deaths last year nationwide, a 13% increase over 2020.

The sheriff proposed several actions to alleviate Portland's problems, including taking firearms from individuals who are prohibited from having them, engaging in outreach for homeless people, and increasing funding for specialty teams that investigate criminal organizations.

""We need to act with a sense of urgency. Summer is approaching, a time when we typically experience increased violence in our community,"" Reese wrote. ""Without action, we can expect worse to come.""

PCB Mayor: Same criminals behind Miami spring break crime now targeting Panama City Beach,"It's known as the spring break capital of the world. But this year, Panama City Beach is a target for criminals.

The city had a dangerous weekend with police seizing 75 guns and arresting more than 160 people.

The weekend violence has locals and visitors on edge. It's not typical spring breakers — high schoolers and college students enjoying the beach — causing problems. It's bold criminals who came to the city with bad intentions.

FLORIDA'S PANAMA CITY BEACH SPRING BREAK REVELERS PROMPT POLICE STREET CLOSURES, REPORT SAYS

""Our police chief said it best — the last book most of these folks read was ‘Cat in the Hat,’"" said Panama City Beach Mayor Mark Sheldon.

Over the last seven years, Panama City Beach has worked hard to distance itself from its ""Girls Gone Wild"" days and now advertises itself as a ""family friendly"" spring break destination.

In 2016, the city passed ordinances for the month of March, banning alcohol on the beach and ending alcohol sales past 2 a.m., to encourage revelers to go elsewhere. For the most part, it's worked to deter crime. But last weekend was different.

""Taking 75 guns off the street in a weekend in Panama City Beach is unheard of,"" Sheldon said. ""This was not spring break in any way, shape or form.""

After weeks of violence in Miami, city officials believe those bad actors have traveled to Florida's panhandle.

""Some of these same criminals who came to our county this weekend were in Miami last weekend; we know the exact people,"" Sheldon said. ""These criminals are traveling from town to town, so it's nobody new. It's just a bad group of folks who are trying to be lawless in every community they can find.

MIAMI BEACH VIOLENCE DRIVEN BY GUN-TOTING SPRING BREAKERS COMING IN BY CAR

The gunfire on Sunday left one person injured, shocking many in the community.

""It was unbelievable what happened,"" said Rafael Wanderbrock, food & beverage director for Barefoot Restaurants. ""Definitely those people didn't come here to vacation or have fun.""

Spring breaker Mary McGee from the University of North Alabama feels like her vacation is under attack.

""I don't see why you would plot something here,"" McGee said. ""We're just here to have fun. We're not trying to be a part of any of that.""

Just 20 minutes down the road from PCB, you'll find the smaller beach towns, such as Seaside and Rosemary Beach, known locally as 30A. The area is known for its quaint, oceanfront communities frequented by several country music stars like Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Garth Brooks.

Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson says his deputies are prepared if the violence spills over into the family-friendly communities.

""This is an extremely safe place to be, but for those individuals who are considering another kind of lifestyle, who are looking to come here and make this a ‘takeover destination,' we're going to take that with a strong hand.""

Adkinson says deputies will not be issuing any warnings or notices to appear. Those that break the law will go to jail and see a judge.

And for the criminals who fled Panama City over the weekend, Mayor Sheldon says they have not escaped the law.

MIAMI BEACH STREETS QUIET AS CURFEW GOES INTO EFFECT FOLLOWING SPRING BREAK VIOLENCE

Philadelphia police underreported crime data to FBI for city's bloodiest year on record,"The Philadelphia Police Department underreported crime statistics to the FBI for 2021, a historically bloody year for the city, new data show.

Roughly 2.1 million crimes across the country will go unreported to the FBI, according to data examined by The Marshall Project and Axios. Philadelphia is among the roughly 60% of U.S. law enforcement agencies that failed to report a full year of data or no data at all to the federal agency.

All in, Philadelphia reported only nine months worth of data to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System. Local police officials cite the city implementing a new crime reporting system for the gap in data.

The Philadelphia Police Department received nearly $4 million in 2016 to upgrade its reporting system, which was officially launched on April 1, 2021, Axios reported. The FBI also switched to a new recording method last year, the National Incident-Based Reporting System, amid a push to better record crime figures and individual incidents.

PHILADELPHIA’S RECORD VIOLENCE SPILLS INTO NEW YEAR AFTER AT LEAST 3 KILLED, 7 WOUNDED IN SHOOTINGS

Philadelphia Police Sgt. Eric Gripp told the outlet that there was a ""significant project delay"" to upgrade the city’s previous system, which was compounded by the pandemic.

Mayor Jim Kenney’s office directed Fox News Digital to the police department’s statement when approached for comment.

Gripp told Axios that the lack of data to the FBI ""will have no impact on the Police Department's relationship with the community,"" and added that the city’s crime data for that year is available on its OpenDataPhilly site.

VIOLENT CRIMES ON THE RISE IN 2022, FOLLOWING PREVIOUS UNPRECEDENTED SPIKE IN MURDERS

About 40% of law enforcement agencies across the country submitted no voluntary data to the FBI for 2021, which is up from 15% in 2020, according to Axios. In Pennsylvania specifically, 31 of about 1,500 agencies reported any data to the FBI last year, which is actually higher than 2020’s figures, when 22 agencies in the state reported crime figures.

Philadelphia set an all-time record for homicides in 2021, recording 562 deaths. The crime has spilled into this year, with the city hitting 200 homicides just after Memorial Day weekend.

The skyrocketing crime in the city sparked an impeachment effort of the city's progressive district attorney, Larry Krasner, which was launched this week by three Republican state representatives.

Jerrick then countered that Republicans point to the Democrat-run cities in their states as the cause for high crime rates, to which Krasner responded that ""Republicans lie.""

Jerrick went on to press Krasner about whether he had considered resigning.

A petition for habeas corpus was filed against the Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Department and its director.

As of Thursday’s habeas corpus filing, Harrell was eight months pregnant. But Harrell has not been receiving adequate prenatal care or nutrition and has not been examined by an outside doctor since October, her attorney wrote.

Norris further argues that Harrell and her unborn child are being held ""in a cell block or pod where violent criminals are housed with"" them, including inmates who are ""housed in the pod because they have been disciplined or under investigation for fighting or committing crimes or violation of the prison rules.""

""UNBORN CHILD'S constitutionally protected due process rights have been clearly violated,"" the filing states.

READ THE HABEAS CORPUS PETITION:

""Absent immediate release of UNBORN CHILD from the Respondents, UNBORN CHILD will be likely brought into this world on the concrete floor of the prison cell, without the aid of qualified medical physicians and paramedics, and in the presence of violent criminals.""

Marc Shiner, a longtime Florida-based criminal defense attorney, told Fox News Digital a habeas corpus proceeding ""is basically saying, ‘You’re holding my client illegally.’""

He described how Florida and federal law dictate that unborn fetuses should be recognized as legal victims when impacted in the commission of several different types of crimes, even before a trial.

LAS VEGAS UBER DRIVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTS SLEEPING PASSENGER, STRANGLES WOMAN AS SHE BEGS HIM TO STOP: REPORTS

""We do recognize, in many situations, unborn fetuses as a victim,"" Shiner said. ""So, if they're a victim for criminal purposes, why are they not a criminal for penalty purposes, for penal purposes, when locking up the mother who's not even found guilty? She's presumed innocent.""

Harrell was six weeks pregnant July 23, 2022, when she shot 28-year-old Borcela inside an Uber near Southeast First Avenue and First Street in Miami, according to court papers and officials.

Video from inside the ride-share vehicle shows the pair arguing in the back seat before Harrell moves toward the front and reaches for something in her purse.

She turns toward the victim, and the pair continue to exchange words as Harrell’s hand remains in her purse.

A man seated in the front passenger seat grabs her forearm and repeatedly tells her, ""Don’t do that.""

""Get off my hand,"" she tells him. ""Can you let me go."" The vehicle is in motion throughout the argument.

Harrell and Borcela continue to exchange words for over a minute, and Harrell frees her hand. Borcela appears to lunge forward and extend her hand toward Harrell, at which point Harrell fires the gun.

Borcela, who was reportedly a mother of three, was struck once in the chest and could not be saved.

PHOENIX UBER DRIVER ATTACKED ON VIDEO

Harrell, 24 at the time, was charged with second-degree murder. Her attorney argues Harrell shot Borcela after the victim ""continued to threaten"" her and ""attempted to assault"" her.

In response to Norris’ argument in the habeas corpus filing, Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Director James Reyes, who is named in the filing, responded that Harrell’s first pregnancy test in the jail’s custody — July 26, 2022 — was negative. He said Harrell ultimately tested positive on Aug. 12.

WATCH THE VIDEO:

Reyes and the state noted that the filing should be dropped altogether because it is missing key records.

Harrell weighed 106 pounds on Aug. 22, 2022, compared to the 140 pounds she weighed on Feb. 16, 2023, the response states. And she has a history of declining or refusing her own medical treatment, Reyes wrote.

""Petitioner has been taken to at least four obstetrician appointments outside of the jail and, notably, refused to attend a fifth,"" the response states. ""[Harrell] has been offered prenatal vitamins on a daily basis for months. She has refused prenatal vitamins on more than one occasion, as recently as January 16, 2023 … [and] has refused to allow nurses and medical providers to measure the fetal heart rate.""

She has had at least 11 medical visits since August 2022, the response states. Her last appointment was inside the jail on Feb. 17.

Reyes’ attorneys wrote that Harrell would be transferred to the infirmary once she reaches 36 weeks pregnant and would be taken to the hospital to deliver the baby.

The state wrote that Harrell’s past motions included only ""sparse"" details regarding alleged medical mistreatment.

State attorneys argued that the petition for habeas corpus should be dismissed because it ""is not available as a substitute for other legal proceedings.""

""Petitioner neither claims that the mother’s arrest was illegal, challenges the trial court’s finding of probable cause, nor does Petitioner assert that there has been a wrongful denial of bail,"" the state wrote in its response. Instead, her ""claim solely relates to the alleged inadequacy of medical and prenatal care. As the claim has no legal bearing on the lawfulness of Petitioner’s detention, habeas corpus is not a proper vehicle for Petitioner’s claim.""

Puerto Rican man sentenced for committing hate crime against transgender woman,"A U.S. District Court Judge in Puerto Rico sentenced a man charged with committing a hate crime against a transgender woman in 2020 to 33 months of incarceration.

On Aug. 29, Anthony Steven Lobos-Ruiz pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting others in the attempted assault of a transgender woman identified as Alexa Negron Luciano with a paintball gun because of her gender identity.

Lobos-Ruiz and two others, Jordany Rafael Laboy-García and Christian Yamaurie Rivera-Otero, were indicted by a federal grand jury in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in August 2021 on three counts, charging them with hate crimes.

Rivera-Otero and Laboy-García were also charged with obstruction of justice.

The indictment alleged that on Feb. 24, 2020, Lobos-Ruiz, Rivera-Otero and Laboy-García were in a moving car when they saw the victim on the side of the road in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.

The three suspects recognized the person, who on social media previously identified as a man and entered a women’s restroom at a restaurant. After recognizing the person, Lobos-Ruiz, Rivera-Otero and Laboy-García allegedly harassed the victim before leaving to grab paintball guns and paintballs and returning to shoot at the victim.

According to court documents, the men recorded both encounters on their cellphones and shared the recordings with others.

The indictment alleged that Rivera-Otero told Lobos-Ruiz to delete at least one video from his cellphone, and Lobos-Ruiz complied.

Lobos-Ruiz admitted to using a paintball gun to hurt Luciano and harassing the victim. He also admitted to recording the assault with his cellphone and sharing the video with others.

U.S. District Court Judge Aida Delgado Colón sentenced Lobos-Ruiz to 33 months in prison and three years of supervised release.

Charges against Laboy-García and Rivera-Otero are still pending.

If convicted, Laboy-García and Rivera-Otero fax a maximum sentence of 10 years for the hate crime, five years for the conspiracy charge and a fine of up to $250,000.

"Rahm Emanuel leaves behind tainted legacy as Chicago murder rate, crime and corruption surge on his watch","Nearly eight years ago, Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's brash, f-bomb dropping former chief of staff swept to power in Chicago promising to cut down on crime and corruption and be the much-needed adult in the room to run America’s third-largest city.

Fast forward to Tuesday, Mayor Emanuel, in a surprise announcement, said he would not be seeking a third term, leaving behind a legacy of record homicide levels, soaring crime rates and a deep racial divide that has polarized the Windy City.

“For the last seven and a half years I’ve given my all every day and left everything on the field,” Emanuel said at a press conference this week. “This commitment has required significant sacrifice all around.”

CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL ANNOUNCES HE WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION

But the numbers tell a different story.

Since Emanuel took office in mid-May 2011, there have been more than 19,000 shootings in Chicago. In that time, there have been 4,000 murders. According to the Chicago Police Department, the average number of murders per year during Emanuel’s administration is 541. The average number of murders per year prior to Emanuel taking office was 463.

Emanuel’s surprise announcement comes as he faces harsh criticism over his handling of race relations and his response to violent crime. He’s been accused of favoring Chicago’s wealthier north and east sides while ignoring the crime-ridden, poverty-plagued areas south and west of the city.

RAHM EMANUEL UNDER INCREASING FIRE FOR LINKING CHICAGO VIOLENCE AND MORALS IN MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS

His promise of cleaning up the streets when he took office in 2011 has fallen short of expectations.

“Chicago is still known as the murder capital of America,” Dick Simpson, professor and director of undergraduate studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, told Fox News. “(Emanuel) has tried hard to deal with the problem but has not been successful.”

The mayor’s decision to step away from the political spotlight comes as the murder trial of a white police officer accused of shooting a black teenager gets underway.

Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke is accused of killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Grainy dash camera video shows McDonald writhing around on the ground after being shot 16 times.

Emanuel’s team of city attorneys fought against the release of the video for more than a year until a judge in 2015 ordered it to be made public. Many activists and community leaders accused Emanuel of trying to cover-up the incident, putting the already fragile relationship between the mayor and community into disrepair.

When it was finally released, the video sparked outrage and led to widespread protests as well as calls to gut the Chicago Police Department.

Emanuel’s administration was also on the receiving end of a scathing 2017 Department of Justice report that found Chicago police routinely used excessive force, violated civil rights and had racial bias against blacks.

The investigation, one of the largest in the nation, was prompted by the Van Dyke dash-cam video.

The report slammed the city and police for insufficient training and a failure to hold power-hungry officers accountable.

Jamie Dominguez, a professor of political science at Northwestern University, said: “[The] collection of these issues has greatly soured his relationship with a core constituency fundamental to his electoral success: the black community.”

In 2017, Black Lives Matter as well as a handful of other groups sued the city after Emanuel backed off a pledge to allow a federal judge to oversee reforms.

""Chicago has proven time and time again that it is incapable of ending its own regime of terror, brutality and discriminatory policing,"" the lawsuit said. ""Absent federal court supervision, nothing will improve.""

Emanuel has also faced backlash for seeming to look the other way when it comes to crime in some parts of the city.

The majority of Chicago shootings take place in the city’s south and west sides - areas not only marked by deteriorating neighborhoods but that also lack quick, efficient emergency care.

Last year, the number of murders in Chicago was up 47 percent versus 2010.

Even though Chicago’s homicide rate is high compared to other major cities, as of Sept. 3, it has seen a 19 percent decrease from the year before. The city clocked 462 murders during the first nine months of 2017. In 2018, the number fell to 375.

While authorities have attributed the decrease to improvements in technology as well as a coordinated effort to rebuild relationships in the community, not everyone is convinced.

PICTURE OF SNOOZING CHICAGO COP GOES VIRAL AFTER VIOLENT WEEKEND

“We can’t survive another year of mayhem,” Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill., recently told Fox News. “The stress and strain of it is so great. Everyone seems to be on different pages and there are constant crosses and difficult situations to bear.”

Widespread crime has also taken a toll on Chicago’s children. Each month this calendar year, at least one minor has been shot and killed in Chicago.

According to data compiled by The Chicago Tribune, since September 2011 at least 174 people under the age of 17 have been killed while 1,665 kids have been shot.

Prior to dropping out of the race, Emanuel’s political opponents took him to task for blaming a lack of morals in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods for an uptick in violent crime.

Emanuel urged locals to “be a neighbor” and “speak up” to help law enforcement pursue killers, gang members and drug dealers.

After one particularly violent weekend in early August when nearly 80 people were shot, Emanuel deflected questions about police staffing and strategy. Instead, he ignited a firestorm when he said there needs to be a politically incorrect conversation about character and values.

Critics called him out for what they dubbed tone-deaf comments, in which Emanuel seemed to be blaming the victims.

Shari Runner, former president and CEO of the Chicago Urban League, deemed the remarks insensitive. ""I cannot see the victims of racist policies and bigoted practices shamed by anyone who says they need to do better or be better in their circumstance. I won’t accept it,” Runner said

Prior to Emanuel’s decision to duck out of the mayoral race, a dozen or so candidates had lined up to challenge him. After his announcement, political watchers expect that number to rise significantly.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/rahm-emanuel-leaves-behind-tainted-legacy-as-chicago-murder-rate-crime-and-corruption-surge-on-his-watch,N/A
"Don't buy the hype, 'rogue' prosecutors driving violent crime surge, not guns: Expert","Soft-on-crime district attorneys across the country are to blame for a spike in violent crime – not firearms, a former federal prosecutor told Fox News Digital.

""Guns don’t commit crimes, neither do knives and hammers, people do,"" said Charles Stimson, now a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""It’s a red herring to focus on guns rather than the harder issue of how to enforce the law fairly and hold criminals accountable.""

LA COUNTY DA GASCON RIPPED AGAIN FOR LENIENT CRIME POLICIES: ‘NOT ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF VICTIMS OF CRIME’

During a visit to New York City last week, President Biden said he would help Mayor Eric Adams get illegal guns off the streets to combat cresting violent crime.

Across the country homicides were up 30% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to FBI data. The murder rate in 22 major U.S. cities was up 44% in 2021 compared to 2019 and 5% compared to 2020, according to a study from the non-partisan Council on Criminal Justice.

Stimson blamed much of these increases on progressive district attorneys who have weakened consequences for a range of serious crimes in mostly Democratic-run cities.

""It is not true that crime is rising in every big city — it’s true that it’s rising in cities that have elected rogue prosecutors,"" Stimson said, specifically highlighting the policies of George Gascón in Los Angeles, Chesa Boudin in San Francisco, Kim Foxx in Chicago, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia and others.

They have all argued that most misdemeanors should not be prosecuted, lobbied for lighter sentences for serious felonies and pushed for the elimination of cash bail.

FATHER OF SLAIN UCLA GRAD STUDENT BLAMES POLITICIANS FOR CRIME SPIKE

The result has been mass shoplifting, open prostitution, drug markets and, in many cases, record numbers of shootings and murders, he said.

Stimson, who formerly worked as an Assistant US Attorney in D.C., contended that giving a pass on lower level crimes breeds more serious misconduct.

He compared the murder rate in Philadelphia to San Diego, two similarly sized cities. Last year under Krasner’s watch, Philadelphia suffered the bloodiest year in its history clocking 562 murders, he said.

There were 48 homicides that same year in San Diego under DA Summer Stephan, who he called a more law-and-order Democrat.

CHICAGO: 3 SMASH AND GRAB ROBBERIES IN 20 MINUTES ON CITY'S NORTHWEST SIDE

Jeffrey Butts, the director of the Research & Evaluation Center at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, disagreed with Stimson.

""The argument about woke prosecutors is entirely ideological and devoid of evidence,"" Butts told Fox News Digital. ""There’s no correlation between the quality and tone of prosecution and the violent crime surge we’ve seen in the last two years all over the country.""

He added that strong federal gun control laws would drive down violent crime by stemming the flow of firearms from states with more permissive firearm laws.

Studies have shown that aggressive prosecution and severe punishment will cost an enormous amount of money, hurt communities and not improve public safety, he said. ""Certain and swift punishment are more powerful crime deterrents,"" Butts added.

Stimson countered that coddling criminals increases crime and fails victims. True reform, he said, is the creation of diversion courts that offer alternatives to incarceration if participants comply with the programs.

These courts, which often handle cases involving veterans, drug addiction, the mentally ill, domestic violence and teens, began decades ago under both Democratic and Republican prosecutors.

The dueling experts agreed that these programs are an effective cornerstone of criminal justice reform.

Butts said that much of the debate about crime and justice is ""performative."" Politicians on both sides say what they believe will please their constituents — even if it’s impractical. ""We need more of a rational, deliberate debate instead of performative drama,"" he said.

In a controversial memo Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg issued last month in his first week in office, he told prosecutors not to ask for pretrial detention for a slew of crimes, including robbery, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking and witness tampering.

EMBATTLED MANHATTAN DA ALVIN BRAGG BACKPEDALS ON CONTROVERSIAL SOFT-ON-CRIME POLICIES

He also urged prosecutors not to seek prison time except for the most serious felonies — including murder and sexual assault. Bragg has since walked back some of his positions after fierce backlash.

Stimson further argued that what critics call the get-out-of-jail-free approach of progressive district attorneys is contributing to the demonization and demoralization of police.

Officers have stopped arresting suspects for certain crimes like resisting arrest or possession with intent to distribute because many DAs no longer prosecute them.

With bail reform, suspects are immediately released and sometimes commit new crimes eroding the public’s confidence and trust in law enforcement, he added.

Seven cops have been shot this year in New York City — two of whom died from their injuries.

""The criminals are laughing,"" he said.

Stimson predicted that the end result of these lenient crime policies will be disastrous for big cities.

""They’re going to be hellholes until people, the people most impacted by these crimes, the Black and the Brown people, realize this,"" he said.

"San Francisco residents arming themselves with bats, say city drug initiative making crime worse","San Francisco residents are reportedly arming themselves with bats and other protective weapons after a drug sobering center opened in the city, which some say has caused a spike in drug use, as well as crime.

""They’re letting their clients come out here and get high, go inside and get sober and then get high again,"" business owner and resident Mark Sackett told ABC7.

The city’s first drug sobering center opened in the SoMa neighborhood back in June, and some residents say the opening of the location has increased the presence of ""troublemakers.""

""More troublemakers settling in, feeling comfortable doing their drugs, pissing and s---ting in the street blocking the sidewalks,"" a man who only identified himself by his first name, Ghis, told ABC7. He called what he is currently seeing ""a period of insanity.""

""If you ask me, it should be closed down and there should be other approaches to the homeless and drug problem we're all facing,"" he added.

The drug sobering center, SOMA RISE, opened in June with the support of Democratic Mayor London Breed.

""The Mayor remains focused on ensuring San Francisco is a place where people want to live, visit, do business and work. Addressing public safety is our top priority. She understands people are fed up and shares their frustrations,"" Breed's office told Fox News Digital later Wednesday.

The center has a $4.2 million budget funded by taxpayers for the 2022/2023 fiscal year, $3.5 million of which goes to the center’s lease and the nonprofit that runs the center, The San Francisco Department of Public Health told ABC7.

""We can’t fix everything, but we’re a piece of that; a piece of the city trying novel things to respond to people experiencing homeless and street drug use and mental illness,"" HealthRight 360 CEO Vitka Eisen told the outlet.

The nonprofit has made some changes in recent days, including putting a halt to handing out food and ""drug supplies"" on the streets outside the clinic to help prevent loitering.

The center, which has 20 beds and assists about 240 people per week, has an 18-month contract for the location. The city will then reassess the clinic, according to ABC7.

""Since opening in July, more than 1,000 visits have been made to SoMa RISE and 89% of those visits are from individuals in the Tenderloin and SOMA neighborhoods. During this time, a number of clients have left SoMa RISE and engaged in services such as detox facilities and safer sleeper arrangements, which helps keep them off the streets,"" the San Francisco Department of Public Health told Fox News Digital Wednesday of the clinic. ""Additionally, several hundred kits of naloxone, the lifesaving medication that reverses drug overdoses, have been distributed to clients of SoMa RISE since it opened three months ago. One recent success was documented by the mother of a man with substance use disorder, in a letter to Mayor Breed, that SoMa RISE has helped her son stay safe and become mentally present again.""

Breed declared a state of emergency last year relating to drug overdoses in the Tenderloin District, which is located near the SoMa neighborhood.

CONCERNS ESCALATE OVER SAN FRANCISCO'S RISING CRIME HURTING BUSINESS

In June, San Francisco voted to recall then-District Attorney Chesa Boudin, whose critics said he implemented progressive policies such as eliminating cash bail and had a soft-handed approach toward drug crimes. Boudin's replacement, Brooke Jenkins, has reversed many of her predecessor's policies since being appointed, but that hasn't made the city noticeably safer, residents told Fox News.

""Safety in California and San Francisco is horrible,"" Keith, a longtime San Franciscan, said. ""I do not feel safe in the city at all.""

""On crime, they don't do anything, they just let the criminals out,"" he continued.

Keith, who worked at a grocery store in the San Francisco Marina, said criminals used to steal goods from the store, and employees were advised to do nothing. He blamed Proposition 47, a California measure passed in 2014 that prevents shoplifters from being charged with a felony if they steal $950 or less worth of goods.

That data also shows that larceny has risen 3% since Jenkins took office on July 8, 2022, through October 13, 2022.

Susan told Fox News she's seen car break-ins and thefts from local drug stores and said that many homeless people commit crimes to make money.

""The blue BMW could be seen across the street, and he doesn't act right away, he waits for that perfect moment to jump out,"" Village of Mamaroneck Police Department Lt. P.J. Trujillo told ABC 7 of the incident at Diamond Car Wash.

Another BMW was stolen at the Dip In Car Wash in Mamaroneck, while a Mercedes was stolen at a car wash in Manhasset and an Audi stolen from a car wash in Oceanside, according to local reports this month.

Police in New York are advising that drivers use car washes that allow them to remain in the vehicle or to ask the attendant to return the car’s key fob once the vehicle comes out of the wash.

""You should never lose sight of your vehicle,"" Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder told WCBS 880. ""As soon as it gets out, make sure that the company that’s doing it pulls that vehicle aside and then ask them to shut the car off and give them the keys as they go to dry the vehicle. Do not leave the car running in that situation.""

Drivers can also buy a ""kill switch"" for their vehicles, which can turn cars off from a distance.

In Tennessee this month, criminals took another brazen tactic to steal: targeting cars at a funeral for a veteran.

""We were probably only a hundred feet from where the cars were to the grave site. We didn’t hear anything, didn’t have any indications there were issues,"" one mourner told Fox 13.

Family and friends gathered at the Memphis Funeral Home & Memorial Gardens in Bartlett on Monday to celebrate the life of Air Force veteran D’Laine Camp, 91. When mourners returned to their vehicles, they found some car windows were broken and personal items were stolen, including one woman’s purse.

""When we went back to our cars, I looked … like my window had been left open. I said, ‘Well, I didn’t leave my window open.’ It wasn’t left open. It was burst out,"" one man told Fox 13.

A similar situation played out in Maryland earlier this month when mourners left a funeral service for an Army veteran and found that several cars at the cemetery were broken into. While earlier this year in Illinois, a car thief also targeted a funeral home, driving off with the establishment’s van, which had a dead body in the back.

University of Minnesota crime concerns: School announces new safety committee after shots fired near campus,"The University of Minnesota (UMN) on Tuesday announced a new safety committee following a Monday meeting discussing concerns about crime on and near campus.

The Strategic Safety Advisory Committee, which will include students, parents, school staff and city representatives, will present ideas to UMN and the city of Minneapolis to improve campus safety, according to a press release.

""The University continues to invest significantly and partner with local agencies to enhance safety and deter crime. But urgent and real safety concerns demand more collaboration than ever before to find effective, layered solutions,"" University President Joan Gabel said in a Tuesday statement.

""That can only be accomplished by bringing together a group like this one,"" Gabel added. ""It will help us examine what tools we already have or need to support our partnerships with the City of Minneapolis and Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), and how we can enhance public safety in these off-campus neighborhoods.""

DEREK CHAUVIN FACES SENTENCING ON FEDERAL CHARGES IN GEORGE FLOYD KILLING

The new committee comes after approximately 200 UMN parents on Monday met with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Gabel, as well as chiefs from MPD and the University of Minnesota Police Department (UMNPD) to express concern with a 45% rise in violent crime near the school's campus since 2019, KSTP reported.

""We care about this city, and we care that the students at the University are safe,"" Frey said during the Monday meeting, the outlet reported. ""And, it is incumbent upon us do to everything possible whether that’s lighting, technology improvements, or whether that’s expanding law enforcement, or making sure we’re working directly with our police officers to have the right patrols in the right place at the right time to strategically keep people safe.""

Parents' concerns were underscored by reports of shots fired on the morning of July 8 at a burrito joint located just outside UNM in Minneapolis' Dinkytown neighborhood in an area where some students live off-campus. Officers with the Minneapolis Police Department and UMPD responded but they reported no injuries.

A video posted to TikTok also appears to show the aftermath of shots fired Friday into a residential building.

Officers recovered evidence of gunfire from the scene, which is currently listed as a ""damage-to-property"" report since there were no victims, the police department told Fox News Digital.

MPD is currently handling the investigation into the incident, and officers have not made any arrests as of Tuesday afternoon.

A university watchdog Twitter account suggested that the school did not send out a safety alert — called ""SAFE U"" alerts — to students following the incident.

UMN said in a statement that ""SAFE U Emergency Notifications are issued upon confirmation of a significant emergency or dangerous situation that poses an immediate threat to campus.""

""SAFE U Advisory Notifications are issued when a reported crime, occurring on University Clery Geography, is determined to pose a serious or on-going threat to the campus community but does not require immediate action,"" a university spokesperson said.

The next day on July 10, UMN issued a safety alert after two teenage suspects committed a robbery on the 1100 block of University Avenue.

One student's father, Brian Peck, said during the Monday meeting that his son lived in a fraternity house on University Avenue where, early last month, more than 50 rounds were fired and a 15-year-old boy sustained gunshot wounds, the outlet reported.

""My son said after that shooting, 'Mom and Dad, do you know every day I wake up and go to class I am scared for my life?'"" Peck shared at the meeting.

New restrictions on Washington state police may lead to spike in crime,"As the most sweeping police reform in the nation takes effect in Washington state over a year after the death of George Floyd, law enforcement agencies outside of Seattle are arguing new restrictions set on officers when interacting with the public may further incentivize criminal activity.

The nearly a dozen bills, passed by a legislature controlled by Democrats and signed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee in May, took effect on July 25 and cover virtually all aspects of policing, including the background checks officers undergo before they're hired; when they are authorized to use force and how they collect data about it; and the establishment of an entirely new state agency to review police use of deadly force.

Perhaps the most concerning changes come under two new laws, H.B. 1310 and H.B. 1054, because they take away officers’ ability to pursue criminals or prevent crimes from occurring, Lewis County Sheriff Robert Snaza told Fox News. Under the first new law, officers now must have probable cause, a higher threshold, instead of traditionally just reasonable suspicion, before they can use force.

That means, according to Snaza, if a property owner calls police to report a potential robbery taking place at their home, and deputies arrive but only witness individuals walking off the property, they no longer are able to use force to detain those individuals while they further investigate. And that’s even if those people match the description of the suspect.

WASHINGTON MAN ARRESTED IN MURDER OF 19-YEAR-OLD IN SEATTLE'S CHOP ZONE LAST YEAR

""We’re are going to see a dramatic increase in criminal activity,"" Snaza said in a phone interview with Fox News. ""What’s going to happen is, there’s going to be a lot of backpedaling. These Democrat legislators are going to say that’s not what we meant, we didn’t mean to take the tools away. That is backpedaling because Washington Association of Sheriffs & Police Chiefs (WASPC), federal police and all these other organizations told these legislators the consequences. They told them what was going to happen, and they chose not to listen.""

Furthermore, Snaza argues the law fails those suffering from mental health, drug addiction and homelessness, and the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office has moved to no longer send deputies to mental health calls. Under the new legislation, deputies will only be allowed to use force to detain an individual in mental health crisis if they pose an ""imminent threat"" to themselves or others.

""If someone is having a mental health crisis, we may go there to their house, but if they’re not breaking the law, we can’t even use force or basically touch them,"" Snaza said. ""We can talk to them and try to de-escalate. But if we determine there is no crime, then we call in mental health and say, 'Hey, you guys might want to come out here and take care of this person.’""

Uncertainty exists about how to apply the new laws, and faced with limited resources, each agency must choose whether it's worth responding to such noncriminal mental health calls when officers are now required to exhaust de-escalation tactics, which can include just leaving the scene.

In the past, deputies who encountered someone who appeared to be a danger to him/herself or others, was acting suicidal or threatening physical violence could involuntarily take that individual in custody and bring them to an appropriate mental health provider for treatment. The bar for involuntary committal was already very high, Snaza said, but the new law raised it even higher.

""What we did is we just went backwards on helping people with mental health needs, substance abuse disorders, and the homeless. Those three things go hand in hand,"" Snaza said. ""These laws have done nothing to protect those people and help those people get out of the situation they’re in.""

State Rep. Jesse Johnson, the first-term Federal Way Democrat who sponsored bills on police tactics and use of force, acknowledged some clarifications are necessary — but said that's not uncommon in complex legislation. The higher standard is designed to keep police from using force against the wrong person — something that happens too often, especially in communities of color, Johnson said.

""We have to create new policies, because what we were doing before was not working,"" Johnson told The Associated Press. ""What we wanted to do with these bills is set an expectation that officers de-escalate and that there's less lethal enforcement of the law. A lot of the pushback we're getting is because it's a paradigm shift.""

SEATTLE MAYOR CALLS FOR MORE POLICE AFTER SIX SHOOTINGS IN ONE WEEKEND

The measures also restrict when officers can engage in car chases, make it easier to decertify police for bad acts, and make it easier to sue individual officers. Several law enforcement agencies in Thurston County said Monday they intend to largely stop handling ""community care"" situations, such as suicidal people, welfare checks and drug overdoses, instead letting crisis responders, firefighters or emergency medics handle such calls.

Snaza told Fox News the new laws, Seattle police’s decision earlier this year to no longer detain or arrest people or confiscate drugs, and a Washington Supreme Court’s ruling on drug possession, have also negatively impacted how agencies outside the liberal hub fight addiction.

""In 85% of Washington, we still have rural communities, we still have community-based police. We still have all of these great things. But the trend is let’s follow what Seattle is doing,"" Snaza said. ""Because they said, ‘Well, we don’t arrest people who are doing drugs in front of cops.’ Well to me, you do that in Lewis County, you get to go to jail, and you know what you get at jail? You get to see mental health. You get to see counselors. And you get a pathway to getting transitional housing.""

Meanwhile, H.B. 1054 also has arguably conflicting language. It bans chokeholds, neck restraints and no-knock warrants, and limits the use of tear gas and military equipment. Inspired by the officers who stood by in Minneapolis as their colleague Derek Chauvin pressed a knee to Floyd's neck, the measure also requires officers to intervene when a colleague engages in excessive force and to report misconduct.

The restriction on military-grade weaponry would inadvertently ban some less-lethal impact weapons, including the shotguns police use to fire beanbag rounds. Johnson said the context makes clear the intent was to embrace, not ban, less-lethal weapons. He expected the state attorney general to clarify that until the Legislature can fix the wording next year

But in the meantime, some departments, including the Lewis County Sheriff’s Office, the King County Sheriff's Office and Spokane police, have hung up their beanbag weapons, while others, including Kent and Auburn south of Seattle, will continue using them.

""Now because of those two bills, one says de-escalate and the other says take away my tools. Well, you can’t have both. So now we’ve had to remove all of our less-lethal shotguns from our vehicles, and we’re encouraging all our smaller agencies to do the same,"" Snaza said. ""They’ll say, ‘That’s not the intent of the law,’ but the sad part is the letter of the law says ‘you shall not use 50 caliber or larger,’ so if a judge looks at it, he or she will look at the letter of the law, not the intent.""

The laws are taking affect as officers have left the state or the profession in droves.

Seattle is down hundreds of officers following large-scale demonstrations calling to ""defund the police"" last year. There’s been a huge increase in early retirements, and officers across Washington are leaving for jobs in Idaho, Montana and elsewhere.

"Zeldin: NY crime not going anywhere because election is over, residents tasked with deciding whether to stay","Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost his election for New York governor to incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul, said that just because the election is over, crime issues plaguing the state will not disappear.

""The governor is going to have to step in and crack down on [crime]. We have to support our men and women in law enforcement. Many of the issues that we were campaigning on, they don't just go away the day after an election,"" Zeldin said on ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""

""And we continue to see that with all the crime headlines that continue to be part of the news. And that's going to impact New Yorkers deciding whether or not to stay in this state and for others to decide whether or not to travel to New York,"" he continued.

Zeldin campaigned on law and order as the state, and in particular, New York City, has been throttled by rising crime over the last few years. Zeldin blamed the crime rates on soft-on-crime district attorney and policies such as bail reform, which went into effect in the state in 2020 and eliminated cash bail options for most nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors.

DESPITE LOSS, ZELDIN REMAINS PROUD OF 'ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION CAMPAIGN'

""It's really important as the Democrats go forward that they understand that they can't be passing more pro-criminal laws. They need to make changes to some of the pro-criminal laws they have passed already, like cashless bail. We still have rogue district attorneys like Alvin Bragg who might be emboldened to go forward with policies refusing to enforce the law,"" Zeldin said.

Hochul received nearly 53% of the vote on Tuesday compared to Zeldin’s 47%. Though he lost, Zeldin noted that he was the first ""Republican statewide candidate in the last 52 years"" to receive as many votes as he did.

""There's a lot we need to build upon here in New York. We saw big victories in Asian American communities. We won Chinatown and Manhattan and Sunset Park and Brooklyn and Flushing and Queens, great progress with Latino voters, with Black voters with Orthodox Jewish voters. We won a lot of important down ballot races. And many different competitive House seats unfortunately flipped from blue to red, which is a big deal as far as the effort to regain control of the House of Representatives,"" he continued.

Mexican beach town announces major crackdown amid country's crime crisis ahead of spring break,"Mexican authorities in at least one major city have taken steps to improve security ahead of a busy tourist season and spring break as high crime remains a chief concern.

""We strengthen security with the construction of three filters at points marked by the heat map, such as the accesses to Cancun-Playa del Carmen, Tulum-Playa del Carmen and Valladolid-Playa del Carmen, as well as in Villas del Sol, to guarantee a safe stay for visitors and locals,"" Municipal President Lili Campos said during a press conference earlier this month.

The coastal resort town of Playa del Carmen, which sits roughly 40 miles south of Cancun, has announced plans to increase the number of patrols from 20 a day to 314, which will reflect ""better security in the municipality,"" according to Campos.

The announcement followed the discovery of four murdered people inside a van in the Ejidal neighborhood of Playa del Carmen, according to Reportur, a news outlet dedicated to Latin American tourism news.

Pope Francis says homosexuality is 'not a crime' but remains a 'sin' among Catholic doctrine,"Pope Francis said during an interview Tuesday homosexual relations are ""not a crime"" and called laws that penalize homosexuality ""unjust.""

At the Vatican, the Pontiff said that God loves everyone as they are and called on Catholics to do more to welcome people from the LGBTQ community into the church. He also encouraged them to support laws allowing homosexual practices.

""Being homosexual isn’t a crime,"" Francis told The Associated Press.

Amid his remarks, Francis said there needed to be a distinction between a legal crime and a religious sin with regard to homosexual practices: ""It's not a crime. Yes, but it's a sin. Fine, but first, let's distinguish between a sin and a crime.""

POPE FRANCIS WARNS OF 'ELEGANT DEMON' LURKING AMONG VATICAN STAFF

The Pope added: ""It's also a sin to lack charity with one another.""

The Pope also addressed how some Catholic bishops support laws criminalizing homosexuality in some parts of the world. He, too, has referred to the issue in terms of ""sin"" but said bishops and others should undergo a process to change their thinking to recognize the dignity of all people.

""These bishops have to have a process of conversion,"" he said, saying the bishops should observe the same ""tenderness, as God has for each one of us.""

The Associated Press reported 67 countries or jurisdictions around the world have laws on the books criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity. Of these countries, 11 can or do impose the death penalty, according to The Human Dignity Trust.

Such laws, even if not enforced, can contribute to harassment, violence or allow people to become stigmatization against LGBTQ people, according to the United Nations, which has repeatedly called for an end to such laws.

POPE DERIDES BIDEN'S ABORTION VIEWS, CATHOLIC SELF-IDENTITY AS 'INCOHERENCE'

The UN also said such laws violate rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. They are also a breach of international law to protect the human rights of all people, per the international body.

Francis called these laws ""unjust,"" and said the Catholic Church could and should work to put an end to them. ""It must do this. It must do this,"" he emphasized.

Francis also said gays must be welcomed and respected: ""We are all children of God, and God loves us as we are and for the strength that each of us fights for our dignity.""

The Pope has made embracing the LGBTQ community a hallmark of his papacy but he has not challenged or changed Catholic teachings, which say people must be treated with respect but homosexuality is ""intrinsically disordered.""

CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE DEFENDS POLICY TO NOT ADMIT CHILDREN WHO REJECT THEIR BIOLOGICAL SEX

Francis repeatedly and publicly ministered to the gay and trans community and once favored granting legal protections to same-sex couples without wholely endorsing gay marriage, which Catholic doctrine forbids.

Despite the appreciable remarks, the Pontiff has been careful not to use the Vatican’s doctrine office to support or bless same-sex unions ""because God cannot bless sin,"" he said in 2021.

Such laws that impose the death penalty for homosexuality are common in Africa and the Middle East, some of which are inspired by Islamic law.

Catholic bishops are somewhat torn on the issue as some maintain a literal interpretation of Scripture and do not recognize homosexual relations, while others call for laws against homosexuality to be overturned.
