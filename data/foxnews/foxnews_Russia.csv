0,Putin promises to build up Russia's nuclear arsenal after backing out of New START treaty with US,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he will strengthen Russia's nuclear forces, announcing that his military is prepared to deploy a new intercontinental ballistic missile system with hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines.

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches its one-year anniversary, Putin has declared that Russia will pull back from the New START treaty negotiated with the United States, signaling his intention to ramp up the country's nuclear armaments. In a speech commemorating Defender of the Fatherland Day, a Russian holiday that honors the country's armed forces, Putin said Russia will continue to ""focus on strengthening the nuclear triad.""

He said the new RS-28 Sarmat liquid-fueled missile, also called ""Satan 2,"" is ready for combat deployment after a years-long delay. The ""nuclear triad"" refers to missiles based on land, sea and in the air.

""This year, the first Sarmat missile system launchers with the new heavy missile will be put on combat duty,"" Putin announced. ""We will continue full production of the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic systems and begin mass deployment of Tsirkon sea-launched hypersonic missiles.""

RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN NEW START NUCLEAR TREATY WITH US, PUTIN SAYS

On Tuesday, Putin announced that Russia would suspend its participation in the New START treaty, which caps the number of nuclear armaments each country can possess at 1,550 warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

He also threatened to resume testing nuclear weapons if Western nations do not cease their aid to Ukraine, which is suffering under a brutal Russian invasion. Putin has characterized the conflict as an attempt by Russia to defend itself from encroaching Western powers and asserted that neo-Nazi forces have ""taken root in Ukraine.""

PUTIN ISSUES NUCLEAR WARNING TO US, THREATENS TO RESUME WEAPONS TESTS

Russia's Sarmat missile is 35 meters long (nearly 115 feet), has a range of 18,000 km (about 11,000 miles) and is able to carry at least 10 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles — each with a nuclear warhead — that can be aimed at different targets, Reuters reported.

Putin also noted the completion of a new nuclear-powered submarine called ""Emperor Alexander III,"" which is now operational in the Russian navy.

""With the Borei-A nuclear-powered submarine Emperor Alexander III becoming operational in the navy, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the naval strategic nuclear forces will reach 100 percent,"" Putin said. ""In the coming years, three more cruisers from this project will be delivered to the navy.""

Launched in late December, the Emperor Alexander III is the seventh Borei-A class submarine, which can carry 16 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles.

Putin also reaffirmed Russia's commitment to developing ""modern and efficient"" conventional forces, relying on combat experience to ""pursue balanced and high-quality development of all components of the armed forces"" and ""improve the system for training units.""

""We will continue to supply advanced equipment to our troops, including new strike systems, reconnaissance and communications equipment, drones and artillery systems,"" Putin said.

1,China edges closer to sending lethal aid to Russia as UN votes to condemn invasion of Ukraine: report,"Russia is in talks with China to purchase 100 combat drones, according to a new report published just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had evidence Beijing was weighing lethal aid to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

Der Spiegel reports that Moscow is looking to commission a Chinese manufacturer to mass produce the drones – with a delivery date as early as April.

Per the report, Xian Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology, a Chinese drone manufacturer, has said it was prepared to make 100 prototypes of its ZT-180 drone, which carry a 35-50 kg warhead.

The drones are similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to kill hundreds of Ukrainians and damage infrastructure.

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Bingo had plans to establish a productive site for the drones in Russia.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Fox News Digital has contacted the State Department for comment on the report but did not hear back before publication.

Former intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler argued that China's decision calculus is ""entirely rational"" as helping Russia militarily keeps the U.S. bogged down in Ukraine and focusing on the European theater as Beijing eyes Taiwan.

""The biggest challenge for the United States would be to have to be engaged in two wars simultaneously, albeit by proxy – one with Russia, on behalf of Ukraine, and the other with China, on behalf of Taiwan,"" Koffler said. ""There are concerns within the Pentagon about how long U.S. stockpile would last if Russia and China were to challenge us in a two-theater war.""

The Der Spiegel report comes days after Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price warned Wednesday there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Also on Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. The resolution, drafted by Ukraine in consultation with its allies, passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions.

2,Blinken insists Biden 'makes the decisions' in US response to Russia,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during a lengthy interview about Russia a year after the invasion of Ukraine, took a moment to insist that when it comes to how the United States handles the situation, President Biden is the one calling the shots.

Blinken was in the middle of discussing how Biden wants to continue supporting Ukraine but does not want to ""broaden"" the war, then made it clear that it is indeed up to Biden.

""And by the way, he’s the one who makes the decisions,"" Blinken told Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. ""The rest of us, we can give him advice, recommendations, if you’re not in government you can opine and criticize, which is always what’s needed to make sure we’re doing the best that we can, but ultimately, as the saying goes, the buck stops with him. And that’s something that he takes very seriously.""

The statement came at a time when it remains a question whether Biden will seek re-election in 2024. Members of both parties have expressed concern about the president's ability to win and serve a second term, as he recently turned 80.

Blinken also heaped praise on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the interview, lauding him for how he has handled the Russian invasion, going back to when Blinken first warned him that he believed an invasion was coming.

""Right man, right place, right time. Someone who stood up to this moment in history,"" Blinken said, adding that the Ukrainian leader has ""become an extraordinary figure on the world stage, as well, all to the benefit of his country.""

Blinken also addressed the nature of the situation between Russia and the U.S., fielding a question of whether it is Cold War-like in nature. The secretary noted that the current conflict is not ideologically based in terms of communism versus capitalism.

""It is about an imperialist power that is seeking to aggress another country, and to aggress the principles at the heart of the U.N. charter that are there to try to keep the peace around the world, and many countries standing up against that,"" Blinken said. ""So in that sense, I don't see it as a Cold War, I see it as a large part of the world standing up against aggression.""

Blinken added that opposing Russia's aggression is not just important for fending off the threat to the Ukrainian people, but for making sure ""that other would-be aggressors"" do not ""get the wrong message from what Russia is doing.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blinken-insists-biden-makes-decisions-us-response-russia,N/A
3,US warned Russia of Biden's visit to Ukraine 'hours' before departure,"U.S. officials warned Russia that President Biden was visiting the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv hours before he made the trip, the White House National Security Council revealed Monday.

National security officials provided more details about Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday, calling the trip unprecedented given the lack of U.S. military infrastructure in the war-torn region. Reporters pressed national security adviser Jake Sullivan on whether the U.S. had warned Moscow that Biden was headed to Kyiv, a city scarred with Russian missile strikes.

""We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv,"" Sullivan told reporters Monday. ""We did so some hours before his departure for de-confliction purposes.""

Sullivan declined to elaborate on how the Russians were notified and whether they responded, however.

Sullivan went on to characterize the trip as an ""affirmation"" of the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine.

""This was not a celebration,"" he clarified, adding that there will likely be dark days ahead.

UKRAINE WARNS OF MASSIVE RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON ANNIVERSARY OF PUTIN’S INVASION: ‘WE HAVE TO BE READY’

Biden himself acknowledged the challenges facing Ukraine in comments during his visit. Large areas of Ukraine remain under Russian control even after months of successful ground offensives from Kyiv's forces.

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" Biden said in a Monday statement.

Sirens could be heard in war-torn Ukraine as Biden arrived in the country. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also announced $5.5 billion in aid for Ukraine as Biden visited with Zelenskyy.

Biden's visit comes just before Russia is expected to ramp up its offensive once again in its own acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Ukrainian officials warned of a massive barrage of missiles that Russia may launch on Friday, Feb. 24.

4,"Russia suspends participation in New START nuclear treaty with US, Putin says","Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday that Russia was pulling back from the New START treaty with the United States which reduces and limits each country's nuclear arsenal.

""In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty,"" Putin said in his annual address to the nation, just one day after President Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine.

In his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast Russia and Ukraine as victims of Western double-dealing. He said Russia, not Ukraine, was the one fighting for its very existence.

The speech reiterated a litany of grievances that the Russian leader has frequently offered as justification for the widely condemned war and ignored international demands to pull back from occupied areas in Ukraine.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV. UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

The New START treaty, first signed in April 2010, limits the U.S. and Russia from having more than 1,550 nuclear warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

Both the U.S. and Russia are capable of deploying far more than the allotted nuclear warheads as Washington and Moscow have a combined total of more than 13,000 warheads – making up roughly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal, according to data provided by the Arms Control Association.

Following the nuclear arms race that largely came to an end with the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.N. has pushed for nuclear disarmament and global warheads inventories have dropped since hitting their peak in 1985, when more than 70,000 warheads were estimated to make up global stockpiles.

Putin's speech comes three days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has continued its attack on Ukraine over the last year despite Western sanctions and losses on the battlefield. Ukraine's defense has been supported by a number of other countries, most of which are in the West.

Ukrainian officials have said they expect Russia to ramp up its offensive in Moscow's acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the war on Feb. 24.

Biden on Monday met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mariinsky Palace to announce an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES MILLIONS MORE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ASSIST UKRAINE DURING SURPRISE TRIP TO KYIV

The new assistance includes shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, air surveillance radars and other aid but does not offer new advanced weaponry.

Biden said he visited Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy and ""reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."" He said Putin was ""dead wrong"" in believing Ukraine was weak when he launched the invasion a year ago.

""I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine.""

6,Russia denies planning hypersonic missile test in South Africa,"The Russian military denied Wednesday that it was planning to test its new Zircon hypersonic missiles during naval drills off the coast of South Africa this week that will coincide with the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine.

China's navy also is participating in the Indian Ocean exercises, which come at a time when Russia's relationship with the West is at its lowest point since the Cold War, and ties between China and the United States are under serious strain.

As Russian and Chinese warships prepared in South Africa for their joint drills, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted China's most senior foreign policy official at the Kremlin. Those meetings showed the strengthening of Russia's relationship with China and raised concern in the West that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support for its war in Ukraine.

RUSSIAN UNION SUSPENDED FROM INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF JOURNALISTS FOR ACTIONS FOLLOWING UKRAINE INVASION

Russia's aims for the naval exercises came under scrutiny because of the involvement of the Admiral Gorshkov, a frigate which is armed with hypersonic missiles and has served as the main testbed for them. The ship arrived in Cape Town last week emblazoned with the letters Z and V, letters also seen on Russian weapons on the front lines in Ukraine and which are used as patriotic symbols in Russia.

Russia has said the Zircon missiles can penetrate any missile defense systems by flying at an astounding 7,000 miles per hour — around nine times the speed of sound — to strike targets at sea and on land. They have a range of over 620 miles, Russia claims.

Putin sent the Admiral Gorshkov on a trans-ocean cruise last month in a show of force as tensions with the West escalated over Ukraine. But a Russian navy officer in South Africa said Wednesday that the exercises would focus on maritime security, including the fight against piracy, and the Zircons would not be fired.

The drills will involve ""mutual maneuvering of the three sides, assistance of the suffering vessel in a disaster, liberation of a captured vessel by the pirates, and artillery fire which, according to our schedule, does not include the firing with the hypersonic missiles,"" Capt. Oleg Gladkiy said. He spoke through a translator.

The Admiral Gorshkov and a Russian oil tanker for refueling, a Chinese destroyer, frigate and a support vessel, and a South African frigate will be involved in the exercises, according to a South African military statement released last week.

Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa, Liubov Abravitova., criticized the timing of the drills, which will overlap with Friday's one-year anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine.

Abravitova noted that China, Russia and South Africa, which are partners in the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, have undertaken joint naval drills before but said ""it is a concern for us that they are happening at the time of the anniversary of the brutal Russian invasion.""

""The vessel that came to the shores of South Africa basically brought a piece of the war to this peaceful land through having the letters Z and V, which they are using as a marking on their military equipment while bombing Ukrainian cities,"" Abravitova said in an interview with The Associated Press.

RUSSIA URGES UN TO INVESTIGATE NORD STREAM EXPLOSION

Last week, a small yacht flying Ukraine’s flag sailed by the Admiral Gorshkov in Cape Town’s harbor in protest. On Wednesday, a group of protesters gathered outside the Russian Embassy in the South African capital, Pretoria. They criticized the presence of the Russian warship and South Africa's decision to host it.

One protester held up a placard that read: ""DON'T PLAY with bullies.""

South Africa, a key partner of the West in Africa, has come under criticism for holding the naval exercises but has defended itself by saying they were planned two years ago, well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

7,US forces China’s hand in revealing possible lethal aid to Russia amid war in Ukraine: experts,"The Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing this week that it suspects China is considering sending Russia lethal aid as Moscow’s war in Ukraine drags on, experts told Fox News Digital Tuesday.

""China has a difficult decision to make,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""They want Russia to win. On the other hand, they don’t want to lose their economic access to Europe.

""It’s impossible to know where they’ll come down,"" he added.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken first revealed the U.S.'s suspicions following his meeting with Beijing's top diplomat Saturday, after which he expressed concern ""that China’s considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine.""

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.

China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.

In recent weeks Beijing has struggled to keep a balance between maintaining constructive relations with the West while condemning the U.S. of ""hysterics,"" as Beijing did over the shooting down of the surveillance balloon and accusing it of escalating the war by providing defensive aid to Ukraine.

International security experts agree that China is trying to ""strike a balance"" between preserving its economic interests and its desire to see the U.S. fall in the global hierarchy.

""China needs Russia to help it change the rules-based world order,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Michael Ryan said. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] partner in trying to undermine U.S. influence in the world and to show that autocracy and not democracy is the superior form of government.""

Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.

Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Providing arms to Russia would have obvious consequences and change the dynamic on the battlefield, making it harder for Ukraine to win.

Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.

""This would increase the odds of the war in Ukraine becoming even more protracted,"" explained James Anderson, the former acting under secretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration. ""The longer the war in Ukraine drags on, the greater the chances it will spread to other countries in Europe.""

Iran and North Korea have already been providing some weaponry to Moscow, and Tehran’s drone contribution has allowed Russia to hit the one area that Ukraine is unable to effectively beat it — air defense.

But Russia needs munitions, tanks and armored vehicles — which is where China could step in and change the course of the war.

Experts agree that China’s involvement in the war would do more than aid Russia’s war effort, it would morph into a new ""Cold War with China.""

""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPY CRAFT

Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.

""[China] does not want to see Russia fail because it portends…Western support in terms of [the] Taiwan scenario,"" Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under the Trump administration, told Fox News.

""The Chinese have been caught by surprise,"" Klinck said pointing to not only Russia’s operational failures on the battlefield but the steadfast response from the U.S. and its Western allies.

Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.

""What is more important to China: ensuring Russian success?"" he questioned. ""Or is it being part of an international order?""

Ultimately experts agree that China has to consider whether it will more negatively be affected by the strategic implications of a Russian failure and its ally’s standing on the global stage or the economic repercussions that would directly impact Beijing.

""Those domestic implications are always what drive Chinese decision-making,"" Klinck argued.

Anderson also pointed out that the West will need to move quickly to decide how it will respond with economic repercussions should China involve itself in the war effort.

""This would be a real test of Western unity since many European countries have extensive trading relationships with China, and some of our allies and partners may well be reluctant to jeopardize them with sanctions,"" he said. ""Anything less than a massive sanctioning effort would likely fail.""

""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken made that accusation Sunday on CBS, where he said Chinese companies have already been supplying Russia with non-lethal aid and may soon do more.

""The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they’re considering providing lethal support, and we’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,"" Blinken said. When asked what lethal aid China might deliver, Blinken said, ""weapons.""

""It is the U.S. not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said. ""The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger-pointing, or even coercion and pressurizing from the U.S. on our relations with Russia.""

Wang said China supports peace and took another shot at the U.S. by saying it’s the U.S. that is promoting conflict by arming Ukraine.

BLINKEN ISSUES WARNING TO CHINA ABOUT SPY CRAFT IN ‘CONFRONTATIONAL’ MEETING WITH COUNTERPART

Wang said China would soon release a document proposing a peaceful resolution of the conflict, which will stress that a ""nuclear war must never be fought and can never be won.""

Wang also fired back at the U.S. over the diplomatic disruption that was caused when the Biden administration confirmed the existence of a Chinese surveillance balloon hovering over the U.S. That discovery prompted Blinken to postpone a scheduled trip to China.

9,US State Department hints at 'consequences' if China provides lethal aid to Russia for Ukraine war,"U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday warned there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine, but when pressed on just what those consequences might be, he was more ambiguous.

Wednesday’s comments came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

Price clarified that the U.S. has not seen concrete evidence of direct support, but added ""we don’t believe they’ve taken it off the table, either.""

Price said China’s providing of lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine ""would cause real consequences in our bilateral relationship.""

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

""We’ve been clear we will not hesitate to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, and we’re monitoring very vigilantly for potential violations.""

Price predicted that China would suffer ""reputational costs"" if it were to follow through with providing Russia with lethal aid.

""Already, it is providing diplomatic support. It is providing economic support. It is … spewing propaganda that serves to amplify the lies, the distortions, the myths, the half-truths that are emanating from Moscow,"" he said.

Later in the press conference, a reporter questioned what possible leverage the U.S. has as a deterrent if China sides with Russia.

Price said there was ""an advantage to some degree of ambiguity.""

""We have been clear with the PRC about the fact that consequences would befall them if they were to provide lethal assistance, but we think it’s most effective if we leave that ambiguous and we continue to warn consistently of those consequences,"" Price said.

Experts have argued that the Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing its suspicions that China was considering providing Russia with lethal aid.

10,"Biden challenges Putin to 'end the war' in Ukraine, threatens to ramp up sanctions against Russia","President Biden on Tuesday challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the war"" against Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies around the world will continue to support Ukraine and push for new sanctions on the Kremlin.

Biden delivered that warning from Warsaw, Poland, nearly a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a day after making a surprise visit to Ukraine.

""One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv,"" Biden said. ""Well, I just came from Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong. Kyiv stands proud. Kyiv stands tall. And most importantly, Kyiv stands free.""

Biden said that a year after Putin’s invasion, NATO is ""more united and more unified than ever before.""

""Putin is confronted with something today that he didn’t think was possible a year ago — the democracies around the world have grown stronger, not weaker; but the autocrats around the world have grown weaker, not stronger,"" Biden said.

""One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction; he doubts our staying power; he doubts our continued support for Ukraine; he doubts they can remain unified,"" Biden said. ""But there should be no doubt — our support for Ukraine will not waiver. NATO will not be divided and we will not tire.""

Citing remarks Putin made early Tuesday, Biden said the United States and Europe ""do not seek to control or destroy Russia.""

""The West is not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today,"" Biden said. ""This war was never a necessity — it is a tragedy.""

Biden said Putin ""chose this war.""

""Every day the war continues, this is his choice. He could end the war with a word,"" Biden said. ""It’s simple: If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war.""

Biden said that the United States and a ""worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations"" will continue to ensure that Ukraine stands able to defend itself.

Biden also touted the sanctions placed on Russia by his administration and allied nations.

""Together, we made sure Russia is paying the price for its abuses,"" Biden said. ""We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed in any country in history, and we're going to announce more sanctions this week, together with our partners, to hold accountable those who are responsible for this war.""

""They will seek justice for war crimes and crimes against humanity that continue to be committed by the Russians,"" he said.

Biden reflected on the ""extraordinary brutality"" committed by Russian forces in Ukraine ""without shame or compunction.""

""They've targeted civilians with death, destruction, used rape as a weapon of war, stolen Ukrainian children, an attempt to steal Ukraine's future from train stations, maternity hospitals, schools and orphanages,"" Biden said. ""No one — no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It's abhorrent.""

But Biden also said that ""one year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-challenges-putin-end-war-ukraine-threatens-ramp-sanctions-against-russia,N/A
11,Six countries join Russia in opposing UN's resolution for peace in Ukraine,"Six countries sided with Russia during a United Nations General Assembly resolution on Thursday, in which 141 countries voted to end hostilities in Ukraine and for Russia to withdraw its forces.

Belarus, North Korea, Syria, Eritrea, Mali and Nicaragua all joined Russia in opposing the declaration.

While the resolution does not force Russia into leaving Ukraine, it signifies an international censure against Moscow's aggression.

The vote marks a slight increase from the four countries who voted against an October resolution denouncing Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories. Mali and Eritrea abstained from the vote during that time.

The six countries opposing the resolution have developed close military ties with Russia. Amendments proposed by Belarus would have stripped much of the resolution's language but were resoundingly defeated.

Countries who abstained during Thursday's vote included South Africa, China and India.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took the 141-7 vote as a victory, saying it represents global support for Ukraine.

12,Top Republican says 'all options must be on the table' after Russia pulls out of nuclear treaty,"EXCLUSIVE: House Armed Services Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said that President Biden’s administration should ""accelerate planning"" on Russian nuclear deterrence after the communist nation pulled out of the New START nuclear treaty with the U.S.

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained Rogers’ press release following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s retreat from the treaty reducing and limiting the number of nuclear warheads in each country’s arsenal.

Rogers said Putin’s move is ""no surprise"" given his decade-long dismantling of nuclear arms treaties with America and said that the Biden administration should ""accelerate"" their plans in the event Russia ""breaches New START caps"" on nuclear warheads.

RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN NEW START NUCLEAR TREATY WITH US, PUTIN SAYS

""Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend participation in the New START Treaty should come as no surprise; over the last 10 years, he has systematically dismantled nuclear arms treaties with the United States and pursued an arms race,"" Rogers said in the release.

""Whether Russia has already broken the treaty’s warhead limitations is not clear, but hoping Russia returns to the fold is not wise, nor is it a strategy,"" the Alabama Republican said. ""The Biden Administration should declare Russia to be in ‘material breach’ of the New START Treaty and direct the Joint Staff and U.S. Strategic Command to accelerate planning in the event Russia breaches New START caps.""

""All options must be on the table including deploying additional nuclear forces and increasing the readiness of our nuclear triad,"" he continued. ""We must also accelerate efforts to modernize our nuclear systems, and I again call on the President to abandon his plans to weaken our deterrent such as canceling the Nuclear Sea Launched Cruise Missile.""

Rogers’ comments come the same day that Putin pulled Russia out of its 2010 New START nuclear arms treaty with the U.S. The treaty was formed while Biden was serving as vice president.

Putin announced Tuesday that Russia was pulling back from the New START treaty with the United States, which reduces and limits each country's nuclear arsenal.

The New START treaty, first signed in April 2010, limits the U.S. and Russia from having more than 1,550 nuclear warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

Both the U.S. and Russia are capable of deploying far more than the allotted nuclear warheads as Washington and Moscow have a combined total of more than 13,000 warheads – making up roughly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal, according to data provided by the Arms Control Association.

14,Top Chinese diplomat visiting Russia will discuss 'world peace' with Moscow officials,"China's top diplomat is traveling in Russia on a diplomatic mission that will touch on the countries' roles in propagating ""world peace.""

Wang Yi, the director of China's Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, landed in Moscow on Tuesday for the first diplomatic meeting between the two allied countries since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

RUSSIA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN NEW START NUCLEAR TREATY WITH US, PUTIN SAYS

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin commented on the trip Tuesday as Yi was en route to Russia, describing the visit — announced last week — as an opportunity for discussion on the two countries' roles in promoting world peace.

""Last week, we announced that Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi would visit Russia,"" said Wenbin.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV. UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

He continued, ""China would like to take the opportunity of this visit to work with Russia to promote the steady growth of the bilateral relations in the direction identified by our presidents, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play a positive role for world peace. We will release relevant information in a timely manner.""

Yi is set to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during the trip, but whether there will be an audience with President Vladimir Putin is still unknown.

Vice President Kamala Harris announced last week that the United States has officially determined the Russian military is committing crimes against humanity in its invasion of Ukraine.

UKRAINE WARNS OF MASSIVE RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON ANNIVERSARY OF PUTIN’S INVASION: ‘WE HAVE TO BE READY’

""From the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes. Their actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common humanity,"" Harris said during her speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany .

""And let us be clear. Russian forces have pursued a wide spread and systemic attack against a civilian population,"" she continued. ""Gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape and deportation. Executions, killings, beatings and electrocution. Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children.""

Wang Yi is the director of China’s Office of Foreign Affairs, and he just met with Ukraine’s foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend. A spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, told Russia’s Tass news agency that a meeting this week with Putin could be in the cards.

""We do not rule out a meeting between Mr. Wang Yi and the [Russian] president, he will indeed be in Moscow,"" Peskov said.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has information that China may be preparing to offer Russia weapons, a move that would put China squarely opposed to the U.S. policy of helping Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s attack.

That statement infuriated China, which said only the U.S. has been ""pouring weapons into the battlefield."" China didn’t explicitly deny the possibility of sending weapons to Russia but did stress that China is looking for a peaceful settlement.

16,War in Ukraine: Here's how we defeat Russia and deter China,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year ago on Feb. 24, the first major conflict between the world’s autocracies and democracies began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fortunately, a unified West pushed back against Vladimir Putin’s murderous assault, marking an historical moment when we stood on principle.

The war has since been a failure for Moscow in multiple ways. Notably is the Russian military’s incompetence, exposed by the skill, courage and tenacity of much smaller Ukrainian forces that not only denied Putin a quick victory, but also demonstrated the ability of a determined people to beat back a larger foe – an important lesson for China and Taiwan.

The war has stalemated since Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive last fall. It cannot be allowed to harden into another ""frozen conflict."" As such, we should pause on this gruesome anniversary to assess how best to facilitate victory for Kyiv and send the right signals to Moscow (and Beijing).

Western unity has proven the most important factor in hampering Russia’s war effort and enabling Ukraine’s. The U.S. has done a good job keeping the allies together and moving forward. This must be sustained. But what is lacking is a clear sense of how Washington wants this conflict to end and then resourcing that outcome.

UKRAINE WAR ANNIVERSARY: TIME FOR RUSSIAN SANCTIONS WITH REAL TEETH

Regarding the former, we should follow the lead of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said Russia must completely leave his country, including Crimea. That may be difficult for Moscow to accept, but we should not allow Putin’s saber rattling to deter us. A year of his bluster has proven fears of escalation to be overblown.

On the latter, while U.S. support has been strong, the Biden administration has been frustratingly late in providing Kyiv what it needs. Weapons systems like HIMARS, Patriots and now Abrams tanks, arrive long after Ukraine suffers needlessly. We seem to be doing just enough to prevent a Ukrainian loss, but not nearly enough to enable a Ukrainian win.

Zelenskyy has long asked for ATACMS. Now he is seeking modern fighter jets – critical to supporting a counteroffensive – but once again Washington begins with ""No.""

Why not start training Ukrainians on F-16s now, or assembling a volunteer cadre of former pilots and maintainers, pending a final decision that is likely to be approved anyway? Ukraine can’t afford to get pummeled for months awaiting aircraft, much like they are now desperate for tanks as a Russian offensive slowly begins.

Other actions should be taken to tighten the noose on Putin and signal our resolve, such as stiffening sanctions on Russia and those who aid them. Additionally, all our allies – not just a stalwart few – should contribute their fair share to the war effort. It’s time for everyone to step up.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Erdogan has played domestic politics, demanding unreasonable concessions, over NATO accession for Finland and Sweden – two democracies that would clearly enhance the alliance. Biden needs to turn up the heat on his dubious counterpart.

After all, we need a robust and ready NATO to not only empower Ukraine, but to deter Russian misadventures elsewhere, while also dissuading China from acting against Taiwan. An alliance-wide agreement to spend no less than 2% of GDP on defense – something I long advocated – would underscore our resolve.

Time is not on Ukraine’s side. Every passing day is another opportunity for Western support to weaken or fracture. Putin is counting on it. Moreover, before Russia can adapt to global sanctions and rebuild its forces, we must give Kyiv the means to win quickly and decisively. This makes many uneasy, but Ukraine’s future is on the line, and Beijing is taking notes.

Importantly, the U.S. must continue to lead. This means keeping the West unified and less self-deterred; surging the defense industrial base for the global long haul; and providing continued assistance, all properly accounted for, to Kyiv.

Frequent messaging at home, framed in the broader strategic contest at hand, is important to sustain public support and congressional funding. And finally, we should push similar support to Taiwan now, before Beijing acts.

This all comes at some expense, for sure, but deterring war is less costly than fighting one, and winning costs less than losing. But defending freedom against autocracies like Russia and China that only respect strength, will keep us all safer in the long run. History has taught us both lessons time and again; let’s heed them and act.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ukraine-war-anniversary-heres-how-we-defeat-russia-and-deter-china,N/A
17,Russia's Wagner chief accuses defense heads of 'treason' as forces fall amid ammunition shortages,"The head of Russia’s top mercenary group Wagner on Wednesday brought renewed attention to increasing divisions between Russia’s troops and its for-hire soldiers after he accused Moscow’s defense heads of ""treason.""

Yevgeny Prigozhin has increasingly drawn attention to the fissures in Russia’s war strategy in Ukraine and in his most recent public outcry accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov of ordering the ministry not to distribute arms to Wagner forces.

Prigozhin's press office posted a picture of dozens of dead Wagner soldiers to its Telegram channel Wednesday morning, questioning where their ammunition was and claiming that there would have been ""five times fewer"" dead had they been properly armed.

US FORCES CHINA’S HAND IN REVEALING POSSIBLE LETHAL AID TO RUSSIA AMID WAR IN UKRAINE: EXPERTS

Russian and Ukrainian forces have been heavily engaged in a brutal ground fight in eastern Ukraine around the Bakhmut sector in Donetsk and, despite months of throwing men at the problem, Moscow has seen few gains.

In a highly charged video released Tuesday Prigozhin raised his voice and said the defense ministry’s ""direct resistance"" is ""nothing other than an attempt to destroy Wagner.""

""This can be likened to high treason in the very moment when Wagner is fighting for Bakhmut, losing hundreds of its fighters every day,"" he said.

Fox News Digital could not independently verify Prigozhin’s claims though Western defense officials have been signaling for months that Russia is running low on munitions.

Since the beginning of the war Russia has been unable to adequately train or supply its troops on the front lines, and after Russia’s military saw significant losses in the first few months of the war Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was allowed to turn to Russia’s penal system for recruitment.

The penal recruits have since ceased and as of last month reports began to suggest that Russia’s defense ministry was pushing back on Prigozhin’s influence after he claimed his soldiers, not the Russian military, won the town of Soledar, just 10 miles north of Bakhmut.

It is unclear exactly how many Wagner troops have died since the penal recruitment began last summer, as these figures are not generally reported alongside official military deaths.

The U.K. defense ministry estimated earlier this month that more than 800 Russian soldiers are killed every day, and that during one particularly brutal fight in January in southern Donetsk as many as 5,000 Russian troops died in a single battle for the city of Vuhledar.

RUSSIAN WAGNER GROUP GAINS GLOBAL NOTORIETY FROM AFRICA TO UKRAINE, BUT DIVISION BREWS AT HOME

The Russian defense ministry denied Prigozhin’s most recent ""excited declarations"" of weapons withholding and said there had been supply chain holdups for ""assault detachments.""

""Attempts to create a split in the tight-knit machinery of cooperation and support between subdivisions of the Russian forces are counterproductive and only benefit the enemy,"" the ministry added.

The most recent accusation levied by Prigozhin could suggest that Russia has seen significant munition stockpile drops, though one Russia expert warned not to take the Wagner chief ""at face value.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""While Russia is definitely expending high quantities of military hardware in this conflict, I don’t interpret his rants as a sign of shortages of weaponry,"" Russian expert and former Defense Intelligence Agency intel officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. ""[Prigozhin] has his own ambitions for power and reasons for trying to upstage and demonize regular Russian military officials.

""The Russian offensive is not going to be a ‘blitzkrieg,’ it's a calibrated series of waves, which has already begun,"" she added. ""We’ve been hoping for a while that Russia would run out of weapons, trying to bleed them out, but that hasn’t happened yet.""

18,Nikki Haley blasts Biden amid Russia nuclear treaty suspension: ‘we have a weak President’,"EXCLUSIVE: Republican White House contender Nikki Haley blasted President Biden amid Russia’s suspension of the New START nuclear arms treaty.

Haley torched Biden after Russia suspended the treaty that limits the number of nuclear warheads in each country’s arsenal that was formed when Biden was vice president.

""Russia has long violated this agreement, so this is not new,"" Haley said. ""What’s new and dangerous is that we have a weak President our enemies think they can intimidate.""

TOP REPUBLICAN SAYS ‘ALL OPTIONS MUST BE ON THE TABLE’ AFTER RUSSIA PULLS OUT OF NUCLEAR TREATY

""That needs to change,"" Haley continued.

The White House declined to comment on Haley's remarks, citing federal ethics laws.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Tuesday his country would be pulling back from the New START treaty.

""In this regard, I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty,"" Putin said in his annual address to the nation, just one day after President Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine.

In his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast Russia and Ukraine as victims of Western double-dealing. He said Russia, not Ukraine, was the one fighting for its very existence.

The speech reiterated a litany of grievances that the Russian leader has frequently offered as justification for the widely condemned war and ignored international demands to pull back from occupied areas in Ukraine.

The New START treaty, first signed in April 2010, limits the U.S. and Russia from having more than 1,550 nuclear warheads deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile or heavy bombers.

Both the U.S. and Russia are capable of deploying far more than the allotted nuclear warheads as Washington and Moscow have a combined total of more than 13,000 warheads – making up roughly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal, according to data provided by the Arms Control Association.

Mark Milley told lawmakers that Kyiv could fall within 72 hours if a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine takes place, multiple congressional sources tell Fox News.

Milley told lawmakers during closed-door briefings on Feb. 2 and 3 that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in the fall of Kyiv within 72-hours, and could come at a cost of 15,000 Ukrainian troop deaths and 4,000 Russian troop deaths.

Several lawmakers expressed concern that the Biden administration did not respond quickly to provide Ukraine with significant military aid, such as anti-aircraft and rocket launcher systems that would defend against an invasion from Russia.

21,"Romanian president, Moldovan president boost ties amid Russia's war with Ukraine","Romanian President Klaus Iohannis discussed energy, economic and security issues in Bucharest Thursday with his visiting Moldovan counterpart, as the two neighbors seek to boost ties amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Iohannis' office said the talks with Moldovan President Maia Sandu would aim to bring her country closer to the 27-nation European Union, to which Romania belongs.

Afterwards, Sandu said Moldova’s strategic partnership with NATO-member Romania is yielding ""concrete benefits.""

""Moldova is going through unprecedented challenges,"" Sandu said, adding that over the past year, her country has faced ""security challenges aimed at creating chaos and destabilizing our region."" Both countries border on Ukraine.

Sandu’s visit came a week after she claimed Moscow was allegedly plotting to overthrow Moldova’s government, put the nation ""at the disposal of Russia,"" and derail its aspirations to join the EU. Russia strongly denied her claims.

""Some wanted our country to fall. To be able to establish a puppet government in Chisinau, servile to the interests of the Kremlin,"" Sandu insisted Thursday. ""The Republic of Moldova remains ... determined on its way to the EU.""

Over the past year, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

22,Poland’s Duda to push Biden on increasing US presence in country amid Russia threat: diplomat,"Polish President Andrzej Duda is expected this week to press President Biden during his Warsaw visit to increase the number of permanent U.S. troops in nations along Russia’s borders, a top diplomat in the U.S. told Fox News Digital.

Biden’s visit comes after Monday's surprise trip to Ukraine, where he met with President Zelenskyy. All this happening just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine, and Poland is looking for a little acknowledgment for the role it has played in aiding Ukraine.

""I think one of the purposes of President Biden's visit to Poland is actually to…emphasize support, U.S. support to Poland,"" Adrian Kubicki, Poland's Consul General in New York said. ""[It] is also important that President Biden listens to what we have to say in terms of how to enhance our security.""

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV, UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

Poland has been a top provider in defensive and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, alongside the U.S., since the war began.

Warsaw has not only taken in the greatest number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war-torn nation, but it has also led NATO negotiations to push for newer and faster equipment deliveries to Ukraine, including tanks earlier this year.

Nearly a dozen nations have pledged tanks for Kyiv, and Poland is now working with allied nations to review whether warplanes could be next on the defensive aid itinerary.

However, Kubicki pointed out that Poland, as well as all Baltic nations near Russia and Ukraine, are under threat from Russian aggression.

""We would like to see an increased presence, permanent presence, of U.S. troops right at the doorstep of the ongoing war – which is Poland,"" he said. ""U.S. troops should be present permanently in our countries given the situation…and what could potentially happen in the future if Russia is, God forbid, successful in Ukraine.""

RUSSIAN PLOT TO 'DESTROY' EUROPEAN COUNTRY THWARTED BY UKRAINE

Russia has threatened to push its aggression beyond Ukraine’s borders since the war began, setting its sights on Moldova, which is west of Ukraine and where a contingent of Russian sympathizers remain in an area known as Transnistria.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that Kyiv had thwarted a Russian plot to overthrow the Moldovan government – a claim the Moldovan government confirmed – which reignited concerns regarding Moscow’s overall aggression towards Europe.

Kubicki said that Poland believes Russia is incapable of overthrowing Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin originally intended, or of invading another European nation. However, he warned that Moscow is playing the long game.

24,US vows to halt gaslighting after Russia asks UN Security Council for special meeting on ‘biolabs' in Ukraine,"Russia and China are doubling down on claims that the United States is conducting biological weapons research in ""biolabs"" across war-torn Ukraine – assertions that leaders in Washington and Kyiv have called absurd.

Russian diplomat Dmitry Polyanski has requested the United Nations Security Council discuss the alleged research at a meeting Friday, the Kremlin-aligned media outlet RIA Novosti reported earlier.

The report also highlighted allegations from Russia’s Defense Ministry that claim the U.S. spent $200 million on Ukrainian labs for a purported ""bioweapons program."" Russia claims its troops uncovered evidence during Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which he calls a ""special military operation.""

""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Olivia Dalton, a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, told Fox News Digital Thursday. ""Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law.""

Russia also has a track record of accusing Western allies of misconduct it's conducting itself, she said.

""We’re not going to let Russia gaslight the world or use the UN Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation.,"" she added.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Earlier Thursday, when asked what proof China had of the claims during his daily news briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Ljian provided none but demanded the U.S. answer questions about the issue.

""What has the U.S. been doing at Fort Detrick and its 336 biological laboratories abroad?"" he asked. ""Do the activities conform to the stipulations of the [Biological and Toxin Weapons Conventions]?""

Fort Detrick is the home of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Maryland.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Defense Department officials said that there were five biological research laboratories in Kyiv – focused on ""diagnostics, therapeutics, treatments, prevention and vaccines"" – and not on military or biological weapons research.

""There are no DOD bioweapon labs in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world,"" the officials said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the claims of a global network of U.S.-run biological weapons labs ""preposterous"" Wednesday. She also warned the claims could be an attempt to create cover for a Russian chemical or biological attack on Ukraine, noting that disinformation is part of the Kremlin’s weapons kit.

CHINA ACCUSES U.S. OF ‘BIOLOGICAL MILITARY ACTIVITIES’ IN UKRAINE

""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,"" she said. ""It’s a clear pattern, and no one should fall for it.""

Russia’s UN request follows international calls for the country to have its permanent seat on the Security Council removed.

""Moscow is driving decisions in the United Nations through its role as a Permanent Member of the Security Council,"" U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. ""Russia must be exiled from the international community.""

RUSSIA'S CLAIM ON U.S. AND UKRAINE BIOLABS ‘ABSURD’ AND ‘UNTRUE’: US DEFENSE OFFICIAL

When the Soviet Union collapsed 30 years ago, Russia inherited its seat as one of five permanent fixtures on the UN Security Council. The move went uncontested at the time – but it grants the Kremlin veto power over council decisions.

Moscow used that veto last month when the Security Council floated a resolution denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and demanding a withdrawal of Russian troops.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also called on the UN to revoke Russia’s Security Council seat.

""No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,"" he said in a video posted to Telegram Thursday, translated from Ukrainian. ""The whole world knows that.""

Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday that the U.S. was aware of ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine under questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida.

WHITE HOUSE WARNS RUSSIA COULD USE CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS IN UKRAINE

He asked her if Ukraine has chemical or biological weapons.

""Ukraine has biological research facilities,"" Nuland replied, ""which in fact we are quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.""

She also said that if anyone were to deploy a chemical or biological attack in Ukraine, she ""100%"" believed it would be the Russians.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. has led an international effort to secure and dismantle leftover Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction, including in Ukraine. In August 2005, Washington and Kyiv agreed to cooperate to prevent the ""proliferation of technology, pathogens and expertise that could be used in the development of biological weapons.""

In addition to failing to secure many Soviet weapons in the 1990s, Russia also has a history of violating international laws governing biological and chemical weapons, according to the White House.

Psaki said Wednesday the attempted poisoning of Kremlin-critic Alexey Navalny and Russia’s support of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on rebels within his own borders.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby also addressed the claims Wednesday, saying they were ""malarkey"" and ""classic Russian propaganda.""

""We are not developing biological or chemical weapons inside Ukraine,"" he said. ""It's not happening.""

25,US leads the rest of the world with $196 billion given to Ukraine amid war with Russia,"The United States continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in promised or sent aid, as the U.S. ally continues its fight against Russia.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

These figures do not include loans sent to Ukraine or additional contributions that were approved by their respective governments between Dec. 2022 and Feb. 2023.

MATT GAETZ RIPS ‘BIPARTISAN COALITION’ THAT FAVORS WAR IN UKRAINE

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited each of these top contributing countries, except Estonia.

The growing figures come as the Ukraine-Russia war nears its one-year mark. Russia first invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

""How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?"" asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. ""Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which redline we set will we not later cross?""

The proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations.

The ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" has at least 10 co-sponsors and calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution notes the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, providing financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

In January, President Biden approved additional security assistance, including 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine. On top of that, reports suggest another $2 billion could be in the pipeline.

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" Biden said last month.

Gaetz’s resolution claims the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties by providing weapons and potentially prolonging what he called an ""everlasting conflict.""

""America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" said Gaetz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ""We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately.""

The embassy warned that the ability to leave Russia has already become increasingly difficult with limited commercial flights and crowded border check points.

""Those residing or traveling in Russia should depart Russia immediately while limited commercial travel options remain,"" the statement released by the embassy added.

Putin’s decree to mobilize 300,000 soldiers to go fight in his war in Ukraine has reportedly resulted in hundreds of thousands of conscription age men attempting to flee Russia.

Images have surfaced on social media showing packed airports and Finnish border check point officials have said thousands of cars have jammed up highways as Russians, mostly fighting age men, look to flee from Putin's order.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS 'WE WELCOME' RUSSIANS APPLYING FOR US ASYLUM AMID PUTIN CONSCRIPTION

Russian men have reported flooded into Finland, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia as other European nations have blocked their borders to Russian citizens.

The White House said Tuesday it will accept Russian refugees attempting to forgo joining the war in Ukraine.

Over a five-day period after Putin announced the mobilization on Sept. 21, some 261,000 men had already fled Russia, according to Novaya Gazeta Europe on Monday.

The embassy warned all Americans in Russia that the State Department has a limited ability to assist, particularly as tensions between Moscow and Washington continue to escalate to levels not seen since the Cold War, and said ""conditions, including transportation options, may suddenly become even more limited.""

But one Russia expert said the White House could also be signaling to Putin that Russia is ""now not off-limits for kinetic targeting"" as the Kremlin escalates its language on nuclear threats and claims it will view annexed territory as its own.

27,Russian internal strategy document details Kremlin's plans to take control of Belarus within 7 years: report,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's executive office distributed an internal strategy document in fall 2021 that lays out the Kremlin's 10-year plan to take full control of neighboring Belarus, a country north of Ukraine that borders three NATO members, Yahoo News reported on Monday.

Belorusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the office since 1994 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, is a close ally of Putin and vocal supporter of the invasion of Ukraine.

The internal strategy document, obtained by Yahoo News, details Russia's plans to annex Belarus and create a ""Union State of Russia and Belarus"" by 2030.

The Presidential Directorate for Cross-Border Cooperation authored the scheme, which outlines benchmarks the Kremlin must hit by 2022, 2025, and 2030 to ensure that Russia has ""control of the information space"" and that there is a ""common approach to the interpretation of history"" in Belarus, according to Yahoo News. Russia allegedly wants to achieve this through political, economic, and military tactics.

WHO IS BELARUS PRESIDENT ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, 'EUROPE’S LAST DICTATOR'?

The Russian and Belorusian embassies in the U.S. did not return requests for comment on Monday evening.

Russian forces staged on Belorusian territory ahead of Putin's invasion last year, but Lukashenko has so far declined to get directly involved in the conflict.

BELARUSIAN COURT SENTENCES PROMINENT POLISH JOURNALIST TO 8 YEARS IN PRISON FOR 'INCITING DISCORD'

Ahead of Lukashenko's most recent visit to Moscow last week, the Belorusian leader said that troops would be deployed if Ukrainians encroach on their territory.

""I'm ready to fight together with the Russians from the territory of Belarus in one case only: if so much as one soldier from (Ukraine) comes to our territory with a gun to kill my people,"" Lukashenko said last Thursday.

""If they commit an aggression against Belarus, our response will be the most cruel. The most cruel!""

President Biden said Thursday afternoon that he’s reached a full agreement with G7 leaders to limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy, stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military and impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In a public address from the White House, Biden said Putin has much larger ambitions than Ukraine and wants to ""reestablish the Soviet Union.""

Secretary of Defense Gen. Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of approximately 7,000 additional U.S. troops to Germany in a move aimed at bolstering NATO defense and deterring Russian aggression.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee the country. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

After several hours of fierce battle, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday raised concerns of repeated of the 1986 disaster.

A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Thursday that Putin’s goal appears to be seizing the capital of Kyiv, ""decapitating the government"" and ""installing his own method of governance.""

He claimed Putin indicated this himself during his overnight speech.

However, the defense official emphasized that, ""U.S. troops are not going to be fighting the war in Ukraine."" The U.S. military has no aircraft in Ukrainian airspace as of Wednesday morning, he said.

Russia has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles into Ukraine since its initial onslaught overnight. Starting around 9:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, Russian forces began launching missiles from land and sea-based platforms from the Black Sea toward key cities in central and eastern Ukraine, the official said.

The official said Russian forces were fighting all three major axes ""designed to take key population centers."" The heaviest fighting has been occurring near an axis from northeast of Ukraine to the south, starting from Belarus to an advance on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

A second axis extends from north central Ukraine to the south from Belarus toward Kyiv. A third axis in the south is spreading from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to the Ukrainian city of Kherson.

Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, called for Russia to be removed from SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, and for allies to support them through devastating financial sanctions against Russia, through defensive anti-air supplies, and by cutting all diplomatic ties with Russia.

Recognizing Ukraine is not a member of NATO, Markarova said she did not expect U.S. troops to defend Ukraine but expected other support give their ""strategic friendship.""

RUSSIA CRACKS DOWN ON ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, MORE THAN 1,700 DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine before the House of Commons Thursday and moved to freeze assets of Russian banks. He announced the ""largest ever"" set of sanctions against Russia and vowed to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas.

Anti-Russian demonstrations have popped up across Europe and in the U.S. in cities including New York, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, Russian authorities began cracking down on anti-war protests across the country, reportedly arresting more than a thousand demonstrators in several cities.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""

While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene, something Russian President Vladimir Putin warned would show grave consequences. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.

Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country, The Associated Press reported. Several dozen people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.

Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE IN LARGEST EUROPEAN ATTACK SINCE WWII

""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said Thursday, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.

Russia ""has embarked on a path of evil,"" the president said, but Ukraine ""is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks."" Zelenskyy said sanctions would be lifted ""on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""

The attacks came first from the air. Later, Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

In the north, video showed tanks rolling over the border from the Russian ally of Belarus through Senkivka. Russian forces also landed in the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol.

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone.

Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that it had shot down several Russian aircraft, according to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported. Highways outside of Kyiv swelled with traffic Thursday leading to Poland, and lines of people waited for gasoline, to withdraw money or to purchase other supplies, such as food and water.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Ukraine said columns of Russian troops were passing over the border into the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk, Reuters reported. Russian missiles also targeted several Ukrainian cities, and explosions could be heard before dawn in the capital of Kyiv, home to 3 million people.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""

Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

The comments come amid Russia's ongoing war with neighboring Ukraine, which has resulted in international outrage and an effort by many western governments to sanction Russia and cut off its influence around the globe.

But the international influence campaign has seemingly brought Russia and China closer together, with Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week in Xi's first foreign trip since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

RUSSIANS SET UP METHOD TO CONVERT WIRE CURRENCY INTO CHINESE YUAN, SPARKING FEARS OF ALLIANCE

While China has not provided Russia with direct support or relief from sanctions, it has extended its trade partnership with a Russian economy struggling to find international partners. About 81% of Russian car imports during the second quarter came from China, Bloomberg reported, while China's Xiaomi phone brand became the most popular in Russia during the same time period.

China has also been a dependable consumer of Russian fuel, buying up liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a steep discount from Russia. The arrangement has benefited both countries, giving Russia a buyer for its energy resources while China has used the windfall to sell energy sources at a markup to a European economy that has found itself short of resources amid sanctions against Russia.

""We are going to yell as loudly as we can and continue to until he gets home,"" she went on. We aren’t going to let it rest.""

AMERICANS IN RUSSIA

Fogel had worked as a teacher at school in Moscow for nearly ten years when he was stopped at an airport upon his return to Russia. He was in possession at the time of medical marijuana that his doctor recommended he take for ""severe chronic pain"" that was caused by years of spinal injuries and resulting surgeries.

US OFFERS ‘SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSAL’ TO BRING BRITTNEY GRINER, PAUL WHELAN HOME FROM RUSSIA

According to The Washington Post, he had approximately half an ounce of medically-prescribed marijuana when he was detained in August 2021. In June of this year, he was sentenced to 14 years in a Russian prison after he was convicted of ""large-scale drugs smuggling,"" according to reports.

Then, this week, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken revealed that the U.S. had offered to make a deal with Russia in exchange for two Americans, WNBA athlete Brittney Griner – who was also detained at a Russian airport on drug-related charges – and Michigan security executive Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for espionage charges that his family has completely rejected.

But Fogel was not included in the deal.

JACK BARSKY: WHAT A RUSSIAN SPY'S JOB MIGHT LOOK LIKE NOW, FROM ONE OF THE KGB'S 'BEST-TRAINED' DOUBLE AGENTS

An attorney assisting Fogel’s family with his case told Fox News Digital in an email that Fogel ""fully cooperated with the investigation and prosecution; submitted substantial proof of prior medical treatment, of debilitating health conditions, and of his doctor’s recommendation for medical marijuana.""

His representatives shared dozens of references letters and evidence showing his lack of any criminal record.

""However, Marc’s exorbitant 14-year sentence, which is usually reserved to large-scale drug smugglers and murderers even in Russian courts, made it abundantly clear that Marc cannot obtain justice in Russia,"" the attorney wrote.

The family has asked the U.S. State Department to classify Fogel as ""wrongfully detained."" The designation, the attorney said, ""which would commit additional US government resources to securing his release and move to the jurisdiction of the US government’s Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs.""

""A request has been made for Marc’s Humanitarian Release due to his health conditions: given Marc’s age and health condition, a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison colony is, at best, a life sentence and, at worst, a death sentence,"" the attorney continued. ""We strongly believe that Marc should be included in any exchange deal the U.S. and Russia are negotiating.""

FAMILIES OF AMERICANS DETAINED IN RUSSIA AMID CONFLICT REMAIN HOPEFUL, DESPITE FEARS OF RUNNING OUT OF TIME

A State Department spokesperson said they were limited in what they could discuss because of privacy concerns, but said consular officers are working in many ways to help Fogel, whom they did not identify by name. The State Department is insisting that Russia continue to allow access to U.S. citizens detained there, and is urging the Russian government to ensure fair treatment and adequate medical care for detained Americans, the spokesperson said.

‘FROM CRITICAL TO DIRE’

Ellen Keelan, Fogel’s niece, told Fox News Digital neither she nor her family has spoken directly to Fogel in ""almost a year,"" and is instead limited to pre-screened and roughly translated letters that, in the end, don’t ""even sound like him."" And they don’t know what actually gets to him, and in what state their messages to him end up being, she said.

""My understanding is he is okay … I don’t know if that is the right word,"" Keelan said. But ""nobody has been granted a phone call. Nobody has heard from him or seen his face.""

She added: ""It’s just been a black box in communication. Every time we think we are going to get an answer, we are sent down another path.""

In just weeks, he will have been detained in Russia for one year.

""A 14-year sentence being forced to do hard labor – it’s not like we’re going to see him when he is 75. He is simply not going to survive this. We are fighting for his life.""

She said the situation has gone ""from critical to dire.""

""We are pleading with the Biden Administration to classify him as wrongfully detained,"" she added. ""Remember this is a real person – a husband and father and an amazing teacher – and we can’t let this be the end of his story.""

Fogel’s family has started a Change.org petition and is now trying to be as active as possible on social media. Keelan credited Griner’s case with ""raising awareness"" to Fogel’s story.

Principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel was asked this week about Griner’s exact whereabouts after her legal team confirmed that she had been moved out of a detention center just outside of Moscow on Nov. 4 to a remote penal colony to serve out her nine-year prison sentence on drug smuggling charges.

""We are aware of the reports of her location and in frequent contact with Ms. Griner’s legal team, but the Russian Federation has still failed to provide any official notification for such a move of a U.S. citizen, which we strongly protest and disagree with,"" Patel said during a press briefing.

Iran first faced international ire earlier this year when the White House announced that it had knowledge Tehran would be ""gifting"" Russia hundreds of drones as Moscow’s supplies showed signs of dwindling less than six months into its war in Ukraine.

But Tehran has since taken even bolder steps, sending other missile units and agreeing last month to streamline Russia’s ability to develop Iranian drones on its own turf for use in Ukraine.

""In return Russia is highly likely offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their defense relationship.""

35,"Russia-Ukraine war: Knowledge of communist history will help Americans understand invasion, expert says","To understand the Russia-Ukraine war, one must understand the history of communism – and more specifically, Russian communism.

That’s according to Andrew Bremberg, president of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) and former U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.

""Young Americans know very little, and frequently nothing, about Josef Stalin – the brutal leader of the USSR that took over after Lenin and took his crimes under communism and really ratcheted them up,"" Bremberg said. ""I think people know nothing of the Holodomor, which was Stalin's planned famine in Ukraine that killed over 10 million people during the time.""

At the time of the Holodomor, known as the Great Famine, when Westerners were suffering from the Great Depression in the early 1930s, socialism and communism were ""very much in vogue,"" Bremberg explained.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""It is a terrible chapter in human history of the 20th century, and the vast majority of young Americans truly know nothing about [it]. Just knowing that one fact, I believe, can really materially change how a person understands communism,"" he said. ""And, frankly, I think it has an effect on how people understand the attacks and crisis today"" in Ukraine.

VOC’s mission is to commemorate ""the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world"" and pursue ""the freedom of those still living under totalitarian regimes.""

The foundation published a report last year that found an increasing number of young Americans are unaware that some 100 million people have been killed by communist parties in power over the last century, and many are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany.

UKRAINE CRISIS: COMMUNISM VICTIMS ORGANIZATION CALLS RUSSIA'S INVASION ‘ILLEGAL’ AND ‘A WAKE-UP CALL’

While Russia is a socialist country today, Bremberg argued that it is being led by a ""dictator"" and former KGB leader, President Vladimir Putin, who is ""trying to legitimize and rehabilitate the image of Josef Stalin – specifically him as a person – and of the Soviet empire.""

""Putin knows the history of communism in 20th century, and if we do not, we are at a significant disadvantage in not understanding what is going on, why it is happening, and … the important historical context for what is happening,"" the former U.N. ambassador said.

BLINKEN SAYS PUTIN'S RHETORIC ON NUCLEAR THREAT IS ‘HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY’

Bremberg traveled to Europe before Putin invaded Ukraine to meet with heads of state in Romania, Poland and Hungary to discuss the countries’ respective histories battling communism in an effort to ""build a relationship"" with those countries and better tell their stories here in the U.S.

VOC is building a museum dedicated to victims of communism from more than 40 nations since 1917 in Washington, D.C., and it is set to open in May.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, however, the tone of Bremberg's conversations with foreign leaders has shifted. Officials have been reflecting on their own country’s battles against Russia and communism as Ukraine comes under Putin’s fire.

A century ago, the Red Army invaded Poland with the intent of taking over Central Europe, and Polish citizens stepped up during the invasion to help defend the country’s capital of Warsaw, which is reminiscent of Ukrainians defending Kyiv today.

After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the Hungarian people helped defend Budapest when Russia invaded to stop the regime change.

""We can look at and see lots of parallels to what we're seeing in Ukraine today"" when looking at Central Europe’s previous battles against the Soviets, Bremberg said.

RUSSIA HOLDS DRILLS WITH NUCLEAR SUBS, LAND-BASED MISSILES

Much of the dialogue in Europe surrounding the Ukraine crisis paints Ukraine and its citizens in a positive light, and the same is happening in the United States.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted on staying in Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv as Russian missiles strike the city and a military convoy edges slowly toward the center of the capital, despite an offer from the U.S. to help him evacuate.

In Russia, citizens have risked arrest to protest Putin’s war against Ukraine – something that would not have happened during the Cold War, according to Bremberg.

He said he fears ""Putin is so isolated and separate"" from the Russian people ""that regardless of how they may protest,"" the impact of sanctions – with ""Russia being basically cut off from much of the rest of the world"" – will be more significant on them than Putin and Russian oligarchs unless further sanctions, such as travel options, are directed toward the higher-ups personally.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-crisis-knowledge-communist-history-americans-understand-russia-invasion-expert,N/A
36,Top 5 reasons America must support Ukraine and help it defeat Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Congress is considering an end-of-year spending bill containing billions in new military aid to Ukraine. Is additional support to Ukraine in the interests of the U.S.?

First, consider Russia’s actions. Russia has long been a geo-strategic foe of the United States, and its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine is only the latest in a series of actions hostile to American security and international peace. Russia invaded its neighbors in 2008 and 2014, threatened the stability of NATO Allies, interfered in U.S. politics, destabilized the Middle East through interventions in Syria and Libya, cheated on arms control agreements, used chemical weapons against dissidents and defectors, and sponsored cyber-attacks against the U.S. and other NATO allies.

Second, consider Russia’s so-called ""friends."" Through his alliances with China, Syria and Iran, Russian President Vladimir Putin has defined Russia as an adversary to the U.S. An unchecked Putin will continue to escalate tensions and further harm the national and economic security of the U.S. and its allies -including by threatening to use nuclear weapons.

US CONSIDERS SENDING PATRIOT MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM TO UKRAINE

But after almost 10 months of hard ground fighting and with financial and materiel support from the U.S. and Europe, Ukraine is winning its fight against Putin. Ukraine’s bravery and America’s public support have thereby strengthened U.S. national and economic security in at least five ways:

1. Ukraine keeps the war from spreading

World wars start in Europe and the Russian Army rolling westward is a clear and present danger to the U.S. and its NATO allies. The restoration of peace depends on Ukraine pushing the Russians back into their territory. Because our support would allow Ukraine to finish the job, we would prevent a larger European conflict that would drag the U.S. into a world war.

2. Ukraine is degrading a hostile Russia

The Ukrainians are bleeding Russia of manpower and materiel. Take some rough math. In FY22, $730 billion was appropriated for Defense. The U.S. has spent $19.3 billion since the invasion on weapons for the Ukrainians. That is the equivalent to approximately 2.6% of what we are spending annually on defense. 2.6% is a reasonable investment considering that the Ukrainians are significantly degrading the capability of what the U.S. National Defense Strategy calls an ""acute"" threat. A Russia with diminished war-making capability gives our European allies time to build their forces to meet their NATO obligations, a longstanding U.S. goal. It also allows the US to shift its resources to the Pacific to protect our economic interests and to deter China from invading Taiwan.

3. Ukrainian success helps restore economic vitality

The Russian-Ukrainian War has hurt the European and U.S. economies. It has caused spikes in oil prices. By withholding natural gas transfers to Europe, Putin has weaponized energy to pressure Europe to push Ukraine into early peace talks. Europe is a large economic power; the deeper the European economy goes into recession, the more negatively it will affect the U.S. economy. A Russian win could mean higher energy and food prices for Europe and the U.S. The best way to strengthen the global economy would be to hasten a Ukrainian victory.

4. A victorious Ukraine helps the U.S. competition with China

A Chinese takeover of Taiwan would be an economic calamity for the U.S. and an unrecoverable blow to U.S. power and influence. Taiwan would give China greater market power and proximity to the sea’s busiest lanes of international commerce, enhanced clout to dominate Asia. But China is watching everything that happens in Ukraine.

If Ukraine stalls for lack of military assistance and is forced into early negotiations, China may conclude the west did not have the stomach to hang in long enough for Ukraine to defeat Russia. However, if the U.S. and its allies show resolve and Ukraine is successful in pushing back the Russians, China will think twice before invading Taiwan.

Transferring weapons to the Ukrainians need not be at the expense of building up U.S. forces in Asia to deter China. First, Congress should fund the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and other budget requests for the Asian theater. Second, Congress should force the Pentagon to be very clear about tradeoffs between Europe and Asia. This would enable the Congress to better allocate funding for scare weapons systems and munitions. Congress should also undertake urgent measures to grow an enhanced industrial base that can contend with a dangerous Russia and a growing China. Also, Congress should consider that Ukrainian success would deal a defeat to China.

According to the U.S. intelligence community, China and Russia are ""more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s."" A loss for Russia is a loss for China. We need allies in Asia to stand with us against China. If we abandon Ukraine, our would-be Asian allies will conclude we cannot be trusted.

5. A Ukrainian Victory Promotes American Values

Russia’s predatory behavior is a threat to the U.S. because Russia seeks, with its ally China, to destroy the U.S.-led post World War II international system built on freedom, economic openness, and democracy.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

A successful Ukrainian campaign would be a triumph of our values over those of countries that brutalize their populations, repress human rights, and threaten peace and security by fantasizing about lost glory. A Ukrainian victory promotes western values of freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity and international recognized borders, the fundamentals of peace and security.

Ukrainian battlefield success has advanced U.S. vital interests. The Ukrainians have the Russians on the run and need more time and arms to finish the job. Congress should stand firm against Putin by approving additional military aid.

American taxpayers have been generous with Ukraine, and as we ask more of them, Republicans should conduct vigorous oversight to ensure the money is spent responsibly. Republicans have rightly been deeply skeptical of President Joe Biden’s conduct of foreign affairs since the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and need to be assured that the Biden administration has a plan beyond weapons transfers.

Congress should press the secretaries of State and Defense for their strategy — and insist that they come to Capitol Hill often to defend it. Republicans should pursue a detailed accounting of the administration’s spending but additional support will allow Ukraine to maintain its momentum and show that the democratic West has toughness and resolve in the face of geopolitical foes.

38,Tucker Carlson: America would gain nothing from starting war with Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Here’s something all of us need to internalize. Just because something seems far-fetched, or it seems crazy, or it seems totally destructive to core American interests doesn’t mean the U.S. government won’t do it. That’s the main lesson at the moment we’re living in.

So with that in mind, do not discount, no matter how far-fetched it may seem, a hot war with Russia. Yes, that is a lunatic idea. There is nothing we could possibly gain from a military confrontation with Vladimir Putin and there’s very much we could lose including of course many thousands of American lives. But that doesn’t mean Joe Biden won’t do it.

Biden is unpopular, he’s incompetent and he’s desperate. More than anything Joe Biden is weak. He’s a pawn of his staff in the hard-eyed ideologues who surround him. Russia is currently involved in a border dispute with neighboring Ukraine. Many of Biden’s closest aides are pushing the United States to get involved militarily. Among the many, many ironies here is the Ukraine crisis was largely created by Joe Biden’s own aides and many people like them throughout all levels of the U.S. government.

US GOING TO WAR WITH RUSSIA OVER UKRAINE WOULD ‘COURT DESTRUCTION OF THE KNOWN WORLD’: MACGREGOR

So here’s the Russian position. For Russia, the core question is NATO. NATO is the post-war military alliance created in 1949 to keep the Soviets from invading Western Europe. And it worked pretty well for about 40 years. The Soviet Union has not existed in more than three decades; it’s part of history now. And yet NATO very much lives on, better funded than ever. It’s an army without a purpose. So at this point, NATO exists primarily to torment Vladimir Putin who, whatever his many faults, has no intention of invading Western Europe. Vladimir Putin does not want Belgium. He just wants to keep his western borders secure.

That’s why he doesn’t want Ukraine to join NATO. And that makes sense. Imagine how we would feel if Mexico and Canada became satellites of China. We wouldn’t like that at all. In Russia’s case, this is an existential question. A NATO takeover of Ukraine would compromise Russia’s access to its Sevastopol Naval Base – that’s the site of the Russia Black Sea’s fleet and one of the country’s only connections to international waters. In the words of Russia scholar Richard Sakwa, if Russia lost the Sevastopol Naval Base, it would be ""the biggest military geopolitical defeat of Russia in the last thousand years.""

So for Vladimir Putin that’s unacceptable. It’s a disaster. He cannot let it happen, he will not let it happen. But for the United States, and this is the main point here, there would be no benefit either. The United States would gain precisely nothing from taking over Ukraine. Why would we want to do that? At best, we would be driving Russia, and we are in fact, deeper into the arms of the government of China. Now it would be a disaster for the United States and a disaster for the world.

So why are we doing this? Why is the U.S. government pushing Ukraine to join NATO? Well, God knows why. But we are doing this, both parties are doing this. The neocons around Joe Biden are for it, of course, as they are for every sinister and stupid idea. But so is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a smart man. So is Ohio Sen. Rob Portman. So are many Republicans. So this is a bipartisan sort of insanity. The question is can Joe Biden stand up to it? The answer is, come on, Biden has always been more lobbyist than leader. He says what he’s told to say. Once it was the credit card companies in Delaware that wrote his scripts. Now it’s the neocons at the state department. It’s the same idea.

THANKS TO BIDEN, PUTIN HOLDS ALL THE CARDS AND ALL THE LEVERAGE: dANA PERINO

Biden spoke today with Vladimir Putin by video call. According to the White House, he informed the Russian leader that the United States plans to control Ukraine no matter what. Secretary of State and struggling pop musician Tony Blinken repeated that message. He threatened to send American troops there. Here’s Tony Blinken’s spokesman.

Ned Price: If Russia chooses to fail to deescalate, if Russia chooses to move forward with any plans it may have developed to continue its military aggression or to aggress militarily upon Ukraine, to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty, its independence, its territorial integrity, we and our allies would be prepared to act. We would be prepared to act resolutely.

Ukraine’s territorial integrity. That's the concern. That’s what this is really about, they’re telling us. Because if there’s one thing that the Biden White House cares about its secure borders. At least in Eastern Europe where borders are not racist. Ukraine’s borders must be defended. It would be immoral to open those borders to the world and allow, say, tens of thousands of unemployed Haitians to pour across. We can’t allow that. In fact, we will send American troops to Ukraine to prevent that. Open borders are only permitted in Texas, Arizona and California and anywhere else the potential Democratic voters might arrive uninvited from the Third World.

But Ukraine? No. Ukraine is a God-given right to territorial integrity and American soldiers will die to defend that territorial integrity. That’s our official position as a country.

Now according to CNN, we must stop these Russian attacks on the sacred borders of Ukraine because if we don’t stop them what we could have here is what CNN is calling a dire security situation. Now that phrase apparently comes from Joe Biden’s undersecretary of state, Toria Nuland who, according to CNN, gave a gloomy briefing to U.S. senators last night. Now, Toria Nuland is strongly in favor of war with Russia. What is amazing is that anyone anywhere is still listening to her. No serious person could take Victoria Nuland seriously. She’s a joke. Not only is she obviously unimpressive as a person, ask anyone who knows her, and she’s not especially pro-American, by the way, she’s one of the architects of the disaster in Iraq. So why is Toria Nuland still talking about foreign policy? Is the guy who designed Chernobyl still building nuclear reactors? Probably not.

Only in Washington where failure assiduously rewarded could someone like Victoria Nuland wield power, which she absolutely does. It’s scary when you think about it. Victoria Nuland is driving our Ukraine policy, which of course is being justified by our broader support for ""democracy."" Now keep that in mind as you listen to this. This is the same – the same -- Toria Nuland who was caught on tape several years ago scheming about how to end democracy in Ukraine. Here’s Nuland in a leaked audio recording plotting the overthrow of Ukraine’s democratically elected president. Listen as Nuland rattles off a list of potential puppets to install in place of the democratically elected president.

Victoria Nuland: I think Yats is the guy. He’s got the economic experience, the governing experience. What he needs is Klitsch and Tyahnybok on the outside. He needs to be talking to them four times a week, you know. I just think Klitsch going in, he’s going to be, at that level, working for Yatseniuk. It’s not going to work.

Geoffery Pyatt: Yeah. I think that’s right. Okay.

RUSSIA VOWS TO CONTINUE CONSULTATIONS ABOUT UKRAINE FOLLOWING PUTIN-BIDEN CALL

It’s just not going to work. What about the voters of Ukraine who thought they were engaged in democracy? No. There’s Toria Nuland looking to overthrow democracy. Keep in mind, if they do it there, they’ll do it here.

You’re hearing this same State Department goon who worked to organize a coup in Ukraine telling us we need to go to war with Russia to preserve democracy in Ukraine. These people have no shame. So the question is what is this really about? Of course, it’s not about democracy for which they have zero respect. Well, in part, it’s a hangover from the lunatic Russia hoax that absorbed Washington for three years. Everything about Vladimir Putin is bad, therefore let’s have a war with him. A lot of people think that.

But there’s also a deeper cause here that’s rarely noted. For years, Ukrainian interests have pumped millions of lobbying dollars into Washington D.C. to change American foreign policy in the region. At one point, as you may have heard, they employed the president’s own son to repeat their talking points. So tens of thousands of dollars a month to tell us that Russia is bad and we need to stand with Ukraine because democracy, even as we work to overthrow democracy in Ukraine.

So with that in mind, now that you know that, maybe you’re not so surprised when Joe Biden concluded that Vladimir Putin doesn’t possess a soul.

George Stephanopoulos: He said you know he doesn’t have a soul.

President Biden: I did say that to him, yes. His response was we understand one another. I wasn’t being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. That’s how it came about. It was when President Bush said he looked in his eyes and saw a soul. I said I looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul. Vladimir said we understand each other.

Stephanopoulos: So you think Vladimir Putin is a killer?

Biden: I do.

MCENANY ON HIGH-STAKES BIDEN-PUTIN CALL ON UKRAINE: ‘WE ALL SEE BIDEN’S CAPABILITIES'

These people are children. Again, children pretending to be leaders. Vladimir Putin is a killer. Presumably unlike every other head of state on earth through all human history. But honestly, that is not the relevant question. Vladimir Putin’s soul? Who cares. We can leave that to his priest assuming he has one. The only question that matters, the only question, is how does intervening in Ukraine help the core interests of the United States? And, of course, that is the one question no one in Washington is asking.

Watch the Pentagon’s obedient little flak, the man with so little dignity he will say whatever he’s told to say, brag about how much military equipment we’re now sending to Ukraine. And notice while you watch this tape that he never even thinks about explaining why we would be sending that military equipment.

John Kirby: We have provided millions of dollars worth of lethal and nonlethal assistance to Ukraine in just the last ten months, 11 months. // Nothing has changed about our commitment to making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.

LIBERAL MAINSTREAM MEDIA'S ‘SMOKE AND MIRRORS’ NOT ENOUGH TO COVER FOR BIDEN ADMIN: HANNITY

So say what you will about Donald Trump and his Twitter account, maybe you liked him, maybe you were appalled by his personal style. But in retrospect, if there’s one thing that Donald Trump deserves eternal credit for is keeping idiots like that in their box for four years. There were no pointless wars under Donald Trump. That is not a small thing in recent American history. In fact, it’s rarely happened over the past century. But through unwavering determination for which he’s not gotten credit -- and if there’s one thing he deserves credit for, it’s this -- Donald Trump pulled that off. He resisted again and again when members of Congress, guys from Raytheon, when all the interested parties pushed him to go to war here, there and everywhere, Donald Trump resisted that. And in Washington, above all, they hated him for that. In the end, they impeached him for it.

Adam Schiff: As one witness put it in our impeachment inquiry, the United States aids Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia over there and we don’t have to fight Russia here.

Really? We’re going to fight Russia here are we, Adam Schiff? Adam Schiff, of course, a dumb person and a partisan Democrat. But what is so interesting and ought to make you sit up and pay attention, is suddenly partisan Republicans are making identical noises. Just this afternoon, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, not a genius famously but still a sitting Republican senator, went on Fox News to say we may need to send American troops to Ukraine and possibly – not that this is insane or anything – think about the use of nuclear weapons. Got that in our back pocket – nuclear weapons. Roger Wicker, sitting U.S. Senator.

No one in Washington laughed at Roger Wicker. This is so crazy that no one seems aware of how crazy it is. They’re all just sitting back and listening to Toria Newland tell them what we need to do. How much has this penetrated the psyche of Washington D.C.? Well, here’s a sad piece of tape. This is Joni Ernst, who’s a totally affable, nice Republican, sort of reasonable on most things from the Midwest, suddenly sounding like a blood-thirsty warmonger; sounding a lot like actually Adam Schiff when she talks about that dastardly Vladimir Putin.

Joni Ernst: He needs to say to Vladimir Putin that we are no longer going to allow you to continue with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. We need you to know and understand that we will defend Ukraine, we will provide them assistance. He needs to make that very clear.

Putin is so bad we’re going to cut off natural gas to Western Europe in retaliation against him in December. We’re going to freeze Germany and Luxembourg and that’s going to teach Vladimir Putin. Again, what you just saw there is a child who has no idea what she’s talking about but keeps talking anyway. We will defend Ukraine, says Joni Ernst. Remember, this is a senator from Iowa.

So what happens if we don’t defend Ukraine, Joni Ernst? Will kids in Des Moines grow up to speak Russian? No one asked her that question. She’s never thought about it for a moment. But all this reading from the same talking points -- Adam Schiff to Roger Wicker to Joni Ernst. It turns out that foreign lobbying campaigns work pretty well. And that’s why the Ukrainians paid for one in Washington.

39,"Russia launches missiles on Ukrainian towns on Christmas, claims Ukraine military","Russian forces continued to wage war on Ukraine over the holiday weekend, with more than 40 missiles being launched into Ukrainian towns on Christmas day, according to Ukraine's military.

According to Russian news agencies, which cited the country's defense ministry, three Russian military personnel were killed Monday by falling wreckage of a Ukrainian drone that was shot down as it was on its way to attack a base in Russia's Saratov region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated Sunday that he was open to negotiations and accused Ukraine and its Western allies of not engaging in talks. The U.S. has previously dismissed this stance from Russia as posturing given the ongoing attack on Ukraine.

""We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them - we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,"" Putin said in an interview on Rossiya 1 state television.

PUTIN CLAIMS RUSSIA IS READY TO NEGOTIATE; UKRAINE ACCUSES KREMLIN OF TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, responded on Twitter by saying Putin needed to acknowledge it was Russia that has not been open to talks.

""Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,"" the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. ""Russia doesn't want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.""

Moscow launched its invasion into its eastern European neighbor on February 24, and attacks on Ukraine's power stations have left millions without electricity. Zelenskyy said Russia would attempt to make the final days of 2022 dark and difficult.

""Russia has lost everything it could this year. ... I know darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario,"" he said in a Christmas Day address.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES CLUSTER OF 13 IRANIAN-MADE DRONES AT KYIV IN SUSPECTED ENERGY ATTACK

Ukraine and Russia traditionally celebrate Christmas on January 7, but some Orthodox Ukrainians decided to celebrate on December 25 this year. Zelenskyy, Ukraine's prime minister and other officials in the country issued Christmas wishes on Sunday.

Ukraine's military said early on Monday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of towns in the prior 24 hours on the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzia regions.

""In the Kherson direction, the enemy continues artillery shelling of populated areas along the right bank of the Dnipro River,"" the military said.

The Ukrainian military also said its forces launched attacks on nearly 20 Russian targets.

Russia's defense ministry said Sunday that its forces had killed about 60 Ukrainian servicemen the previous day along the Kupiansk-Lyman line of contact, and that it had destroyed numerous pieces of Ukrainian military equipment.

The Kremlin vowed to fight until all its territorial goals are reached, but Ukraine says it will keep fighting until every Russian soldier is forced from the country.

40,North Korea soldiers in Ukraine would be logistical 'mess’ Putin won’t 'allow': Russia expert,"Climbing Russian casualties and reports suggesting that Russia is now looking to North Korea to aid its flagging troops raised eyebrows this week as some began to question whether Moscow would drag Pyongyang into its war in Ukraine.

Russia expert and former intelligence officer in Russian doctrine and strategy for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Rebekah Koffler, threw cold water on these claims and said they were ""implausible.""

""The Russian propaganda machine could say that 100,000 North Korean volunteers would fight on behalf of Russia, just to scare the West, but in reality, it’s disinformation,"" she said in answer to questions from Fox News Digital.

RUSSIA CREATES NEW VOLUNTEER GROUND FORCE AS TROOP NUMBERS FLAG, UK INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS EFFECTIVENESS

Reports claiming that North Korea may send up to 100,000 soldiers to aid Russia’s campaign in Ukraine began to circulate on Western and Russian news sites this week after the pro-Kremlin Regnum News Agency released an article earlier this month suggesting as much.

The article dated Aug. 2 said that ""North Korea, through diplomatic channels, made it clear that it is ready to help the LPR [Luhansk People’s Republic] and DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] in strengthening defense[s]"" and ""is ready to transfer up to 100,000 of its soldiers.""

""Pyongyang will be able to transfer its tactical units to the Donbas,"" the article continued.

The report never detailed whether the news outlet obtained the ""diplomatic channels"" referenced in the report but instead pointed to comments made by a Russian member of parliament who championed Pyongyang’s alleged willingness to help.

North Korea in March backed Russia when it joined it and three other nations in voting against a United Nations General Assembly resolution that condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

But Koffler said Pyongyang’s support for Russian President Vladimir Putin does not mean the Kremlin chief would actually allow North Korea to send ground forces into Ukraine.

""Putin will never accept — it’s implausible,"" she said. ""Just think about the sheer scale of it.""

Apart from the fact that Russia and North Korea have not held joint combat training and Pyongyang hasn’t even seen active combat in decades, the logistics of such an alliance would prove tricky.

""The command-and-control aspect of it is impossible. They do not speak Russian,"" Koffler said in reference to the average North Korean soldier. ""How are they going to use Russian weapons systems?""

RUSSIA LAUNCHES IRANIAN SATELLITE INTO SPACE AMID FEARS IT WILL BE USED TO SURVEIL UKRAINE

""It would make more of a mess than it would help,"" she added.

As Russian causalities in Ukraine continue to climb and Moscow continues to increase joint military drills with neighboring Belarus, some have become concerned Putin may add to his fighting force with the help of Minsk.

But Koffler said North Korea does not pose the same threat to the war in Ukraine that Belarus does.

""Remember, Belarussians, Chechens, Buryats, anyone from the former Soviet Union speaks Russian,"" she said. ""They are more integrated. Not only do they have the same, what we call tactics, techniques and procedures, but doctrinally they are on the same page [in their] war-fighting doctrine.""

Koffler said it is more likely that North Koreans could be used to assist Russia with its rebuilding efforts in eastern Ukraine if Moscow is successful in holding off Kyiv from retaking occupied territory.

The Russia expert also suggested Moscow could be looking to Pyongyang to assist its forces with more advanced weaponry like the KN-25 — which outranges the U.S. HIMARS — in the wake of Western arms supplies to Ukraine.

41,Retired FBI counterintel agent reportedly involved in Trump-Russia probe arrested for ties to Russian oligarch,"A former senior FBI counterintelligence official who reportedly was involved in the Trump-Russia probe was arrested and charged over his own alleged ties to a sanctioned Russian oligarch amid the war in Ukraine.

Charles McGonigal, the former special agent in charge of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division in New York who retired in 2018, is charged with violating U.S. sanctions by agreeing to provide services to Oleg Deripaska, a sanctioned Russian oligarch. He was charged alongside Sergey Shestakov, a former Soviet and Russian diplomat who later became a U.S. citizen and a Russian interpreter for courts and government offices, through a five-count indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court Monday.

McGonigal and Shestakov both were arrested Saturday. The indictment is a rare move by federal prosecutors to bring charges against a former senior FBI official before a federal grand jury.

Though not referenced in or related to the indictment, McGonigal, while serving as chief of the cybercrimes section at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., was one of the first bureau officials to learn of allegations that George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser for former President Donald Trump, boasted that he knew Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton, launching the investigation into alleged Russian election interference known as Operation Crossfire Hurricane, Business Insider previously reported. Fox News is told that as a senior counterintelligence official at the time, he likely was briefed on Crossfire Hurricane at the time the investigation was launched.

GEORGE SANTOS HAS BUSINESS TIES TO RUSSIAN OLIGRACH'S COUSIN, STORMY DANIELS HUSH-MONEY DEAL FIXER: REPORT

McGonigal, 54, of New York City, and Shestakov, 69, of Morris, Connecticut, ""both previously worked with Deripaska to attempt to have his sanctions removed, and, as public servants, they should have known better,"" U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. ""This Office will continue to prosecute those who violate U.S. sanctions enacted in response to Russian belligerence in Ukraine in order to line their own pockets.""

Both men are charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (""IEEPA""), one count of violating the IEEPA, one count of conspiring to commit money laundering, and one count of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Shestakov is also charged with one count of making false statements, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, prosecutors said.

""The FBI is committed to the enforcement of economic sanctions designed to protect the United States and our allies, especially against hostile activities of a foreign government and its actors,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael J. Driscoll said. ""Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska perform global malign influence on behalf of the Kremlin and are associated with acts of bribery, extortion, and violence.""

""After sanctions are imposed, they must be enforced equally against all U.S. citizens in order to be successful,"" Driscoll added. ""There are no exceptions for anyone, including a former FBI official like Mr. McGonigal. Supporting a designated threat to the United States and our allies is a crime the FBI will continue to pursue aggressively.""

It was then-President Barack Obama who in 2014 issued Executive Order 13660, which declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea.

On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") designated Deripaska as a Specially Designated National (""SDN""), sanctioning him for acting on behalf of a senior official of the Russian Federation’s government and for operating in the Russian energy sector.

In 2021, the two defendants agreed to and did investigate a rival Russian oligarch of Deripaska in return for concealed payments from Deripaska, in violation of sanctions the United States imposed in 2018, the indictment says. McGonigal and Shestakov allegedly knew their actions violated U.S. sanctions because, among other reasons, while serving as special agent in charge, McGonigal received then-classified information that Deripaska would be added to a list of oligarchs considered for sanctions.

As part of their negotiations with Deripaska’s agent, McGonigal, Shestakov and the agent attempted to conceal Deripaska’s involvement by, among other means, not directly naming Deripaska in electronic communications, using shell companies as counterparties in the contract that outlined the services to be performed, using a forged signature on that contract, and using the same shell companies to send and receive payments from Deripaska, according to the indictment.

In 2019, McGonigal and Shestakov also allegedly worked on behalf of Deripaska in an unsuccessful effort to have the sanctions against Deripaska lifted. In November 2021, when FBI agents questioned Shestakov about the nature of his and McGonigal’s relationship with Deripaska’s agent, the interpreter made false statements in a recorded interview, federal prosecutors said.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told Fox News Digital in a statement: ""The way we maintain the trust and confidence of the American people is through our work—showing, when all the facts come out, that we stuck to the process and we treated everyone equally, even when it is one of our own. The FBI will go to great lengths to investigate and hold accountable anyone who violates the law, including when the individual is an FBI employee. We hold ourselves to the highest standard, and our focus will remain on our mission and on doing the right thing, in the right way, every time.""

42,US Department of State nixes Russia's claims that Brittney Griner negotiations are moving forward,"Despite Russia saying there was new ""activity"" in negotiations to return Brittney Griner to the United States, the U.S. Department of State says Russia still is not seriously negotiating.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Viktor Bout, a convicted arms dealer serving 25 years in a U.S. prison, is ""undoubtedly … among those being discussed, and obviously we are hoping for a positive result.""

However, the U.S. said Russia has ""consistently failed to negotiate in good faith.""

""We are not going to comment on the specifics of any proposals other than to say that we have made a substantial offer that the Russian Federation has consistently failed to negotiate in good faith,"" a U.S. statement said.

""The U.S. government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with the Russian government. The Russian government's failure to seriously negotiate on these issues in the established channel, or any other channel for that matter, runs counter to its public statements.""

ESPN notes that Griner's family is confident the Biden administration is working to bring the WNBA star home, but they also are trying to stay level-headed on what is clearly a complicated process.

The U.S. comments come after Griner was reportedly transferred to a Russian penal colony, roughly 300 miles southeast of Moscow, where she is expected to serve out a nine-year prison sentence for drug smuggling. Her appeal was denied last month.

Griner was arrested at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow Feb. 17 after Russian officials said she was carrying vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage.

43,Russia and China grow closer following Pelosi’s Taiwan visit,"It was predictable that Russia’s Foreign Minister would rip House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, calling it an ""annoyance"" and accusing America of the very thing the West blames Russian President Vladimir Putin of constantly flaunting: Impunity. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s point was that despite warnings from China that it did not want her in its backyard, Pelosi did what she wanted to and got away with it.

China, of course, cannot dictate the travel of American lawmakers, but it can be provoked. ""Those who play with fire will not come to a good end,"" threatened China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

The visit so roiled Beijing that it has apparently led to practically shore-lapping military exercises that will encircle the island nation this week. Given Ukraine is often seen as a litmus test for China regarding its designs on Taiwan, how does this play into the bigger geopolitical picture and specifically the escalating tensions between the United States and a Russia essentially being backed by China?

The answer is—it does not, according to Dmitri Trenin, who served in the Soviet and Russian armies and reached the rank of colonel before going on to become a military and political analyst. Russia and the U.S., he says, are waging an indirect war in Ukraine. Trenin told Fox News, ""But, it (the Pelosi visit) may make the Chinese drop their lingering illusions concerning doing business with the United States. That would be good for Russia.""

CHINA COULD INVADE TAIWAN BEFORE THE 2024 US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: SOURCES

Trenin, who now holds positions at both Russia’s Institute of World Economy and International Relations and the Higher School of Economics in Russia, said that at the same time ""the Chinese interest in keeping their access to Western markets makes them very careful not to run afoul of the U.S. on the Russia sanctions issue.""

Trenin says the Russians have gotten used to that. ""They know that China is always after its own interests, and they look for areas/instances when these coincide with their own.""

Pelosi is the highest-ranking United States official to visit Taiwan in a quarter of a century. ""America made a promise to always stand with Taiwan,"" she said. ""Today our delegation came to Taiwan to make it unequivocally clear we will not abandon our commitment to Taiwan.""

Trenin says he believes ""many if not most"" in the rest of the world actually saw the visit as ""a reckless provocation in support of pure personal/party ambitions of the Speaker, at the price of risking a direct military collision between two nuclear-armed superpowers."" But the visit does show, he said, that ""The U.S. remains the world’s top player by far. It can handle both adversaries, Russia and China, simultaneously. Essentially, Washington insists that it can do as it pleases anywhere in the world, ignoring the protests of the major powers.""

On Thursday morning, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council Dmitry Medvedev even added a threatening note, saying ""The United States will now have global consequences,"" he said. ""No one can guarantee that the next flight of some restless old woman will reach the selected point.""

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: CHINA, PELOSI AND THE IDES OF AUGUST

Taiwan certainly welcomed Pelosi with open arms and her remarks about America’s commitment to democracy being ""ironclad"" went down well.

Trenin claims Russia-China ties are also pretty strong. They have passed the post-February 24th ""stress test,"" he says. Perhaps most significantly, Trenin concludes, the pivot East for Russia is complete, ending what he describes as a 300-year Western orientation, ""for better or for worse.""

44,Russia bans bitcoins,"If you’re going to the Sochi Olympics in Russia, don’t bring bitcoins. Yesterday the Russian Prosecutor General’s office released a statement that clearly prohibits Russians from using the new digital currency.

“Bitcoin is a money substitute and cannot be used by citizens and legal entities,” the agency’s press release reads.

The Russian law enforcement agency cited an existing 2002 law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that reads, “the official currency of the Russian Federation is the ruble. Introduction of other monetary units and money substitutes is prohibited.”

But supporters of bitcoin -- a virtual currency unconnected to any country that has no physical form in paper or coin -- say the Russian ban will only hurt Russian entrepreneurs and consumers.

'Russia's loss is everyone else's gain.' — Jinyoung Lee Englund, spokesman for the non-profit Bitcoin Foundation

“Russia's loss is everyone else's gain ... Companies and profits that could have benefited Russia will now go towards other countries,” spokeswoman for the non-profit Bitcoin Foundation Jinyoung Lee Englund told FoxNews.com.

“Bitcoin is the first payment protocol designed for the Internet. It is faster, cheaper and more secure than existing systems and as a result, we are seeing an increase in merchant adoption worldwide.”

The Russian government says it is moving against bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because of growing use by criminal organizations and because “its price is determined solely by speculative actions that entails a high risk of loss.”

The price of bitcoin on Coinbase.com, the largest American site for buying and selling bitcoins, fell from about $780 before the Russian announcement to $700, before rising back to $750 by mid-day Friday. The price may also have been affected by financial problems at the Japanese bitcoin exchange MtGox.

Englund agreed that bitcoin is very volatile, but noted that buyers are aware of the risk.

“It is no secret… However, in time, as the market matures, the price will most likely stabilize.”

Regarding criminal elements, some noted that banning bitcoins may actually make it harder for Russia to track bitcoins use by real criminals.

“Requiring bitcoin companies and exchanges to operate legally and require user verification would aid in that,” bitcoin entrepreneur Margaux Avedisian, who runs Bitcoin Capital Partners, told FoxNews.com.

That’s because if bitcoins are purchased legally through regulated currency exchanges, which require identification from customers, the government can see who bought the bitcoins and can trace where the person then spends them.

But if a person manages to buy bitcoins without giving their name at purchase – for instance, if they do so in person from another individual – then it is much harder to trace a later illegal purchase back to them.

Englund said that, despite the Russia ban, he is optimistic about bitcoin regulation.

“Other countries like France and Brazil are trending towards adopting the United States’ 'smart regulation' approach,” he said.

The United States government has given mostly positive signals about bitcoin regulation. An FBI legal filing against the founder of Silk Road, an online drug bazaar that used bitcoins, noted: “Bitcoins are not illegal in and of themselves and have known legitimate uses.”

The IRS has also announced that it is working on tax guidance for U.S. bitcoin users. The government agency FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) has also issued guidance that it will treat bitcoin similarly to foreign currency.

There has been other good news for bitcoin lately. Despite a Chinese ban on banks using bitcoins, companies in the country have started trading them again.

“Once regulators dive into understanding the technology, fear goes away and they begin to see the social and economic potential,” Englund said.

Some were also skeptical as to whether Russia would take any real action against bitcoin.

“Every business in Russia also deals in euros and dollars, despite rubles being the only legal currency in Russia,” Tony Gallippi, CEO and Founder of BitPay.com, which has helped online merchants accept more than $100 million in bitcoin payments, told FoxNews.com

Bitcoin is here to stay, Englund argues.

“We have figured out how to send money over the Internet -- this learning is not just going to ‘go away.’ The question is a matter of who and when, not if, will lead the world in this cutting edge technological discovery.”

""Iran’s widening radius of drone proliferation continues to prove that bad actors in the Middle East do not stay quarantined,"" Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Fellow Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital.

Taleblu's comments come after a Washington Post report Sunday revealed that Western security officials believe intelligence indicates Russia will purchase Iranian-made Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar short-range missiles with the first shipment expected soon, after the deal was finalized last month.

IRANIAN MILITARY MEMBERS 'MAY' BE TRAINING RUSSIAN TROOPS TO USE 'KAMIKAZE' DRONES IN UKRAINE: REPORT

The missile sales come after reports surfaced last week that Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps troops traveled to Crimea to train Russian forces on the use of Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones. The ""kamikaze drones"" have been used recently to attack areas around Kyiv, with the Ukrainian National Resistance Center alleging the drones have also been used on civilian targets in other areas of the country.

""They [Iranian instructors] teach the Russians how to use kamikaze drones, and directly monitor the launch of drones on Ukrainian civilian targets, including strikes on Mykolaiv and Odesa,"" the organization said last week.

Western officials believe that Iran has been supplying Russia with drones since at least August, an accusation both Russia and Iran have denied.

RUSSIA USING IRANIAN-MADE ‘KAMIKAZE DRONES’ TO STRIKE AROUND KYIV

Tehran's apparently warming relationship with Moscow has come at a critical time for the Russian war effort, with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov claiming last week that Russia was close to depleting its high-precision missile arsenal.

""By using hundreds of high-precision missiles against civilian objects of Ukraine, the aggressor state reduces its ability to strike the military targets,"" Reznikov said.

Some reports have even indicated that Russia has begun using S-300 anti-air munitions for attacks on ground targets, a sign that Moscow may look to friendly nations such as Iran for help to increase its stock of weapons.

46,Russian oil executive who criticized Ukraine invasion dead after reportedly falling out of hospital window,"The chairman of Russian oil giant Lukoil, who along with his company had criticized the Ukraine invasion, reportedly died Thursday after falling from the sixth-floor window of a hospital in Moscow.

Ravil Maganov died in what sources are calling a possible suicide after his body was found on the ground of Moscow's elite Central Clinical Hospital, according to Russian news reports.

A statement from Lukoil said Maganov ""passed away after a severe illness,"" but did not give any further information.

Citing an unnamed law enforcement source, state news agency Tass reported that Maganov committed suicide after having been admitted to the hospital following a heart attack. News outlet RBK also reported that police were investigating the chairman's death as a possible suicide.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, the board of Lukoil was one of few companies that urged for a swift end to the armed conflict, calling it a ""tragedy"" and expressing sympathy for its victims.

PUTIN CRITIC LIVING IN EXILE FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE UPSCALE DC APARTMENT AFTER POLICE RESPONSE TO ‘JUMPER’ CALL

Former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler, author of the book ""Putin's Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital that ""we will never know exactly what happened to Maganov,"" but noted that death by defenestration is ""standard Russian intelligence playbook"" regarding the doctrine of ""wet affairs,"" the translation of a Russian term referring to operations that spill blood.

""The ‘wet affairs’ are targeted assassinations,"" Koffler said. ""Russia and previously the former Soviet Union are known for orchestrating mysterious deaths of the Kremlin’s opponents. It’s done in various ways — shots in the back of the head, poisonings, forced suicides and other intricate forms of violent death. I have a whole section in my book describing this doctrine and with examples of high-profile cases.""

PUTIN FURIOUS OVER US 'HEGEMONY,' SAYS END OF 'UNIPOLAR WORLD ORDER' IS ON THE HORIZON

Explaining that the Russian news agencies are mostly controlled or at least influenced by the Russian government, Koffler noted that Russian media ""couldn’t keep its story straight today on what happened to Maganov.""

""Interfax said he died, having fallen out of a window and Tass wrote that it was suicide. Yet another paper speculated that he was trying to go out of a balcony to get a smoke. The truth is these tactics are designed deliberately to be stealthy, so no investigator could identify foul play. They are usually deemed ‘tragic accidents.’ Also part of the doctrine,"" she said.

Maganov's death follows a similar mysterious death in August, when Soviet-born businessman and Putin critic Dan Rapoport reportedly jumped to his death from his upscale Washington, D.C., apartment. Like Maganov, Rapoport had publicly criticized the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A former top manager of Lukoil was found dead in the basement of a residence in a Moscow suburb in May.

47,State Department makes clear stance on Dennis Rodman's Russia travel,"NBA legend Dennis Rodman made waves over the weekend when he revealed his plans to go to Russia to advocate for the release of WNBA superstar Brittney Griner who was sentenced to nine years in prison after she was convicted of drug charges.

Rodman told NBC News over the weekend he ""got permission"" to travel to Russia to ""help that girl."" He didn’t elaborate on who gave him the green light to travel to Russia.

On Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price was asked about Rodman’s travel plans.

""Well, we have seen through the media, and really only through the media, that Dennis Rodman has said he does intend to travel to Russia. He — I want to be clear, he is — he would not be traveling on behalf of the U.S. government,"" Price said.

""I have just reiterated what we’ve said now for the past several weeks. We put forward a substantial proposal to Russia to seek the freedom of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. We believe that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts. We’ve also provided very clear guidance to American citizens owing to a number of threats, not the least of which is the threat of wrongful detention, that Americans should not travel to Russia. That has been our message to private Americans across the board.""

The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory to warn Americans about traveling to Russia.

BRITTNEY GRINER APPEALS 9-YEAR SENTENCE IN RUSSIA DRUG CASE: REPORT

""Do not travel to Russia due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens by Russian government security officials, the singling out of U.S. citizens in Russia by Russian government security officials including for detention, the arbitrary enforcement of local law, limited flights into and out of Russia, the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19-related restrictions, and terrorism,"" the warning reads. ""U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart Russia immediately. Exercise increased caution due to wrongful detentions.""

Price said last week the agency still classified Griner as being ""wrongfully detained."" He was asked about Griner and the potential of a prisoner swap with Russia, which may involve convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout and another American held in Russia, Paul Whelan.

""No element of this trial changes our judgment that Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained and should be released immediately,"" Price said. ""That is why we've put forward a number of weeks ago what we consider to be a serious, substantial proposal and an effort to seek her release, to seek the release of Paul Whelan as well.

RUSSIA CONFIRMS PRISONER EXCHANGE TALKS WITH US FOLLOWING BRITTNEY GRINER SENTENCING

Griner’s lawyers in Russia appealed her conviction. She was arrested for bringing vape cartridges containing oils derived from cannabis through a Moscow airport in February. She was convicted and received her sentence on Aug. 4.

Rodman has a history of interacting with world leaders.

Rodman met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in 2013 and was among the first Americans to meet him. The former Chicago Bulls star addressed a letter to Kim in January 2014, and about 10 months later captured American Kenneth Bae was released, according to TMZ Sports.

RUSSIA FREES JAILED US MARINE TREVOR REED IN EXCHANGE FOR CONVICTED RUSSIAN DRUG TRAFFICKER

Russia once faced international ire this week after it suggested Western support of Kyiv during Russia’s more than 60-day invasion could lead to nuclear warfare.

But despite calls from nations like the U.S. and U.K. to stop the aggressive rhetoric, Putin escalated the tough talk Wednesday.

""We have all the tools to do this. The kind that no one else can boast of right now,"" he said alluding to Russia's deployment of a hypersonic missile last month.

""And we will not boast; we will use them if necessary. I want everyone to know that,"" he continued. ""All the decisions have been made in this regard.""

NATO nations and other allies pledged to continue to support Ukraine as Russia ramps up its second offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine, in what defense officials have warned will be an even more brutal fight.

Moscow has repeatedly defended its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine as an attempt to ""denazify"" certain regions – a claim Ukraine and the West have said is patently incorrect.

PUTIN VOWS THAT UKRAINE WAR GOALS WILL BE 'UNCONDITIONALLY FULFILLED'

Russian forces have yet to make any major military advancements and Western nations this week said they would like to not only see Russia fail in Ukraine, but be incapacitated to the extent that it is unable to launch a similar offensive again.

But Putin doubled down on his efforts and told Russian lawmakers, ""I want to emphasize again that all the tasks of the special military operation we are conducting in the Donbas and Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, will be unconditionally fulfilled.""

Russia last extended its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine outside of the eastern Donbas and said it will seek ""full control"" over eastern Ukraine – giving it better leverage to next launch a campaign into neighboring Moldova.

49,Vladimir Putin cancels annual press conference as Russia stalls in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin canceled his annual year-end press conference for the first time in 10 years on Tuesday.

The press conferences have regularly lasted up to nearly five hours in past years, but the widely-televised event won't happen this year, with most observers crediting Russia's poor performance in Ukraine in recent weeks. Sentiment against Putin's invasion of Ukraine has also grown steadily within Russia throughout the conflict.

""Although questions are almost certainly usually vetted in advance, the cancelation is likely due to increasing concerns about the prevalence of anti-war feeling in Russia,"" the U.K. Defense Ministry wrote in a statement on Twitter. ""Kremlin officials are almost certainly extremely sensitive about the possibility that any event attended by Putin could be hijacked by unsanctioned discussion about the ‘special military operation.’""

Putin kicked off his invasion of Ukraine in February and initially made significant progress. Ukrainian forces, bolstered by tens of billions in funding from the U.S. and allies, stalled the invasion and successfully took back thousands of square miles of occupied territory this fall.

RUSSIAN AGENTS MAY HAVE HACKED FORMER BRITISH PM LIZ TRUSS'S PHONE: REPORT

Putin mobilized 300,000 military reservists in September, a move that triggered a wave of military-age men to flee the country out of fear of a general draft. The infusion of fresh troops does not appear to have had much impact on the front lines, however.

EXPLAINER: DIRTY BOMBS ARE DEVICES USED TO CREATE FEAR AND PANIC, ACTUALLY CAUSE FEW DEATHS

As a result, Putin's strategy has largely shifted away from land grabs. Putin's military has rained down missiles and shells onto Ukraine's energy and water infrastructure since the late fall. Now many Ukrainian citizens are facing the country's bitter winter with unreliable access to power and other necessities.

President Biden's administration announced an additional $53 billion in aid to assist the country in fixing its power grid and water infrastructure in late November.

In total, the U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February.

The Biden administration is already struggling to track those funds, as Republicans warn of impending audits once they take control of the House in January.

Likely future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said his party will not be giving Ukraine a ""blank check"" to fend off Russia's invasion. A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands. The Biden administration's previous tracking efforts have inspected only a fraction of the aid provided to the country.

50,Russia suspends UN grain export agreement participation after drone strikes on Black Sea fleet,"Russia announced it is withdrawing from the UN-facilitated Black Sea grain export agreement after an attack on its naval forces in Sevastopol, Crimea.

""We’ve seen the reports from the Russian Federation regarding the suspension of their participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative following an attack on the Russian Black Sea Fleet,"" Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, said in a press release Saturday morning. ""We are in touch with the Russian authorities on this matter.""

""It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people around the world,"" Dujarric added.

The attack occurred at 4:20 a.m. Saturday in Sevastopol, the biggest city in Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry wrote on Telegram. The attack involved nine aerial drones and seven maritime drones, the post said. Russia claimed it destroyed all the drones and that its fleet only suffered ""minor damage.""

Russia also claimed that the ships targeted in the attack were involved in security for the grain corridor. The United Nations worked with Russia and Ukraine, with Turkey acting as an intermediary, to establish the corridor as a means of securing vital food supplies of grain amid fears that the world could face multiple famines.

But now Moscow has suspended its participation in the deal, undermining the agreement and once again threatening global food supplies.

51,"Russia is greatest threat to US, but Biden administration adopted China-first defense policy","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

For years, military analysts and policymakers have debated whether Russia or China, both of which the Pentagon has designated as near peer competitors, presents a bigger threat to the homeland. While the Trump administration’s defense policy prioritized both Russia and China as top threats, the Biden administration has designated China as its top priority, though it acknowledges that Russia poses ""acute threats.""



The newly updated classified National Defense Strategy, which was briefed to Congress in March, placed China first and Russia second as key U.S. defense priorities. ""Defending the homeland"" from the PRC threat and ""deterring aggression, while being prepared to prevail in conflict when necessary, prioritizing the PRC challenge in the Indo-Pacific, then the Russia challenge in Europe,"" the strategy states, in order of priority.



But what the strategy is missing is that while China is indeed the long-term threat, Russia is the nation that imperils the U.S. and our allies most right now.

CHINA HAS REPEATEDLY SIMULATED ATTACKS ON US WARSHIPS, TAIWAN WARNS



Both Russia and China are of course, a danger and view the U.S. as their mortal enemy. While neither country has plans to invade the United States or to launch a ""bolt-out-of-the-blue missile strike on the homeland, both have developed doctrines that seek to defeat the United States. Both adversaries have redefined the traditional battlefield of ground, air, and sea, to include space and cyberspace, and have developed formidable non-kinetic arsenals to conduct space warfare and cyber warfare against U.S. military, intelligence, and civilian networks and systems.

Both countries are targeting American institutions and Americans with relentless espionage, election interference, and influence operations, sometimes getting uncomfortably close to the heart of Washington decision-making. And both have made significant advances in the development of new technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, electromagnetic pulse weapons, smart bombs, anti-radar systems, electronic warfare, anti-satellite weapons, and undersea warfare capabilities. But one is a nearer-term threat than the other.



Also in March, as the administration was rolling out its China-first strategy, Air Force Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Command, (NORAD) and in charge of protecting the homeland and Canada from missile strikes, identified Russia as the ""primary military threat to the homeland."" He highlighted that over the last 15 years, Russia has ""developed offensive capabilities below the nuclear threshold"" to constrain U.S. options in an escalating crisis.



The general echoed his own assessment from last year, when he identified Russia as ""the most acute challenge"" to defending the U.S. ""It is not China — it is Russia,"" VanHerck said at an unclassified conference last year. ""From a kinetic standpoint — submarines, bombers, cruise missiles, those kinds of capabilities — Russia is the primary military threat,"" he said, warning that it is that it is how they ""rehearse potential strikes on our homeland.""



On Saturday, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, whose mission is to protect the homeland and our allies from nuclear strikes, Navy Admiral Charles ""Chas"" A. Richard, noted that ""Both Russia and China have the ability to unilaterally at their own choosing, go to any level of violence, to go to any domain to go worldwide, with all instruments of national power."" He added that if Moscow and Beijing worked in tandem it would compound the threat.

While Russia and China both have formidable militaries, Russia’s is an existential threat to America, as it is the only country in the world that has the capability to destroy the homeland in a strategic nuclear strike. China has no such capability. Russia also has extensive and recent combat experience, having conducted military campaigns in Chechnya in the 1990s, Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and Syria in 2015, where the Russian forces are still engaged.



Moscow is also more aggressive in using military interventions to attain its goals, while China so far has given preference to non-combat operations while signaling its willingness to ratchet up hostilities. Faced with immediate demographic and economic challenges, Russia feels the pressure to attain its strategic ambitions in the short-term, while China has taken a long-term approach. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already begun the kinetic phase of his master plan to re-establish control over former Soviet nations like Ukraine, while Chinese President Xi Jinping seeks to eventually re-subjugate Taiwan.

The Ukrainian war amplifies the immediate threat from Russia. In the view of the Kremlin, Russia and the United States are in the middle of what Moscow views as a proxy war over control of Ukraine. That is, Moscow in a sense sees the U.S. and Russia at war right now. Given this, and with U.S.-Russia relations having deteriorated to what appears as the point of no return, the risk of escalation of hostilities into a direct military confrontation between two nuclear superpowers is powerful. Russia has developed a sophisticated nuclear doctrine, which envisions a detonation of a low-yield tactical nuclear warhead in the theater of combat operations, such as in Ukraine, as a way of compelling the United States and NATO not to intervene. The fallout from such an event — both literally and in terms of the US-Russia confrontation — is unpredictable.



Putin perceives the United States as openly trying to end his rule. Several U.S. officials have all but called for Putin’s regime change. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has admitted that Washington seeks to degrade Russia’s military and weaken its economy. Biden himself called Putin a war criminal. For Putin and his allies who are in charge in the Kremlin, the struggle in Ukraine is existential, both for them and for Russia, and the risk is that he will resort to extreme measures to achieve victory there is great.

U.S. intelligence officials said Russia may later try to purchase more military equipment from North Korea.

This comes after the Biden administration announced that the Russian military received Iranian drones in August for its invasion of Ukraine. But last week, the White House said Russia has endured technical problems with the Iranian-manufactured drones.

Western countries banned key Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022. The Belgium-based system daily moves billions of dollars around the world among more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions.

Cutting banks off from the SWIFT system severely limits a country's ability to acquire foreign capital and trade internationally and is among the toughest financial sanctions available.

RUSSIA WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST PROVIDING ARMS TO UKRAINE: ‘WILL LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF THIS CRISIS’

Iran and Russia have strengthened ties following Russia's invasion, with Iran supplying attack drones that have dive-bombed infrastructure and other civilian targets across Ukraine. After initially denying that it had armed Russia, in November Iran acknowledged the drones transfer, saying it took place before the war began.

Russia's vast oil reserves and trade ties with China and India have thus far largely cushioned it from Western sanctions.

55,Historic Russian ally snubs Putin in growing shift to European Union,"Russia’s Balkan ally Serbia is taking yet another step toward inching closer to Europe and away from Moscow as Belgrade looks for French fighter jets and European Union infrastructure money.

President Aleksander Vucic announced that Serbia would increase defense spending in an effort to modernize its military, with much of its inventory reliant upon old Soviet equipment. Serbia has shown interest in French jets since 2022 in the hopes of replacing outdated Soviet MIGs.

Serbian negotiations with France remain ongoing, according to Serbian media.

Serbia, which has close cultural and political ties with Russia, has received significant military hardware from Moscow. In recent years, Russia sent Serbia six MiG-29 fighters, 30 T-72 tanks, 30 armored vehicles, the Pantsir S1 air-defense system and Kornet anti-tank missiles, according to the German Marshall Fund.

A turn toward France could signal that Serbia is at least partially comfortable with a modest pivot away from Russia in order to solidify EU membership.

SERBIA, CAUGHT BETWEEN EUROPE AND RUSSIA, COULD MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH KOSOVO

""Serbia will not sever all ties with Russia, but replacing Russian jets with French jets would show that Belgrade is tilting more westward, particularly since, for the last four years, France has emerged as Serbia's primary political partner in the West,"" Vuk Vuksanovic, senior researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, told Fox News Digital.

Serbia is also in line to receive its largest EU funding package worth 600 million Euros to reconstruct the Belgrade railway by 2029. The project would help connect Western and Eastern Europe to Eurasia and Turkey.

Vucic has always tried to balance his relations with Belgrade’s traditional patron Russia while attempting to remain in the good graces of Europe. Serbia officially applied for EU membership in 2009, and its ongoing dispute with former province Kosovo, backed by Russia, remain key points of contention for its path to the EU. Recently, nationalist protesters took to the streets in opposition of an EU proposed plan to normalize relations with Kosovo.

A possible pivot aside, Serbia has not been completely on board with the EU’s commitment to helping defend Ukraine in its war against Russia.

""Until Serbia imposes sanctions against Russia, which is very unlikely to happen, no political move will be enough to satisfy the West,"" Helena Ivanov, associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital.

While it makes political and practical sense for Vucic to purchase more advanced fighter jets from France and accept EU aid, it is still likely not enough to fully ingratiate Serbia with EU leaders.

Many observers expect Serbia to continue making good faith efforts to stabilize relations with the EU, but up to a point.

Despite Cuba's decision earlier this year to abstain from U.N. votes condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Ukrainian territory, Cuba and Russia remain close geopolitical, economic and military allies, united by a shared anti-American vision.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has lavished hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil on the island nation, and Cuba in return has installed Russian intelligence at the infamous Lourdes SIGINT (signals intelligence) station near Havana, where it actively monitors U.S. communications.

WHAT IS PUTIN THINKING? WHERE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR STANDS NINE MONTHS AFTER INVASION

Despite Cuba's dismal economic outlook, Russia appears happy to extend repeated financial lifelines to the Caribbean Island in exchange for a bolstered geopolitical and military presence a mere 150 miles from U.S. shores. At a time when Russia is imperiled as never before in the post-Cold War era, its commitment of critical resources demonstrates the value it places on Cuba, which many scholars believe to be the command center in the ""long game"" Russia is seeking to play as it battles for hearts and minds in the Latin American region.

Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital that ""The Cuban regime has struggled to stay relevant after their financial enablers in the Soviet Union stopped sending them money in the 1990s,"" yet with renewed ties they receive ""military equipment and intelligence from Russia…the Cuban regime benefits because it can further sustain itself with Russian blood money. Communism only works with other peoples’ money.""

Russian-born intelligence expert Rebekah Koffler, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, believes that Russian military deployment to the island is a possibility.

""Russia is probably considering deployment of military assets and personnel into Cuba to show Washington that it can mess in its backyard, too — all part of the plan to put pressure on the Biden administration to abandon support of Ukraine. Obviously, Putin would need Diaz-Canel’s consent for that.""

Sixty years after 1962’s harrowing Cuban Missile Crisis, the threat of another confrontation looms large.

""Putin is maybe hoping to get permission to deploy nuclear-capable assets on the island as Moscow fears NATO’s intervention in the Russia-Ukraine war. This is meant as a deterrent but would likely be perceived by Washington as escalatory,"" Koffler said.

Diaz-Canel’s visit demonstrates that Cuba remains firmly in the Russian geopolitical orbit, with ties between the two nations arguably closer than at any time since the end of the Cold War.

MORE CUBANS IMMIGRATING TO THE US BY CROSSING FROM MEXICO

As Koffler notes, ""On Jan. 24, one month prior to the so called ‘special operation’ (the Russian invasion of Ukraine), the Cuban and Russian presidents had a ‘friendly and productive phone call’ during which they discussed their ‘strategic partnership’ … less than a week prior to the invasion, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov visited Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, key Russian allies in Latin America, to secure support.""

Despite the close relationship, Cuba and other Latin American allies like Venezuela and Bolivia surprised the world when they abstained from a U.N. vote to condemn the Russia invasion of Ukraine earlier this year and a subsequent vote on Oct. 12 regarding Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Koffler believes that this decision is tied to Cuba maximizing its economic standing with its historical benefactor.

""Cuba didn’t overtly vote in support of Russia, probably because it wants some negotiating leverage over Moscow. Havana likely hopes that Moscow will forgive some of its loans and get preferential terms for trade. In 2014, Moscow wrote off $32 billion of Cuba's outstanding debt. Havana probably hopes for more debt forgiveness by Moscow.""

Russia and China, while sharing a hearty interest in the region, take vastly different approaches to Latin America. While China has largely confined its interests to ensuring a return on its economic investments, Russia, in a return to a Cold War-mentality, has made substantial political investments in ensuring the stability and longevity of its authoritarian allies, as well as bolstering anti-American movements and sentiments.

The renewed use of the Lourdes SIGINT facility, whereby it actively monitors U.S. communications, is a key component of Russia's long-game strategy in the region, which primarily consists of antagonizing the United States.

Yet, given Cuba’s history of aggressive military interventions around the globe, military involvement on the part of Cuba in Ukraine is not beyond the realm of possibility. Last week, popular state television host Vladimir Solovyov called for the formation of international brigades to come to Russia’s aid.

""I don’t understand why Americans, even if they’re fighting in Grenada, always improvise an international coalition. … Why do we deny ourselves that pleasure? There are units in Syria very well trained by us, there are people in Africa who support us, there is Venezuela, there is Nicaragua, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.""

Citing the example of foreign volunteerism during the Spanish Civil War, he added, ""If volunteers from all over the world go and fight in Donetsk, why shouldn’t we give them the opportunity to organize and create an international body?""

Yet, Koffler deems this possibility as remote.

""I don’t see this as likely, but we cannot completely rule it out, at least, on a coercive basis rather than voluntarily,"" she said. ""Solovyov is one of the Kremlin's top propagandists and most of his rhetoric is intended to frighten the West and to galvanize ultra-nationalist sentiments within Russia. While we can’t completely dismiss what he says, we always need to take his rants with a grain of salt.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/cuban-state-visit-russia-demonstrates-importance-havana-putins-anti-american-agenda,N/A
57,"Americans told to leave Russia 'immediately' or face false arrests, US warns","The U.S. State Department on Monday ordered all U.S. citizens in Russia to leave immediately as the war in Ukraine ramps up and concerns over arbitrary detentions mount.

""U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately,"" the U.S. embassy in Moscow warned. ""Exercise increased caution due to the risk of wrongful detentions.""

In a stark message the department also said, ""Do not travel to Russia.""

FORMER PUTIN SPEECHWRITER, OTHERS ADDED TO RUSSIA'S 'FOREIGN AGENT' REGISTRY

The embassy warned that its ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia was severely limited due to staffing limitations, travel restrictions and the suspension of consular services.

All Americans have been warned to find a way out of the country immediately and reminded that U.S. debit or credit cards do not work in Russia, and the electronic transfer of funds has become increasingly difficult due to sanctions.

""Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, singled out U.S. citizens in Russia for detention and harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and convicted them in secret trials or without presenting credible evidence,"" the embassy added.

Fox News Digital could not immediately reach the State Department for comment on why this warning was issued now and whether that suggested a looming escalation in the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin on Monday dismissed the warnings by the embassy and pointed to similar calls to leave Russia issued by the State Department in September, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin mobilized more Russians to join his ranks in Ukraine.

""[Warnings] have been voiced by the State Department many times in the last period, so this is not a new thing,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said according to Reuters.

U.S. experts on Monday were divided on the significance of the warning and its timing, with one former Defense Intelligence Agency intel officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy Rebekah Koffler, describing the alert as ""serious.""

IRAN HELPS RUSSIA EMPLOY MULTIPURPOSE DRONES IN UKRAINE FOR 'MAXIMUM DAMAGE'

Koffler pointed out that the announcement came 10 days ahead of Russia’s Soviet Army Day, also known as Defender of the Fatherland Day, and 11 days before the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine.

""Putin wants to claim to some achievement,"" she said, warning that she believes Russia will launch a ""massive assault"" within the next week as it looks to gain some ground in Ukraine.

Ukrainian and Western defense officials have been sounding the alarm for months that Russia is planning a major offensive in an attempt to turn the tide after gaining little ground in months.

""There's no way for this war to go except up,"" Koffler continued questioning why the department had not issued another warning to U.S. citizens ahead of the looming offensive.

""Neither side has an exit [strategy],"" she said pointing out that both Ukraine and Russia view the war as an existential threat and therefore will not concede on the battlefront.

Former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman argued the embassy alert was routine and served as a reminder to Americans of the dangerous situation they are in if they remain in or travel to Russia.

""Bottom line is that we've issued these warnings in the past,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Just because you issued it once, doesn't mean everybody remembers.

""We don't make decisions based on calendar dates,"" he continued. ""I've [served] in a lot of embassies overseas. What we do though is we look at the threat and we say, 'it's still out there, we'll remind everybody – public service announcement.'""

""It’s horrific, it’s unconscionable,"" she told Fox News. ""What is happening in our judgment is war crimes.""

""This is about freedom, about the fight between good and evil,"" she said. ""We think it’s absolutely essential that Russia faces strategic defeat and that Ukraine prevails.""

59,Brittney Griner guilty plea possible 'gamble' to speed up Russia exit: expert,"Imprisoned basketball player Brittney Griner’s guilty plea to drug charges may play a role in speeding up her exit from Russia, but it’s a risky gamble that may have significant downsides, a hostage expert told Fox News Digital.

""I can't say that's the right or the wrong thing to do because, in any event, the Russian system … it's not our system,"" said Hugh Dugan, the acting special envoy for hostage affairs during the Trump administration. ""But that's the gamble based on the direction that her attorneys counsel her.

""To our eyes, it looks like, OK, this gets her into that status where they can do a [prisoner] swap.""

Griner, who pleaded guilty to drug charges July 7, has been held in Russia since February after Russian authorities say they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage.

RUSSIAN PRISONER BRITTNEY GRINER AND THE GROWING TREND OF HOSTAGE DIPLOMACY

The guilty plea does not bring an end to the case, but some have suggested it could speed up the process along with Griner’s exit from prison. She could make herself eligible for a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington, D.C.

Dugan explained that, by the books, Griner would have to return to the U.S. and finish her sentence in an American prison, something he believes would not happen in any formal manner if it occurred.

""In that type of prisoner swap, you're supposed to finish your sentences and respect the judgment of each respective country,"" he said, adding that he would ""doubt that the Russians would force their guy to sit in prison there for another so many years.

""That would mean you set up a certain jail here for the next ten years, at least, if it were a bona fide prisoner swap under our consular procedures and agreements with Russia on these matters,"" Dugan added. ""We didn't see it happen with [Trevor] Reed. I didn't see it happen with any type of such arrangements when I was acting either.""

BRITTNEY GRINER HAD DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS IN U.S.

Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, explained that most details of any dealings would remain out of the public and within diplomatic channels.

""They don’t want anything public,"" she said. ""The one thing about the Russian system that is very, very different from the American system is that there’s virtually no independent judicial process, especially in cases of high visibility like that.""

""Russians are saying she isn’t unlawfully detained. She possessed drugs,"" Koffler continued. ""It’s basically the clash of two legal systems.""

She added that it depends on ""what Putin wants.""

ENES KANTER FREEDOM CALLS OUT LEBRON JAMES: ‘BREAKS MY HEART WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THEIR FREEDOM FOR GRANTED’

Dugan worried that by pleading guilty — even if Griner does intend to make herself eligible for a prisoner swap and speed up her exit from Moscow — Griner has made Russia’s negotiating position stronger.

Part of the issue arises from Griner ""admitting"" to her criminal activity, which Dugan argued makes it difficult to classify her a hostage. He noted that officials had a hard time arguing for her ""hostage"" status since she was in pretrial proceedings for months already, meaning her status would more qualify as ""wrongfully detained.""

""It's a roll of the dice as to what we're dealing with,"" he said, noting that if Griner tried to argue her innocence, the Russian courts could set her next hearing months or even years later. ""Russia will do what it wants anyway. … It's kind of a no-win situation no matter what.""

And Griner is not the only American in Russian custody. Trevor Reed recently returned home, but Paul Whelan, an executive at automative supplier BorgWarner, remains in prison after he was left out of the prisoner swap that brought Reed home.

60,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine failed on numerous fronts, so Putin turns to 'Plan D' to 'save face'","Former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland told Fox News Digital that Russia has fallen back on ""Plan D"" after failing to maintain a protracted siege in Kyiv.

Russia re-evaluated its strategy and on March 25 began to pivot focus toward securing eastern Ukraine, which culminated in the surprise withdrawal from Kyiv and surrounding cities – a move that some intelligence and military experts claim is little more than an attempt to save face after a military disaster.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""Their Plan A was to mass along the border as if to invade, and assume Ukraine would capitulate on NATO membership and Donbas,"" McFarland said. ""When Ukraine did not, Russia’s Plan B was to invade and be in control in a few days.""

""When that didn’t happen Russia moved to Plan C – protracted war and siege,"" she continued. ""When that didn’t work, they’ve moved to Plan D – consolidate in east and a frozen conflict along the border: spin it as a success back home, come back for rest of Ukraine in a few years.""

McFarland said the prevailing belief – hers included – prior to the invasion was that Russia would aim to take the Donbas/eastern provinces. She labeled the full invasion a Russian intelligence and military failure, stressing that Russia failed to anticipate the Ukrainian leaders and people.

""Presumably, they thought Ukrainian leaders had been bought and would flee, and Russia could install a puppet government,"" she added.

PUTIN SHAKES UP LEADERSHIP IN UKRAINE WAR AS DEFENSE OFFICIALS WARN OF EASTWARD FOCUS

Fredrick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, went a step further and said the Donbas region was little more than a ""consolation prize"" to make up for the ""sacrifice"" in Putin’s campaign.

""The overall objective of the invasion was to replace the Zelenskyy government with a government that Moscow could control,"" Kagan said. ""That effort has failed.""

Kagan explained that the ""Putin World"" explanation is that Russia has ""bizarrely"" claimed to have achieved its objective around Kyiv and is now working to secure the land claimed by proxy republics Moscow has recognized.

FORMER UKRAINE PRESIDENT: PUTIN IS CONDUCTING AN ‘ANTI-HUMAN WAR,' ATROCITIES ‘HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY’

But securing those regions could provide a long-term purpose, which is to continue eroding Ukrainian territory and improving future invasion efforts.

""The more Ukrainian territory Russia has the harder it is to keep an independent Ukraine alive over time, and the more opportunities Putin will have to invade again after he’s built up his military or to do other things to achieve his aim to bring down an independent Ukrainian government,"" Kagan argued.

The extreme losses in Ukraine have pushed Russia to ""frantically"" rush to build up the military again, with a more robust conscription effort and other short-cut methods that will allow them to field something of an army.

Ultimately, Kagan believes that as long as Putin or ""Putinism"" remains dominant in Russia, it will continue seeking to destroy an independent Ukraine.

""This was never about Donbas, and it’s also never been about NATO, primarily,"" Kagan said. ""[Putin] does not accept Ukraine has the right to an independent government, he does not accept Ukraine’s sovereignty and he does not accept its existence as an independent state.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mcfarland-russia-plan-d-after-failing-siege-kyiv,N/A
61,Russia warns Israel against providing arms to Ukraine: 'Will lead to an escalation of this crisis',"Russia on Wednesday took aim at Israel and warned it not to get involved in the war in Ukraine by providing arms to Kyiv, claiming such a move would ""lead to an escalation of this crisis.""

""We say that all countries that supply weapons should understand that we will consider these to be legitimate targets for Russia’s armed forces,"" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said according to a report by The Times of Israel.

""Any attempts — implemented or even unrealized but announced for the supply of additional, new or some other weapons — lead and will lead to an escalation of this crisis,"" she added. ""And everyone should be aware of this.""

ISRAEL REJECTS US REQUEST FOR HAWK MISSILES IN AID TO UKRAINE

Zakharova’s comments came one day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was considering supplying Ukraine with more than just humanitarian aid – a move that would reverse Israel’s previous position on the war.

Netanyahu told CNN Tuesday that he was ""looking into"" providing Ukraine with ""other kinds of aid"" besides humanitarian help.

Israel has made no hard commitments to Ukraine when it comes to defensive aid largely because of the complex relationship it holds with Russia, though Moscow’s burgeoning relationship with Iran – which has provided Russia with drones for its war effort in Ukraine – could prompt Jerusalem to change its tune.

Netanyahu’s comments ran counter to a statement made last week by a spokesperson from the Israeli Ministry of Defense who told Fox News that Israel’s ""policy of the security echelon has not changed.""

The spokesperson's statement came after reports said Israel denied a U.S. request that it send Hawk missiles to Ukraine.

""Each request is examined on its merits. Beyond that, we do not refer to additional details,"" the spokesman added.

US TRANSFERS MILITARY WEAPONS STOCKPILE FROM ISRAEL TO UKRAINE

But the Netanyahu administration has set it sights on countering Iranian threats and Russia’s growing partnership with the Persian nation could mean Israel may finally decide to back Ukraine with arms.

Netanyahu also said he would not mind serving as a mediator if both Russia and Ukraine, along with the U.S., asked him to fill the role.

Russia’s warning Wednesday was not only directed at Israel.

France also received some finger waging after Zakharova condemned French President Emmanuel Macron’s comments this week when he said sending warplanes to Ukraine was not off the table.

""No element of this trial changes our judgment that Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained and should be released immediately,"" Price said. ""That is why we've put forward a number of weeks ago what we consider to be a serious, substantial proposal and an effort to seek her release, to seek the release of Paul Whelan as well.

The deal comes as tensions between U.S. and Russia are running high, with Moscow's bloody invasion of Ukraine in its 63rd day.

""Today, we welcome home Trevor Reed and celebrate his return to the family that missed him dearly. Trevor, a former U.S. Marine, is free from Russian detention,"" President Biden said in a statement. ""I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence. And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In their own statement, the Reed family thanked Biden ""for making the decision to bring Trevor home"" as well as other administration officials and Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations whom the family said traveled to Moscow in the hours before the Ukraine war began in hopes of securing Reed's release.

""Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is safely on his way back to the United States,"" the statement read, adding that ""as soon as he's ready, he'll tell his own story"" and that the Reed family stands with ""all the other families of wrongfully detained Americans who are still waiting for their own release moment.""

Reed was one of several Americans known to be held by Russia, including WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was detained in February after authorities said a search of her bag revealed a cannabis derivative, and Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, who is being held on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus.

""We won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends,"" Biden also said Wednesday.

U.S. senior administration officials said Wednesday that Reed, who is in ""good spirits"", is currently heading back to America to be reunited with his family and that his health was an ""intense concern"" and driving factor leading to his release.

""This is a discreet issue in which we were able to make an arrangement with the Russians,"" one official said about the prisoner swap. ""It represents no change – zero – to our approach to the appalling violence in Ukraine.""

Reed, a now-30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran and former presidential security guard, had been living in Russia in the summer of 2019 when was arrested by Russian police and accused of assaulting a police officer. He had been celebrating in a park with his longtime Russian girlfriend and her colleagues at the time, his father, Joey Reed, told Fox News Digital earlier this month.

Reed was sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family has maintained his innocence and the U.S. government has described him as unjustly detained.

""He was extremely intoxicated because they’d been to a party for her law firm in a park,"" he explained.

At the time, Reed had been taking Russian language classes for an international studies degree through the University of North Texas, his father said.

Following a public trial, Reed was convicted in July 2020 of assaulting police officers and was sentenced to nine years in prison.

His time in Russian prisons and labor camps had been concerning, the family said.

""He was essentially in solitary confinement, I believe, for over a year in a pretty bad prison,"" Reed said. ""Once he got to the labor camp … they would wake him up every hour. You know, they were punishing him for different things.""

He added: ""My son saw the sun maybe a dozen times in two years.""

Trevor pushed back against Russian authorities’ efforts to make him work at the labor camp, telling them: ""I’m not working for you. You’ve taken me hostage, and I’m not going to make stuff for you to make money on.""

Trevor’s situation grew recently concerning in recent months after he became ill with active tuberculosis and then began continuously coughing up blood.

In the other side of the prisoner swap, the U.S. agreed to return Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the U.S.

Russia had sought his return for years while also rejecting entreaties by high-level U.S. officials to release Reed, who was nearing his 1,000th day in custody.

The two prisoners were swapped in a European country. Though officials would not say where the transfer took place, in the hours before it happened commercial flight trackers identified a plane belonging to Russia’s federal security service as flying to Ankara, Turkey.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons also updated its website overnight to reflect that Yaroshenko was no longer in custody.

A person familiar with the situation told Fox News Wednesday that the prisoner swap is an ""extraordinary rarity"" with regard to the Biden administration’s strategy in bringing Americans who are held hostage and unjustly detained around the globe home to the United States.

The ""very difficult decision"" made by the president was ""driven by circumstances with respect to Trevor’s health,"" the person told Fox News, adding that the Biden administration is ""committed and the president is committed to trying to find ways to bring others home around the world.

""The person said that the president was willing to make the call because of how ""strongly he feels about his commitment to bringing Americans home.""

The person said conversations regarding Reed’s return to the United States were ongoing for ""months and months.""

Despite significant advances Ukrainian forces made in completely repelling Russian troops from the northern Kharkiv region and pushing Russian forces east across the Dnieper River in the southern Kherson region, Zelenskyy looked to sound the alarm in his overnight address Tuesday.

""The situation at the front is difficult,"" he warned. ""Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south.""

Defense officials have repeatedly pointed to Russia’s inability to advance its ground forces in Ukraine following Kyiv’s recent military gains.

Hudson explained that this policy means South Africa will choose to work with any nation that best suits it including the U.S., Russia and China despite adversarial differences – a geopolitical tactic that Western nations have a difficult time accepting.

""In a multipolar world, all partners are valid partners,"" he said.

US-AFRICA LEADERS SUMMIT: WASHINGTON ‘PLAYING CATCH-UP’ WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA

The war in Ukraine has prompted Western countries to draw geopolitical lines, and they have called on nations around the globe to condemn the war.

But South Africa, which was one of 35 nations last year to abstain from a U.N. vote condemning the war in Ukraine, has decided to take a neutral stance.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a call with his South African counterpart earlier this week in which they reportedly discussed the upcoming anniversary and Minister Naledi Pandor’s support for a peaceful resolution to the war, a readout of the talks said.

But the readout did not include any mention of the joint drills with China or Russia – two of the U.S.’s biggest adversaries and who have been vying for greater influence in the African continent as their ties with the West become increasingly strained.

In a statement to Fox News Digital a State Department spokesman said Friday the department had noted with ""concern"" South Africa's decision to hold joint drills with Russia and China.

""We encourage South Africa to cooperate militarily with fellow democracies that share our mutual commitment to human rights and the rule of law,"" the spokesman added.

But Hudson argued that Washington's private or public lobbying to discourage relations with its chief adversaries could be only complicating the situation further.

""South Africa is not unique in the position that it holds among Africans,"" Hudson said. ""They do not want to be trapped between great powers. They want to be able to choose and define their external relationships and not be pressured.""

China has been inserting itself across the continent for years by employing various loan programs that often result in Beijing’s increased influence as poor nations struggle to pay off the loan commitments – a scheme that has been deemed ""debt trap diplomacy.""

But Russia’s increasing interest in the African continent has Western officials concerned.

BLINKEN FLIES INTO 'SUPERPOWER' BATTLEGROUND IN AFRICA

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has already visited the continent twice this year alone, including South Africa in January.

Earlier this month he pronounced that the West had been unsuccessful in isolating Moscow from Africa following his second tour.

Blinken traveled to South Africa in August where he championed the end of apartheid and met with Pandor for a joint press conference.

But Blinken’s reception by the South African government did not appear to be as warmly welcomed as Lavrov’s visit earlier this month. During a joint press conference the international minister accused the U.S. and its Western allies of employing ""a sense [of] patronizing bullying"" when it came to the war in Ukraine.

""It's a bit ironic that while South Africa kind of rails against the West, for its sort of hegemony historically, it's aligning itself with malign actors,"" Hudson said, adding that the drills that kicked off Friday are just the latest ""rejection of all the courting that the Biden administration has been doing in South Africa.""

Over the last 20 years the U.S. has provided over $7 billion in AIDS relief to South Africa alone, which doesn't include the other millions of dollars in humanitarian aid Washington continues to provide annually.

It is unclear how much aid either Russia or China provide to South Africa annually, but Hudson explained this is the crux of Washington's woes in Africa.

""We in the United States, view our relationships in South Africa and with Africa, as kind of aid dependent – it is not a relationship of equals,"" he said. ""It is a relationship of donors and recipients.

""Whereas Russia and China are building relationships of equals,"" he added. ""They're not sending aid to these countries. They're doing business deals, they're doing security deals, they're making investments, they're building political alliances in ways that we in the United States simply are not.""

Russia’s close ties with South Africa date back to the days of apartheid when Moscow backed the African National Congress (ANC) in its fight against the oppressive government.

The U.S.'s support of the South African government during the early days of apartheid in the late 1940s was largely down to the government's support of anti-communist ideals – a topic of immense importance to Washington as the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia kicked off.

Though the U.S. also eventually sanctioned the South African government in support of ending apartheid in 1986, Russia’s official and unofficial financial backing of the ANC reportedly ensued for decades after apartheid ended.

Russia has also made efforts to renew its diplomatic ties with South Africa in the face of Western isolation.

""South Africa is going to have its cake and eat it too,"" Hudson explained. ""They're going to take humanitarian aid from us. They're going to take investments from the Chinese. They're going to take energy deals from the Russians.

""For them there is no internal inconsistency to that because they want a multilateral world,"" he added. ""The question is, is Washington willing to accept that?

""And I think the bottom line is if Washington isn't willing to accept that, it's going to be cut out of South Africa,"" Hudson said.

66,"UK spy chief warns of 'no limits' Russia, China partnership, but insists West has 'advantages'","MI6 Chief Richard Moore did not hold back when discussing Russia and China during a fireside chat at the Aspen Security Forum, going so far as to even reveal that the U.K. now considers China its ""top priority"" and that Russia's war efforts in Ukraine culminated in ""complete failure.""

""Presidents Putin and Xi, when they met, they came up with this agreement … with the term 'no limits,'"" Moore said. ""Now … that ‘no limits’ is a ringing phrase, isn't it? That's a ringing phrase, and I think it says, when President Xi says these things, he means them, and we ought to listen hard.""

Moore, in his first-ever on-camera interview outside the U.K., presented a complex picture of the international landscape, particularly regarding the challenges of remaining ""upstream"" of China as well as a number of blunt statements regarding Russia and its actions in Ukraine.

Moore criticized China for ""beating the Russian drum and selling"" Putin’s narrative on Ukraine ""without any sense of irony."" ""They’re selling their snake oil around the world,"" Moore said.

CHINA ‘TRYING TO STUDY’ RUSSIA'S FAILURES; CIA DIRECTOR ‘WOULDN’T RULE OUT' NEAR-TERM TAIWAN INVASION

He also raised the negative side of doing business with China, pointing to Sri Lanka, which made ""really misplaced economic decisions"" in trusting China and falling prey to its Belt and Road Initiative. The West, he argued, shows a greater willingness to work in an ""independent and creative"" environment.

Most startling, Moore labeled China as the U.K.’s top priority – ahead even of any counterterrorism efforts.

""We are putting more effort into China,"" Moore said. ""We now devote more effort to China than any other single subject.""

""So, for example, it just moved past counterterrorism in terms of our mission, and that feels like a very big moment – post-9/11, post-7/7 in London – but it reflects the seriousness of the mission for us,"" he added.

BIDEN LACKS COHERENT STRATEGY ON IRAN THAT IS ‘WEEKS’ FROM BUILDING NUCLEAR BOMB, AIDS RUSSIA: EXPERT

The greatest challenge with China is dealing with an ""opaque"" system, especially after China crushed U.S. spy sources in 2010, killing or imprisoning at least 18 such operatives and setting the U.S. back ""decades.""

""But I would just say that … we have this huge advantage that the Chinese don’t because we have friends – we have allies, we have an ability to work in a trusted way to try and take on this challenge.""

The U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand share intelligence in a system known as the Five Eyes Alliance. Moore argues that in addition to this alliance, which allows free movement of intelligence between the five nations, the U.S., U.K. and their partners also offer a ""middle ground"" for countries that China and Russia do not.

""You know, there are a lot of countries out there that may not share our values,"" he said. ""They may not share our political systems, but they are a vital battleground for us as we seek to compete with the Chinese, and if we leave a vacuum in those places, the Chinese will fill it.""

FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR O'BRIEN TO CHAIR NIXON FOUNDATION, HOPES TO ‘EDUCATE’ US ON CHINA THREAT

Moore outlined how he seeks to ""forge a relationship"" with the intelligence service of a given country that ""might fall into that category"" and try to find common ground.

""I’m not leaving my values at the door,"" he added, stressing that his values remain ""critical"" to his service. ""I will find ways of finding a common ground and I think we’ve got to do that, and part of that is frankly not seeing this as some kind of set of a 1950s cowboy movie [where] the bad guys have black hats and we all have white hats.""

""It’s a messy, contested world out there, and we’ve got to be prepared.""

One area in which this preparation came in handy was dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Moore once again highlighted the value of knowing ahead of the invasion what Putin intended to do, and how that led to numerous failures.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR HIGHLIGHTS TAIWAN AS ‘MOST-SENSITIVE’ ISSUE, CLAIMS US DOES NOT SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE

""We had the enormous privilege in the U.S. and U.K. intelligence services of knowing what [Putin’s] plan was, and he had three things he wanted,"" Moore said. ""One was to remove [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy, second was to capture Kiev, and third was to sow disunity within the NATO alliance.""

""If you turn to those three briefly … I think that's a fail, if you completely failed to capture Kyiv."" That, he said, means Russia suffered a ""very, very bloody nose.""

He echoed estimates from CIA Director William Burns that Russia had lost some 15,000 troops – at least – during the invasion, saying it was a ""conservative"" estimate that would equal the same number of troops Russia lost in the 10-year Afghanistan operations in the 1980s. Like Burns, he also said Putin was not in poor health.

He said Russia’s greatest failure of all resulted in NATO growing in strength – once again highlighting the value of cooperation between Western allies in order to achieve their goals. With Sweden and Finland joining the alliance, Moore believes NATO stands stronger than ever before.

But Biden stopped short of sanctioning Putin himself, and he did not announce a ban on Russia from the SWIFT banking system, saying Europe is not on board with such a move.

On orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin, troops began attacking Ukraine overnight Wednesday.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""Putin is the aggressor,"" Biden said. ""Putin chose this war. And now, he and his country will bear the consequence.""

Biden said the sanctions, in coordination with a coalition of other nations, would target more major Russian banks, including VTB, Sberbank, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank OJSC and Novikombank. The sanctions will make it harder for Russia to do business in dollars, Euros, pounds and yen, and there will be ""new limitations"" on what can be exported to Russia, he said.

The sanctions will also target Russia elites: Sergei Ivanov and his son Sergei, Andrey Patrushev and his son Nikolai, Igor Sechin and his son Ivan, Andrey Puchkov, Yuriy Solviev and two real estate companies he owns, Galina Ulyutina and Alexander Vedyakhin, the U.S. said.

The sanctions will also limit the borrowing opportunities for 13 Russian entities and enterprises, according to the U.S.: Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways.

Biden said he believes Russia has ""much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union.""

""America stands up to bullies,"" Biden declared. ""We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.""

""Liberty, democracy, human dignity – these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression,"" he added. ""Make no mistake, freedom will prevail.""

Biden spoke with G7 leaders Thursday morning before his speech, saying allies are ""in full and total agreement.""

The U.S. and partners are also going after the Russian military and Belarusian individuals and entities for their support for the invasion.

Meanwhile, Biden maintained that the United States will ""defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power.""

""Let me say it again—our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East.""

RUSSIANS MOVING TOWARD ‘DECAPITATING’ UKRAINE IN MULTI-STEP ATTACK: US OFFICIAL

""There is no doubt, no doubt, that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article IV commitments, which says, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" Biden said.

The Pentagon said the number of U.S. service members authorized to go to Germany is 7,000. Last month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened preparedness.

Biden said he spoke with Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley about ""preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO allies and support the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, NATO.""

""This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world,"" Biden said. ""Putin has a committed assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace. Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about.""

Biden was pressed by reporters Thursday on why his administration has yet to impose sanctions directly on Putin – which he did not directly answer.

Biden did, though, say he has no plans to meet with Putin.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""They have every intention of decapitating the government and installing their own government,"" the official said.

Russia launched more than 100 ballistic missiles into Ukraine overnight, including short range ballistic missiles, medium range ballistic missiles, cruise and Surface to Air.

The official said Pentagon officials ""haven't seen something on this scale"" since World War II, saying officials anticipate that it will be ""very bloody, very impactful"" and continue ""for a long, long time to come.""

""This is a war of choice,"" the official said.

Putin, in an address Wednesday night announcing he had made the decision to green light Russian military operations in Ukraine, said that Moscow’s ""analysis"" had concluded that ""confrontation with these [Ukrainian] forces"" was ""inevitable.""

Putin, though, threatened the west and countries that try to interfere with Ukraine with ""consequences you have never seen.""

TAIWAN WARNS OF ‘DESTABILIZING’ ACTIONS BY CHINESE AS RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE

""A couple of words for those who would be tempted to intervene,"" Putin said Wednesday night. ""Russia will respond immediately and you will have consequences that you never have had before in your history.""

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""

Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since the Second World War.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""

While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.

And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promised: ""We will defend ourselves.""

An advisor to Zelenskyy said Thursday that, so far, about 40 people have been killed in the Russian attic on the country, and that several people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.

Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine int he squares of our cities.""

""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said Thursday, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.

Russia ""has embarked on a path of evil,"" Zelensky said, but Ukraine ""is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.""

Zelenskyy said sanctions would be lifted ""on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone. Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that it had shot down several Russian aircraft, according to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported. Highways outside of Kyiv swelled with traffic Thursday leading to Poland, and lines of people waited for gasoline, to withdraw money or to purchase other supplies, such as food and water.

68,USDA blames Russia for rising price of Thanksgiving dinner,"The Department of Agriculture says Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine is one reason why your Thanksgiving dinner costs more than it did last year.

A USDA memo this month said turkey prices will be higher because of this year’s outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which led to the death of 8 million turkeys in 2022. But USDA also said ""Russia’s war on Ukraine and drought across the United States"" are other factors that are ""pushing up the price of Thanksgiving staples.""

USDA told Fox News Digital that both the COVID pandemic and ""Putin's Price Hike"" have boosted food prices around the world, and said Russia's move against Ukraine cut off a ""critical supply"" of wheat, corn, barley and other grain. Russia's war in Ukraine plus the pandemic have putt ""pressure on food prices,"" USDA said.

President Biden and his administration have often blamed Russia for the broad increase in inflation and has referred to higher food and energy prices as ""Putin’s price hike.""

THANKSGIVING VILIFIED BY MEDIA AND SCHOOLS AS A CELEBRATION OF ‘GENOCIDE,' ‘IMPERIALISM’

The Biden administration’s own data, however, shows that inflation began ratcheting up almost immediately after Biden took office in February 2021.

Just before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022, the Biden administration reported that consumer prices were up 7.5% in the year ending in January 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation would rise as high as 9.1% in the year ending June 2022, but sharp increases were seen well before Russia invaded Ukraine.

Ukraine is a major grain exporter, and Russia’s effort to block those exports has led to price spikes. But again, feed grain prices were rising along with the prices of many other commodities before Russia’s invasion.

ACTIVISTS PLAN THANKSGIVING PROTEST AT PLYMOUTH ROCK AGAINST ‘GENOCIDE’ OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

USDA's memo said the Biden administration has made progress fighting higher prices at the grocery store by noting that the 0.4% increase in grocery prices in October was the ""smallest increase since December of last year.""

That memo also downplayed the impact that inflation is having on the cost of Thanksgiving dinner compared to non-government estimates. It said the average cost of Thanksgiving retail staples like a fresh turkey, sweet potatoes, cranberries and green beans will only cost about 1% more this year compared to last year, and that substituting in a frozen turkey means a 6% increase.

But the American Farm Bureau Federation says the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner is up 20% compared to last year. The cost of stuffing mix, frozen pie crusts, whipping cream, frozen peas and dinner rolls have all increased by more than 20%, the Farm Bureau said.

BIDEN PARDONS TWO TURKEYS IN THANKSGIVING TRADITION

While those prices may remain high throughout the holiday, turkey prices seen in stores haven’t increased as much. Beth Breeding, vice president of communications and marketing at the National Turkey Federation, said grocery stores typically lower turkey prices closer to Thanksgiving and use turkeys as loss-leaders to bring in customers.

Still, she said prices seen in actual stores in the days before Thanksgiving are higher than they were last year and rose from about 93 cents a pound to $1 a pound, an increase of about 7%.

69,What is Putin thinking? Where the Russia-Ukraine war stands nine months after invasion,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Washington will soon debate sending billions more to Ukraine to assist its war effort. Lawmakers may want to first conduct a reality check on where Russia stands in this nine-month war and on Putin’s decision calculus. This suggests that U.S. funding will not produce quick results, may not produce any results or may also produce very bad results for America and Ukraine.

This is how, when wishful thinking is set aside, things actually look:

The Battlefield

Multiple areas across Ukraine are still under Russian assault, even as Ukrainian forces are gaining momentum with an effective counter-offensive, pushing to reclaim territories captured by Russia. On Friday, special units of Ukraine’s armed forces entered the strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, following the retreat of the Russian troops as directed by the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. As Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy was championing another victory, the Kremlin warned that Kherson’s status didn’t change, despite the retreat, claiming that the city was still ‘part of Russia.’

The Russians are unlikely to permanently abandon Kherson or any of the three regions that Moscow recently ""annexed."" The Russian ground forces who assumed defensive positions on the left bank of the Dniepr River, will probably not engage in a mano-a-mano battle with Ukrainians, having lost so many men and so much military hardware. The withdrawal is a potential ruse to lure Ukrainian troops into a radioactive chamber. Russian Spetsnaz operatives reportedly left a nasty message on a door of one of the buildings. Addressed to Ukrainians, the message warned that this was ""the territory of the Russian Empire,"" that Putin was ""our and your Czar"" and that the Russian troops went ""on vacation.""

PUTIN’S CYBER ARMAGEDDON DOCTRINE SEEKS TO EXPAND RUSSIA'S OFFENSE BEYOND BATTLEFIELD

For weeks, Moscow has been accusing Kyiv of planning to use a ""dirty bomb,"" also called a radiological dispersal device (RDD), an improvised nuclear device containing dynamite laced with radioactive powder. Unlike traditional nuclear bombs, RDDs have low military value but produce panic and terror in the opposing force and population. They cause severe burns, irradiation sickness, and they contaminate food and water. Driving Ukrainians out of the region by contamination would be consistent with Russia’s most recent military doctrine, which envisions use of radiological, chemical and biological warfare for ""defensive"" purposes. The Russians have a special military branch, Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces (RKhBZ), that are trained in decontamination and clean up.

A New Strategy of Indirect Action

Russia has all but exhausted its conventional combat power, having fired around 4,000 missiles and, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, have lost some 100,000 personnel to death or injury. Morale is low. Special units are sent to the front lines to shoot retreating soldiers and deserters. Multiple Russian commanders have failed to secure victory.

However, despite Washington’s expectations, Putin will not abandon the fight. His regime views the stakes as existential for him and for Russia. Moscow wants Ukraine to remain part of its strategic security perimeter, on which it relied for centuries. Putin will continue to enforce his version of the Monroe Doctrine to keep NATO troops and influence out of a country that has a 1400-mile border with Russia.

FIVE REASONS WHY BIDEN MUST MOVE TO DE-ESCALATE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR NOW

Under the new ""asymmetric"" strategy, Moscow is targeting critical infrastructure to leave Ukrainians without water, electricity and heat as winter approaches. Missile and drone strikes on Kyiv’s electrical grid have left half a million homes without power. Local authorities are mulling evacuation plans should the city become unlivable.

Forty percent of the country’s energy infrastructure has been crippled, and multiple industries have incurred devastating cyber strikes. Loss of power will result in lack of water, causing sewage problems that will spread disease. In late October, Ukraine’s intelligence services uncovered Russia’s plot to blow up the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam to trigger a massive flood in southern Ukraine. Couple that with a dirty bomb in Kherson, and a large swath of the country will become an environmental disaster. The main target in this phase of war is the population, its psychological state and its will to fight.

Putin’s Health and Regime Stability

Endless rumors abound about Putin’s deteriorating physical and mental condition – anything from thyroid to pancreatic cancer, to Parkinson’s, a mysterious mental illness caused by COVID-related isolation, and more. It is impossible, even for U.S. intelligence, to assess Putin’s health with high accuracy. Putin takes extreme measures – including having his security personnel collect his excrement and urine when he travels - to safeguard information about his health. There is no credible evidence Putin has a chronic condition like cancer. Instead, Putin appears ""entirely too healthy,"" as CIA Director William Burns recently assessed.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Two weeks ago, the Russian strongman put on a three-hour performance, including a speech and Q&A, at the annual international ""Valdai"" conference hosted by Russia. Putin was lucid, forceful, confident and looked healthy. There is no credible evidence suggesting the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, his ouster or forced retirement into a sanatorium.

What the future holds

Putin is preparing for the long haul and even an all-out war, anticipating NATO intervention. Moscow has mobilized additional 318,000 men and mandated basic military training in high school. It has expanded military cooperation with Iran and North Korea to replenish its depleting weapons supply. Russia is standing up bomb shelters, training police in wartime protocols and conducting emergency evacuation drills.

The Biden administration’s solution to the Russia-Ukraine problem has been to hit Russia with more sanctions, deprive another Russian oligarch of his yacht or palace and send billions in aid to Ukraine. This is naïve and simplistic. The question of control over the post-Soviet space has been festering since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries. So victory is not around the corner, nor will it be defined by President Biden. That the Washington establishment is dragging America into yet another geopolitical experiment as Ukrainians are being slaughtered and their country ruined is irresponsible and dangerous.

""But it could have a profound negative impact on the climate obviously. You have a war and obviously you’re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war. But equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know, I think hopefully President Putin would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.""

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk,"" he added. ""And the people of Russia are at risk. And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry, who has faced criticism for his own impact on climate change, made similar comments Sunday when he told GZERO Media’s Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what’s necessary"" to curb emissions, and it will be ""very tough for the climate agenda, there’s no question about it.""

Kerry's made the comments days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since World War II.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

The satellites have proven vital for Ukraine’s troop communication on the ground and along the front lines, but their assistance to Kyiv in its battlefield successes has become a sore point in Russia.

""Namely, the use by the United States and its allies of civilian, including commercial, infrastructure elements in outer space for military purposes,"" he added, noting that satellite use ""constitute[s] indirect participation"" in the war. ""Quasi-civilian infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation.""

Frustration has reportedly mounted in Moscow and within Russia’s own ranks over its inability to maintain command and control as Ukrainian forces continue to make battlefield advances.

RUSSIA CHAMPIONS ELON MUSK'S 'PEACE' PROPOSAL, UKRAINE REJECTS MUSK AS TWO-FACED

Vorontsov argued that the use of commercial satellites to benefit Ukraine in the war violates the Outer Space Treaty and warned that it could start a ""full-fledged arms race in outer space.""

The spokesman’s comments come as speculation surfaced last week that SpaceX might cut off funding for Ukraine’s satellites if the Department of Defense does not agree to foot the bill.

However, on Monday, Musk cleared the air and said in a tweet that he had already assured Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov that SpaceX ""would not off Starlink even if [the Department of Defense] refused to provide funding"" – a scenario which appears likely as Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said last week that commercial decisions were up to individual companies.

""What an individual company may or may not do in any particular corner of the world of course is incumbent on that company to decide and do,"" he told reporters.

72,Defense Secretary Austin says US would enter conflict if Russia attacks Estonia,"In the event that Russia launches an attack or invasion against Estonia, the United States will enter the conflict, according to the head of the Department of the Defense.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin III spoke Thursday at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium. The conference focused heavily on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is approaching its year anniversary.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: BELARUS WILL JOIN FIGHT IF EVEN 'ONE SOLDIER' ATTACKS TERRITORY, PRESIDENT SAYS

Austin was asked by a reporter how the country could be confident they'd have the backing of U.S. military might in the event of a Russian invasion.

""You know, I'll just point to what our president, President Biden, has said a number of times and what I've also said. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad. And we take that very seriously and will live up to our commitments,"" Austin told the press.

RUSSIA WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST PROVIDING ARMS TO UKRAINE: 'WILL LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF THIS CRISIS'

Article 5 of NATO’s Washington Treaty is known as ""the principle of collective defence."" It obliges all member countries to come to the aid of another member whose sovereignty or territorial integrity might be under threat .

NATO defines it as being ""at the very heart of NATO’s founding treaty.""

FORMER PUTIN SPEECHWRITER, OTHERS ADDED TO RUSSIA'S 'FOREIGN AGENT' REGISTRY

The defense secretary explained that the US military has maintained a comprehensive presence within the Baltics since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""We also set up, you know, back at Madrid, our president made the decision to rotate forces in and out of the Baltics on a consistent basis in a heel-to-toe fashion so that we had the, you know, consistent presence. We've lived up to that. We'll continue to live up to it,"" Austin said.

Austin touted this level of military presence as a promise kept, stating that similar promises of military support would be kept if necessary.

""And the final thing I would just point out to you is that prior to Russia's invasion, you know, I met with your minister of defense and I told him that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would deploy forces to Estonia the next day. And we did. We were the first to be here and we meant every word we said. And we'll live up to our commitments going forward. So we are committed to to Article 5. And you can bet on it.""

73,GOP rips Brittney Griner deal for stranding Paul Whelan in Russia: ‘Celebrities over veterans?',"Republican lawmakers on Thursday criticized President Biden for a deal that returned WNBA star Brittney Griner from a Russian prison camp, but failed to free Paul Whelan, a U.S. Marine veteran who has been jailed in Russia since 2018 on spying charges that the U.S. government has said are baseless.

In return for Griner, the U.S. agreed to send convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" back to Russia. Several Republicans said that was a bad deal given the serious charges against Bout, and that Biden missed a chance to get Whelan.

""If @POTUS is going to release a guy convicted of providing aid to a terrorist organization & conspiring to kill American citizens, he should have at least gotten BOTH Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan in return,"" tweeted Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y. ""A U.S. Marine is left behind in another bad deal made by Biden.""

BRITTNEY GRINER RELEASED FROM RUSSIAN PRISON IN SWAP FOR CONVICTED ARMS DEALER

""Where is U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who has been unjustly held by Russia for far longer?"" tweeted Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla. ""Celebrities over veterans?""

Waltz said in a separate tweet, ""This is absolutely shameful,"" and said Biden is giving priority to a celebrity over a veteran.

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said on Twitter it was ""foolish"" of Biden to trade away someone U.S. law enforcement spent years tracking down and capturing.

""I'm grateful that Brittney Griner is out… but I can't believe that he actually negotiated away the Merchant of Death as the swap for her, and left a Marine in prison,"" Lankford said.

""SO @POTUS just traded an enemy who smuggles guns and helps shoot Americans for an American who smuggles drugs and shoots basketballs, all while a former US Marine, Paul Whelan, rots in a Russian prison,"" tweeted Rep. Scott Perry, R-PA. ""Let that sink in.""

""President Biden just gave Russia its ‘Merchant of Death’ back while U.S. Marine Paul Whelan is left locked up in a Russian prison,"" tweeted Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich. ""We need justice for Paul. He should be on that plane coming home too.""

BRITTNEY GRINER'S LEGAL TEAM MET WITH WNBA STAR AT RUSSIAN PENAL COLONY: 'DOING AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED'

""@POTUS @SecBlinken, it's been over 4 years since his imprisonment,"" tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. ""How much longer must his family wait? There is no place for weakness when it comes to lives of innocent Americans.""

""This is now the second prisoner exchange where President Biden has left Paul Whelan behind,"" tweeted Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich. ""A Marine and Michigan native, Paul has been wrongly imprisoned for 4 years. Absolutely heartbroken for the Whelan family. They deserve better.""

A Republican who just won a seat in the November midterm election, John Block of New Mexico, ripped the deal and said it favors Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""The Biden regime literally swapped Brittney Griner for Viktor Bout (the Merchant of Death) in Russia,"" he tweeted. ""Can’t make this stuff up… Biden just gave Putin exactly what he wanted.""

WHO IS VIKTOR BOUT, RUSSIA'S ‘MERCHANT OF DEATH’ FREED IN PRISONER SWAP FOR BRITTNEY GRINER?

Other Republicans were less critical but said there is more work to do to get Whelan and other Americans home. ""I will continue my work with @RepHaleyStevens until all Americans wrongfully detained abroad are free,"" tweeted Rep. French Hill, R-Ark.

Some House Democrats made similar points. Texas Rep. Colin Allred agreed that the U.S. ""must remain committed to getting every American detained abroad back home.""

""While we are very happy that Brittany Griner is returning home, we cannot forget we still have Americans unlawfully detained in Russia – specifically Paul Whelan,"" tweeted Rep.

74,"Russia, Iran reach deal to make drones on Russian soil for Ukraine war: report","Moscow and Tehran have reached a deal to make drones on Russian soil to bolster its war effort in Ukraine following months of relentless bombings on civilian locations, a report by the Washington Post said Saturday.

Fox News could not immediately reach the Pentagon for comment, but according to the report, U.S. intelligence officials recently learned of the agreement which was reached by the two nations in early November.

The U.S. first revealed Iranian plans to ""gift"" Russia hundreds of Shahed-136 drones earlier this year and by August 1,000 Iranian-supplied drones were shipped off to Russia before being dropped over civilian targets in Ukraine.

RUSSIA FIRES 18 CRUISE MISSILES, 5 DRONES AT UKRAINE ONE DAY AFTER US, ALLIES PLEDGE TO BOOST KYIV AIR DEFENSE

The agreement apparently coincided with Russia’s defeat in Kherson earlier this month when it withdrew its forces from the capital city in its biggest military loss since retreating from Kharkiv in September.

It is unclear which drone design would be employed for production in Russia, but according to the report officials from both nations are working the transfer key components and plans to get the manufacturing up and running within three months.

A reported 400 drones have been dropped over various targets in Ukraine, hitting civilian neighborhoods, villages, cities and the nation’s energy infrastructure.

Russia has intensified its aerial attacks in recent months while its ground forces continue to see setbacks as Ukrainian forces push the front lines farther east.

NATO SAYS RUSSIA 'ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE' FOR DEATHS IN POLAND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM AIR DEFENSE MISSILE

Since Nov. 11, Russia had launched roughly 150 missiles and over 25 kamikaze drones against Ukraine, according to Ukrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksii Hromov on Thursday.

Over 100 of the air strikes carried out in the six-day period were blocked by Ukraine’s air defenses.

But Russia’s latest agreement with Tehran may not only increase its ability to produce more drones but may rapidly increase the amount of time it would take to refit its troops both in Ukraine and those in border regions in Russia and Belarus.

Ukraine has pleaded with its Western allies since the beginning of the war to help it improve its air defenses – a request that has become ever more urgent given Russia’s heavy reliance on aerial attacks.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said this week that he, and the nearly 50 other allied nations that make up the Ukraine Contact Group, were looking to send Ukraine the ""right mix"" of air defenses and weaponry to stop Russia from gaining air superiority.

75,Five reasons why Russia is likely behind the Nord Stream industrial sabotage,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov dismissed Ukraine’s accusations Thursday that Russia was behind the Nord Stream pipeline gas leaks, calling it an act of state-sponsored ""terrorism."" After NATO condemned it as a ""deliberate, reckless"" act of sabotage, Russia’s top intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said Moscow has evidence it’s the West that did it.

Here are five reasons why Russia is probably the state that has orchestrated this dangerous act.

First, Putin has the motivation. Facing potential defeat in Ukraine, Putin is desperate to reverse the momentum on the battlefield by resorting to dramatic escalation. This is his way of trying to compel the U.S. and Europe to stop providing long-range weaponry to Ukraine. The outcome of the conflict in Ukraine is an existential issue for him personally and for Russia. Russia views Ukraine, along with other former Soviet states, as part of its strategic security perimeter.

Putin has already declared adding Ukraine to NATO and integrating into the West a ""red line."" Moscow views this as its version of the Monroe Doctrine.

NATO CONDEMNS ‘DELIBERATE, RECKLESS’ SABOTAGE OF NORD STREAM PIPELINES AFTER FOURTH LEAK DISCOVERED

The risk for Putin of having Ukraine join NATO outweighs that of being condemned by NATO as a sponsor of industrial terrorism. Frustrated that he is not taken seriously, Putin is desperate to send what he thinks is a clear message.

Second, damaging or destroying critical infrastructure is consistent with Russia’s warfighting concept called Strategic Operation to Defeat Critical Infrastructure of the Adversary (SOPKVOP, in Russian). Russian strategists spent decades conceptualizing ways to bypass the U.S. and NATO conventional superiority in a conflict they had concluded was inevitable because Moscow and Washington have been in confrontation over control of the post-Soviet space since the collapse of the USSR in 1991.

NORD STREAM PIPELINE BLASTS WERE LIKELY FROM EXPLOSIONS, NOT EARTHQUAKES, SEISMOLOGIST SAYS

Intended for wartime, SOPKVOP operations also can be deployed during peacetime to ""destabilize the opponent’s social and political situation"" and dislodge the adversary psychologically to persuade him to abandon the fight. Russia’s targeting strategy prioritizes critical infrastructure. It has spent years studying Western vulnerabilities. SOPKVOP envisions prosecuting quasi-military campaigns by employing cyber operations and other non-kinetic methods.

Third, Russian military strategists have pondered a scenario in which Russia would target their adversaries' civilian infrastructure during a conflict. Defeating a ""small number of key interconnected targets"" that are vital to the functioning of the state would cause the ""entire system to collapse,"" they hypothesized.

GLENN GREENWALD: NORD STREAM PIPELINE PROVIDES 'ENORMOUS' LEVERAGE TO RUSSIA

In 2012, Russian strategists analyzed a 2001 accident in the United States that involved a train that was transporting hazardous chemical materials and veered off the tracks in a Baltimore tunnel. The accident burst a water pipe, causing a three-foot flood that disrupted Baltimore’s mail carrier and telecommunications systems. Disruption of train and auto transportation followed along the entire Baltimore-to-New York corridor.

""Taking parts of the adversary’s civilian infrastructure out of commission,"" the Russian strategists argued, will produce cascading destructive effects, ""harming the economy, healthcare, defense and security of the entire state.""

Fourth, Russia is one of very few countries that has the exact capability needed to sever the Nord Stream pipelines carrying Russian gas to Europe and to do it covertly. Moscow has invested in undersea warfare capabilities through its GUGI program, a top secret program with the innocuous cover name of ""Deep Sea Research"" that includes work on undersea communications and sensor networks, hydrocarbon exploitation, submarine rescue and investigating wreckage.

Moscow has war gamed territorial incursions in the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic as well as the disruption of undersea cables that carry communications. It is the only country, according to the U.S. Naval Institute, that has a fleet of special mission submarines for seabed warfare and espionage and is expanding this capability, while U.S. and European antisubmarine warfare capabilities have atrophied since the end of the Cold War.

Fifth, Putin has no use for Nord Stream in the short term, as neither pipeline 1 or 2 are revenue producing. Moscow shut down Nord Stream 1 at the end of August, claiming that U.S. and European economic sanctions had made maintenance impossible. Nord Stream 2 never became operational, with Germany having declined its certification. To the contrary, taking Nord Stream out of commission serves Putin’s goal of freezing the Europeans in winter, a standard Putin move to use energy as a weapon.

Russia is replacing this lost revenue with export earnings from non-Western countries, such as China, India, and even the Taliban. The $55 billion joint Russia-China pipeline ""The Power of Siberia,"" which has partially operated since 2019 and is scheduled to come online in 2025, is part of Putin’s long-term plan to pivot to Asia, given Moscow’s conclusion that relations with the U.S. are irreparable.

The Kremlin has the motive, the means and a warfighting doctrine that all put the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline directly at its feet.

76,Russia claims to secure up to 98% support for annexation in controversial referenda: report,"Russia on Tuesday claimed to have garnered up to a 98% support rating as tallying continues in four regions of Ukraine as Moscow looks to illegally annex areas from its southern neighbor.

Polls closed Tuesday in the controversial referenda held in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions as Russia looks for a pretext to support its attempts to seize control of the eastern and southern regions.

PUTIN EXPECTED TO SEIZE PARTS OF UKRAINE AS 'SHAM' REFERENDUMS END TODAY

According to alleged results released by Russian media, roughly 98% of the votes so far tallied in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions claim to have expressed support in joining Russia, while the Kherson region came in slightly lower with nearly 97% of voters backing annexation.

Kyiv and Western officials have long decried the referenda as ""shams"" and warned Moscow would mimic steps taken in 2014 when it held a ""vote"" over the annexation of Crimea which allegedly showed that some 97% of voters supported the move.

Reporting later showed that only 30% of Crimeans are believed to have participated in the vote, and just 15% actually supported Crimea joining Russia.

Moscow has warned that if it gains enough ""support"" to annex the four war torn regions, it will treat any attack on them as a direct attack on Russian territory.

Russian state-owned news outlet RIA confirmed that Russian forces fired nuclear-capable ICBM missiles from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, roughly 600 miles north of Moscow, along with a submarine-launched ballistic missile from the Barents Sea.

Long-range air-launched cruise missiles were also reportedly fired Wednesday.

""The tasks envisaged during the training of the strategic deterrence forces have been completed in full, all missiles have reached their targets, confirming the specified characteristics,"" the Kremlin reportedly said in a statement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin observed the ""Grom"" – meaning thunder – exercises from the Kremlin in Moscow.

Despite Western concerns over Putin’s increasingly threatening rhetoric on deploying nuclear weapons amid the war in Ukraine, defense officials said they were aware of the previously planned exercises.

The Department of Defense on Tuesday confirmed that Moscow had alerted it to regularly scheduled missile tests per U.N. charter, and therefore, did not violate any international treaties.

""As we've highlighted before, this is a routine annual exercise by Russia,"" Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. ""In this regard, Russia is complying with its arms control obligations, its transparency, commitments to notifications.""

EXPLAINER: DIRTY BOMBS ARE DEVICES USED TO CREATE FEAR AND PANIC, ACTUALLY CAUSE FEW DEATHS

The brigadier general said the U.S. will continue ""to keep an eye on"" Russia’s nuclear testing exercises.

""But beyond that, I'm not going to have any further information at this time,"" he added.

Russia escalated concerns surrounding the threat of nuclear use in Ukraine this week, when it claimed that Kyiv was preparing to use a ""dirty bomb"" – a crude devise that relies on conventional explosives like dynamite but is also paired with nuclear materials.

Ukrainian and Westerns officials have rejected these claims as false and have warned Moscow could be using these allegations as a pretext to justify its own nuclear use in the war torn nation.

In an interview with Fox News Digital about his new memoir, ""One Damn Thing After Another,"" in which he details long-term national security challenges facing the U.S., Barr said he agreed with the Biden administration's moves to reject Poland's proposal to send MiG-29 planes to the Ukrainian military.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES

The Pentagon this week said Poland's proposal raised concerns regarding the deployment of warplanes from a U.S. base in a NATO-allied nation to combat Russian forces.

Ukraine has been pleading with Western allies to send military aid and implement a no-fly zone over the country. The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly said a no-fly zone over Ukraine could bring about a direct conflict with Russia.

""We have to be very careful about getting into direct conflict with Russia — Russia is a nuclear power, and we can’t allow this to escalate into a nuclear war,"" Barr said. ""I do think now is the time for prudence, and that we do not escalate — I know people see what’s going on, and they feel terrible about it — but that’s the nature of countries getting nuclear weapons: our options are curtailed.""

NORTH KOREA TESTS NEW ICBM MISSILE SYSTEM IN 'SERIOUS ESCALATION,' US OFFICIAL SAYS

""That’s why having North Korea get nuclear weapons is a problem, and that’s why Biden’s efforts now in reopening these negotiations with Iran and letting Iran become a nuclear power is very sobering,"" Barr continued. ""After Ukraine, say some things like this happen in Israel — we would be dealing with a nuclear power.""

Putin launched Russia’s multi-front war against Ukraine on Feb. 24. His brutal invasion of the country is continuing for a 15th day, and Barr warned that there could be a long road ahead.

""I think now that Putin has committed, there is no off-ramp for him,"" Barr said. ""It is hard to see a way he saves face without continuing to push forward.""

Meanwhile, Barr said he does not think Russia has ""the military power"" to move into neighboring countries after the invasion of Ukraine.

""Even if their military was operating well, I think they’ve diminished themselves in the eyes of the world as a military power, because their military is not functioning very well,"" Barr said. ""But even on paper, they don’t have the military power to do more than what they’re doing.""

Barr added that, over time, he believes Putin’s strategy will be to ""neutralize"" and have ""a puppet regime in Ukraine like in Belarus.""

""And so, that Ukraine, Belarus, Russia would be his sphere of influence, and then, down the road, I think he could try to destabilize the Baltic States,"" Barr said.

""I don’t think there is any risk in the short term of him expanding this to include invasions of other countries,"" Barr continued. ""I don’t think that there is a game plan to move beyond Ukraine at this point.""

But Barr said Biden's weakness ""invited"" Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

""A lot of our foreign adversaries think President Biden is a weak leader, and I think that’s partly what invited the aggression in Ukraine,"" Barr said. ""Putin has always made it clear that he would not tolerate Ukraine as a part of NATO, but there was no real urgency on that.""

""I just think that he saw that there was an opportunity for him to move quickly against a leader who he didn’t think would resist very effectively,"" Barr explained, noting that the opening was seen during the botched withdrawal of U.S. military assets from Afghanistan.

""Putin also saw that Biden had curtailed American energy independence, thus increasing the leverage of Russia,"" Barr said.

79,"Who is Viktor Bout, Russia's 'Merchant of Death' freed in prisoner swap for Brittney Griner?","WNBA star Brittney Griner has been released from the Russian prison system in exchange for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer known as the ""Merchant of Death,"" Fox News confirmed Thursday with a senior administration official.

Reports earlier this year suggested that Bout, whose weapons sales fueled deadly conflicts around the world, could be exchanged for Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan.

But Whelan does not appear to have been a part of the exchange despite the assertion by the State Department that he has been wrongfully detained.

The former Marine was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on alleged espionage charges.

Russian officials have long pushed for the release of Bout, who was serving a 25-year sentence in U.S. prison after being convicted in 2011 of conspiracy to kill Americans, conspiracy to deliver anti-aircraft missiles, and aiding a terrorist organization.

He was nabbed in 2008 in a sting operation at a luxury hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, where he met with Drug Enforcement Administration informants who were posing as officials with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which has been classified by US officials as a narco-terrorist group.

Prosecutors said that Bout was prepared to provide the group with $20 million worth of ""a breathtaking arsenal of weapons — including hundreds of surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and sniper rifles — 10 million rounds of ammunition and five tons of plastic explosives.""

BRITTNEY GRINER REVEALS TRANSLATION ISSUE DURING HER FEBRUARY ARREST

Bout, who was played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie ""Lord of War,"" has maintained his innocence, claiming that he is a legitimate businessman.

The Russian state-owned news agency TASS originally reported in May that talks are underway to exchange Bout for Griner.

Russian officials see Bout as a ""high-value asset"" and are likely pushing hard for the exchange, according to former Defense Intelligence Agency officer Rebekah Koffler.

""Moscow wants him back because he possesses critical insights that he can share with the GRU, his former agency. Having been in a U.S. prison and interrogated by U.S. officials, he knows what our intelligence requirements are and other information that is valuable for the Russians,"" Koffler, the author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital.

""It would be a big mistake for the U.S. to give up Viktor Bout, as much as one feels compassion for Ms. Griner and Mr. Whelan.""

But Ukrainian forces have been making advances in western Luhansk and northern Donetsk as they inch toward the strategically important city of Sievierodonetsk, which Russia has occupied since June.

Cherevatyi said that some 5,000 to 5,500 occupiers were in Lyman, but noted it was difficult to estimate the number of troops in the areas surrounding the town due to the fluid movement of troops in combat zones.

The official’s comments echoed claims made by Putin after polls allegedly showed Ukrainians in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions ""overwhelmingly"" supported seceding from Ukraine.

""The days are going never to return when the U.S. can use the UNSC as its shield and means of aggression for maintaining its supremacy,"" he added, accusing the UNSC of employing ""gangster-like double standards.""

The comments from the North Korean ministry coincided with Pyongyang's decision to fire an unannounced ballistic missile over Japan – which has joined the U.S. and its NATO allies in condemning Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The missile – the longest test fired by North Korea with a range of more than 2,800 miles – was immediately condemned by the White House, which accused Pyongyang of blatantly violating UNSC mandated international safety norms.

82,Russia's reinforcements: Where Putin has found more weapons and troops as Ukraine invasion drags on,"Russia’s weapon and troop shortage has forced it to turn to other rogue nations and some surprising sources in an effort to sustain its invasion of Ukraine.

Analysts predicted Russia’s invasion would last only days or weeks due to confidence in a superior military force with vast supplies and an overwhelming advantage in manpower, but nine months later, Moscow has looked to source weapons and troops from other countries.

""Russia clearly wasn’t prepared for the nine-month slog that it’s fighting in Ukraine now,"" Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital. ""Putin thought that it would be a one- to two-week project, [and] Russian intelligence failed to accurately estimate Zelenskyy's ability to galvanize Western support, Ukrainians’ will to fight, U.S. and Europe’s willingness to provide unprecedented levels of security aid and the Russian forces’ tactical limitations.""

Experts previously told Fox News Digital about how ""rampant"" corruption undermined Russia's military, with oligarchs allegedly pocketing the money instead of investing it in the military over the past thirty years since the Soviet Union collapsed.

THE RUSSIA-IRAN MONSTER: BIDEN'S STRATEGIC INCOMPETENCE HAS CREATED A NEW MENACE FOR AMERICA

And Ukraine bolstered its own supplies with heavy investment from the U.S. and its NATO allies, helping to level the battlefield for months and allowing Ukraine to push Russian forces back. Russian President Vladimir Putin had to withdraw his troops to the eastern border and focus on locking down ""rebel"" states in Ukraine after failing to take any major strategic target.

But now Russia has started to build its own coalition of allies, even as those allies try to keep their support quiet.

""Russia has already fired on the order of 3,000-4,000 missiles in Ukraine, more than expected, with hundreds of missiles launched in the last two weeks targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure to disrupt electricity and water supplies ahead of winter,"" Koffler explained. She added that ""Russia's missile arsenal is almost certainly depleting,"" and current inventory is ""probably"" below 40% of pre-war levels.

The U.S. on Wednesday accused North Korea of secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells, and reports over the past month detailed how Iran first supplied Russia with Shahed-136 ""kamikaze"" drones and then trained Russian troops in their use. New reports indicate that Iran added Mohajer-6 as well as Shahed-129 drones to its shipments.

White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told a virtual briefing that North Korea had attempted to hide the shipments by sending them through countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Reuters reported.

RUSSIA REJOINS UKRAINE GRAIN EXPORT WARTIME DEAL

""Our indications are that the DPRK is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,"" Kirby said, adding that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments.

""We do have a sense on where they are going to transfer these shells,"" Kirby said. He declined to give any more details as the U.S. weighs its possible options. But he insisted that the weapons would not likely change the momentum or outcome of the war.

The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) reported that Iran may even increase its support and provide Russia with short-range ballistic missiles, a move that indicates any economic relief Tehran would gain through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — also known as the Iran nuclear deal — would end up funding Russia’s war and undercut U.S. sanctions.

""With reports that Iran plans to send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine — and as the people of Iran cry out in the streets for a change in regime — the U.S. and its European allies should withdraw all sanctions relief offers made to Tehran and complete the snapback of U.N. sanctions at the Security Council,"" Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor at the FDD, wrote in an analysis published Wednesday.

UK TIGHTENS SECURITY OVER HACKING FEARS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA

The transfer would include Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles. The Fateh-110 can reach a distance of 150-180 miles, while the Zulfiqar could potentially reach targets within 435 miles.

Iran already sent over 3,500 drones to Russia, with most of the units produced in factories operated by the Iranian Ministry of Defense and the Iranian Aviation and Space Industries Association (IASIA).

Weapons alone will not win the war as Putin also looked to replenish his depleted forces. After months of silence about the true number of casualties, both CIA Director William Burns and British Intelligence Chief Richard Moore indicated that Russia lost around 15,000 troops over the first five months of the invasion.

""We've seen for months now attempts by Russia to recruit sort of their own version of the foreign legion, of particular communities by the Wagner Group in the field from Syria, from Libya, from the Central African Republic,"" Goldberg told Fox News Digital. ""We've heard reports of Serbians, as well, fighting on the pro-Russia side.""

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BACK TO KYIV AS RUSSIA TARGETS CITY WITH DRONES AND MISSILE STRIKES

""[One of] the main motivations for doing this for the Russians is they're quickly depleting their own forces,"" Goldberg explained. ""They are moving into reserve call-ups, and they don't want to have to continue taxing the Russian population wherever possible.

""So to the extent that they can lean on foreign troops to do the work, to have non-Russians fighting and dying rather than Russian bodies coming home to their families, that's their preference,"" he added, noting that Putin is seeking ""low-cost, high-impact systems.""

Putin attempted to replenish his forces through a forced enlistment by announcing a ""partial mobilization,"" but many Russian men decided to flee the country rather than join Putin’s war in Ukraine.

Russia had already drawn in Chechen fighters in the early phase of the Ukraine war after it became clear the conflict would not end as soon as Putin had believed and would require more commitment.

RUSSIA EXPANDS UKRAINE EVACUATION ORDERS IN OCCUPIED KHERSON

Reports started to emerge over the following months of Russia reaching out to friendly nations and seeking reinforcements. The New York Times in April reported that Putin had looked to Syrian and Georgian fighters to bolster its forces.

And multiple Afghan military and security sources last week said that elite National Army Commando Corps soldiers started joining the Russian forces after the U.S. left behind the 20,000 to 30,000-member force following its military drawdown.

As many as 10,000 of the former commandos were initially inclined to accept Russia’s offer, Foreign Policy reported.

Goldberg likened Russia’s growing coalition to Ukraine’s International Legion, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy established at the start of the conflict. It drew 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries in the first week.

""Moscow is running low both military hardware and personnel, having to fill the gaps with non-indigenous capabilities. It’s procuring weapons from Iran and North Korea and is relying on the mercenary contingent, the Wagner Group, the Chechen fighters, Kadyrov, to replenish its regular forces,"" Koffler said. ""They are even recruiting prisoners and bringing in former Afghan security forces, who were displaced as the Taliban came back to power, after the U.S. withdrawal.

The announcement came one month after President Biden had approved a separate $800 million arms package for Kyiv.

But Moscow is taking issue with the sophisticated systems that the U.S. and NATO nations are arming Ukraine with and in a diplomatic démarche this week accused the U.S. of ""adding fuel"" to its war, first reported the Washington Post Friday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked that more aid be provided from allied nations more quickly as Kyiv prepares for what defense officials have warned will be an even more brutal fight in the Donbas.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters this week that the U.S. has been getting defensive aid to Ukraine at ""unprecedented speeds"" and noted that it takes just one week from the time Biden signs off on an aid package to when it gets into Ukrainian hands.

An entire delivery of an arms package takes roughly four weeks.

""I would remind [you] that we front load. Every shipment has a mix of material on board,"" the official said, noting that the last shipment contained surface-to-air defenses like Javelin and Stinger missiles, along with Switchblade drones armed with tank-busting warheads.

In an annual news conference from Moscow, the foreign minister began his comments by defending Russia’s barrage of missile fire on civilian targets like Ukraine's energy sector and attempted to claim it was a defense tactic to halt Western arms.

""We disable energy facilities [in Ukraine] that allow you [the West] to pump lethal weapons into Ukraine to kill Russians,"" Lavrov said, according to a translation by Reuters.

""So don't say that the U.S. and NATO are not participants in this war - you are directly participating,"" he continued. ""Including not only with the supply of weapons, but also with the training of personnel – you train the [Ukrainian] military on your territory.""

Lavrov was referring to international efforts to train up Ukrainian servicemen with NATO tactics in nations like Britain, Germany and Italy – comments which were made after reports surfaced this week suggesting that Washington may expand its training of Ukrainian soldiers on U.S. bases in Germany.

Russia has been accused by NATO of using winter as a ""weapon of war"" by forcing Ukrainian citizens to endure increasingly harsh conditions without electricity, heat or running water as the cold months set in.

The West has further claimed that Moscow is targeting civilian populations as a way to try and force Kyiv to capitulate as Russian forces have seen significant losses on the front lines.

It remains unclear what the general sense in Russia is when it comes to Moscow’s deadly war in Ukraine, though cities across Russia have canceled their Christmas and New Year’s celebrations in recognition of the costly war.

Western estimates regarding the toll that the war has taken on Russian troops suggest that they have seen at least 80,000 casualties since the war began in February.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will not engage in peace talks until Russia completely withdraws all troops from Ukraine.

The U.S. is taking recent signaling from the Kremlin very seriously, and does not consider the matter a bluff, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.

Russia already has about 100,000 troops stationed along its border with Ukraine, the defense official said.

When asked about the report Friday, President Biden vowed the U.S. would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin to carry out the plan.

NATO CHIEF WARNS RUSSIA AGAINST INVADING UKRAINE

""We’ve been aware of Russia’s actions for a long time and my expectation is we’re gonna have a long discussion with Putin,"" Biden told reporters later, as he prepared to leave Washington for a weekend visit to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland.

""We’ve been aware of Russia’s actions for a long time and my expectation is we’re gonna have a long discussion with Putin."" — President Biden

In earlier comments, Biden told reporters that his administration had new initiatives planned that were intended to deter Russian aggression.

""What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be, will be, the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,"" Biden said.

The planned Ukraine offensive for 2022 would involve about double the number of Russian troops that participated in a military exercise near the Ukraine border last spring.

""The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment,"" a Biden administration official told Fox News.

‘All contingencies’

In remarks this week, one day before meeting with his Russian counterpart, Blinken claimed Putin was preparing to have the ability to quickly invade Ukraine, whether he planned to or not – and said the U.S. needed to be ready either way.

""We must prepare for all contingencies,"" Blinken said.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who met with Blinken in Sweden, pointed to U.S. military equipment and activity getting closer to Russia’s borders.

Biden’s personal history involving Ukraine includes his admitted role in the ouster of Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in 2016, when Biden was vice president.

It was former President Donald Trump’s later inquiries into Ukraine involvement by Biden and son Hunter Biden that eventually led House Democrats to impeach Trump over a phone call with a Ukraine leader. The Senate later acquitted Trump in that impeachment case and another separate impeachment that followed.

Critics say the Obama administration was caught flat-footed in 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine soon after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

The bill under consideration at the State Duma, Russia’s lower house, would prohibit websites from distributing materials related to LGBTQ or those that might prompt children to seek gender reassignment surgery. It also blocks the sale of physical products dealing with these issues, along with books and movies.

Similarly, advertisements would be banned from including ""information demonstrating non-traditional sexual relations or preferences.""

The Duma gave the measure a second reading on Wednesday. Under the Russian legislative process, a third reading is needed to pass the bill to the Federation Council, the upper House. Once passed there, it can be signed by President Vladimir Putin.

According to the Duma, the author of the measure is State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, who cited trends in the U.S. and Europe as a reason to pass it.

""He cited data from opinion polls, according to which 16% of Europeans aged 14 to 29 identify themselves as LGBT,"" the Duma reported. ""And in the U.S. state of Maryland, the number of students who have not decided on their gender due to the promotion of non-traditional relationships has grown almost six times in two years and today makes up 45% of all students in the state.""

The Duma did not cite where it received the polls, and it was not immediately clear if the polls are in fact accurate.

""We must do everything to protect our children and those who want to live a normal life. Everything else is sin, sodomy, darkness, and our country is fighting this,"" Volodin said, according to the Duma.

""For violation of the ban on propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations or preferences among people of any age, a fine of 50 thousand to 400 thousand rubles for citizens, from 100 thousand to 800 thousand – for officials, from 800 thousand to 5 million or suspension of activities up to 90 days – for legal entities,"" the Duma said.

""We reject any attempt to suggest that children need to be protected from LGBTQI+ persons,"" the spokesperson said. ""Equating child abuse with LGBTQI+ persons is a generations-old tactic to dehumanize and further marginalize members of the LGBTQI+ community, and it is reprehensible.""

The spokesperson added that any expansion of Russia's ban would be ""yet another serious blow to freedom of expression and human rights in Russia and would disproportionately harm LGBTQI+ persons.""

""Vladmir Putin has demonized LGBTQI+ persons, and smeared policies and laws in other countries that protect their human rights,"" the spokesperson said.

87,Iran helps Russia employ multipurpose drones in Ukraine for 'maximum damage',"Iran's supply of drones to Russia for its war effort in Ukraine appears to have escalated in recent months after a study released this week found Tehran has modified its drones to employ maximum damage.

A January report by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) released publicly Thursday broke down why the affordably made Iranian Shahed-131 single-use drones have been employed to significant effect in Ukraine.

Russia has relied on Iranian-supplied unmanned areial vehicles (UAV) in Ukraine for months to help assist with its diminishing missile stockpiles as the war continues into its 11th month, according to the Pentagon.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES CLUSTER OF 13 IRANIAN-MADE DRONES AT KYIV IN SUSPECTED ENERGY ATTACK

Iranian drones have been used to hit civilian structures and target Ukraine’s critical infrastructure as Russia looks to bombard the war-torn nation in near-daily strikes.

One of the defining characteristics of the drone reviewed in the CAR report is the fact that it not only has a primary charge on the forward section of the warhead, but the body of the drone also contained 18 smaller ""shaped charges"" around the warhead that generates ""a secondary radial anti-armor effect.""

The warhead also had ""pre-serrated fragmentation matrixes"" on the forward and rear of the drone which consisted of 11 layers of fragmented cubes that are ""designed to generate an additional radial fragmentation effect for soft-skin targets.""

The fragmented matrixes are believed to be a later modification to the warhead, which were apparently crudely added as the ""fit, finish, alignment and quality"" were described as ""poor.""

IRAN MAY BE 'CONTRIBUTING TO WIDESPREAD WAR CRIMES' IN UKRAINE BY PROVIDING DRONES TO RUSSIA: WHITE HOUSE

But despite the lack of quality control, the multipurpose warheads are believed to have been ""designed specifically for attacks against large targets like energy infrastructure.""

CAR previously found that the Shahed drone can be fitted with other warheads intended for different targets and striking abilities.

A November 2022 CAR report found that other Shahed-136 UAV warheads had been reinforced with a 7-mm-thick steel casing which allowed it ""to penetrate structures before detonating.""

The varied warhead could also be fitted with a delayed fuse mechanism ""designed to initiate the main charge once inside the intended target.""

The findings come as Russia prepares for a major offensive in Ukraine and reports this week signaled Moscow and Tehran were moving forward with plans to develop drones in Russia.

Defense officials have become increasingly concerned by the expanding relationship between Russia and Iran, particularly as Moscow looks to shore up its defenses with other Western adversaries like North Korea and China.

""Witnessing the strengthening alliance between Russia and Iran, and the use of Iranian weapons by Russia to perpetrate war crimes in Ukraine, it should be clear to the world that Iran is a global disruptor and menace which doesn't only concern Israel or the Middle East,"" Brig.

88,Russia aims to boot former Soviet nations from NATO by relinquishing sovereign recognition: lawmaker,"A Russian lawmaker on Wednesday said Moscow will look to repeal its recognition of the independence of former Soviet nations like Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in an attempt to revoke their NATO protections.

State Duma deputy Yevgeny Fedorov told a Latvian news outlet that reversing Russia’s decision to recognize the Baltic States as sovereign would allegedly create legal grounds to force the alliance to divert to 1997 borders.

""The NATO Charter contains clause six, according to which the disputed territories cannot be included in the alliance. As soon as the territories of the Baltic countries are recognized as disputed, this will become the basis for the exclusion of the Baltic countries from NATO,"" Fedorov said.

UKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY SAYS ARMS URGENTLY NEEDED AS RUSSIAN SUPPLY DWINDLES, NATO PREPARES TO SEND MORE AID

Last week Fedorov introduced legislation targeting Lithuanian sovereignty and claimed it illegally left the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.

Lithuania became the first republic to announce it would restore its independence from the collapsing USSR in March 1990 after being under Soviet control since 1940.

Moscow, under President Mikhail Gorbachev, acknowledged Lithuania's sovereignty by September 1991.

Fedorov claimed that Lithuania was Russia’s first NATO target as it posed the greatest threat to Moscow and claimed it was ""NATO's gateway to the Baltics.""

But the Russian lawmaker also said that other former Soviet states could be next.

""The Commander-in-Chief determined that our ‘red lines’ run along the borders of NATO in 1997. This means that we need, at a minimum, to push NATO beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union,"" he said in reference to an era before eastern European nations were invited to join the alliance.

TOP RUSSIAN SECURITY OFFICIAL QUESTIONS WHETHER UKRAINE WILL 'EXIST ON THE MAP' IN 2 YEARS

Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all of which share borders with Russia or Belarus – which has been described as a Russian puppet state – joined the NATO alliance in 2004.

The only nations to join between 1997 and 2004 were Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and Russia has repeatedly called for the disarmament of these nations – a move NATO has flatly rejected.

""If countries do not pose a threat, then we will not change anything with them - there will still be peace and friendship,"" the state deputy claimed.

Fedorov threatened that should Russia decide to reverse its recognition of independent Baltic States then NATO should boot them from the alliance or accept that a ""Third World War will begin.""

NATO has not publicly commented on Russia’s potential move to repeal its recognition of Baltic States’ sovereignty.

But in an address Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg pledged to bolster security efforts within alliance and beyond.

""President Putin's goals goes beyond Ukraine, and that's the reason why we need to both provide support to Ukraine as we do, but also strengthen our deterrence and defense not least in the eastern part of the Alliance,"" he told reporters.

Despite Russia’s unveiled threats to NATO allies, experts told Fox News there was no chance Moscow would be able to dictate NATO membership.

""First, NATO would not ‘boot’ any nation out of the Alliance. NATO is the result of a treaty, the Washington Treaty, so the only way for a NATO member to leave the Alliance is by their own choice,"" Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO, Michael Ryan, said. ""Second, the United States never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union.

90,Iran helps Russia employ multipurpose drones in Ukraine for 'maximum damage',"Iran's supply of drones to Russia for its war effort in Ukraine appears to have escalated in recent months after a study released this week found Tehran has modified its drones to employ maximum damage.

A January report by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) released publicly Thursday broke down why the affordably made Iranian Shahed-131 single-use drones have been employed to significant effect in Ukraine.

Russia has relied on Iranian-supplied unmanned areial vehicles (UAV) in Ukraine for months to help assist with its diminishing missile stockpiles as the war continues into its 11th month, according to the Pentagon.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES CLUSTER OF 13 IRANIAN-MADE DRONES AT KYIV IN SUSPECTED ENERGY ATTACK

Iranian drones have been used to hit civilian structures and target Ukraine’s critical infrastructure as Russia looks to bombard the war-torn nation in near-daily strikes.

One of the defining characteristics of the drone reviewed in the CAR report is the fact that it not only has a primary charge on the forward section of the warhead, but the body of the drone also contained 18 smaller ""shaped charges"" around the warhead that generates ""a secondary radial anti-armor effect.""

The warhead also had ""pre-serrated fragmentation matrixes"" on the forward and rear of the drone which consisted of 11 layers of fragmented cubes that are ""designed to generate an additional radial fragmentation effect for soft-skin targets.""

The fragmented matrixes are believed to be a later modification to the warhead, which were apparently crudely added as the ""fit, finish, alignment and quality"" were described as ""poor.""

IRAN MAY BE 'CONTRIBUTING TO WIDESPREAD WAR CRIMES' IN UKRAINE BY PROVIDING DRONES TO RUSSIA: WHITE HOUSE

But despite the lack of quality control, the multipurpose warheads are believed to have been ""designed specifically for attacks against large targets like energy infrastructure.""

CAR previously found that the Shahed drone can be fitted with other warheads intended for different targets and striking abilities.

A November 2022 CAR report found that other Shahed-136 UAV warheads had been reinforced with a 7-mm-thick steel casing which allowed it ""to penetrate structures before detonating.""

The varied warhead could also be fitted with a delayed fuse mechanism ""designed to initiate the main charge once inside the intended target.""

The findings come as Russia prepares for a major offensive in Ukraine and reports this week signaled Moscow and Tehran were moving forward with plans to develop drones in Russia.

Defense officials have become increasingly concerned by the expanding relationship between Russia and Iran, particularly as Moscow looks to shore up its defenses with other Western adversaries like North Korea and China.

""Witnessing the strengthening alliance between Russia and Iran, and the use of Iranian weapons by Russia to perpetrate war crimes in Ukraine, it should be clear to the world that Iran is a global disruptor and menace which doesn't only concern Israel or the Middle East,"" Brig. Gen. (Res) Yossi Kupperwasser, a security expert and Senior Researcher at the Israel Defense Security Forum, told Fox News Digital. ""Iran should be treated as such and met with a unified front of Western powers, led by the U.S.""

RUSSIA ‘PREPARING FOR INVASION OF UKRAINE,’ NATO HEAD SAYS, AS WORLD FACES ‘NEW NORMAL IN EUROPEAN SECURITY’

Russia has amassed nearly 150,000 troops along its southwest border with Ukraine and conducted military drills over the weekend. Russia continues to claim that it has no intention of invading neighboring Ukraine, but President Biden said Friday that he is confident that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine.

The U.S. has threatened to hit Russia with sanctions – both on the state itself and against individuals, including President Vladimir Putin – should it proceed to invade Ukraine.

Robert L. Wilkie, former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness during the Trump administration and visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, previously told Fox News Digital that China would play a role in mitigating any U.S. sanctions placed on Russia in the event Vladimir Putin authorizes any military action in Ukraine.

""A lot of the talk about economic sanctions is really a pie in the sky because China is now Russia’s banker,"" Wilkie said. ""Xi Jinping will back Putin if sanctions from the West come.""

Wilkie focused his argument on Beijing increasing its purchase of oil from Russia, which already stands as the second-largest exporter of oil to China, but the energy market appeared the easiest path for China to provide economic relief to Moscow.

""[China] would start buying a lot more energy from Russia,"" Wilkie explained. ""If we went to move on the SWIFT loan system that gives Russia access to western capital, China would pick up the slack with that.""

""On the Ukraine issue, China always stands on the side of peace,"" Wenbin responded.

93,Putin ally recommends Russia use low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine,"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov on Saturday urged Moscow to consider deploying low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine after Russian forces retreated from the city of Lyman.

In a post shared on Telegram, Kadyrov said he believes ""more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.""

Kadyrov is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who appointed him to govern restive Chechnya in 2007.

The comments came after Russia lost its stronghold of Lyman in eastern Ukraine following a massive offensive from Ukraine.

UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIA WITHDRAWS TROOPS FROM LYMAN, STRATEGIC TOWN IN REGION PUTIN ANNEXED

Russia has the largest atomic arsenal in the world, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons designed for use against opposing armies.

Other top Putin allies, including former president Dmitry Medvedev, have floated the idea that Russia may need to use nuclear weapons, but Kadyrov's suggestion was the most explicit.

Putin said last week he was not bluffing when he vowed to use ""all available means"" to defend Russia's ""territorial integrity."" The U.S. has said it would respond decisively to any use of nuclear weapons and has threatened ""catastrophic consequences"" if Moscow were to deploy the weapons.

RUSSIA ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING HEAD OF UKRAINE NUCLEAR PLANT

Kadyrov has been a vocal supporter of the war against Ukraine, with Chechen forces forming part of the vanguard of the Russian army in the region.

The Chechen leader said in his post that Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, commander of the Russian forces fighting at Lyman, was a ""mediocrity."" Kadyrov suggested the commander should be demoted to private and have his medals taken away.

""Due to a lack of elementary military logistics, today we have abandoned several settlements and a large piece of territory,"" Kadyrov said.

Kadyrov said he had warned Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia's general staff, about the possibility of a defeat at Lyman two weeks ago but that Gerasimov had dismissed the idea.

94,Putin's thug army: Russia deploys soccer hooligans to Ukraine as war drags on,"Russia will deploy violent soccer fans, known as ""hooligans"" or ""ultras,"" to Ukraine in an effort to bolster troop numbers as the conflict enters its 11th month.

""What is very clear is that Putin will not end this war any time soon,"" Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital. ""He will use hooligans, prisoners, and any sort of thug to continue flowing fighters into Ukraine, to keep it from becoming part of NATO. The mission is this important.""

""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime view the outcome of this war as existential for Russia and for themselves personally,"" she added.

News broke last month that Putin had looked to recruit extremist Russian football fans to fight in Ukraine as part of the 106th Airborne Division and the Vostok battalion, The Daily Mail reported.

RUSSIA'S LAVROV FLAT-OUT REJECTS ZELENSKYY'S CONDITIONS FOR ‘PEACE FORMULA’

The unit, known as ""Espanola,"" includes recruits from club supporter groups including CSKA Moscow, Zenit St. Petersburg, Spartak Moscow and Lokomotiv Moscow, according to the Daily Mirror.

Stanislav ""Spaniard"" Orlov, a commanding officer of the hooligans, said that the death of one of their members in combat has already spurred the others to ""stay and fight,"" declaring, ""Our comrade died here, and now this is our place.""

""The combat part of the detachment are people who have military experience or have served in the army,"" Orlov explained to Russian news outlet Vechernyaya Moskva. ""After a short training course, they directly fight in the zone of the special operation. Russian fans form small infantry reconnaissance and assault groups or send them to sapper and engineering works.""

PUTIN LAUNCHES LATEST NUCLEAR SUBMARINE ‘EMPEROR ALEXANDER III’ AS PART OF NEW FLEET

""On the basis of the Vostok detachment, newcomers train to shoot automatic and large-caliber weapons, train in sapper work, conduct reconnaissance and combat drone flights, and hone tactical training from morning to evening,"" he added, stressing that there are ""not jokes"" among the group and that ""hundreds"" want to join the operation.

At the outset of the war, Putin drew on support from Chechen mercenaries, later trying - and failing - to recruit Syrian mercenaries and even prisoners to help bolster his forces as the war dragged on for months longer than Russian command had anticipated.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that while the department was ""not in a position to confirm these reports,"" it was ""another indication that Putin is scraping for additional personnel to throw into this fight – troops who will just be cannon fodder for his needless, brutal, and failing war of aggression. Rather than withdraw his troops and stop this needless loss of life, Putin has chosen time and again to escalate.""

In 2018, Putin said he would ban the hooligans in his country from attending games as the world watched Russia stage the 2018 World Cup. Now, he appears to have let the fans back into the fold to help boost his military’s numbers.

KYIV, LVIV WITHOUT POWER AFTER RUSSIA LAUNCHES ‘MASS’ AIR AND SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK ACROSS UKRAINE

The Russian fans famously attacked England supporters during the 2016 European Cup matches, with two men jailed after the hooligans allegedly ""mounted an urban guerilla offensive, like paramilitaries,"" the BBC reported.

Koffler explained that hooligans started leaving Russia for Ukraine when the government first started cracking down on violence at stadiums, but those fans turned up for Russia when Putin announced the partial mobilization in September.

""When Russia announced partial mobilization, founder of the All-Russian Association of Fans Andrey Malosolov announced in an interview with the radio station ‘Moscow Speaks’ that 500 of these football ultras formed a volunteer subdivision to go fight in Donbas,"" Koffler explained.

""Putin, who originally was looking to ban this movement when they were creating chaos at sports events, realized that he could put them to use as heavy attrition of Russian soldiers started setting in after months of grueling fighting,"" she said.

""The authorities directed these fighters to put aside their differences and varying allegiances and fight as a unified team for Mother Russia. This unit of what the Russians call ‘near-footballers’ come from different clubs … they have varying levels of experience with some having never being in combat,"" Koffler continued.

95,Obama's hashtag diplomacy with Russia sparks new criticism about weak foreign policy,"The Obama administration using Twitter to show public support for Ukraine and to negotiate with Russia after the annexation of Crimea is sparking another round of accusations about President Obama being soft on foreign policy.

The most recent criticism followed a tweet late Thursday by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

“The world stands #UnitedforUkraine. Let’s hope that the #Kremlin & @mfa Russia will live by the promise of hashtag,” she posted.

The tweet apparently was in response to Russia using the hashtag -- which essentially brings like-minded tweets into a collective batch -- to further its own agenda on social media.

“Note to the State Department: ‘The promise of a hashtag’ isn't going to make [Russian President] Putin pull out of Ukraine,” Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted Saturday.

Supporters of the administration using Twitter argue that social media is a fast, non-filtered way to connect with Ukrainians and others around the world, particularly amid the country's months of political unrest.

In February, Ukraine ousted Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, which was followed by Putin sending troops into eastern Ukraine and annexing the Crimea peninsula, arguing he had to protect his country's interests and ethnic Russians in the region.

The situation has continued to escalate with pro-Russian groups taking over government buildings and establishing roadblocks, which Western allies say has been inspired by Moscow operatives in the region. In addition, a recent United Nations-backed peace treaty was violated over Easter weekend with a fatal shooting attack at a checkpoint.

Former Arkansas Gov. and potential 2016 GOP president candidate Mike Huckabee on Saturday also criticized the Psaki tweet.

“The thought that somebody would come at him with 160 characters is absolutely terrifying to Vladimir Putin,” Huckabee, who also is a Fox News contributor, said mockingly.

The United States has imposed some sanctions on Russia. But on Friday, Obama and other Western leaders decide to wait on imposing additional ones.

""I think it's important for us not to anticipate that the targeted sanctions that we're applying now necessarily solve the problem,"" Obama said in a news conference in South Korea.

Criticism about Obama having a weak foreign policy strategy is not limited to conservatives.

New York Times critic David Brooks said this week on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Let's face it Obama whether deservedly or not does have a -- I'll say it crudely -- but a manhood problem in the Middle East.

“Is he tough enough to stand up to somebody like [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, somebody like Putin -- and I think a lot of the rap is unfair but certainly in the Middle East there is an assumption it's not tough enough.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-hashtag-diplomacy-with-russia-sparks-new-criticism-about-weak-foreign-policy,N/A

97,"Russia, Ukraine 'deepfake' video, audio are concerns for US intelligence","As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine and Russia, U.S. intelligence officials are on the watch for manipulated video and audio that could result in multiple cases of misinformation.

The FBI continues to wage a campaign against illegal deepfakes, as the technology continues to improve.

""Audio, video, text and images that are created to show something that didn't necessarily happen, or never occurred,"" FBI Cyber Division Unit Chief Pranav Shah said of deepfakes.

Shah tells Fox News the technology, once reserved for cyber wizards, is becoming more user-friendly. He says it is getting easier to make these digital deceptions, and they aren't always illegal. Several parodies of Tom Cruise and other actors exist online.

The FBI gets involved if the video violates any federal laws, like extortion or fraud. Shah gave Fox News an example of the voice of a company executive being manipulated.

""The same inflection. The same accent, and they make a phone call and you can ask the employee as the CEO, to wire that money.""

A similar situation happened in Hong Kong as part of an international heist that is still under investigation.

While the FBI won't specifically comment on deepfakes as part of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, other intelligence sources say they are on the lookout for altered videos of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key players.

98,"Zelenskyy warns Russia seeks truce to 'regain strength', calls on US, allies to enforce 10-step peace plan","Russia is seeking a ""short truce"" according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who warned Western leaders Saturday against believing that this could signify ""the war's end.""

""The end of the war does not guarantee peace. Russia is now looking for a short truce – a respite to regain strength,"" Zelenskyy said in an address at the 2022 Halifax International Security Forum ""Someone may call this the war's end. But such a respite will only worsen the situation.""

Zelenskyy comments show he is unwilling to stop fighting until his forces have fully removed invading troops from Ukrainian territory – including Crimea which has been occupied by Russia since 2014.

MILLEY URGES UKRAINE TO NEGOTIATE WITH RUSSIA, SAYING CHANCES OF TOTAL MILITARY VICTORY 'UNLIKELY'

It is unclear when or if Russia formally requested a ""short truce"" following several battlefield defeats as the winter months loom.

Top U.S. defense officials like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin suggested this week that wars during the winter generally slow down, historically speaking, which could provide Kyiv with an opportunity to enter into peace talks with Moscow.

But Zelenskyy has rejected previous calls for peace talks and has remained adamant that no such negotiations could exist until Russia’s invading forces leave Ukraine.

""Any voiced ideas of our land`s concessions or of our sovereignty cannot be called peace,"" he said Saturday. ""Immoral compromises will lead to new blood.""

""A truly real, long-lasting and honest peace can only be the result of the complete demolition of Russian aggression,"" he added.

Zelenskyy has outlined a 10-step ""peace formula"" which he urged Western leaders Saturday to help implement to permanently end the war.

The strategy not only calls on Russia to withdraw all troops from Ukraine and for a tribunal to address war crimes, but lists nuclear, food and energy security as chief items of importance.

Zelenskyy’s list also includes environment initiatives to restore destroyed lands and forestry, a prisoner swap, a return of those forcibly deported and a post-war security plan to prevent another attack from Russia.

""These are challenges which should be overcome for the sake of security of Ukraine, Europe and the world. This is the Peace Formula for the world,"" he said.

99,"Russia muted on Biden's Ukraine visit, mostly viewed as 'theatrics', expert","The Kremlin has yet to respond publicly to President Biden’s secret trip to Ukraine Monday as the war nears the one-year anniversary mark.

Russian media pushed the narrative that Biden would use his trip to start outlining a strategy for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, though the president did not allude to any suggestion that he and Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed peace plans.

Instead, Biden pledged ""another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments.""

BIDEN'S SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV WILL HAVE 'ZERO' IMPACT ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT, PUTIN EXPERT SAYS

He also said the U.S. will announce additional sanctions against ""elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia's war machine.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not comment on Biden’s trip but said Russian President Vladimir Putin was working on his address to the federal assembly scheduled for Tuesday, reported Russian media.

Russian expert and former Defense Intelligence Agency intel officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital that she does not believe Putin or his speech will be influenced by Biden’s visit to Ukraine.

ZELENSKYY: BIDEN’S SURPRISE VISIT ‘BRINGS US CLOSER’ TO VICTORY OVER RUSSIA

""Russia and Putin are not afraid of words, visits, and other showmanship. They view it as theatrics,"" she said. ""Putin does the same thing when he visits his counterparts in China, Iran, etc.""

Koffler said Putin ""may spin the visit"" as an attempt by Biden to convince Zelenskyy to forfeit the fight as expected spring time offensives near.

""Regardless, Putin will use the speech tomorrow to galvanize the Russian people for the war, to defend Russia from Western assault,"" she added. ""This has been Putin’s narrative – preparation for an all-out war against Western aggression.""

The White House did not comment on specific security details surrounding Biden's trip but said that ""basic communication with the Russians occurred to ensure deconfliction"" ahead of Biden’s visit.

Former Russian president and Moscow’s current Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev confirmed that Biden had ""received security guarantees"" ahead of his trip in a Telegram post Monday, but he did not say who had provided the assurances.

Speculation had been building for weeks whether the president may make a trip to Kyiv as leaders from his top alliances have on repeated occasions, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish President Andrzej Duda along with the U.K.’s former and current prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.
