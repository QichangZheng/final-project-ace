Country music icon Brad Paisley releases new song 'Same Here' featuring Ukraine President Zelenskyy,"Country music icon Brad Paisley released a new song Friday morning that compares the humanity of those in America with those fighting for their lives in Ukraine. It also features Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In the song, titled ""Same Here,"" Paisley compares the hopes, dreams, and fears of people living in both countries, because to him ""there’s just no differences.""

He also highlights that people in the U.S. and Ukraine alike watch the sunset, attend weddings, and worry about their families.

""However you talk, whatever you think, from the songs that you sing to the drink that you drink, if you miss your mama and worry 'bout your babies, and love each other like crazy, and want someone to share your hopes and fears, same here,"" the lyrics read.

Paisley also said in the song that both countries have their ""left coast clichés"" and they have residents that go to bars to ""buy each other beers and solve all the world's problems."" The lyrics continue, ""People cry when they're happy, same here.""

The three-time Grammy-winning country star told The Associated Press that he wrote the song after watching news broadcasts showing Russian troops invading Ukraine, saying he did not know the Ukrainian language but he could ""recognize the tears.""

He said he felt helpless at the images of people losing their homes and being forced to flee their comfort.

""You can put us in different places with different flags and different languages, but we have so many similarities,"" he continued. ""I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t sort of swing for the fence with things like this. For me, I’m happiest dealing with stuff as a songwriter that’s very true and very, very passionate. And sometimes I don’t know if you’d call it risky, but it’s more like it’s bigger than me.""

""The world felt like it was in a new place that it hadn’t been in decades,"" Paisley said.

The song does not explicitly mention Ukraine but includes a brief conversation with Zelenskyy, who Paisley introduces as ""a friend across the ocean.""

""He says our worlds are very different. Yeah, that's true, but I gotta say,"" Paisley adds. ""He's got his own kind of football team that lets him down every year, a wife he loves and a bunch of dreams for his country he holds so dear.""

He adds: ""He prays for peace and freedom. Same here.""

""Hi, Brad,"" Zelenskyy says in the song.

""Hello, Mr. President,"" Paisley responds.

In the song, Zelenskyy agrees their countries are similar in many ways: ""We speak different languages in our life. Yes, but I think we appreciate the same things - children, freedom, our flag, our soldiers, our people. The biggest treasure we have. And friends. And we're proud of our army who defends our freedom and will defend our lives.""

""There's no distance between our countries in such values. That is very important to see that they are really in many, in many things really the same,"" the Ukrainian president says in the song.

""Same Here"" is Paisley's first from his new record, ""Son of the Mountains,"" which will be released later this year.

Paisley co-wrote the song with Lee Thomas Miller (co-writer on Paisley hits ""The World"" and ""Perfect Storm"") and Dawes frontman Taylor Goldsmith.

Zelenskyy signed off on the song and suggested some changes to it, the country star said.

It was released on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

""We do deal with stuff going on in the world,"" Paisley added. ""How do you sing about things that are truly big — a big deal right now — that also don’t feel like maybe they’re the type of thing that you would be singing about typically? And yeah, on this album I have kind of really dug deep and tried to say something.""

He added: ""That’s where it gets really rewarding... feeling like maybe the heart of this helps paint the picture they want to paint.""

Sean Penn urges Biden to send modern fighter jets to Ukraine: 'Blood will be on our hands',"Sean Penn is doubling down on his call for the United States to supply Ukraine with modern fighter jets amid the country's war against Russia.

The 62-year-old actor, who first pressed the White House on Ukraine's need for jets last March, said President Joe Biden's surprise trip to Kyiv this week to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion was ""extremely encouraging."" However, he stressed that the U.S. continue sending military aid, including modern aircraft, to the war-torn nation.

""There’s no scenario where Ukraine loses this battle,"" the two-time Academy Award winner said told Politico in an interview that was published on Friday.

He continued, ""There’s a scenario where territory is taken, and Putin buys his way into fighting insurgents throughout a broken infrastructure of a broken country.""

SEAN PENN SPEAKS OUT ABOUT TIME IN UKRAINE, SAYS ZELENSKYY ‘WILL WIN, BUT AT WHAT COST’

""But the Ukrainians are going to fight till the last drop of blood. And that drop of blood will be on our hands if we don’t faithfully equip them.""

Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the ""Milk"" star took to Twitter to urge the U.S. and Polish governments to provide Ukraine with fighter jets.

""I JUST got off a call with President Zelensky’s Chief of staff, Andriy Yermak,"" he wrote on Mar. 9. ""Somewhere in the bureaucratic chain between our White House & the Polish Gov., the desperately NEEDED jets are not yet delivered to Ukraine. Public outcry may find the bottleneck.""

Poland had offered to give its entire fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. in exchange for a chance to buy American F-16s as part of a deal to bolster the Ukrainian air force while upgrading their own with NATO aircraft.

However, the Pentagon announced later that it would not support Poland's proposal, referring to the move as ""high-risk"" for escalating tensions with Russia.

The following month, Penn called for buyers from the private sector to spend $300 million to buy two squadrons of U.S.-made F-15 or F-16 fighter jets, adding, ""12 aircraft with better tech than Russian MiGs or SU’s [Sukhoi].""

""One billionaire could end this war in Ukraine,"" he wrote. ""Of course there are add-ons in arming & maintaining creative runways, etc, but seems worth a think.""

The actor has since deleted his Twitter account.

Penn has reiterated his calls for Ukraine to be supplied with more advanced aircraft during media interviews and in private conversations with members of Congress, Politico reported.

The ""Mystic River"" actor explained the fighter jets that the Ukrainians are currently using are insufficient to combat Russia's more advanced aircraft.

""The Ukrainians are flying without guided missile systems,"" he told Politico. ""So, they actually have to get a visual on the Russian MiGs to shoot them down.""

He continued, ""Whereas the Russian fighter jets can lock in, fire a guided missile from 100 kilometers out, then duck into safe airspace.""

The Biden administration has faced mounting pressure to provide Ukraine with modern fighter jets from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Last month, Biden told a White House reporter ""No"" when asked if he planned to send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets.

During his interview with Politico, Penn recalled being in Kyiv when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. He had a meeting with Zelenskyy the night before the invasion in which the president agreed to participate in Penn's documentary about the conflict, ""Superpower.""

""We went back to our hotel and closed our eyes for about two hours, and all of a sudden, the missiles and rockets were coming in,"" Penn remembered.

The actor remained in Ukraine for a few days to continue filming after Russia's invasion. According to Politico, he has returned to the country six times, including a November visit when he gave his Oscar statuette to Zelenskyy. His most recent visit took place last week when he screened ""Superpower,"" which premiered on Feb. 17, for Zelenskyy.

Penn told Politico that Zelenskyy was""clearly realistic"" about the likelihood that Russia would invade Ukraine during his first meeting with the president on Feb. 23.

However, Penn said that Zelenskyy ""could not possibly have known that he would so completely rise to the occasion of the actuality.""

""It was immediately clear when he walked into the room on February 24th that we were witnessing the newfound embodiment of an historic courage and leadership,"" Penn told the outlet. ""The resolve was in his eyes; Zelenskyy wasn’t going anywhere.""

Ukraine pastor remains amid war to bring God's hope to the suffering,"Preaching in a most desperate hour, while he could hear bombing in the distance, Sergey Nakul, pastor of Grace Reformed Church in Kyiv, Ukraine, delivered the only message he believes will keep people safe, no matter what.

""God is with me right now. God is with us … and He says, 'Don't be afraid, I am with you.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Ukraine has a vibrant faith community through a media outlet called The Far East Broadcasting Company, also known by its initials, FEBC.

Pastor Sergey is one of the hosts.

He shepherds Grace Church.

The pastor sent his wife and two sons, ages 16 and 6, further west, away from physical harm as Russia continues its bloody campaign against his country.

PASTOR RECALLS WORSHIPPING WITH CHRISTIANS IN UKRAINE

But Nakul stayed behind, bringing people a message that safety comes in more than one form.

""People are so open to right now, when they understand that their life could just end any moment — and nobody knows who is next.""

The pastor believes that Psalm 23 is being lived out in real time: ""Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.""

Together with a few members of his congregation, he is holed up in the basement of the church, now a bomb shelter. He ventures out to minister to people who did not or could not leave.

FAITH LEADERS SHARE OUTRAGE, INSIGHT AND PRAYERS FOR UKRAINE

He walks the streets of Kyiv taking pictures of the damage and talking with both soldiers and citizens to broadcast out to the world.

For him, the message of Psalm 23 is now being lived out in real time: ""Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.""

Nakul exhorts, ""The Lord is my shepherd. And if Jesus is my shepherd, if he is my pastor — I cannot imagine that my pastor could just leave me or run away.""

""Vladimir … repent. Repent of all of your evil deeds because you're not God.""

That is why he stays — to give comfort to those who may think that God and the world has abandoned them.

""I just cry with them. I just hug them, and I just hold them.""

He continued, ""I don't know all the answers, but what I know for sure [is] that God is with me, God is with them now … This is most precious. And this is most important.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin, by all accounts, ironically, sees himself as the defender of Christendom and the Orthodox Christianity.

But Sergey Nakul, who is spreading the message of the Gospel in the middle of artillery fire, has one message for Putin: ""Vladimir … repent.""

""Repent of all of your evil deeds,"" he adds, ""because you're not God.""

And Nakul also has a heartfelt message for the American people: ""I'm very proud of you and in both your prayers and about your support and for everything that you're doing.""

He also says about Americans: ""You're always fighters for freedom. You're in the nation [that] started as a nation of those who are fighting for freedom. So continue to do this.""

PRAYERS FOR UKRAINE

With Easter just a few weeks away, Pastor Sergey Nakul is reminded that death does not have the final say.

So he does not fear for his life.

And regardless of what happens — his faith assures him he will see his family again.

""We’re talking to the ministry of health,"" Graham said on Sunday morning.

""We have five field hospitals that we keep here in North Carolina ready for deployment and we’re getting one of those ready right now.""

Biden scoffs at East Palestine mayor who claimed he 'doesn't care' about town amid trip to Ukraine,"President Biden shrugged off criticism Friday over his handling of the toxic Ohio train derailment that has unfolded as a public safety concern for local residents.

During an interview with ABC News, Biden visibly scoffed at East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway's assertion that the president ""doesn't care"" about his town as Biden flew to war-torn Ukraine to show solidarity in its battle against Russia.

""Do you have any plan to travel to Ohio and have you talked with the mayor yet?"" ABC's David Muir asked.

""Let's put this in perspective,"" Biden responded. ""Within two hours of that derailment, the EPA was in there. Within two hours. Every major agency in the United States government that had anything to do with rail and or cleanup was there and is there. In addition to that, I've spoken at length to the congresspersons, the governors, the senators from both states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. And I've made it clear to them anything they need is available or we'll make it available to them.""

FALLOUT FROM TOXIC OHIO TRAIN CRASH COULD BE A PREVIEW OF 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

""Whatever happens here, we got to understand this the responsibility of the railroad company who's made, by the way, tens of billions of dollars in profits. Tens of billions of dollars of profits lately,"" Biden added.

""Do you plan to travel there and have you talked with the mayor?"" Muir asked again.

""I can't recall that - I don't think I've talked to the mayor,"" Biden responded. ""I've talked to everyone else there and, in multiple times, talked about the senators, but both governors, I've talked to everyone that there is to talk to. And we made it clear that everything is available.""

Ron DeSantis rips Biden's 'blank-check' Ukraine policy as US announces additional aid: 'Not acceptable',"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called out President Biden for his ""blank-check policy"" on Ukraine after the president traveled to Kyiv for an unannounced visit shortly before the one-year mark of Putin's assault.

DeSantis joined ""Fox & Friends"" Monday to discuss Biden's first visit to the war zone since the conflict started a year ago, and why the newly allocated half-billion dollars in Ukrainian aid is unacceptable without clearly defined goals.

""They have effectively a blank-check policy with no clear, strategic objective identified, and these things can escalate, and I don't think it's in our interests to be getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea,"" DeSantis said.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

""So I think it would behoove them to identify what is the strategic objective that they're trying to achieve, but just saying it's an open-ended blank check, that is not acceptable,"" he continued.

Biden met with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday to announce the additional U.S. aid.

It encompasses various military necessities including shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, and air surveillance radars.

Even though the additional assistance comes on the heels of billions of American tax dollars that have already funded Ukrainian efforts in recent months, the list does not include F-16s, which Zelenskyy has requested, or new advanced weaponry.

However, DeSantis argued the war may never have happened if Biden handled various transnational issues differently, notably the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the drug crisis fueled by an open southern border.

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

""I don't think any of this would have happened, but for the weakness that the president showed during his first year in office, culminating, of course, in the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan,"" DeSantis said. ""So I think while he's over there, I think I and many Americans are thinking to ourselves, okay, 'He's very concerned about those borders halfway around the world. He's not done anything to secure our own border here at home.' We've had millions and millions of people pour in, tens of thousands of Americans dead because of fentanyl, and then, of course, we just suffered a national humiliation of having China fly a spy balloon clear across the continental United States.""

""So we have a lot of problems accumulating here in our own country that he is neglecting,"" he continued.

Biden was previously scheduled to arrive in Poland on Monday per his public schedule, but instead, took a covert, 10-hour train ride to Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted during his visit to Ankara, Turkey, that there are growing concerns surrounding potential Chinese aid to Russia in the form of ""lethal assistance,"" and that could have a significant impact on U.S.-China relations.

His comments come on the heels of icy tension over Beijing's spy flight in American airspace.

""As President Biden said going back many months, when the aggression first took place, and he spoke to President Xi Jinping, he told him at that point that there would be real consequences in our own relationship were China to provide lethal assistance to Russia in this aggression against Ukraine,"" he said Monday.

Even as fears of a proxy war between Washington and Beijing loom, DeSantis noted that despite Putin's ongoing assault, the real threat to America does not originate from Moscow.

""The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all of that and steamrolling… that is not even come close to happening,"" DeSantis said. ""I think they've shown themselves to be a third-rate military power. I think they've suffered tremendous, tremendous losses.

""I got to think that the people in Russia are probably disapproving of what's going on,"" he continued.

""I don't think they can speak up about it for obvious reasons, so I think Russia has been really, really wounded here. And I don't think that they are the same threat to our country, even though they're hostile. I don't think they're on the same level as a China.""

According to the United Nations, more than 8 million Ukrainians have fled the country to other European countries since the war with Putin's invasion on Feb. 24 last year.

Trump's stance on ending Ukraine aid could box in DeSantis: WSJ columnist,"Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel condemned former President Trump’s foreign policy stances and warned GOP leaders like Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., against following his lead.

Strassel slammed political leaders’ lack of willingness to fund Ukraine’s war effort, suggesting it has put future presidential nominees at a geopolitical crossroad.

""Donald Trump’s early entry into the Republican primaries is already presenting his potential rivals with some tough choices,"" she wrote. ""Among the most consequential: Do they join the former president in forging a GOP surrender caucus?""

She harkened back to Trump’s proclamations that he would ""clean house of all the warmongers and America-Last globalists"" and his warning against starting ""WORLD WAR III,"" saying this risks the decades-long Republican brand of being the ""party of strong defense.""

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP,NEGLECTING EAST PALESTIME, SOUTHERN BORDER: ‘THEY CAN KEEP HIM!’

She went on to warn, ""Mr. Trump and a small group (at least for now) of congressional Republicans risk throwing all that hard-earned credibility away, neutralizing one of the party’s greatest strengths and leaving the country without a meaningful alternative to Mr. Biden’s weak multilateralism.""

Strassel then recounted how DeSantis had slammed having a ""blank check"" aid policy to Ukraine, but speculated this is not a firm policy commitment to isolationism.

""The temptation might be to follow Mr. Trump down this rabbit hole. Some will warn Mr. DeSantis that this is where Mr. Trump will hit him, framing him as a GOP pol who’ll drag the country into endless wars,"" she wrote. ""Some will note numbers showing Republican support for Ukraine aid (slightly) waning. Mr. DeSantis’s advisers will tell him he can’t be seen to be on the same side as Democrats.""

EAST PALESTINE, OHIO MAYOR ‘FURIOUS’ WITH BIDEN'S UKRAINE VISIT: ‘THAT WAS THE BIGGEST SLAP IN THE FACE’

Strassel warned that ""it would be a mistake for Mr. DeSantis to cast his lot with Mr. Trump,"" saying he would concede an important issue to Trump and lose an ""opportunity to contrast a bold, well-thought-out foreign policy"" with the former president’s ""opaque retreatism.""

""It would muddy Mr. DeSantis’s ability to otherwise take a tough line on the world’s rogues, including China. It would give Mr. Biden—who is already gunning for Mr. DeSantis—an easy attack line. And it would put the governor crosswise with most congressional Republicans, many of whom are rooting for him,"" she continued.

She offered her prediction of the world if such policy is emulated.

""Policy-wise, any presidential candidate needs to campaign as if he plans to win, and Mr. DeSantis might consider the world he’d inherit should Vladimir Putin prevail,"" she wrote. ""A victorious Russia wouldn’t stop with Ukraine. China would delight in America’s retreat from the world stage and rush to fill the gap. Iran would double down on a bomb and on exerting greater hegemony over the Middle East. Peace through weakness never works.""

Fox News Poll: Half say US should support Ukraine as long as it takes,"Friday marks the one-year anniversary since Russia invaded Ukraine and half of American voters say the U.S. should back the embattled nation for as long as it takes, according to a new Fox News survey.

The survey, released Thursday, asks what the timeframe should be for U.S. support in Ukraine: 50% think it should continue until Ukraine wins, while 46% think it should be time limited.

Democrats (66%) favor sticking with Ukraine until it’s victorious, while Republicans (61%) opt for a time limit on U.S. support. Independents split: 49% set limit vs. 45% as long as it takes.

On Monday, in the middle of the survey’s interviewing period, President Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv stating the U.S. would support Ukraine for ""as long as it takes."" Biden also announced an additional half-billion dollars in assistance which will include artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars.

A January Fox News survey found that two-thirds favored the U.S. continuing to support Ukraine both by sending weapons supplies and providing funding. Majorities of Democrats, Republicans, and independents agreed on lending help in both ways.

Voters sharply divide over Biden’s response to Russia’s invasion: 48% approve vs. 49% disapprove. That’s the highest his approval has been since the war started, the previous high was 45% in January and the lowest was 40% in August.

Since last August, Democrats (74% today vs. 68% in August), Republicans (24% vs. 19%), and independents (41% vs. 31%) have all increased their approval of Biden on Ukraine.

"Biden’s weakness emboldened Putin’s Ukraine invasion. One year later, we’re more at risk","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his bloody invasion of Ukraine. While Putin clearly expected the war to be over in a matter of months, the bravery and fortitude of the Ukrainian people continue to frustrate and deny the Russian dictator even today. As we mark this auspicious anniversary and prepare for the second year of war, it is essential that we assess how this conflict began, its impact on the American people, and what it will take to end it.

Sadly, the Biden administration doesn’t seem serious about achieving a real victory and deterring America’s adversaries as it has been too slow in delivering the means necessary to deter or defeat them.

This war was far from inevitable. We cannot say for certain that it would not have happened had the Trump administration been in office, but I can say this: It didn’t happen on our watch.

UKRAINE WINNERS AND LOSERS: CHINA MAKES GAINS, BUT WHERE DO OTHER COUNTRIES STAND?

We knew it was Putin’s aim to establish Russian dominance over all the old Soviet bloc countries, including in Ukraine (as well as all of Eastern Europe). We prevented invasion by establishing deterrence: we kept the Nord Stream II pipeline from being completed, we withheld talks on a new START treaty, and we worked with our partners in NATO to increase defense spending and present a greater potential response to any act of Russian aggression.

We also supplied Ukraine with the tools it needed to deter an invasion and counter the Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. We knew Putin’s objectives, and we took the steps necessary to deny him any room to achieve them.

We also were consistent – just as we deterred Putin, we imposed costs on anyone who threatened to harm or undermine our interests. Putin saw how we approached Iran, North Korea and China, and knew that threatening our interests was met with a real and costly response.

What changed? It certainly was not Putin. We should remember that the same man who ordered the invasion of Ukraine one year ago also ‘annexed’ Crimea during the Obama administration.

Then as now, Putin saw weakness in President Joe Biden’s leadership. He watched Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost 13 brave Americans their lives, with no reprisal or costs imposed on those responsible. He took note when Biden said that a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would be permissible even as Russian forces massed on Ukraine’s border, as well as Biden’s failure to impose costs on Russia following the hacking of American pipelines.

The deterrence we created during the Trump administration was lost due to Biden’s weakness. And Biden’s failure to protect American sovereignty at our southern border sent a signal that no border is to be respected. Putin didn’t change; American leadership changed, and that opened the door to the invasion of Ukraine.

Biden’s weakness and this war have had real consequences for the American people. Energy prices were pushed higher once the invasion began after Biden had already driven them up by killing America’s energy dominance, leading to the persistent inflation that continues to crush American families. Global supply chains and food markets have also been upset by the war, which has greatly affected American businesses and farmers.

Failing to defeat the Russians in Ukraine may only lead to a growing conflict in Europe and further harm our deterrence in Asia or the Middle East. The Ukrainians are fighting this war without U.S. troops, but that would not be the case should the Russians achieve victory in Ukraine and move on to a NATO country. Biden’s failure to put the American people first economically and in preserving our security has cost us here at home and around the globe.

Sadly, Biden continues to allow the war to proceed on Putin’s terms, choosing to ""lead from behind"" rather than leading a response that will bring the war to an end. Even having passed massive defense spending packages centered around military aid to Ukraine, this administration continues to send our aid piecemeal.

That is not to say that the rest of Europe shouldn’t do more – they should. And Ukraine hasn’t asked for our men and women in uniform to fight for them, nor should we provide such assistance. They are only asking for the equipment to fight their own battle, but Biden isn’t responding nearly fast enough to force Putin to reconsider his objectives.

His recent pledge to send American Abrams tanks is a clear example: Rather than be taken from the tanks already stationed in Europe, we are going to build 30 new tanks and ship them there. This process will take months, if not an entire year.

It will do nothing to actually deter Putin – it will only assure him that our aid will not be rapid or concentrated enough to give the Ukrainian military a decisive advantage. This timidity and weakness encourages Putin that America and its NATO allies are not serious about deterring him.

It is essential that the Biden administration change its approach, not just to achieve a favorable outcome in Ukraine, but to establish our deterrence with adversaries beyond Russia. This weakness will only embolden the bad guys.

Vladimir Putin was watching Biden’s botched withdrawal in Afghanistan, but so was Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. Xi is now contemplating assisting the Russians with lethal aid, a move that will only intensify the conflict and inflict further death and destruction on the Ukrainian people.

The CCP spy balloon that was allowed to traverse the entire United States for a week is evidence enough that Xi feels more emboldened than ever, and respects U.S. leadership as little as ever. Xi is now watching how we approach Ukraine with an eye towards Taiwan, and a slow, weak, and feckless response in Ukraine greatly increases the risk that Xi will feel emboldened to move against the island nation. The consequences of such a move for the American people would dwarf those of the war in Ukraine.

Biden visited Kyiv this week and proclaimed that ""Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you."" This is all well and good, but we should never forget that warm words and triumphant photo-ops are not a replacement for real deterrence and assistance.

If we do not back up our words with action, we will do little to convince our adversaries that there are costs for attacking U.S. interests. Indeed, we will only reinforce the impression of American weakness held by the likes of Putin, Xi, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and North Korea’s Chairman Kim Jong Un.

Tucker Carlson: What happens to our troops in Ukraine if Russia invades?,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Joe Biden, you may recall, spent a lot of his time as vice president meddling in the internal affairs of Ukraine. And you may wonder, why Ukraine as opposed to say, Denmark or Senegal or any of the world's other 195 countries. Simple. Because the Ukrainians were paying Joe Biden's family a million dollars a year in exchange for the work that he did. And as president, you may have noticed, Biden has continued to represent Ukrainian interests. Most recently in their dispute with Russia.

Biden talks constantly about all the scary things he'll do if embattled Vladimir Putin dares to offend the territorial sovereignty of Biden's close friends, the Ukrainians. But one thing Joe Biden will not do, he has assured us repeatedly, is send American troops to Ukraine. Polls show Americans do not want that at all and Biden claims he's heard the message.

BIDEN WARNS NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE WILL NOT BE OPERATIONAL IF RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE

BIDEN: This would be the largest, if he were to move in, with all those forces would be the largest invasion since World War II. It would change the world.

REPORTER: What about military consequences?

BIDEN: There's not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine.

There are not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine. That's what Joe Biden told us, and it's reassuring to hear that. But wait. It's not true. It's yet another lie from the mannequin, in case you're still bothering to keep track of them all. Fox News has just learned that there are already more than 300 American troops in Ukraine. Now, Joe Biden is calling them ""military advisers,"" just like we did back in Vietnam. Troops, advisers, it's really a distinction without a difference.

Just last week, we were told there are only 150 American troops in Ukraine. As far as we know, the force has more than doubled in recent days, and that's assuming the new number is even real. And by the way, why would we assume that number is real? These people lie about everything. The truth is, we have no idea how many American troops are in Ukraine right now; only that the total is a lot more than they said it was because again, they lie all the time.

So here's the question. There are American troops in Ukraine. What's going to happen to these troops if and when the Russians invade? The Pentagon says there are no plans to pull these troops out. And so that means that very soon, American soldiers could be fighting Russian soldiers, which sounds to our civilian ears very much like the definition of war with Russia. Are you ready for war with Russia? Has anyone asked for your consent or even your opinion on war with Russia? No. That's democracy.

Top 5 reasons America must support Ukraine and help it defeat Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The Congress is considering an end-of-year spending bill containing billions in new military aid to Ukraine. Is additional support to Ukraine in the interests of the U.S.?

First, consider Russia’s actions. Russia has long been a geo-strategic foe of the United States, and its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine is only the latest in a series of actions hostile to American security and international peace. Russia invaded its neighbors in 2008 and 2014, threatened the stability of NATO Allies, interfered in U.S. politics, destabilized the Middle East through interventions in Syria and Libya, cheated on arms control agreements, used chemical weapons against dissidents and defectors, and sponsored cyber-attacks against the U.S. and other NATO allies.

Second, consider Russia’s so-called ""friends."" Through his alliances with China, Syria and Iran, Russian President Vladimir Putin has defined Russia as an adversary to the U.S. An unchecked Putin will continue to escalate tensions and further harm the national and economic security of the U.S. and its allies -including by threatening to use nuclear weapons.

US CONSIDERS SENDING PATRIOT MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM TO UKRAINE

But after almost 10 months of hard ground fighting and with financial and materiel support from the U.S. and Europe, Ukraine is winning its fight against Putin. Ukraine’s bravery and America’s public support have thereby strengthened U.S. national and economic security in at least five ways:

1. Ukraine keeps the war from spreading

World wars start in Europe and the Russian Army rolling westward is a clear and present danger to the U.S. and its NATO allies. The restoration of peace depends on Ukraine pushing the Russians back into their territory. Because our support would allow Ukraine to finish the job, we would prevent a larger European conflict that would drag the U.S. into a world war.

2. Ukraine is degrading a hostile Russia

The Ukrainians are bleeding Russia of manpower and materiel. Take some rough math. In FY22, $730 billion was appropriated for Defense. The U.S. has spent $19.3 billion since the invasion on weapons for the Ukrainians. That is the equivalent to approximately 2.6% of what we are spending annually on defense. 2.6% is a reasonable investment considering that the Ukrainians are significantly degrading the capability of what the U.S. National Defense Strategy calls an ""acute"" threat. A Russia with diminished war-making capability gives our European allies time to build their forces to meet their NATO obligations, a longstanding U.S. goal. It also allows the US to shift its resources to the Pacific to protect our economic interests and to deter China from invading Taiwan.

3. Ukrainian success helps restore economic vitality

The Russian-Ukrainian War has hurt the European and U.S. economies. It has caused spikes in oil prices. By withholding natural gas transfers to Europe, Putin has weaponized energy to pressure Europe to push Ukraine into early peace talks. Europe is a large economic power; the deeper the European economy goes into recession, the more negatively it will affect the U.S. economy. A Russian win could mean higher energy and food prices for Europe and the U.S. The best way to strengthen the global economy would be to hasten a Ukrainian victory.

4. A victorious Ukraine helps the U.S. competition with China

A Chinese takeover of Taiwan would be an economic calamity for the U.S. and an unrecoverable blow to U.S. power and influence. Taiwan would give China greater market power and proximity to the sea’s busiest lanes of international commerce, enhanced clout to dominate Asia. But China is watching everything that happens in Ukraine.

If Ukraine stalls for lack of military assistance and is forced into early negotiations, China may conclude the west did not have the stomach to hang in long enough for Ukraine to defeat Russia. However, if the U.S. and its allies show resolve and Ukraine is successful in pushing back the Russians, China will think twice before invading Taiwan.

Transferring weapons to the Ukrainians need not be at the expense of building up U.S. forces in Asia to deter China. First, Congress should fund the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and other budget requests for the Asian theater. Second, Congress should force the Pentagon to be very clear about tradeoffs between Europe and Asia. This would enable the Congress to better allocate funding for scare weapons systems and munitions. Congress should also undertake urgent measures to grow an enhanced industrial base that can contend with a dangerous Russia and a growing China. Also, Congress should consider that Ukrainian success would deal a defeat to China.

According to the U.S. intelligence community, China and Russia are ""more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s."" A loss for Russia is a loss for China. We need allies in Asia to stand with us against China. If we abandon Ukraine, our would-be Asian allies will conclude we cannot be trusted.

5. A Ukrainian Victory Promotes American Values

Russia’s predatory behavior is a threat to the U.S. because Russia seeks, with its ally China, to destroy the U.S.-led post World War II international system built on freedom, economic openness, and democracy.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

A successful Ukrainian campaign would be a triumph of our values over those of countries that brutalize their populations, repress human rights, and threaten peace and security by fantasizing about lost glory. A Ukrainian victory promotes western values of freedom, sovereignty, territorial integrity and international recognized borders, the fundamentals of peace and security.

Ukrainian battlefield success has advanced U.S. vital interests. The Ukrainians have the Russians on the run and need more time and arms to finish the job. Congress should stand firm against Putin by approving additional military aid.

American taxpayers have been generous with Ukraine, and as we ask more of them, Republicans should conduct vigorous oversight to ensure the money is spent responsibly. Republicans have rightly been deeply skeptical of President Joe Biden’s conduct of foreign affairs since the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and need to be assured that the Biden administration has a plan beyond weapons transfers.

Congress should press the secretaries of State and Defense for their strategy — and insist that they come to Capitol Hill often to defend it. Republicans should pursue a detailed accounting of the administration’s spending but additional support will allow Ukraine to maintain its momentum and show that the democratic West has toughness and resolve in the face of geopolitical foes.

TUCKER CARLSON: There is no limit to the war in Ukraine,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

There is a poignant, but recognizable thing that happens to powerful men as they decline. They get bursts of irrational energy. An 85-year-old tycoon marries a stripper. On the face of it, the marriage does not make sense. Everybody groans. How is this arrangement going to work out for him really? How about for his children?

The tycoon doesn't care. He isn't thinking long term. He's reacting against what he feels inside, which is the steady loss of his power as a man. The faster that power recedes, the more frantically he asserts it. He is raging against the dying of the light. These last embarrassing decisions are, in fact, his death throes. It's sad, really.

Unfortunately, what happens to men also tends to happen to the systems they create. For the last 80 years, our world has been governed by a system formed in the final months of World War II. Its features define our life: free and open global trade routes guaranteed by the U.S. Navy, a universal currency called the dollar and overseeing it all, one supreme power, the world's largest economy, the United States of America.

ENERGY EXPERTS BASH KAMALA HARRIS OVER DUBIOUS ENERGY PRICE CLAIM: 'COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH'

It's been a great system in most ways, but for many reasons, including the passage of time, that system is dying. What comes next is not entirely clear, but how to influence it to America's greatest possible advantage is the most important task that faces any U.S. government. Nothing else comes close to that.

Sadly, the Biden administration, geriatric and irrational in its best moments, is not up to that task. No one in the White House even seems aware that the architecture of the world is changing. They call themselves progressives, but the Biden people think it's 1961 when American power seemed unlimited. Just today, our elderly Treasury secretary scolded the Chinese government like a tardy servant. Shape up, China. We’ll send you back to the cellar. Watch this.

JANET YELLEN: We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us, and we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdiction about what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences they would face for violating them.

We're going to tell them what the rules are. Once they hear the rules, they'll obey. Janet Yellen seems shocked and outraged that China has decided to align with Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine. It's an outrage. It's unbelievable. Who could have seen this coming? Well, almost everybody, actually. It was obvious to the world it was going to happen because it was always going to happen if we didn't force a peace in Ukraine.

But somehow the Biden administration didn't see this coming. Now that it has happened, now that the world's largest country has joined with the world's largest economy, which also has the world's largest population, in order to fight a war against us, what do we do? Well, if you're Janet Yellen, you just order them to stop. Stop it, you naughty Chinese, stop it. Otherwise, we will impose some serious consequences on you. We can't tell you what they are, but trust us, they are serious. They might even include further statements of outrage. So, shape up Chinese people.

Pretty amazing to watch, a lady who's never been in a fistfight ordering the Chinese military around like she owns it. You can imagine the laughter in Beijing tonight. Next, we'll have Admiral Rachel Levine wagging his perky finger at Chairman Xi. Surrender your arms, China, because transwomen are women. It's all pretty amusing until you realize it's real. Caught in the middle of a historic global pivot and one of those rare moments when everything changes forever, the Biden administration has decided to live in the past and to pretend that the United States is still capable of imposing unilateral decisions on the rest of the world because we said so. Here's Joe Biden once again playing Churchill to Putin's Hitler.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for as long as it takes and that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President. For as long as it takes.

JOHN KIRBY: As the president has said, and we're going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.

KAMALA HARRIS: Again, the United States will continue to strongly support Ukraine, and we will do so for as long as it takes.

YELLEN: As President Biden has said, we will stand with Ukraine in its fight for as long as it takes.

CHINA BLAMES US GUN POLICIES FOR GLOBAL VIOLENCE, SAYS AMERICA EXPORTS ‘WOES AND INSTABILITY’

Silly, ineffectual buffoons. The world is laughing, the adults are laughing. and in this country it's a measure of our media's total corruption that no one ever asks anyone in the Biden administration what the United States is hoping to accomplish in Ukraine. As long as it takes to do what exactly?

Now, the original answer was, well, to push Russia back to where it was a year ago before it invaded Ukraine and that seemed like a reasonable and measurable objective. The public seemed behind that. Then, without fanfare or even official notice, the goal changed and became taking the Russian port of Crimea just because it would be nice to have that. Always, wanted it. Why not take it now?

Then the goal became overthrowing Putin and putting American tanks in Red Square because sure, we could manage Russia once we overthrow the dictator. We're good at that. We did it in Iraq. We did it in Libya. Now the objective appears to be winning World War III against both Russia and China, a war that would, by definition, include the use of nuclear weapons and the deaths by incineration of hundreds of millions of people.

At this point, there is no limit to the war in Ukraine. It is all that matters. The war in Ukraine is the focus of the entire U.S. government, all branches, both parties. It is also, as our own economy degrades as huge companies lay off thousands, the war in Ukraine is one of our main expenses. Here's Janet Yellen to explain.

YELLEN: Our economic assistance is making Ukraine's resistance possible by supporting the home front, funding critical public services and helping keep the government running. In the coming months, we expect to provide around $10 billion in additional economic support for Ukraine.

OK, so just to be clear, in case you weren't listening carefully, and it's hard to understand what she's saying, but we have the transcript, that's not 10 billion more in war aid. That's to fund critical services in the government, which is Zelenskyy's political party, which has banned a Christian denomination and arrested priests. That's what we're paying for. And leaving aside the aims, that's still $10 billion more in tax dollars. That's on top of the $113 billion that Congress has already approved. That's $123 billion pledged to Ukraine in a year. And then when you add a thousand other off the book sources of aid, the entire intel world, you're looking at perhaps $200 billion to Zelenskyy and his wife in 12 months. $200 billion! It's truly crazy. How much money is that?

US STATE DEPARTMENT HINTS AT 'CONSEQUENCES' IF CHINA PROVIDES LETHAL AID TO RUSSIA FOR UKRAINE WAR

Well, to make it easier, let's pretend we'd only spent 100 billion in Ukraine so far. We know we have. What can we do with $100 billion here in the United States. For one thing, and this is kind of in the news recently, we could modernize our rail system to avoid the thousand derailments we have every year and the mushroom clouds over Ohio that sometimes result from them. $100 billion is more than five times the entire discretionary budget of the Department of Transportation. There's just 13 billion in the DOT's budget for transit and less than $3 billion for Amtrak. Remember that? The artery that connects the cities on the East Coast. Then there's the FAA. That's the government agency that sought to prevent planes from crashing into each other and killing hundreds of Americans.

The FAA got $20 billion in the last budget. $20 billion! So given that planes seem to be coming very close to hitting each other lately, it might be worth funding the FAA a little more. Oh, but no Zelenskyy's political party needs it.

And then, of course, with that money, we could do things that matter long term, like building a wall along our southern border. We could build four of them for that. That would save, in addition to a lot of other things, hundreds of thousands of American lives by blocking drug traffickers from entering the country, and then you wouldn't have a cartel war in Texas and Arizona, which we're absolutely going to get.

With $100 billion, we could pay off half the medical debt in the entire country. We could pay for two years of community college tuition for every young person in the United States. We could fund all out-of-pocket expenses for cancer patients for five years. That's a lot of money. We could do a lot with it. Why isn't Bernie Sanders doing the math on this? Why isn't he even talking about it? Why is it left to some right-wing TV show to figure out what could be done with that money domestically? Bernie Sanders is all for saying that money to Ukraine and it turns out most so-called progressives are.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Sandy Cortez, voice of the people, she's for it, too. It's fascinating. Of course, we could also keep the money. That'd be useful. We need it. Our national debt is now over $31 trillion. It's bigger than our GDP. Our debt is bigger than our GDP. In just the last 27 months, the Biden administration has increased the national debt by $7 trillion. How much is that? I mean, it's an incomprehensible number, but here's the context. It took 215 years from George Washington to George W. Bush to accrue that much debt.

Interest payments on that debt have hit more than $400 billion this year. So, according to calculations by Pew, that's $100 billion more per year than we spent on elementary and secondary education, disaster relief, agriculture and environmental protection combined. Within the next decade, interest costs on the debt will be greater than spending on national defense and Medicaid. Within 30 years interest payments will be the single largest expenditure in the entire federal budget, bigger than Social Security. And a lot of that debt, you should know well over a trillion dollars is owned by China, the country we're now fighting in Ukraine.

You see how this works? Most Americans do see how it works and they oppose it. They're afraid of it. They should be. Polls show clearly they oppose it, but here's the interesting thing. Neither party in Washington cares what their voters think. Here, for example, is Republican Michael McCaul. He is the Republican Party's head foreign policy genius in the House, a man completely controlled by the intel agencies, but here he is on television explaining that in a democracy, it doesn't matter what voters think.

KAMALA HARRIS DISMISSES UNPOPULARITY AMONG DEMOCRATS AHEAD OF 2024: 'POLITICAL CHATTER'

PAMELA BROWN: And a new poll is showing support among Americans for arming Ukraine is dropping. How concerned, Congressman McCaul, are foreign leaders you're speaking to that American support for Ukraine, particularly within your own party, is weakening?

REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: I would say that support is still very strong and this delegation, this bipartisan, very strong support for Ukraine, I think we're you're seeing a split from the administration, though and I have to say, this is bipartisan as well, is that for the past year, we've been very slow in getting these weapons in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be stingers, javelins, these short range artillery, now longer range artillery attack ATACMS they can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea and also aviation like F-16. If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different.

You'll notice that whenever there's a bipartisan consensus on something in Washington, it's a bad idea. Usually, it's the worst idea. There's no bipartisan consensus on saving middle class America or rescuing rural Americans from fentanyl. There's no bipartisan consensus on that. Nobody cares. The bipartisan consensus is that we should send the contents of the U.S. Treasury to a corrupt Eastern European country to facilitate World War III

And why is that? Well, the truth is, Washington is so dysfunctional that funding a war, destroying things is like the one thing they can do. And that's why they love it so much, because they can get something done. Of course, it's purely destructive.

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

So, we wanted to talk to Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas, the foreign policy genius, more about this. You don't care what your voters think, really? So, we asked to come on tonight. Why do you support a war that your constituents oppose? How does this benefit the United States? Were you proud that you helped Russia and China align in a bloc that's more powerful than the United States? Is that good for us? How does that work, Congressman?

He can't make it, unfortunately. Congressman Mike Turner can't come either. He represents Ohio. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah didn't respond at all. Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell were, of course, hard no's. No way. We're not going to answer questions. Shut up, we'll do CNN first.

You should know that everyone we just mentioned is a Republican. They can't defend this, of course. Only a very tiny number of Republicans voted to stop this insanity before it destroys the economy of the United States and triggers World War III, and they've been punished for it. And a lot of Republicans care because on MSNBC, if you're against World War III, you're an agent of Putin. Watch.

TUCKER CARLSON: The point of the Ukraine war is regime change in Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

This week marks the seven-month anniversary of the beginning of the war in Ukraine , something that is still going on and isn't talked about quite as much anymore. The day that war began, which was February 24, two things were very obvious. The first was that there was no way the Ukrainian army would be able to win a decisive military victory over Russia and the reason was simple. Russia is too big. Ukraine is too small. The Russian military is many times the size of the Ukrainian military. Plus, of course, it has nuclear weapons.

Russia itself is the largest country on planet Earth. It's got a relatively huge economy for the region and it's got 145 million people who live there. Ukraine has a population of about 40 million. It's the poorest country in Europe. It's got an average annual income that is much lower than Albania's.

So, just by looking at the most basic Wikipedia level numbers, it was clear right away that if Ukraine wanted to remain a sovereign country and of course, all of us wanted that for Ukraine, Ukraine was going to have to reach some kind of negotiated settlement with Russia. Pitched battles were not going to do it. Now, that's not a moral judgment. You can root for the Ukrainian military all you want, but it's still a fact and there's no getting around it.

The second thing that was immediately evident about this war was how unusually destructive it was and was going to be. It wasn't just Ukraine that was getting pummeled, though it certainly was. It was the entire Western economy, including our economy. Russian energy fuels Europe. A recession in Germany was certain to lead to a recession here and in the months since, it has, a bad one. The longer this war goes on, inevitably the poorer everyone is going to be, with the exception probably of Vladimir Putin.

PUTIN INITIATES CONSCRIPTION TO BOLSTER MILITARY INVASION AS UKRAINE MOUNTS COUNTEROFFENSIVE

We are breaking things that are very hard to rebuild. Again, this was very obvious the first day of the war. You weren't allowed to say it at the time. Anyone who did was denounced as a Russian spy. But it was still clearly true and the Ukrainians certainly understood it. Back in April, according to an account in Foreign Policy magazine, negotiators from the governments of Russia and Ukraine met secretly and ""appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement to end the war.""

The terms of the deal were simple. Russia would withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Ukraine would promise not to join NATO, so each side would get the thing that it wants most simple and effective, and it might have worked.

But the Biden administration adamantly opposed this settlement. Biden's advisers didn't just want the Russians to leave Ukraine. That's what they told us they wanted on television, but no. Biden's advisers wanted a total regime change war against Russia, apparently to avenge the election of Donald Trump, which they believed Putin was responsible for, and they were willing to fight to the last Ukrainian to get it.

On April 9 of this year, the White House dispatched its hapless cutout, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian news media, Johnson communicated two messages to the Zelenskyy government, ""The first is that Putin is a war criminal. He should be pressured, not negotiated with and the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, the West is not.""

In other words, who cares what the Ukrainians want. America and the U.K. demand total war with Russia, regime change war with Russia and of course, the Ukrainians caught in the middle had no choice but to concede. So, days later, the peace negotiations fell apart. This was virtually unreported at the time, but it was the turning point in the war in Ukraine. This was the moment where the goal changed from restoring Ukraine to what it was before the invasion – and that seems reasonable to everyone in the West – to something very different, to a war designed to topple Vladimir Putin, just like we toppled Saddam Hussein and then hoping for the best afterward. That is clearly insane and dangerous, but that's where we are and from that point on, everything changed and that is how we got to where we are today, which is the closest we have ever been to nuclear conflict in history.

REP. WALTZ URGES BIDEN TO BE TOUGH ON 'WAR CRIMINAL' PUTIN AS UKRAINE WAR RAGES ON: 'RHETORIC MATTERS A LOT'

This week, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine gave an interview to the left-wing newspaper, The Guardian and in it, he casually called for the United States to nuke Vladimir Putin. ""The other nuclear states need to say very firmly that as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes on foreign territory, in this case the territory of Ukraine, there will be swift retaliatory nuclear strikes to destroy the nuclear launch sites in Russia."" Parse that, and we're quoting, ""as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes"" – meaning before Russia actually launches missiles – ""the U.S. needs to launch nuclear weapons against Russia."" In other words, we need to launch nuclear weapons now. Why now and how do we know that's what Zelenskyy meant? Because the Zelenskyy was responding to this warning from the Russian government on Wednesday.

PUTIN: I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and for separate components, more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use means at our disposal. It's not a bluff.

""It's not a bluff,"" says Putin, who we are told is insane, so we probably should take it seriously. He is, after all, running a country with the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet and he's talking about using nuclear weapons if the West continues to threaten Russia's territorial integrity. It's a conditional warning and, of course, threatening Russia's territorial integrity was never part of the deal. Right? You remember this? It's why you wore a Ukrainian lapel pin or put a Ukrainian flag in front of your house. Ukraine was invaded. The point was to kick the Russians out. That seems reasonable by any standard of fairness and decency, but that's not what the Biden administration is pushing for. They're pushing for toppling the government of Russia and once again, hoping that everything will be fine after that, someone better will somehow take over. ""He's bad. Let's kill him.""

In response to what Putin just said, Ukraine's government called for an immediate nuclear attack on Russia, an attack that would without question result in the immediate destruction of New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, the deaths of tens of millions of Americans. That's what he just said. Sane people do not talk this way, ever. If there was a moment for the Biden administration to shut this whole thing down and force negotiated peace, which they could do in an instant, that moment is right now before huge numbers of people die, but that's not what the Biden administration is doing. They are moving in the other direction at high speed and doing all they can to bring the West to the brink of destruction.

At the U.N. yesterday, Joe Biden accused Russia, not Ukraine, of making overt nuclear threats. Watch.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: This war is about extinguishing Ukraine's right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine's right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not, that should make your blood run cold. President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the nonproliferation regime. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia's aggression. Period.

OK. Putin is bad. Fine. Agree, but Putin is making nuclear threats. Whatever the reason, he is making them, the fact he is making them and the Ukrainians, of course, are also making explicit nuclear threats, is enough for any responsible person to say, ""now we stop,"" especially if that person is the leader of the United States, the country which is funding this war and that could end this war tonight by calling Ukraine to the table. Russian troops leave. Ukraine promises not to join NATO, everything is as it was in January of this year, and everything's fine. We don't have to worry about New York getting nuked.

But that's not what they want. So, Joe Biden didn't say a word about America's responsibility here. Again, we are funding this war. We could end it. They're choosing not to. He didn't say a word about that at the United Nations, of course, because they want war and neither did Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Watch.

SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN: President Putin picked this week as most of the world gathers at the United Nations to add fuel to the fire that he started. Shows his utter contempt for the U.N. Charter, for the General Assembly and for this council. The very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes. We cannot, we will not, allow President Putin to get away with it. Every council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.

AIR FORCE ACADEMY DIVERSITY TRAINING TELLS CADETS TO USE WORDS THAT 'INCLUDE ALL GENDERS ,' DROP 'MOM AND DAD'

OK. So Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, is a buffoon and a failed rock musician, reading some paper posturing like a cable news segment about how Putin's bad. Yeah great. Got it. But sitting behind him in the shot you just saw is someone who is not a buffoon at all and that would be Toria Nuland, one of the people responsible for the disaster in Iraq. Now in a functioning country anyone who had a hand in the 20-year tragedy of Iraq in which America's prestige was gravely degraded, in which thousands of Americans died, in which we got much poorer for no good reason, anyone who was involved in that, including the lie that got us into it, would be disqualified from participating in American foreign policy forever, but Toria Nuland just ascended, ascended, ascended until she brings us to the brink of nuclear war with Russia.

So Tony Blinken is telling the United Nations and the rest of us that it's okay for Ukraine to threaten nuclear war on behalf of the United States and the rest of the world looks on with their jaws open, including China, of all places. Here's China's foreign ministry spokesperson yesterday. Watch.

WANG WENBIN, CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire and stop the war through dialog and negotiation and to find a solution that takes into account the legitimate security concerns of all parties as soon as possible. We also hope the international community will create the conditions and space for this.

We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire like the one they nearly had in April before the Biden administration blew it up because they want regime change in Russia. Now, that's coming from China, which has a human rights record that help makes Russia seem like Sweden and of course, China has benefited almost as much from this war as Putin has and Raytheon and Lockheed has, but even the Chinese are not crazy enough to want nuclear Armageddon. In the end, all they want to do is do business and dominate through business.

They don't want their customers to blow themselves up and they understand they're coming incredibly close. Only Tony Blinken and lunatics like Toria Nuland really want that and they are fully behind Ukraine's president as he declares that his goal is not ending the war and getting his country back, which is a fine and admirable goal, that most Americans support. No, his goal is toppling Vladimir Putin and turning Russia into another failed state. Oh, good plan. Here he is.

ICC TO RETURN TO UKRAINE NEXT WEEK TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, 'PIERCE THE FOG OF WAR'

ZELENSKYY: A crime has been committed against Ukraine and we demand just punishment. The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations and Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. This is the first item of our peace formula, comprehensive item punishment.

So, a corrupt Eastern European authoritarian leader in a t-shirt is lecturing us about the community of nations and telling us this is really about the punishment that Ukraine demands. It's not about self-defense or getting their territory back. It's about regime change. Specifically, they're demanding a nuclear strike from us. How do we get involved in this anyway? But almost nobody in Washington is standing back to ask that question. They're full speed ahead on this. This is insane, but they're all for it.

Adam Kinzinger just tweeted this: ""By the way, any target within Russia that contributes to the war is fair game, by law of armed conflict. There's no escalation possible by a country fighting for survival. Anyone claiming Ukraine is escalating should stop.""

Anyone saying things that stupid in public should immediately resign from public office and be silent until wisdom comes, please. Then over in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are in agreement on just that same point. They've announced that Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism.

SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Russia should be declared a state sponsor of terrorism because the events of these past days and weeks have shown the need more powerfully than ever that Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism.

PUTIN TAKES EXTREME ACTION TO FILL RANKS, UNVAXXED HEROES STILL STUCK IN LIMBO AND MORE TOP HEADLINES

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think bipartisanship is strong when it comes to supporting Ukraine over Russia. I want to thank the administration for doing more. We have our differences about the next step, but Speaker Pelosi's in our camp. She has said from her point of view, Russia has earned the designation in U.S. law of being a state sponsor of terrorism.

The fact that Lindsey Graham can go on television, as he so often does, and claim to be conservative and someone who cares about the United States, it's beyond. So, this is part of the endless posturing about how Russia's bad and sure, Russia's bad. Fine, Russia's bad, but it's the words, as always, that matter. They're telling you that Russia is now a state sponsor of terror. Why are they saying that? And you're probably nodding. ""Yeah. It seems like a bad place with a bad leader, fine, but state sponsor of terror?"" It's important for them to define Russia very specifically as that. Why? Because what do we do with terror states? We topple their governments. We go on the offensive. We take the fight to them and that's the position of Washington on a bipartisan level and it's particularly the position of people who believe falsely, speaking of election-related conspiracy theories, that Vladimir Putin stole the 2016 election and no one believes that lunacy more fervently than the lady who lost. Here she is.

HILLARY CLINTON: They're getting the weapons they need to defend themselves and they're now on offense and I think we have to keep supporting them, helping them. They were attacked by an unprovoked act of war and they've held out and they've done better than anybody could have predicted and Zelenskyy has been a true wartime leader. I'm so impressed with him and I think, you know, the United States should stand with them.

BIDEN OFFICIAL GRILLED AFTER LATEST TAIWAN DECLARATION CONTRADICTS POLICY: 'HE SAID IT FOUR TIMES'

If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Republicans who, when this broke out in February, thought ""Well, this is awful. You shouldn't invade a sovereign country"" and of course, we agreed with that, we should stand with Ukraine, you may feel a little fooled at this point, because what you're watching is classic mission creep. We arrive for one purpose and we extend the stay for an entirely different purpose that you didn't sign up for and that will absolutely hurt the United States long-term.

When Hillary Clinton says we're going to stand with Zelenskyy as he goes on the offensive, that does not mean expelling Russian troops from his country, which everyone would agree with. That means toppling Vladimir Putin and creating a black hole in the center of Eastern Europe, the place where Asia meets Europe in a country with some of the biggest energy reserves on the planet and the largest nuclear arsenal. How is that going to work out? Well, let's listen to the Pentagon spokesmen. They're going on television to explain.

RETIRED LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG: What we need to do is instead, we just need to reverse. We say, ""all in"" and we haven’t done that. For example, we haven’t given the Ukrainians systems like the attack cruise missile which can reach all of Crimea. It’s a 200-mile range, 500-pound warhead, 300 bombers to it. It really can put the Russians at threat, but we haven’t done that. And I think we should put them at threat. Until he really believes that we’re seriously going after him, he’s going to continue to make these threats

So again, anybody who had a hand in, say, like the last five wars that diminished American power, killed Americans, made us poorer, hurt the United States long-term in very real ways, anyone who participated in any of that should probably bow out of the conversation about the latest war for the same reason that you wouldn't say take financial advice from someone who has gone bankrupt or go to marriage counseling with someone who's been divorced three times because they've demonstrably failed in their area of so-called expertise and that would include virtually everyone you hear talking about this stuff. ""He is going to continue making these threats,"" meaning Putin.

So, these are apparently the only threats that we object to. If Ukraine wants us to launch a preemptive nuclear strike in their behalf, that's totally fine. This is complete craziness. This is a ""strategy"" that could very easily bring the total destruction of the West and soon and maybe that's the point.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-point-ukraine-war-regime-change-russia,N/A
TUCKER CARLSON: Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the endpoint of a much longer story,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The war in Ukraine began a year ago today, on February 24, 2022, when the Russian military rolled across the eastern border of their country. But in many ways, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was the endpoint of a much longer story. The propaganda campaign designed to convince Americans to take sides in this conflict — a conflict that has nothing, strictly speaking, to do with them or with America — that effort began many years earlier.

We’d peg it to July 22, 2016. That’s the day that WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the servers of the Democratic National Committee in Washington. Those emails proved that party officials had rigged the Democratic process, the primary process, in favor of Hillary Clinton, and against the insurgent populist candidate that year, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Within days, the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, resigned in disgrace. The WikiLeaks scandal broke on the same day that Hillary Clinton chose her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, and it overshadowed the nominating convention that followed.

But, more significantly, the WikiLeaks scandal threatened to split the Democratic Party into pieces. More than 13 million Bernie Sanders voters, many of them young people, learned that the process they had always believed in, was in fact a sham. They had been cheated.

Democratic leaders had to act quickly in the face of this, to deflect blame from themselves onto someone else. The DNC’s servers, they claimed, had been hacked by the Russian military. The goal was to hurt Hillary Clinton, whom the Russians feared for her strength and wisdom, and to help Donald Trump, whom they controlled. Russia hacked the servers, in order to hack the election. That was their story. The Washington Post ran with it the first day, as if it were true.

SUSSMANN TRIAL PROVES HILLARY CLINTON PERPETRATED ‘MASSIVE FRAUD’, SHOULD BE ‘BANNED FROM TWITTER’: TAIBBI

But there was never any evidence that it was true. Almost seven years later, there is still no evidence. The DNC’s story about its servers is a lie. But, as a political strategy, that lie worked flawlessly. Russia made the perfect villain. It was a White, Christian country with a traditional social structure. It was everything the Democratic Party already opposed. The foreign policy apparatus in Washington was happy to hate Russia again. After 40 years of Cold War, hating Russia was muscle memory.

So, soon the leaders of both parties in Washington signed on to the Russia collusion hoax. It had the twin benefits of paralyzing the Trump administration, which it did, and justifying the expansion of the national security state. As the years passed and the rhetoric intensified, hysteria set in. After awhile, anyone with a heterodox opinion — from right-wingers to avowed-socialists — could be accused of working secretly for Vladimir Putin. Many were accused, and some were destroyed by it. It was a textbook witch-hunt, far more effective than McCarthyism.

And unlike McCarthyism, it never ended. Russia remained America’s greatest enemy, even as China emerged as America’s greatest threat. Over time, the lie that Democrats told to hide their crimes in the 2016 primaries, came to dominate America’s foreign policy, and then to imperil America itself. For generations, statesmen and diplomats worked to prevent other great powers from aligning as a block against the U.S. The idea was pretty straightforward: You might be able to beat one strong country, but if a couple of strong countries ever got together, you would lose. This is why Richard Nixon went to China: to make sure the Chinese government didn’t align with Brezhnev, with the Russians.

CHINA MOCKS BIDEN FOR KNOCKING DOWN BALLOONS WITH FIGHTER JETS: ‘HYSTERICAL,’ ‘LAUGHABLY JUVENILE’

Donald Trump understood this very clearly: ""Russia will never be our closest ally,"" he said. ""But if Russia ever becomes China’s ally, we’re in deep trouble."" The combination of natural resources, military and economic power — and sheer population — would make the Russian-Chinese alliance the most powerful force in the world. The United States would soon be dethroned, we’d be taking orders. As Trump put it, there is no reason to make Russia our enemy and there are many reasons not to.

It was a sound case, but official Washington ignored him. Their response, shouted in unison: ""Shut up Putin stooge."" And then they set about trying to provoke a war with Russia. Now they have succeeded.

But the war we are fighting in Ukraine is not against Russia alone, but also against Russia’s newest ally, the People’s Republic of China. What Donald Trump predicted has happened, and in the worst way. If the war in Ukraine continues, we will lose no matter how it ends. The world order is being reshuffled as we watch, and by the time it’s over, the U.S. will no longer be at the top of the deck. That is very obvious to the rest of the world.

But what’s fascinating is how few Americans seem to understand what's happening or its consequences. But how would they know? No one in American politics or media will tell them the truth. Since the first hours after the invasion, Americans have been fed a steady diet of increasingly absurd lies about Ukraine. Google and Facebook have joined with the Biden administration to censor any factual information that contradicts the official storyline. It’s dystopian.

Joe Biden’s first remarks about the war gave no hint we’d be sending advanced weapons systems and American military advisors to Ukraine, then supporting the entire Ukrainian government and its pension system with hundreds of billions of U.S. tax dollars. No, Joe Biden mentioned only sanctions, which are free. Sanctions he suggested would be enough. Here he is, a year ago today:

PRESIDENT BIDEN 2022: The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity... This aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom... Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences. Today, I'm authorizing additional strong sanctions.

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP, NEGLECTING EAST PALESTINE, SOUTHERN BORDER: 'THEY CAN KEEP HIM!'

Strong sanctions. That'll do it. Now, the goal at that point, a year ago today, you may remember this, was to push Russian forces back into their own country to reverse the invasion. And that seemed reasonable to most people. It did not seem like the beginning of a third world war, but it was exactly that. And by December, Lindsey Graham was confident enough to say so out loud. Here he is.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: How does this war end? When Russia breaks and they take Putin out. Anything short of that, the war is going to continue to ask the Ukrainians to give Russia part of their country after all this death and destruction is not going to happen. To signal a cease fire, Russia will take the opportunity to rearm and come at them again. So we're in it to win it and the only way you're going to win it is to break the Russian military and have somebody in Russia take Putin out.

So we're going to, says Lindsey Graham confidently, continue pouring billions into Ukraine until they, ""take Putin out.""

Does Putin know this? Well, we have no idea. We're not allowed to see Russian media in this country. That's too much information for Americans to handle. But if Putin does know that we plan to kill him, wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? Why wouldn't he fight back with nuclear weapons? No one in the United States seems to be allowed to wonder that, much less have a conversation about it out loud.

Instead, we're treated to more lectures about democracy. Ukraine is a democracy, we're told. That's why we're on the side of Ukraine. The problem is that is a lie. Ukraine is not a democracy. Ukraine is a corrupt one-party state. Ukraine has none of the freedoms that define democratic governance: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion. Ukraine is the least free place in all of Europe and probably for that reason, it is Joe Biden's favorite place.

So for those who understand what is actually happening and what Ukraine is actually like, it is very frustrating to watch Biden say this again and again. It is galling to be lectured about democracy by a man who took power in an election so sketchy that many Americans don't believe it was even real.

Joe Biden has never had the majority of Americans' support for a single day of the Ukraine war. In fact, Joe Biden is far less popular in the United States than Vladimir Putin is in Russia. That is not an endorsement of Putin. It's just true. And it says everything about Joe Biden's tenuous legitimacy. Democracy? Please. We're adults. Stop lying to us.

So what happens next in this war? Well, according to our elderly Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, the war in Ukraine will go on forever, and so will our support for Zelenskyy.

SECRETARY YELLEN: Let me make clear, the United States and the allies, our support for Ukraine will be lasting and is unconditional.

WAR IN UKRAINE: THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ENERGY AND FOOD ONE YEAR AFTER RUSSIA'S INVASION

Unconditional support for Ukraine. Unconditional support for a nation most Americans know nothing about and couldn't find on a map. Unconditional support – that's a profound statement. Outside of your immediate family how many people would you pledge unconditional support to? How many countries would you pledge unconditional support to? This is insane when you think about it.

But the people in charge of this disaster aren't thinking the way that most Americans do. The Atlantic magazine commemorated the anniversary of the war by commissioning a piece today by Tom Nichols. Nichols is a thoroughly silly foreign policy establishment parasite, who apparently is taken seriously by other ne'er-do-wells and dumb people in Washington. But the piece is fascinating. In it, he inadvertently reveals the point of this war in the clearest possible terms: ""Now we are faced with the long grind of defeating Moscow's armies and eventually rebuilding a better world.""

Oh, defeating Moscow's armies and building a better world. Perfect, thank you, Tom Nichols. Adding those items to this week's to-do list.

Unspecified in the piece is exactly how we plan to do this, how we plan to defeat Russia and its ally, China, and then build utopia. The piece is notably light on details.

Now you'd feel a little better hearing all this if Tom Nichols and others like him in Washington had a track record that suggested they could do any of this, a track record of competence and success. They don't. Nichols himself seems to spend most of his life arguing with other people on Twitter. He's never achieved anything at all that we're aware of, but then virtually none of them have achieved anything. Biden's chief Ukraine strategist, Victoria Nuland – you would not hire her to plan spring break. She couldn't do it. She doesn't have the skills.

BALTIMORE SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, 5 INJURED, INCLUDING 2 CHILDREN: ‘FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES’

Now, these very same people, these demonstrably incompetent people, say they plan to rebuild a better world. All right, that seems ambitious. How about starting with Baltimore before moving on to total global transformation? Shouldn't we fix the biggest city in Maryland first?

Under the leadership of people like Tom Nichols and Victoria Nuland, neoliberal geniuses with grand plans, Baltimore has devolved into third world chaos. But then so has Iraq, so has Libya and so has every other place these people have decided to, ""rebuild.""

It should spur a moment of silence and self-reflection in the U.S. State Department that the moment Western diplomats and NGOs left the country, Afghanistan got safer. There are far fewer killings in Kabul now than there were 18 months ago. Pedestrians in Kabul can walk to dinner at night without being murdered. Now, that fact doesn't tell the whole story of Afghanistan, of course, but we shouldn't ignore that fact. It means something.

If you spend billions trying to make a place better, and it gets worse, you have an obligation to think about why. Maybe you're doing it wrong. Maybe you're not as powerful and clever as you thought you were. Maybe there's a problem with your formula.

But none of this ever occurs to people like Tom Nichols and Victoria Nuland and for that matter, Joe Biden. The more discredited they are, the more self-confident they become. They see every failure as evidence that their talents are more desperately needed than ever. What is this? Well, it's called hubris.

TUCKER CARLSON: Zelenskyy is an instrument of total destruction,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

People used to tell you that Donald Trump was stupid. Remember that? ""He's an idiot!"" Now, we're not going to sit here and tell you it was a smart idea to turn the White House over to Jared Kushner; it was not. But it's also true if we're being honest – and we should be – that Donald Trump had far wiser instincts about American foreign policy than any leader in at least a generation, and he did it without the help of anyone.

None of his advisers wanted to hear his views on foreign policy. In fact, they desperately wanted Trump to be quiet, but Trump wouldn't. ""What's the point of NATO?,"" he asked nearly 30 years after the fall of the Soviet Union. No one in Washington could answer him. Shut up, racist, they replied, but Trump just kept going in his Trumpy way. ""Why would we fight Russia?"" he wondered. ""Wouldn't making Russia our enemy just drive Putin into the arms of China and create the most powerful and dangerous anti-American bloc in history?""

No one bothered to answer him. In fact, for the sin of asking, they called him a traitor to his country. They impeached him for it, and then they started a war with Putin. But in retrospect, Trump had asked a deeply patriotic question: If Russia ever joined forces with China, American global hegemony, its power would end instantly. You'd have the world's largest land mass and largest natural gas reserves, allied with the world's largest population and world's largest economy.

So, a Russia-China axis would be not just more powerful than the United States, but much more powerful. It would have the scale to control a lot of the world's economy and trade routes and raw materials. It could project military force that posturing aside, we actually don't have the power to stop. If Russia and China ever got together, it would be a brand-new world and the United States would be greatly diminished. Most Americans agree that would be bad.

PETE BUTTIGIEG RIPPED FOR BEING 'NO-SHOW' IN TOXIC OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT: 'COMPLETE DISCONNECT'

Now, as Donald Trump predicted very clearly, that is happening. Thanks to Joe Biden's reckless and self-destructive response to the invasion of Ukraine a year ago this week, the economies of Russia and China are intertwined. Chinese spending on Russian goods has increased by more than 60%. China now imports more coal from Russia than it has in the last five years. Chinese shipments to Russia, meanwhile, are up by nearly 30%.

Companies like Ford and Toyota pulled out of Russia. They had to. Remember that? So, what happened next? Chinese automakers stepped in. Chinese carmakers once made less than 10% of all cars bought in Russia. Now, China makes a third of them and you can see where this is going. The same thing has happened with smartphones and countless other consumer goods. Not surprisingly, the Chinese yuan is replacing the dollar in Moscow. Chinese currency now accounts for fully one fifth of all trades on the Moscow Stock Exchange. That's up from less than 1% last year.

So, these are deep and growing economic ties and they're formal. The thing about economic ties, however, is that they lead inexorably to military ties. So, it shouldn't surprise you that China is actively helping Russia in the war against NATO, which we are leading. In other words, the country with more ships than any navy in the world has united with a country that has more nuclear armed ICBMs than any country in the world to fight us through proxy in Ukraine.

Well, that's scary, and the thing is, everybody involved seems to know it's scary and just how scary it is. Our leaders understand that their push for total war with Putin, which is unnecessary, could lead to the destruction of the West. They know that, but they're doing it anyway. In an interview with a German newspaper today, the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy casually mentioned that, oh, by the way, the entire world may soon go up in flames: ""if China aligns itself with Russia, there will be a world war.""

There will be a world war if China aligns with Russia? Who could say something like that calmly, since as we just told you, China is aligned with Russia? It's already happened. That's not speculation. It's a fact. And as a result of that fact, according to Zelenskyy himself, hundreds of millions of people will die. No big deal. As long as we take Crimea. This is a very dark way of thinking.

PUTIN ALLY AND CHECHEN LEADER RAMZAN KADYROV PRAISES WAGNER GROUP, SAYS HE'LL CREATE HIS OWN MERCENARY UNIT

Zelenskyy himself is a very dark force. That is obvious if you watch him. It is unmistakable. Who could not see that? This man is a destroyer. He banned a Christian faith in his country and arrested nuns and priests. Oh, but he's a hero, claim our leaders from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell. No, Zelenskyy is not a hero. He is an instrument of total destruction. That is not a defense of his enemies. It's just true and maybe that's why Joe Biden is drawn to him. Biden landed in Kyiv today to promote another world war.

Note the air raid sirens in the background. What's strange is there didn't seem to be any air raids in Kyiv this morning. We checked. There were just air raid sirens at precisely the moment that Joe Biden appeared for a photo op. Even CNN's reporters on the ground in Kyiv know that they've been in the city for the past five days and didn't hear any bombs or missile strikes or any sirens until the moment that Biden walked out for the cameras.

REPORTER: I've been here for the past five days. I have not heard any explosions. I have not heard any air sirens until about half an hour ago, right when President Biden was in the center of Kyiv.

Right. So, here you have Potemkin air raid sirens, just the touch required in this, the most tightly scripted, most completely dishonest war in history, the fakest war and the point, of course, is to sell Americans on yet another $500 million in tax dollars for Ukraine for the Zelenskyy government. Watch this.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: We've committed nearly 700 tanks and thousands of armored vehicles, 1,000 artillery systems, more than 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition, more than 50 advanced launch rocket systems, anti-ship and air defense systems, all defending to defend Ukraine and that doesn't count the other half a billion dollars we're going to be, we're announcing with you today and tomorrow. That's going to be coming your way and that's just the United States in this piece.

BIDEN'S SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV WILL HAVE 'ZERO' IMPACT ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT, PUTIN EXPERT SAYS

This war for democracy that Americans for some reason can't vote on? Why don’t we have a national referendum on all this as long as we're leveling a country on behalf of democracy? It might be nice to try democracy here, but no. It's all so grotesque. It defies imagination, really.

But imagine if you were watching all of this, the spectacle from your home in East Palestine, Ohio, a home that is still stinking of chemicals you can't identify.

Meanwhile, you’re stuck in some lost and forgotten part of Ohio, the state that helped build this country, have a mushroom cloud over your city. The animals are dying. The water is glowing,

And yet, for more than two weeks after all of this started with the famous train derailment, FEMA and the Biden administration have refused to provide any kind of financial assistance to you. East Palestine still hasn't even gotten a visit, a token visit, from Joe Biden's token transportation secretary, Mayor Pete, and after two weeks, people in East Palestine are starting to notice. Watch.

The other is so important we’ll risk nuclear war to protect it. Aid to Zelenskyy? Unaudited. God knows where it's going. Nobody seems to care. Aid to East Palestine? We just can't afford it. Unfortunately, the people, you just saw are not Ukrainian, so Joe Biden is not interested enough to visit. Unfortunately, no one in East Palestine thought to pay Joe Biden's son 80 grand a month. If someone had done that, if someone had been wise enough to pay off the Biden family eight years ago, things would be different. Here's how Joe Biden might talk to them now.

BIDEN: It's going to deliver much needed humanitarian assistance as well as food, water, medicine, shelter and other aid to Ukrainians displaced by Russia's war and provide aid for those seeking refuge in other countries from Ukraine. It is also going to help schools and hospitals open. It's going to allow pensions and social support to be paid to the Ukrainian people so they have something, something, in their pocket.

So, not everything that winds its way through Congress is of equal importance. Most legislation in Congress means nothing in the long term. Nuclear war means everything in the long term.

So, what's the issue on which both parties seem aligned? Oh, the issue that matters. There is no opposition party. Both parties seem to agree that the administration that shot down weather balloons with $400,000 heat seeking missiles is capable of navigating an incredibly complex conflict in Eastern Europe, where the stakes are existential. No problem. We can pull this off. Everybody involved is Winston Churchill.

SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I'm going to try to help explain to the American people that defeating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important event going on in the world right now. It will save us an enormous amount of money down the road if the Ukrainians can succeed. You're not asking for any of our personnel. They're asking us for financial help.

You're beyond the ability to explain, and you're way beyond the ability to lead the opposition in the United States Senate.

But for some reason, McConnell and so many other Republican leaders and talk show hosts have been completely brainwashed by the idea that the United States will benefit from a war with Russia. Well, now that Russia has joined forces with China to create a bloc against the United States that we cannot defeat, they will control perhaps the majority of the world. Really?

Really? You did that, by the way. You laughed at Trump, and here we are facing the end of control of a lot of the world because you so unwisely managed the power that you inherited.

Ukraine war anniversary: Time for Russian sanctions with real teeth,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As we approach the second year of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, a false narrative has emerged that the West is doing everything it can to responsibly support Ukraine, without escalating the conflict.

That narrative belies an uncomfortable but necessary truth: The current path risks defeat, and a better path to victory is crippling Vladimir Putin’s massive web of wealthy enablers – who are still living the high life in the Western countries they claim to detest but love to invest, vacation and live in.

The recent announcement that the United States will send the M1 Abrams tank was billed as a major shot in the arm for Ukraine’s historic fight for independence. The news came shortly after Davos, where attendees whispered compliments about their strong support for Ukraine, which in their view is a victory in and of itself.

I have been on or near the front lines of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine for most of the last year, providing tens of millions of dollars in medicines, generators and basic supplies to help the Ukrainian people - and witnesssing the torture and murder of civilians, systemic rape and other crimes against humanity by Russian forces.

US DETERMINES RUSSIA HAS COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN UKRAINE, VP HARRIS SAYS

Many Western elites and policymakers, are divorced from reality in their belief that loophole-ridden sanctions and slow-walking new aid will win the war.

The United States and its allies deserve enormous credit for uniting to provide military and humanitarian aid to help brave Ukrainians defend their nation. But they must do more.

To bring a halt to the savagery, the West must hit the Russian government where it hurts and target the vast network of oligarchs that prop it up. The media breathlessly reports on the occasional seizure of a luxury yacht but the hard truth is that the Russian elite have managed to successfully evade the toothless sanctions currently in place.

Just look at London’s Billionaires Row, France’s swankiest shopping districts and ski resorts like Courchevel, or the resorts in Maldives and Dubai. They are all jam-packed with big-spending, Kremlin-connected Russians enjoying legal impunity and living like the gods they think they are. I suspect that nearly every $25,000-a-night hotel room in the world is occupied by a Russian.

Until this changes, these powerful oligarchs will continue to support Putin’s bloody war. They currently aren’t paying any price. Thus, targeting and seizing the wealth of Putin’s many collaborators is an essential part of any real strategy to end his disastrous invasion of Ukraine.

What does that mean specifically? Take Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corp., and a longtime Putin confidante. His $80 million 737 airplane continues to travel around Europe, despite sanctions imposed on Chemezov. How? Last year his plane was re-registered in Serbia, and now it travels freely to Serbia, Switzerland, Croatia and Austria. That plane is ripe for seizure in any number of European jurisdictions.

Or look at Roman Abramovich, the longtime owner of the Chelsea football club. He may have been forced to sell his team, but a new investigation from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reveals that he is still getting financing from Credit Suisse, despite sanctions.

Finally, consider Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of The Wagner Group, a Russlan paramilitary organization whose mercenaries are fighting for Russia in Ukraine. One might assume that Prigozhin is exactly the kind of businessman the West would target most vociferously with sanctions, given his direct role in the war. And yet, the British government apparently issued a special carveout allowing him to hire lawyers in the U.K. to sue a journalist.

These kleptocrats are near the top of any public, let alone classified, list of Putin enablers. And they are prime examples of how weak current sanctions are. If Prigozhin, a potential successor to Putin, gets special treatment from No. 10 Downing Street, imagine the warm welcome the rest of the Russian kleptocracy receives from banks, realtors, top tier schools, and the most exclusive resorts across the world.

The West helped create the elaborate schemes and accounting structures that oligarchs use to maintain and grow their fortunes. That’s why the West must uncover and eradicate them. The U.S. in particular must also insist that its allies cease enabling Russian oligarchs

The United States and its allies must make three major changes quickly to save the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians and bring an end to Russia’s bloodshed.

First, they must put meaningful manpower behind sanctions implementation, recruiting the best expertise from the private sector to enforce the sanctions that have been announced and give them real teeth.

Second, expand the list of Russians who are subject to sanctions. The current list only scratches the surface of those who are supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Finally, the West must deny Russian oligarchs the safe harbors around the world where they reside, vacation and invest their ill-gotten wealth. If they want to support Putin, let them sit in Moscow with him.

That kind of crackdown on the Kremlin’s oligarchs will have long-term benefits for the future security of Europe. And for Russia. Putin won’t be in power forever. But whoever comes next will find themselves surrounded by an intelligence service, military, mercenary industry, and economic elites deeply invested in corruption, organized crime and violent nationalism. Unless Europe and the U.S. decide that enough is enough.

The new tanks will only buy Kyiv time before Russia’s seemingly unlimited military manpower and willingness to absorb massive battlefield losses will start another conversation about what other weapons systems Ukraine needs. It’ll be Groundhog Day, all over again.

The best way to break the current deadly stalemate reminiscent of the trenches in World War I is to try a new approach. Show Putin’s vast army of enablers that their lifestyles and wealth aren’t safe as long as Russia continues to wage war against innocent Ukrainian civilians.

Ukraine war: One year later... and the years ahead,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A year of warfare in Ukraine has shown that President Biden is a terrible leader. The saving grace? Vladimir Putin is far worse.

That said, reliving the past is not what is most important now. There are no do-overs in war. Americans must think about what is next – the future of the U.S. in Europe. And because of Putin’s many misjudgments, that future could be very promising indeed.

The U.S. has a serious stake in a peaceful and prosperous Europe. That’s why we are still in NATO. The alliance helps protect us and our interests.

That is also why Russia and China want NATO gone and America out of Europe. The invasion of Ukraine was their biggest, boldest step toward that goal.

WAR IN UKRAINE: HERE'S HOW WE DEFEAT RUSSIA AND DETER CHINA

What happened? Well, for starters, Putin appears to be the worst war leader in modern memory. He not only can’t defeat Ukraine, he can’t even consolidate control over the occupied territory.

Still, persistent concerns that he might escalate the war remain. Well, who knows what Putin will do? But if he can’t defeat Ukraine, will he really venture attacking others (say, Moldova) as well? For the last year, Putin has fought every day, and every day his conventional land forces are weaker than they were the day before. It’s hard to see that changing.

As we mark the anniversary, we should not forget that, as titular Leader of the Free World, Biden’s leadership has often been MIA. It started before the invasion. Biden came into office sending strong signals he didn’t care about Europe, Ukraine or Russia. Then, when Russia was on the march, he spent a year doing nothing more than finger wave and threaten tepid sanctions.

Once the fighting began, Biden’s brave first act was to encourage Ukraine’s president to run away. If not for his humiliation in Afghanistan and the fact that Ukrainians refused to fall, Biden would have turned his back on Ukraine.

BIDEN CHALLENGES PUTIN TO ‘END THE WAR’ IN UKRAINE, THREATENS TO RAMP UP SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA

Now, we have Biden recasting himself as a hero. Sorry, that doesn’t sell. In his surprise trip to Kyiv, Biden declared, ""We will be with you as long as it takes."" That statement surely rings hollow in the ears of Afghans now living in Taliban hell.

Blank-check Biden is also apparently not concerned about spending. Little surprise. He treats the American taxpayer like his personnel ATM. Still, Ukraine support represents but a fraction of the $5 trillion deficit rung up under Biden. Most of it was wasted on pet domestic ""woke"" projects.

Even the trip to Ukraine is less admirable than it appears. If he wished to show American resolve, Biden should have gone to Kyiv when Ukraine was in maximum peril. Instead, he withheld weapons that might have ended this conflict faster. But now he shows up – after first checking with Putin to make it was safe enough to go. Spare me.

Let’s be honest. There are feckless leaders in both Moscow and Washington. While we should have little faith in them, we can have faith in ourselves to make the best of the way forward.

First, we need to put an end to the profligate ways of Blank-check Biden. The U.S. has already earmarked almost $200 billion in aid to Ukraine. Thankfully, we have new leadership in Congress that looks up to the task.

Second, we need to think about what the future U.S. footprint in Europe ought to look like. Since the Russian conventional threat is greatly diminished, and our allies are waking up to their responsibilities to do more in their self-defense, a more limited presence makes sense. More forces could be rotational, but they have to be persistent and forward present on NATO’s eastern frontier to deter future Russian recklessness.

Third, we need to start building better partnerships in Europe. Europe knows Biden is a fair-weather friend. There are many and a growing number of center-right governments in North, Central and Southern Europe. Italy is but one example.

These governments are pro-U.S., pro-NATO, anti-Putin and anti-China. They have proven remarkably resilient through the tumult of inflation, energy prices, and the unsettling war in Ukraine They are increasingly pro-family, pro-life, pro-parent directed education, and anti-woke.

Ukraine war wouldn’t take so long if Biden would commit to victory,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year into Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, it is important to remember why the United States and our allies are supporting Ukraine.

If we had the opportunity to help Poland stop Adolf Hitler in 1939, imagine the horrors that could have been prevented and the blood and treasure that could have been saved. We have that opportunity now as the U.S. and its allies once again face strategic adversaries in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

Currently, Russia is engaged in a new offensive in the east. If successful, President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces could then attempt to occupy Ukraine’s entire southern coastline. The economic and humanitarian consequences of this would be significant.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Reminiscent of Stalin’s genocide of Ukrainians, known as the Holodomor, Russia is using its stranglehold of the Black Sea and attacks on Ukraine’s farmland to not just starve Ukraine, but also exacerbate food insecurity worldwide. Ukraine’s economic self-sufficiency and future exploration of energy reserves in surrounding waters also will be impossible without control of its Black Sea coastline, leaving it dependent on Western aid.

Despite what is at stake, the administration is still too slow in getting critical weapon systems to Ukraine. Ukraine right now has only enough weapons to prevent an outright Russian takeover, but not to secure victory in driving Russian forces out of the country. This strategy of incrementalism and hesitation will only prolong this conflict and lead to more Russian war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities.

The administration has recently committed to provide M1 Abrams tanks, as well as longer range Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) – this is encouraging. Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.

For Ukraine’s offensive to reach its full potential, which will likely begin in the spring, they still need more air defense systems, longer-range artillery, armor, armed drones, fighter jets and most urgently, Ukraine needs the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can hit critical Russian targets currently out of range. These targets include the military bases, fuel and ammunition depots and staging areas for Iranian drones in Crimea.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration has consistently been a step behind throughout this war. They have repeatedly claimed sending certain advanced weapon systems – from Stingers, to HIMARS, to Patriot air defense systems, to Western main battle tanks – would somehow provoke Putin. Yet, when these provisions were eventually sent, months later, there was no Russian retribution.

We commend the United Kingdom for their generous support. They were the first to provide Western battle tanks to Ukraine, helping unlock German approval for the Leopard 2 tanks along with the U.S. decision to send the Abrams.

Additionally, the U.S. and allies should join the British in training Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard fighter jets. Moreover, if smaller countries like the Baltics and Poland can provide such outsized support to Ukraine, larger ones have no excuse not to.

This is not only the morally right thing to do; it’s in the U.S. national security interest. With just over $30 billion just in U.S. security assistance, which is about 3% of the U.S. defense budget, Ukraine has crippled the military of America’s second-greatest adversary without placing a single U.S. servicemember in harm’s way.

Meanwhile, Congress will continue to conduct stringent oversight of U.S. funding to Ukraine, so the American people can rest assured their generous support is being used as intended in Ukraine.

Putin’s revisionist agenda does not stop at the Ukrainian border. If his dream of restoring the Soviet Empire turned its sights on a NATO ally next, then American boots on the ground would be required.

There is also a clear long-term, national security interest in destroying the Russian military now to prevent that scenario. And a Russian victory will only embolden China’s Chairman Xi to threaten the Indo-Pacific, to include Taiwan, and play into his propaganda that the West is in decline.

"Afghanistan IG calls for more oversight to prevent fraud, avoid 'significant mistakes' in $133B Ukrainian aid","As the U.S. commits to support Ukraine no matter how long it takes, some in government are asking: Did America learn its lessons from Afghanistan?

Ukraine is not Afghanistan, but in terms of how the U.S. approaches aid and oversight of funds, ""has that changed?"" asked John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR) which tracked billions of dollars of wasted money over the decades-long effort to rebuild that nation.

""We made some significant mistakes in dealing with Afghanistan,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

The one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion and Ukraine's defense of its territory came with commitments from President Biden to contribute more than the $113 billion already appropriated for the war, and a near-unanimous chorus of lawmakers promising additional assistance in weapons and money.

PENTAGON SENDING UKRAINE THESE WEAPONS IN $2B PACKAGE ON WAR'S 1-YEAR MARK

""The very worst outcome is that the assistance gets diverted, stolen in such a way that it doesn't accomplish its intended purpose — in this case, providing the Ukrainians with the weapons and the money to win their war against the aggressor, Russia,"" Sopko told Fox News.

The question isn't whether money might be lost to fraud or incompetence in Ukraine but what the U.S. can do to prevent it.

""We're spending a heck of a lot of money in that country, and any time you spend that much money in any country, you're bound to get wastage,"" Sopko said. ""You're bound to get corrupt elements of not only the Ukrainian or the host government, but also of U.S. government contractors or other third party contractors to try to steal the money. There's just so much money going in, and it's hard to keep track of.""

Sopko's analysis of the situation in Afghanistan in the later stages of the U.S. involvement, before America withdrew all forces in a messy exit, paints a gruesome picture of what could happen when foreign aid is perceived as flowing to corrupt local leaders.

Without sufficient oversight, aid ""gets stolen or diverted to local oligarchs or local politicians, or just the average Ukrainian will see the waste,"" Sopko said. The result would be a loss of ""support of the Ukrainian government by the average Ukrainian who's fighting, dying and bleeding at the front. And that's what we saw in Afghanistan. The Afghans saw all the money being diverted by corrupt politicians by their version of oligarchs and so when the Taliban was pushing toward the end, the average Afghan soldier or police officer or bureaucrat just said, 'I'm not gonna die for this government… they're stealing everything.' And we, the donors, the U.S., were identified as supporting the corrupt oligarchs.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Sopko does not predict Ukraine will become a second Afghanistan — the two countries are vastly different in culture, infrastructure, civil structure and governance. Ukraine's war is a defensive battle against a powerful foe, while Afghanistan was a civil war.

Nevertheless, corruption is not confined to one area of the globe.

Ukraine's government in 2023 is better off than the government of a decade ago, which was mired in corruption in part due to pro-Kremlin and holdover Soviet interests.

But how different it is from Afghanistan doesn't weigh into the need for oversight, Sopko said.

""What's similar is that we're spending a heck of a lot of money in that country, and any time you spend that much money in any country, you're bound to get wastage,"" Sopko said. ""You're bound to get corrupt elements of not only the Ukrainian or the host government, but also of U.S. government contractors or other third party contractors to try to steal the money. There's just so much money going in, and it's hard to keep track of.""

In order to do oversight properly, Sopko identified several necessary conditions based on his years investigating the U.S. and other nations' investments in Afghanistan. First, there needs to be staff on the ground who speak the language and understand the local power structures in the Ukrainian government.

Another requirement for an effective watchdog is that it should have authority to investigate every agency and every government. Current oversight efforts are ""stovepiped"" by the department — State Department aid is overseen by State's IG, and doesn't have the authority to track the Pentagon's contributions, which falls under the Department of Defense IG.

AFGHANISTAN IG SAYS IT WAS 'NOT SURPRISING' HOW COUNTRY FELL TO TALIBAN: 'ALL THE SIGNS HAVE BEEN THERE'

""We issued reports up to the collapse of the Afghan government saying that the Department of Defense could not tell us what weapons we had given, and what weapons the Afghans had,"" Sopko said.

The U.S. has ramped up commitments to send weapons to assist Ukraine in recent months, and several lawmakers have called on the Biden administration to detail plans for oversight.

In January, the IGs at the Pentagon, State Department and USAID released a plan for the ""Ukraine Oversight Interagency Working Group"" to provide real-time oversight over all the equipment, funds and other aid to Ukraine. The oversight involves 17 separate oversight agencies working together — which Sopko quipped would be like ""herding cats.""

The working group had dozens of reports planned for the coming year and certainly will add more. Already the IGs have identified a weakness, particularly in the Pentagon's security aid: There aren't enough U.S. personnel in Ukraine to track what's happening with the U.S. weapons and equipment sent there.

RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE HITS ONE-YEAR MARK AS PUTIN DIGS IN, ZELENSKYY PUSHES VICTORY. WHAT’S NEXT?

Congress also has ramped up calls for a special inspector for Ukraine aid. ""We have not seen any signs that our budgetary assistance has fallen prey to any kind of corruption in Ukraine,""

Other experts argue the situation in Ukraine is different enough from Afghanistan not to warrant a special inspector. Ukraine has proved it is able to investigate and root out corruption, according to Sarah Hoffman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She notes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proved he was serious about stamping out corruption by firing several officials last month and that the oversight working group quickly spun up the

""Congress and other Washington-based stakeholders should put their trust in the existing mechanisms in place and let them do their jobs,"" Hoffman wrote in an opinion column for The Hill this week.

Calls from Congress to reduce or slow funding, Hoffman added, only help the Kremlin.

""We have not seen any signs that our budgetary assistance has fallen prey to any kind of corruption in Ukraine,"" Defense Department spokesman John Kirby told lawmakers on Jan. 25.

Kirby's statement came one day after reports that Zelenskyy had fired government officials who had ""allegedly engaged in bribery, used government vehicles for personal use, and purchased inflated food supplies for Ukrainian forces,"" Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote in a letter to the Biden administration demanding more transparency.

The call for oversight should be separate from the need for aid, according Sopko, but can't be ignored just because the goal is a noble one. Sopko looks to the example of Harry Truman, who, before running for president, made a name for himself in the Senate by investigating war profiteering in the early years of WWII — perhaps the ""most righteous war"" America has ever fought, Sopko said.

The Biden administration is already struggling to track those funds, as Republicans warn of impending audits once they take control of the House in January.

Likely future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said his party will not be giving Ukraine a ""blank check"" to fend off Russia's invasion.

McCarthy has based his criticism of the aid packages on America's economic situation as the economy threatens to fall into a recession.

""I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" McCarthy said last month. ""They just won’t do it. … It’s not a free blank check.""

Nevertheless, America's funding for Ukraine has been largely bipartisan under Biden, and many Republicans say there is no reason that funding cannot continue in some form.

Biden announces another $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine,"President Biden on Thursday announced another $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, including heavy artillery and ammunition, as the country continues to fight to defend itself against Russia’s multi-front war.

Biden, who spoke from the East Room, said the assistance would include heavily artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, 144,000 rounds of ammunition for those howitzers, and tactical drones.

And he added: ""To modernize Teddy Roosevelt’s famous advice, sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well.""

The president last week had authorized $800 million in weapons, ammunition and other security assistance. The $1.6 billion he approved this week and last is in addition to the more than $1 billion the administration had already said it was sending to Ukraine.

But the president said the funding authorized by Congress for Ukraine has almost been exhausted, and that he would therefore be sending a supplemental funding request to Capitol Hill next week. He called on Congress to pass it quickly, saying the funding would allow the U.S. to keep assistance flowing without interruption.

Biden also said the U.S. would provide $500 million in economic aid to Ukraine and announced a new program that would expedite legal immigration to the U.S. by Ukrainians who can be sponsored by a family or an NGO. And he said the U.S. would bar all ""Russian-affiliated"" ships from American ports.

Security aid is continuing to flow into Ukraine unabated, with senior U.S. defense officials telling Fox News that everything related to Ukraine is being ""expedited.""

The aid comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin, last week, warned of ""unpredictable consequences"" should the United States and NATO continue sending Ukraine ""sensitive weapons.""

The White House this week said it would continue to provide ""significant security assistance, economic assistance and support to the Ukrainian people,"" while maintaining that the president will not send U.S. troops into Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked about Putin’s warning this week, said she would not ""speculate on empty threats by President Putin or Russian leadership.""

Putin this week ordered his troops not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, saying during a televised meeting that he believed the suggested attack ""to be not necessary."" It appears Putin now intends to force a surrender by preventing supplies from entering the factory.

Early Wednesday, the commander of a Ukrainian Marine unit made an urgent last-ditch plea for Ukrainian women and children, along with wounded marines, sheltering in the Azovstal plant to be evacuated to a neutral third country as the Russian deadline to surrender Mariupol loomed.

Moscow had given the Ukrainian forces several deadlines to surrender the plant and leave without their weapons. The latest expired at 2 p.m. Moscow time (11 a.m. GMT) on April 20.

The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works was once the site of one of the largest metallurgical factories in Europe, but since the onslaught of the war more than 50 days ago, it has become a symbol of the city’s resistance.

The plant’s network of underground tunnels has become home to Mariupol residents seeking shelter from the barrage of shelling and a base for several military units.

Despite weeks of intense shelling that has resulted in the death of more than 20,000 Mariupol residents, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko, Russian forces have been unable to take the strategically important city.

Meanwhile, Russia launched a full-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine this week after pivoting from broad-based attacks across the country, including a massive assault on the capital of Kyiv.

Only four buses with civilians managed to escape Mariupol on Wednesday after several unsuccessful attempts, Ukrainian officials said Thursday. Late Wednesday, Ukrainian

The additional aid to Ukraine also comes after President Biden last week called actions by Russian forces in Ukraine a ""genocide,"" saying it is becoming ""clearer and clearer"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""just trying to wipe out even the idea of being Ukrainian.""

Genocide is a type of war crime under International law.

The Senate, last month, approved a resolution that will investigate Putin for war crimes, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said U.S. findings will be used to help international efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable.

Since the onset of the war on Feb. 24, Russian forces have hit apartment buildings, children’s and maternity hospitals, breadlines and more.

Russian forces have also been accused of using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs in the war, which violate international law when used indiscriminately against civilians.

The International Criminal Court said earlier this month that it is opening an investigation into potential war crimes by Putin related to his invasion of Ukraine.

Biden announces millions more taxpayer dollars to assist Ukraine during surprise trip to Kyiv,"President Joe Biden announced during his surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday that the U.S. will be providing nearly $500 million in additional security assistance to the country amid its ongoing war with Russia.

The package includes additional rocket system ammunition, mortar and artillery rounds, radar equipment, anti-armor weaponry, four Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two tactical vehicles for equipment recovery, Claymore anti-personnel mines, demolition munitions, night-vision equipment, communications equipment, medical supplies, spare parts and other field equipment.

According to the Department of Defense, the package is valued at up to $460 million and will be the Biden administration's 32nd drawdown of equipment from DOD inventories for Ukraine.

US WARNED RUSSIA OF BIDEN'S VISIT TO UKRAINE ‘HOUSE’ BEFORE DEPARTURE

Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine sparked widespread criticism that he would visit the country before making a trip to the town of East Palestine, Ohio, which was rocked by a devastating toxic train derailment earlier this month and has upended the lives of those Ohioans living in the area.

That comes in addition to the criticism he's already faced for providing what some have called a blank check to Ukraine, arguing that there is no verification system in place to ensure equipment and money are being used properly and accusing the administration of putting the U.S. on the verge of war with Russia.

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called Biden's approach to funding Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and told ""Fox & Friends"" after the news of Biden's trip broke that he opposes the policy because there is ""no clear strategic objective identified"" in the administration's funding of Ukraine. He added that it isn't in America's best interest to be ""getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea.""

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year but failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, before refocusing its operations on the Donbas region as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.

The one-year mark of the invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives on both sides, is on Friday.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022, through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

"Biden approves sending 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, in reversal","President Biden on Wednesday approved the U.S. to send 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine just hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz said Ukraine would also receive Leopard 2 tanks from Berlin as Russia plans for a major offensive.

The president, joined by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Defense Secretary Antony Blinken, described the vehicles as the ""most capable tanks in the world"" and said they ""will enhance Ukraine’s ability"" on the battlefield.

Biden said Western aid to Ukraine ""is not an offensive threat to Russia.""

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" he added.

UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: GERMANY AGREES TO SEND 2 BATTALIONS OF LEOPARD 2 TANKS AFTER HEAVY PRESSURE

Senior defense officials told reporters Wednesday that between tanks supplied from the U.S., U.K, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden, along with tank shipments expected to be announced by other European nations in the coming days, Ukraine can expect to receive ""hundreds"" of desperately needed tanks.

The Wednesday decisions come after weeks of stalled and frustrated negotiations with Germany in what one senior defense official described as the ""product of good diplomatic conversations.""

""It really is remarkable if you look back over the last year to see the extraordinary shift in Germany's security policy,"" another senior defense official told reporters on background.

While Leopard 2 tanks from EU nations will require minimal turnaround time and will serve the immediate needs of Ukraine’s military forces, the shipment of Abrams tanks to Ukraine will take months.

""Coupled with this near-term commitment that the Germans have made on Leopards, we think this contribution by us with the Abrams represents the long-term commitment,"" one official said.

Top U.S. defense officials, including Austin, had expressed reservations about sending Abrams tanks to Ukraine because of cost, maintenance requirements and the longer training periods needed to get Ukrainian soldiers up to speed on the combat vehicles.

GERMANY 'NOW APPRECIATING THE MOMENT' AS IT FINALLY AGREES TO SEND TANKS TO UKRAINE, GRAHAM SAYS

But earlier this month Germany suggested that it would not agree to send its tanks unless the U.S. did as well, citing concerns over escalating the war – a concern that drew international eye rolls as the deadly war enters its 11th month.

Senior defense officials would not confirm if the decision to send the battalion of Abrams tanks was a stipulation of Berlin’s or motivation from Washington to get the ball rolling on Leopard tanks.

The move was instead championed as a show of long-term support for Ukraine.

""Abrams tanks are the best in the world,"" a senior defense official said. ""This is a tremendous new capability that Ukraine will be getting to boost its long-term defenses.""

The Pentagon is also working through the fuel and maintenance requirements that the Abram tanks demand and the U.S. will also send eight M88 recovery vehicles in support of the top tanks.

The U.S. has already supplied thousands of combat vehicles, including 1,700 Humvees and pledged earlier this month to send another 500 armored vehicles of various types.

The Abrams tanks will be procured through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and will not come directly from U.S. stockpiles.

It remains unclear how long it will take to get the Abrams tanks up and running in Ukraine and defense officials did not say where the trainings will take place, though it was confirmed that the trainings would be held outside of Ukraine.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-approves-sending-31-m1-abrams-tanks-ukraine-reversal,N/A

Biden delivered that warning from Warsaw, Poland, nearly a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a day after making a surprise visit to Ukraine.

""One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv,"" Biden said. ""Well, I just came from Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong. Kyiv stands proud. Kyiv stands tall. And most importantly, Kyiv stands free.""

""One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction; he doubts our staying power; he doubts our continued support for Ukraine; he doubts they can remain unified,"" Biden said.

Biden to deliver Patriot missiles to Ukraine as Zelenskyy visits Washington,"President Biden's administration will send Patriot missiles to Ukraine for the first time on Wednesday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington to address Congress.

The Patriot missiles, the country's most advanced air defense system, will come as part of a $2 billion security aid package for Ukraine that Biden is expected to announce Wednesday, according to Axios. Zelenskyy left Ukraine to visit Washington, D.C., for the first time since Russia's invasion of his country began in February.

Congress has already approved $65 billion in aid for Ukraine, but lawmakers are now debating an additional $45 billion.

The Ukrainian president is expected to praise lawmakers for their support as his nation fights off an unprovoked invasion by Russia. Zelenskyy is also expected to argue that the war is by no means won and that more help is needed.

Top Dem senator calls for 'consequences' if China supplies Russia with weapons to fight Ukraine,"Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., warned China against sending lethal military aid to help Russia fight Ukraine, suggesting the U.S. could respond by imposing sanctions on the Chinese government.

""China needs to know there will be consequences,"" Cardin said during a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview. ""We've isolated Russia economically. We can do the same thing in regard to sanctions against China.""

Cardin's comments came after multiple reports said China is considering sending artillery shells to Russia as the Russian military depletes its supply of ammunition a year into its invasion of Ukraine.

""China needs to understand that they need to be on the right side of history here,"" Cardin told Fox News host Shannon Bream. ""China should be with us.""

The senator referenced the United Nations General Assembly approving a nonbinding resolution on Thursday, the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion, calling for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces.

The resolution passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions. China was one of the countries that abstained from the vote.

""China sat on the sidelines on that vote,"" said Cardin. ""That was wrong.""

During the interview, Cardin also called China a ""major threat,"" decrying the Chinese government for not standing with most of the world against Russia's war in Ukraine.

""I do think China is a major threat against the United States,"" said Cardin. ""They're encouraging this [Russia-Ukraine] war by working with Russia, now perhaps providing additional weapons for Russia to be able to pursue this war of aggression. This is an attack on the sovereignty of a democratic state. There is no question that Ukraine is the front line, but Russia will not stop there. And China's assisting that.""

China expressed anger this past week after the Biden administration suggested that China was considering sending weapons and ammunition to Russia to help its war against Ukraine, saying, ""The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do.""

""It is the U.S. not China, that has been pouring weapons into the battlefield,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said. ""The U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do.

"Gaetz introduces resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine, urge peace deal","FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is introducing a resolution in the House on Thursday that calls on the Biden administration to end U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine -- while also urging all involved to secure a peace agreement after nearly a year of war in the region.

The resolution, the ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" is being introduced by Gaetz and 10 co-sponsors and calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution notes that since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, with more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. It includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.

In January the U.S. announced additional security assistance, including approval by President Biden of 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine. On top of that, reports suggest another $2 billion could be in the pipeline.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" Biden said, making that announcement.

The resolution lists the enormous amount of equipment that the U.S. has provided to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It also cites Pentagon officials who have said the munitions have ""severely depleted United States stockpiles, weakening United States readiness in the event of conflict.""

It also claims that by providing assistance, the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties, and notes U.S. estimates that 40,000 civilians had died in the conflict.

Concern about the continued U.S. funding of the war has grown among a subset o f Republicans as the conflict has dragged on, with lawmakers highlighting issues at home that could use additional funding – including what they see as a failure to protect the U.S. border against a historic migrant crisis.

MATT GAETZ RIPS ‘BIPARTISAN COALITION’ THAT FAVORS WAR IN UKRAINE

Gaetz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. has been the top contributor to what he called an ""everlasting conflict.""

""America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" he said. We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately.""

The co-sponsors on the resolution include Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., Paul Gosae, R-Ariz., Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Mary Miller, R-Ill., Barry Moore, R-Ala., Ralph Norman, R-S.C. and Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.

"Gen. Petraeus says Ukraine, military readiness top priorities for NDAA, vax mandate outrage ‘manufactured’","EXCLUSIVE: Gen. David Petraeus says bolstering the U.S. military's ""core strength"" and ""will"" to take on China and increasing aid for Ukraine should be top priorities in the annual defense policy bill, but also condemned Congress for ending the Biden administration's military COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and said complaints about the mandate are ""manufactured outrage.""

Former CIA Director Petraeus, who served for 37 years in the U.S. Army, spoke with Fox News Digital at the Aspen Security Forum in Washington, D.C., Thursday about top priorities that should be included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which will be up for a final vote in the Senate before lawmakers leave town for the holidays.

The general said the ""most important"" priority for the country that must be reflected in the NDAA is the United States and the West's relationship with China and all things having to do with the Indo-Pacific, including the ""transformation"" of military services capabilities and a strengthening of the ""will"" of the U.S.

He said the U.S. must focus on transitioning away from military services capabilities that are massive and heavily manned, and thus are also ""huge targets"" due to their size.

GEN. PETRAEUS ON GRINER RELEASE: HATE TO 'REWARD' RUSSIA FOR SWAP, VIKTOR BOUT HAS 'BLOOD ON HIS HANDS'

""Keep in mind, Ukraine has validated that old Cold War adage that ‘if it can be seen, it can be hit, and if it can be hit, it can be killed.’ Think about that in a theater where everything can be seen and there are enormous vulnerabilities,"" Petraeus said.

""So we have to be sure that we are transforming that entire theater and service capabilities…to make sure that they're transformed in a way that shores up deterrence. And deterrence, of course, rests on a potential adversary's assessment of your capabilities, on the one hand, and your willingness to employ them on the other,"" he said.

""And we have to ensure there is no doubt about the capabilities, and we've got a lot of work to do there, and this budget will help in that regard,"" he said, referring to the NDAA.

In addition, Petraeus said that the ""will"" of the U.S. to lead on the world stage is especially important during Russia's war on Ukraine and the aftermath of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

BIDEN DESERVES ‘INCOMPLETE’ GRADE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, US MUST ‘OUTCOMPETE’ CHINA: SEN. TODD YOUNG

""And that's why the support for Ukraine is so important, especially coming after the withdrawal from Afghanistan to show that the U.S. can and will lead the world and it has the will to do just that. So again, that has to far and away be the top priority,"" Petraeus told Fox News Digital. ""Assistance to Ukraine, needless to say, has to be definitely one of those top three as well.""

Petraeus said the U.S. has given a ""staggering amount"" of assistance to Ukraine already, totaling over $19 billion in arms and weapons assistance and $13 billion in economic assistance over the past year.

He said Ukraine is making good use of the assistance, and now has ""an army that is bigger and more capable than is that of Russia, despite being less than one third the size of Russia and not having all of the minerals and other blessings that Russia has. I think that situation is irreversible and there's nothing that Putin and Russia can do about it.""

The final priority in the NDAA should be developing the military's ""core strength,"" says Petraeus, which means taking care of U.S. troops and their families.

""Taking care of them, taking care of their families, ensuring that we are recruiting the best and brightest that we can attract,"" he said. ""And of course, there are challenges there right now with the very low rate of unemployment, ensuring that. Taking care of them, retaining them, educating, developing, all aspects of that and their families. Because you know the old saying, you recruit the soldier or the sailor, airmen, Marines, now guardians in the Space Force, you retain the family.""

Petraeus said he is worried about military ""readiness"" due to misperceptions about the COVID-19 military vaccine mandate, increased troop access to abortion after the rollback of Roe v. Wade and the increase of ""woke"" diversity and equity trainings.

""I'm concerned that perceptions of all that may [impact readiness],"" he said. ""I am not one who thinks that this is one of the huge issues that is facing the military. It is, however, something that is perceived to be an issue in certain circles, and I am concerned about that. I don't think, I don't see this kind of concern really manifest. Perception, certainly wrong. But, you know, this is it is a military that has always taken its shots. If its FDA approved and improves readiness, why would you not get that shot?"" said Petraeus.

AIR FORCE PILOTS SEEKING RELIGIOUS VACCINE EXEMPTION STILL GROUNDED WHILE OTHER UNVAXXED MEMBERS CAN FLY

""And why there should be some concern about this particular shot is, frankly, because of domestic political issues that really I don't think actually have particular merit. Once the FDA has approved it. Again, everybody is taking their flu shot every year,"" he continued.

The House on Thursday passed its version of the NDAA including language to strip the Biden administration's military COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Lawmakers cheered the move to end the ""draconian"" mandate, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called it a ""win for our military.""

However, Petraeus disagreed, saying the mandate was designed to improve the readiness of the military, and that those opposed to it are overstating the problem.

""I don't understand actually this particular issue, and I think it is a misperception. I think it is something that should not be present, frankly. Once it is, again FDA approved. And it is to improve the health and well-being and readiness of the workforce. That's something that obviously should be supported,"" he said.

""So I hope we can get past some of the hype. With all due respect, I think some of these are manufactured grievances to pursue domestic political issues. And I think we need to put these aside for the good of our men and women in uniform and their families and for the readiness of the U.S. military.""

George W. Bush pushes back on GOP criticism of Ukraine funding: 'Not going to constrain' helping US citizens,"Former President George W. Bush pushed back on Republican criticism on U.S. funding going to Ukraine on the anniversary of the eastern European nation’s war with Russia.

While speaking at a George W. Bush Presidential Center event on the 20th anniversary of President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., the former president fired back on GOP criticism of funding going to Ukraine amid the war.

Former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, the moderator of the discussion with former Tanzanian President Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, asked Bush for his message to U.S. leaders and critics of American intervention in Africa with AIDS and the Ukraine War.

TRUMP, HALEY AND POTENTIAL 2024 CONTENDERS LIKE DESANTIS COURT BIG DONORS AS GOP’S WHITE HOUSE RACE HEATS UP

""I think we’re a big enough nation to do more than one thing,"" Bush said. ""And continuing to fight against AIDS on the continent of Africa and supporting the Ukrainian freedom fighters is not going to constrain our capacity to help our own citizens.""

Some Republicans have been critical about the amount of U.S. money going toward the war effort in Ukraine as inflation in America remains high.

Several officials, including current Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke at the event on the anniversary of PEPFAR.

Pelosi was joined by her husband, Paul Pelosi, at the event. Bush gave the Pelosis a welcome during his time speaking at the event.

Pelosi said that PEPFAR is about ""health justice"" and saluted both Bush and former first lady Laura Bush ""for not only their leadership, but the birth of this.""

""This statement at the State of the Union,"" Pelosi said. ""And I jumped up right away when he made this announcement representing San Francisco, as I do.""

The former speaker continued and recounted a story of speaking with U2 frontman Bono.

""So, we know when President Bush made the announcement and Bono was involved in it,"" Pelosi recalled. ""And I said to Bono, ‘No photo ops unless Congress goes big. We have to go big.'""

Pelosi said that HIV and AIDS became an issue for her from the ""first moment"" she took her seat in Congress and gave praise to Dr. Anthony Fauci, calling him a ""national hero.""

In his conversation with Kikwete and Rice, Bush recounted a story of receiving a ""lion"" from the now-former Tanzanian president.

""You know, he gave me a lion when I went to visit in Tanzania,"" Bush said.

""Not a live one,"" Rice pointed out.

""So on Presidents Day, I’m not surprised that Biden is ditching America for Ukraine. He ditched America’s interests since the start of his presidency. They can keep him!"" he said.

Freshman Senator Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., added to the mounting Republican criticism in a tweet Monday by saying, ""If you want to understand why so many Americans are frustrated right now: Biden is in Ukraine before Ohio.""

Senior Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, tweeted a similar message Monday: ""No time to visit East Palestine, Ohio but plenty of time for this,"" he said.

In another tweet, Greene noted that the president has yet to visit Ohio following the train derailment earlier this month that led to a toxic chemical scare that still as residents worried about their health.

Government funding bill to include over $12 billion in new Ukraine aid,"A government funding bill set for a Tuesday procedural vote in the Senate will include over $12 billion to help Ukraine continue fighting its bloody war against Russia, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital.

The inclusion of the funding comes after President Biden requested $13.7 billion for Ukraine earlier this month. If the Senate bill passes, this latest tranche will bring the total funding for Ukraine approved by Congress up to approximately $65 billion.

The source familiar with the bill said it will also include funding for Afghan ally resettlement; winter heating assistance; aid for Jackson, Mississippi, amid its water crisis; reauthorization of FDA user fees, and more.

Biden also asked for money to fight COVID-19 and monkeypox, though many top Republicans opposed those priorities and it is not clear if they will make it into the bill.

CONGRESS FLIRTS WITH GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AS MANCHIN PERMITTING BILL MAY DRAG DOWN FUNDING PACKAGE

Congress faces a midnight deadline on Friday to pass the temporary funding bill or else nonessential parts of the government will shut down. That bill is expected to keep the government funded until after the midterms.

It's common for lawmakers to try to add other priorities onto these last-minute bills, though some are likely to complain about these additions. Many Senate Republicans say they want the funding bill to be as ""clean"" as possible.

A significant proportion of Republicans, particularly senators and moderates in both chambers, are still supportive of continued funding for Ukraine. But another round of foreign aid could draw complaints from GOP fiscal hawks and those concerned about increased U.S. involvement in that war.

Republicans supportive of the funding, plus the Democratic majority in both chambers, will likely add up to more than enough votes to get the Ukraine money to Biden's desk.

SEN. JOE MANCHIN PRESSED ON HIS ENERGY PROPOSAL: 'WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS AMERICANS'

The biggest issue facing the funding bill, the text of which has yet to be released, will likely instead be an energy permitting bill backed by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Manchin made a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., last month to bring permitting reform for a vote in exchange for his support of Democrats' social spending and taxation bill.

Schumer scheduled a vote on the package, to include Manchin's energy proposal, for Tuesday night.

But it may not have enough support, given opposition from environmentalist Democrats and many Republicans who, even though they like the underlying permitting policy, are angry at Manchin for his vote on the social spending and tax bill.

If that vote fails Tuesday, Congress will face a mad dash to avoid a partial government shutdown before the Friday deadline.

Lindsey Graham calls on Biden to supply 'heavy modern tanks' to Ukraine for war against Russia,"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on Thursday called on President Biden to send tanks to Ukraine, as requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The Republican lawmaker urged Biden to act following an announcement that France would send the first western tanks to Ukraine to aid the fight against Russia's invasion. France will supply AMX-10 RC light tanks to Ukraine, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters Thursday, according to French news agency AFP.

""I appreciate France agreeing to provide light armored combat vehicles to Ukraine – but this is not enough,"" Graham tweeted. ""The goal for 2023 is to give the Ukrainians the weapons they need to militarily defeat the Russian invaders. This requires heavy modern tanks.

""I am urging the Biden Administration to meet President Zelensky’s request for modern western tanks. The goal is quite simple: Defeat the Russians in Ukraine sooner rather than later,"" Graham said. ""Tanks would change the tide of battle.""

BIDEN CONSIDERS SENDING BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES AS UKRAINE PLEADS FOR TANKS

FRENCH DEFENSE MINISTRY EXPECTED TO SEND ARMORED COMBAT VEHICLES TO UKRAINE

Earlier this week, Zelenskyy renewed his calls for Western tanks to help his troops in areas like Donetsk where brutal ground warfare continues.

Fighting continues in other areas as well including Luhansk, where according to its regional governor, Ukrainian troops are making slow, incremental ""step-by-step"" gains, though he warned these advances were ""not happening fast,"" first reported by Reuters.

President Biden on Wednesday said the U.S. is considering sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine – an armored vehicle that, while not technically a tank, is propelled on tracks and equipped with a free turning turret. It has less firepower than a modern tank and shorter firing range.

The Bradley vehicles are capable of transporting more infantrymen, arms and communications than tanks and can quickly and effectively maneuver on the battlefield. But it is unclear if Zelenskyy would view the lighter vehicles as sufficient for Ukraine's needs.

Mitch McConnell tells German audience that Republican leaders support aid to Ukraine: ‘Don’t look at Twitter’,"Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday told attendees at the Munich Security Conference that Republican leadership backs continued aid to Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion, despite voices within his party opposing continued assistance.

""Reports about the death of Republican support for strong American leadership in the world have been greatly exaggerated,"" he said. ""My party’s leaders overwhelmingly support a strong, involved America and a robust trans-Atlantic alliance. Don’t look at Twitter, look at people in power.""

The Kentucky senator pointed to himself, as well as Speaker or the House Kevin McCarthy and top Republicans on the Senate and House committees.

""Republican leaders are committed to a strong trans-Atlantic alliance. We are committed to helping Ukraine. Not because of vague moral arguments or abstractions like the so-called ‘rules-based international order.’ But rather, because America’s own core national interests are at stake. Because our security is interlinked, and our economies are intertwined.

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

The U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort since the Russian invasion a year ago, giving more than $110 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally. That includes more than $27.4 billion in security assistance.

UKRAINE WARNS OF MASSIVE RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON ANNIVERSARY OF PUTIN’S INVASION: ‘WE HAVE TO BE READY’

In January, the U.S. announced additional security assistance, including approval by President Biden of 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine.

But there have been indicators of growing hesitancy among some Republicans. McCarthy said in November that Republicans wouldn’t write a ""blank check"" for Ukraine. A relatively small but vocal group in the House has opposed the continued aid and called for it to stop.

US DETERMINES RUSSIA HAS COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN UKRAINE, VP HARRIS SAYS

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and 10 co-sponsors introduced the ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" this month, which calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution lists the enormous amount of equipment that the U.S. has provided to the country since the beginning of the conflict. It also cites Pentagon officials who have said the munitions have ""severely depleted United States stockpiles, weakening United States readiness in the event of conflict.""

Gaetz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. has been the top contributor to what he called an ""everlasting conflict.""

""America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" he said. We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately.""

There have also been dissenting voices in the Senate. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., expressed concern this week that pouring support into Ukraine will hurt America's ability to defend against aggression from China.

""Some of the world’s wealthiest nations are our allies in Europe. But right now, we’re the only ones doing the heavy lifting. In fact, we’ve sent more weapons to Ukraine than all of Europe has, combined. And those choices are weakening us in the one place — the Pacific — where we require strength,"" he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation. ""The Uniparty’s way is not sustainable. It is a path to failure.""

Meanwhile, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published this week showed that 48% of those polled support providing weapons to Ukraine, down from 60% in May 2022.

McConnell appeared to reference the risk that U.S. support could wilt, and said that European allies need to step up, arguing that ""European countries have not been uniformly generous to Ukraine.""

""If you want to help Ukraine win; if you want NATO to emerge stronger from this conflict; and if you want sustained political support in America for our staying engaged and invested in maintaining a Europe that is whole, free and at peace . . . then America’s friends on this continent must mirror the resolve and reciprocate the commitment that you hope to see from us,"" he said.

Pentagon refuses to detail request for $37.7B in additional Ukraine assistance,"The Pentagon this week refused to provide key details about the Biden administration’s request for an additional $37.7 billion in funding to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s invasion – a request that would put total U.S. taxpayer support to Ukraine above $100 billion since the war started in February.

The White House asked for more money last week in a letter from the Office of Management and Budget to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. That letter explained that of the $37.7 billion it wants, $21.7 billion would go toward ""equipment for Ukraine, replenishment of Department of Defense stocks"" and other support to Ukraine.

However, when asked Tuesday how much of that amount would be directed toward replenishing U.S. stocks, the Pentagon declined to answer.

""I would not be able to tell you how much of that $21.7 billion is going back to replenishment,"" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, said when asked. ""I just wouldn’t be able to do that from here.""

US POISED FOR SLOWDOWN IN HIGH-END MUNITIONS DELIVERIES TO UKRAINE

When asked if she could ""take the question"" back to the Pentagon and come back with an answer, Singh said she would not.

""I am not going to take the question because I'm answering your question,"" he said. ""I'm not going to be able to itemize that out right now. I just don't have a number or a dollar figure for you right now on what that looks like, and I don't think that's something that we would broadcast from here, or at least something that I could broadcast from here at this time.""

The administration will most likely have to provide more details to Congress before legislation can be passed authorizing more Ukraine spending. For example, the first Ukraine funding bill sought by the administration at the start of the war authorized $40 billion in spending. Of that amount, $6 billion was used to provide weapons, equipment, logistics support, training and other direct military aid to Ukraine, and $9 billion went toward replenishing U.S. weapons stocks.

Lawmakers and others are growing increasingly interested in funding to replenish U.S. weapons stocks, after the U.S. has been depleting its own supplies to aid Ukraine.

MOSCOW CONDEMNS US RESPONSE TO ALLEGED WAR CRIMES AGAINST RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN UKRAINE

In October, sources who track U.S. munitions supplies said it will become more and more difficult to send high-end weaponry like HIMAR rocket launchers, Javelin anti-tank missiles and others because domestic supplies are so low.

In early October, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., proposed legislation aimed at making sure the U.S. restores its depleted stocks and kickstarts production of these items in the U.S.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the United States’ stockpile of munitions is dangerously low. We must reinvest not only in the munitions critical for the defense of America, but also in a workforce that can build these weapons to ensure our military’s readiness,"" Cotton said in October.

ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA SEEKS TRUCE TO ‘REGAIN STRENGTH,' CALLS ON US ALLIES TO ENFORCE 10-STEP PEACE PLAN

Some Republicans have complained that the large spending bills being used to support Ukraine are filled with non-military items that raise their cost, and the White House request includes billions in non-military spending.

For example, within the White House’s latest request for $37.7 billion is a $14.5 billion request that would fund additional security aid to Ukraine that would be run by the State Department, and food security aid run through the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The White House also wants another $626 million for ""nuclear security support"" in Ukraine and for modernizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ""reduce domestic energy costs."" The White House says most of that money would be used to build back the oil reserve.

Finally, the White House wants another $900 million to provide health care services to Ukraine through the Department of Health and Human Services.

Austin boasted of U.S. spending on support of Ukraine over the past year, reflecting on $32 billion worth of assistance that includes ""more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; more than 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems; 232 howitzers and more than two million rounds of artillery ammunition; 38 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and ammunition; a Patriot air-defense battery; eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and other key air-defense capabilities; 109 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles; 31 Abrams tanks; and 90 Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers.""

The trip is the first time Biden has traveled to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion one year ago.

Biden was expected to visit Poland on Monday to mark the one-year anniversary since the war began but instead embarked on a nearly 10-hour train ride from the Polish border to visit Ukraine's capital.

He noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""dead wrong"" in believing Ukraine was weak when he launched his invasion a year ago.

""I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine.""

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" he continued.

Biden also said he is looking forward to meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda and the leaders of our Eastern Flank Allies as the U.S. looks to continue rallying the world to support Ukraine.

"Russia hopes classified document scandal upends Biden, creates hurdle to more Ukraine funding","Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS is putting out the word that the discovery of classified documents in President Biden’s home and former office space means a weaker Biden presidency — one that may have trouble securing more money to arm Ukraine in its war with Russia.

One policy expert interviewed by TASS said that Biden’s standing in the eyes of the U.S. public would likely slip even as major U.S. media outlets work to defend him.

""If there are any consequences for the president, they will be not so much legal as political. In other words, his reputation will suffer,"" said Andrey Kortunov, general director of the Russian International Affairs Council. ""However, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN tend to support Biden. Most likely they will throw their weight behind the Democratic Party in its attempts to play down this scandal.""

BIDEN'S COMPETENCE QUESTIONED AS CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS SCANDAL CONTINUES: ‘INCREDIBLY CARELESS’

But Kortunov predicted Republicans would use the scandal to ""tip the political scales in their favor against the Democrats,"" while another analyst seemed to welcome the idea of the GOP using the scandal as a basis to stop sending military aid to Ukraine.

Documents discovered in Biden’s former office and current home reportedly deal with intelligence matters related to Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom. Dmitry Suslov, deputy head of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the National Research University Higher School of Economics, seemed hopeful that the GOP would use that fact against Biden the next time he seeks billions in new aide to Ukraine.

CONSERVATIVES BLAST BIDEN OVER LATEST BATCH OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FOUND: 'FBI RAID HAPPENS WHEN?'

""It was none other than Biden who oversaw the Ukrainian track in the Obama administration,"" Suslov said. ""The way I see it, the Republicans will not miss the chance to capitalize on this factor to the maximum extent to complicate the process of allocating more money for Ukraine.""

House Republicans have opposed the broad funding proposals put forward by the Biden administration and congressional Democrats. However, many have said they would continue to support Ukraine funding, although that funding might be in small chunks that are focused only on Ukraine’s direct military needs.

Another Russian expert, Andrey Koshkin, head of the political science department at the G.V. Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, said the scandal would likely weigh heavily on a president who is not popular among Americans.

BIDEN'S ‘IRRESPONSIBLE’ HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCS BIGGER ‘LEAKAGE’ RISK THAN TRUMP'S, EXPERTS SAY

""Society is very unhappy with such a president,"" Koshkin said. ""The loss of economic, social and domestic well-being is another factor on the debit side of his balance sheet.""

Rebekah Koffler — president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting, a former DIA intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook"" — said the point of the TASS story is likely to dishearten Ukraine and create new worries that the U.S. will be a less enthusiastic contributor to its defense effort.

""That’s the primary target, but not the only target,"" Koffler said of Ukraine. ""The second target is the U.S. audience, to influence our opinion.

Koffler said 47% of Americans are wary of continued high levels of spending for Ukraine, and she said Russia is trying to take advantage of that split but running the English-only news story.

""They’re trying to sow more division and discourage the US from providing more help,"" she said.

""It is not ready to be turned on,"" Nuland said. ""It has not been tested, it has not been certified, it has not met the regulatory pieces that would allow it to be turned on both on the German side and the EU side.

""As Sen. Cruz likes to say, ‘It is currently a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean’,"" she added. ""No gas will flow through it until those things happen.""

Berlin prompted some cause for concern earlier this month when reports surfaced that suggested sanctioning the pipeline to circumvent Russian aggression in Eastern Europe was an unpopular solution in Germany.

But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz countered these reports and said he would ensure the newly instated government would abide by the July agreement reached by President Biden and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

If allowed to fully function, the controversial pipeline would funnel gas from Russia through Germany under the Baltic Sea — bypassing an existing pipeline that runs into Ukraine.

""We are working on a strong package of sanctions"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told parliament Thursday, noting that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was just one of the economic areas of interest, according to Radio Free Europe.

The White House and NATO have been diligent in their messaging and claim the alliance holds a united front, particularly following the presidential address last week when Biden suggested otherwise.

""As the president said earlier this week, we are unified,"" Nuland told reporters Thursday. ""If Moscow rejects our offer of dialogue, costs must be swift and severe.""

Relations between the U.S., NATO and Russia have remained tense, and the Kremlin has yet to dismantle its 100,000-troop presence amassed along Ukraine’s border.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded guarantees from the west that NATO will not be allowed to expand into Kyiv and that strike weapons will not be placed in Ukraine.

The U.S. and NATO have flatly rejected a membership ban into the 30-nation alliance, but Biden has suggested that negotiations on strike weapons placement could be negotiated.

Sullivan won’t say whether US will back Ukraine in retaking Crimea,"National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan refused to say Sunday whether the United States would support Ukraine in trying to retake Crimea, the peninsula that was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014.

During an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sullivan repeatedly argued that Ukraine itself would have to define victory against Russia. Anchor Chuck Todd then reminded Sullivan that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defined victory last year when he said, ""This Russian war ... began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – with its liberation.""

""President Zelenskyy did define victory, what he thought victory looked like in August of last year,"" Todd told Sullivan on Sunday. ""There's always been a hesitancy among U.S. officials, Jake, and I know you're included here, about Crimea specifically. And it's always been, ‘Well, it's up to Ukraine.’ Well, President Zelenskyy said it – victory is all of the territory back. Why don't we say the same thing now?""

Sullivan sidestepped the question, saying the U.S. would support Ukraine’s efforts to take back its ""internationally recognized borders.""

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY PREDICTS PUTIN WILL FALL TO OWN PEOPLE: RUSSIANS WILL ‘FIND A REASON TO KILL THE KILLER’

""Well, we have repeatedly talked about Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders,"" Sullivan said. ""The question for us is how do we put Ukraine in the best position on the battlefield so that they are ultimately in the best position at the negotiating table. And President Zelenskyy as recently as this week has said we're going to have to ultimately get to a diplomatic phase of this conflict.""

""So from our perspective, our goal is to strengthen the hands of the Ukrainians on the battlefield so that they are in the strongest position with the most leverage when they get to the negotiating table to ultimately achieve an outcome that restores Ukraine's full sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said.

""If they want to take Crimea militarily, will the United States help Ukraine do that?"" Todd pressed again, to no avail.

""Chuck, the critical thing right now is that they need to take back the territory in the south and the east that they are currently focused on, and we need to give them the tools to be able to do that,"" Sullivan responded.

""The question of Crimea, and the question of what happens down the road is something that we will come to,"" he said. ""Where we are right now, is that we need to be focused on the immediate term, because it is critical that we move fast and we move decisively to help them take back the territory across that line of contact that Russian troops are currently occupying.""

"Ukraine aid opened the floodgates for more Pentagon spending as US eyes Russia, China","America's aid campaign for Ukraine has opened the doors for a surge in domestic defense spending, both to refill stockpiles of weapons sent overseas and to bolster U.S. readiness against near-peer rivals.

President Biden requested $813 for the Pentagon for 2023, but Congress appears poised to pass an $858 billion budget plan. If passed, the money will go toward purchasing missiles for the Army, new weapons systems for the Navy and expanding ammunition plants, among other things, the New York Times reported Sunday.

The traditional measure of U.S. military readiness has been its capacity to supply and carry out two major conflicts in separate areas of the globe. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued last week that U.S. support for Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in that readiness.

""We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,"" Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes told NYT. ""So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.""

China's recent aggression toward Taiwan has also contributed to calls for more spending. Aid to the self-governed island has already been delayed, thanks in large part to the flow of weapons to Ukraine.

The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since February, so much that President Biden's administration is struggling to keep track of how the aid is being used. The volume of U.S. aid to the country has given rise to some skeptics within the Republican Party, who are calling for greater accountability.

Nevertheless, funding conflicts with near-peer rivals is far more expensive than the asymmetric warfare the U.S. military has largely engaged in this century.

The potential $858 billion budget would represent a 4.3% annual increase over the past two years, according to NYT.

And the U.S. isn't the only one. Allies like Japan have also announced ramped-up military spending in the face of growing Chinese aggression. Sullivan congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on his administration's new Defense Buildup Program on Friday.

It instructs Treasury to commence ""immediate efforts"" with other governments and commercial creditors to ""pursue comprehensive debt payment relief for Ukraine.""

The language talks only about debt payment relief, and not forgiveness of the assistance given to Ukraine this year to defend itself from to Russia’s invasion.

The U.S. is by far the largest contributor of aid to Ukraine, in the form of weapons, equipment, logistics support, training and other aid to the war-torn country. The U.S. has also provided billions of dollars in economic support to Ukraine, enough to account for a majority of Ukraine’s annual budget.

Russia-Ukraine war: Congress eyes MiG-29 fighter jet transfer as next White House pressure point,"A growing and bipartisan group in Congress is pushing President Biden to facilitate the transfer of Poland's MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine amid Russia's brutal invasion, despite statements by the U.S. military that such a move would be high-risk, low-reward.

The White House is leaning on that position from the military in its opposition to providing the jets, including that Ukraine does not really need the aircraft. But Biden already ceded to pressure from Congress to take a tougher stance against Russia multiple times since the war started. And dozens more members from both parties Sunday called on the president to help Ukraine get its hands on the Polish fighter jets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is petitioning for.

""We, the 58 members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, urge continued U.S. commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine and the freedom of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russia’s ongoing invasion,"" the moderate, bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus (PSC) said Sunday. ""We strongly believe that the U.S. must provide additional defense materiel to Ukrainians protecting their nation.""

UKRAINIAN PREGNANT WOMAN, BABY DIE AFTER RUSSIAN AIRSTRIKE ON MATERNITY HOSPITAL: LIVE UPDATES

The PSC went on to call on Biden to help give the Ukrainians Stinger missiles, drones and Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets that Poland is offering to send to Ukraine.

The Biden administration almost immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine imposed harsh sanctions against Russia. Then it leveled even more sanctions targeting Russia's financial institutions after pressure from Congress. Then Congress pressed for a ban on Russian oil imports. The House was going to pass a bill to that effect before Biden finally announced the ban last week.

Now, after initially signaling an openness to helping make the MiG-29 transfer happen, the White House appears to have shut the door on the possibility, to the chagrin of many in Congress.

Enough talk, people are dying. Send them the planes that they need. They say they need MiGs. People say, ‘Well, maybe that's not the ideal weapon for them.' That's what they say they want. They're there.""

HOW MISCALCULATIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS COULD LEAD TO US-RUSSIA CONFLICT

""When we say we're going to do something, and we don't do it, we're sending mixed messages to Putin. And that shows a lack of resolve,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, added on ""Your World,"" last week.

Democrat Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., both backed the provision of the fighter jets in a hearing earlier Thursday.

""There is bipartisan support for providing Ukraine with fighter jets of neighboring countries that they would know how to fly and engage in,"" Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thursday. ""Time is of the essence. The Ukrainians are getting bombarded and they do no have, at least as their country's leaders suggest and assert, the wherewithal to compete in the sky… I don't understand why we are not working expeditiously to facilitate planes to Ukraine.""

""It is disappointing to see the reluctance on the part of the administration and it is coming across as indecision and bickering,"" Shaheen said.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., also told reporters there's really no ""categorical difference between supplying missiles and anti-tank weapons and supplying aircraft."" The U.S. has been supplying missiles and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war, and even before that.

But the president and his allies say those who are pushing for the jets are not thinking about the potential consequences.

PUTIN MAINTAINS 95% OF AVAILABLE COMBAT POWER IN UKRAINE AS WAR PERSISTS: DOD OFFICIAL WARNS

The White House referred to comments from U.S. European Command Commander Gen. Tod D. Wolters when asked about the possibility of helping Polish jets make it into Ukraine.

""We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems, which is on-going with the international community,"" Wolters said in a statement. ""USEUCOM assesses the military usefulness of additional fixed wing air to Ukraine will be high-risk and low gain.""

""The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force… Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low,"" Wolters added. ""Lastly, the intelligence community assesses the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian escalation with NATO...producing a high risk scenario.""

It crosses the border and then it's in Ukraine… Once that plane takes off from Poland. Well, it's an air raid on Russian forces taking off from Poland.""

US leads the rest of the world with $196 billion given to Ukraine amid war with Russia,"The United States continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in promised or sent aid, as the U.S. ally continues its fight against Russia.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

These figures do not include loans sent to Ukraine or additional contributions that were approved by their respective governments between Dec. 2022 and Feb. 2023.

MATT GAETZ RIPS ‘BIPARTISAN COALITION’ THAT FAVORS WAR IN UKRAINE

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited each of these top contributing countries, except Estonia.

The growing figures come as the Ukraine-Russia war nears its one-year mark. Russia first invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

""How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?"" asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. ""Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which redline we set will we not later cross?""

The proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations.

The ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" has at least 10 co-sponsors and calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution notes the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, providing financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

In January, President Biden approved additional security assistance, including 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine. On top of that, reports suggest another $2 billion could be in the pipeline.

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" Biden said last month.

Gaetz’s resolution claims the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties by providing weapons and potentially prolonging what he called an ""everlasting conflict.""

""America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" said Gaetz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ""We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately.""

US sending another $2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine,"The Pentagon announced Thursday that it is sending an additional $2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including 90 Stryker combat vehicles for the first time and another 59 Bradley fighting vehicles.

The latest package will also replenish the U.S.-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, and Avenger air defense systems, which the Pentagon says will ""counter a range of short and medium range threats and bolster Ukraine’s layered air defense.""

Missing from the latest package are M1 Abrams tanks, which Kyiv has been asking for in recent months.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared frustrated over a ""lack of specific weaponry"" at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland on Wednesday.

""There are times where we shouldn’t hesitate or we shouldn’t compare when someone says, ‘I will give tanks if someone else will also share his tanks,'"" Zelenskyy said through a translator.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and other lawmakers across the political spectrum have voiced support for sending U.S. tanks to Ukraine.

""Now, it is the case that Germany's tanks are a little bit better suited for Ukraine's army and their supply and logistics systems,"" Cotton told Dana Perino on ""America's Newsroom"" on Thursday.

US poised for slowdown in high-end munitions deliveries to Ukraine,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signaled this week that the U.S. and its Western allies are having trouble keeping pace with Ukraine’s demand for the advanced weaponry it needs to fend off Russia’s invasion. That signal reflects dwindling supplies for Ukraine and fear in the White House of escalation that could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia.

The risk of reduced U.S. stockpiles of high-end munitions has been reported almost since the U.S. began contributing to Ukraine’s defense. Now, nearly eight months since the start of the war, experts interviewed by Fox News Digital say the U.S. is at or very near the end of its capacity to give.

They agreed that Austin’s remarks indicate that the initial rush of high-end munitions like HIMAR rocket launchers, Javelin anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft Stingers and M-777 Howitzers is over. These sources said there may be two factors at play that are contributing to this reality.

One factor is the issue that Austin addressed directly this week – the U.S. is running low on equipment that it can hand over to Ukraine.

RUSSIA SCRAMBLES TO REPAIR CRIMEA BRIDGE, ZELENSKYY VOWS TO ACCELERATE ‘VICTORY’

At a press conference Wednesday, Austin was asked whether the U.S. and other nations are worried about running so low on domestic supplies of critical munitions that they can no longer help Ukraine. Austin dodged the question by stressing that the desire is there to get Ukraine what it needs, but he left unsaid whether Ukraine’s allies can actually deliver.

""Well, it certainly is not a question of lack of will,"" Austin replied.

Austin had just concluded a meeting with officials from dozens of countries about Ukraine’s munitions needs. As he described that meeting, he again talked about willpower but hinted at strained capacity to provide more for Ukraine, which is using up munitions faster than the world can deliver them.

RUSSIA'S WAGNER GROUP MAKES ‘SOME’ ADVANCES IN DONBAS IN FIRST TACTICAL GAINS SINCE JULY: UK INTEL

""We will produce and deliver these highly effective capabilities over the course of the coming months — and in some cases years — even as we continue to meet Ukraine’s most pressing self-defense requirements in real time,"" Austin said of the most recent commitment to send HIMARS, vehicles, radar systems and other equipment.

Mark Cancian is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic & International Studies who spent seven years working on DOD procurement issues for the Office of Management and Budget. His assessment based on inventory levels, industrial capacity, and information from the Biden administration is that the U.S. has ""limited"" supplies of HIMARs, Javelins, Stingers and M-777 Howitzers.

""There are some areas where we’re basically at the bottom of the barrel,"" he told Fox News Digital.

In some cases, this means the U.S. will likely start meeting Ukraine’s request for weaponry by sending over lower-end substitutions, such as lighter Howitzers that are serviceable but not what Ukraine is after. In other cases, the U.S. may not have much to give – Cancian said that while there is talk of the U.S. providing more air defense equipment, there is not much the U.S. can give in that area.

Cancian said he reads Austin comments as a sign that the days of the U.S. giving Ukraine its best stuff are gone.

NATO HEAD WARNS RUSSIA TO AVOID ‘VERY IMPORTANT LINE’ AHEAD OF NUCLEAR TESTS

""It confirmed what I believe, that we will continue support Ukraine, but we’re going to have to do it in different ways, like providing substitutes, or we might have to buy stuff from other people, or it will take longer,"" he said. ""That it won’t be quite the same.""

He said this runs the risk of creating what he called a ""petting zoo of NATO equipment"" in Ukraine – relatively small numbers of many types of equipment that could create compatibility issues.

Some on Capitol Hill are reading Austin’s remark differently that leads to largely the same result – that the Biden administration is purposefully slowing down the transfer of critical munitions to Ukraine, because it is increasingly worried about stumbling into a direct conflict with Russia.

A congressional aide with working knowledge of these issues told Fox News Digital that while officials are hinting at limited supplies, there is still room to give more, and that the slowdown is because of a different calculation the Biden administration is making.

""They are afraid of escalation,"" this aide said.

Just last week, President Biden openly talked about the ""Armageddon"" scenario that could unfold if Russia tried to win the war with a tactical nuclear strike. The congressional aide interpreted Austin’s remarks as a sign the administration is more and more worried about crossing a line that might force that outcome.

Another sign of U.S. caution, the aide said, is that the administration allowed nearly $2.8 billion in authority to supply Ukraine with weapons to expire a few weeks ago, at the end of fiscal year 2022. Some on Capitol Hill are reading that as an indication that the administration is finding its own comfort level when it comes to arming Ukraine, and that level stops short of what Congress authorized.

""Congress gave the administration more than it wanted,"" the aide said. The Defense Department declined to respond to questions from Fox News Digital about the expiration of this authority.

RUSSIA USING IRANIAN-MADE ‘KAMIKAZE DRONES’ TO STRIKE AROUND KYIV

There is a related view within Congress that while U.S. stocks of certain munitions have clearly been reduced as the U.S. sends items to Ukraine, that reduction is not a security threat to the United States itself. The aide explained that many of these items were stockpiled largely for use in a possible conflict with Russia, and that conflict is already playing out with Ukraine in the lead.

That conflict is reducing Russia’s military capacity, which means a corresponding drop in U.S. inventories is not putting the U.S. anywhere near a stockpile crisis.

To put it another way: the Biden administration has more flexibility to give Ukraine more but is choosing not to.

National security officials provided more details about Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday, calling the trip unprecedented given the lack of U.S. military infrastructure in the war-torn region. Reporters pressed national security adviser Jake Sullivan on whether the U.S. had warned Moscow that Biden was headed to Kyiv, a city scarred with Russian missile strikes.

""We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv,"" Sullivan told reporters Monday. ""We did so some hours before his departure for de-confliction purposes.""

Sullivan declined to elaborate on how the Russians were notified and whether they responded, however.

Biden himself acknowledged the challenges facing Ukraine in comments during his visit. Large areas of Ukraine remain under Russian control even after months of successful ground offensives from Kyiv's forces.

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" Biden said in a Monday statement.

Sirens could be heard in war-torn Ukraine as Biden arrived in the country. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also announced $5.5 billion in aid for Ukraine as Biden visited with Zelenskyy.

Biden's visit comes just before Russia is expected to ramp up its offensive once again in its own acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Ukrainian officials warned of a massive barrage of missiles that Russia may launch on Friday, Feb. 24.

Vladimir Putin cancels annual press conference as Russia stalls in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin canceled his annual year-end press conference for the first time in 10 years on Tuesday.

The press conferences have regularly lasted up to nearly five hours in past years, but the widely-televised event won't happen this year, with most observers crediting Russia's poor performance in Ukraine in recent weeks. Sentiment against Putin's invasion of Ukraine has also grown steadily within Russia throughout the conflict.

""Although questions are almost certainly usually vetted in advance, the cancelation is likely due to increasing concerns about the prevalence of anti-war feeling in Russia,"" the U.K. Defense Ministry wrote in a statement on Twitter. ""Kremlin officials are almost certainly extremely sensitive about the possibility that any event attended by Putin could be hijacked by unsanctioned discussion about the ‘special military operation.’""

Putin kicked off his invasion of Ukraine in February and initially made significant progress. Ukrainian forces, bolstered by tens of billions in funding from the U.S. and allies, stalled the invasion and successfully took back thousands of square miles of occupied territory this fall.

RUSSIAN AGENTS MAY HAVE HACKED FORMER BRITISH PM LIZ TRUSS'S PHONE: REPORT

Putin mobilized 300,000 military reservists in September, a move that triggered a wave of military-age men to flee the country out of fear of a general draft. The infusion of fresh troops does not appear to have had much impact on the front lines, however.

EXPLAINER: DIRTY BOMBS ARE DEVICES USED TO CREATE FEAR AND PANIC, ACTUALLY CAUSE FEW DEATHS

As a result, Putin's strategy has largely shifted away from land grabs. Putin's military has rained down missiles and shells onto Ukraine's energy and water infrastructure since the late fall. Now many Ukrainian citizens are facing the country's bitter winter with unreliable access to power and other necessities.

President Biden's administration announced an additional $53 billion in aid to assist the country in fixing its power grid and water infrastructure in late November.

In total, the U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began in February.

The Biden administration is already struggling to track those funds, as Republicans warn of impending audits once they take control of the House in January.

A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands. The Biden administration's previous tracking efforts have inspected only a fraction of the aid provided to the country.

"Vladimir Putin gifted Biden a $12,000 pen months before invading Ukraine","Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted President Biden a $12,000 pen and writing set when the pair met for the first time since Biden gained office, according to a new State Department disclosure.

Putin made the gift in 2021 when both leaders met at a presidential summit in Geneva. The White House stated at the time that Biden had given Putin a pair of Aviators sunglasses, but it did not disclose Putin's lavish gift to the president.

State Department records say the gift was given to the National Archives for safekeeping, a common destination for presidential gifts. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital regarding why it hadn't previously disclosed Putin's gift.

The State Department release, first reported by Bloomberg News, describes the gift as a ""Kholuy lacquer miniature workshop desk writing set and pen"" and listed an estimated value of $12,000. Meanwhile, Biden's glasses had a value of a few hundred dollars.

The June 2021 summit came just eight months before Putin would invade Ukraine, dashing hopes of improved relations between the U.S. and Russia.

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP, NEGLECTING EAST PALESTINE, SOUTHERN BORDER: 'THEY CAN KEEP HIM!'

The pen set will likely end up in Biden's presidential library after he leaves office. Gifts granted to U.S. presidents are considered to be the property of the U.S. government, not the individual office-holder. Officials must purchase the items for the estimated price in order to own and use them after leaving office.

Gift-giving among world leaders is an extremely common practice, but Putin's writing set was by far the most expensive gift listed in the State Department's disclosure. For instance, French President Emmanuel Macron also gave Biden a pen, but it was worth just $430. The late Queen of England gave Biden a photo of herself in a silver frame, valued at $2,200.

A reporter asked Jean-Pierre if Biden had any comment for East Palestine Mayor Trent Conway, who said it was a ""slap in the face"" that the president visited Ukraine before visiting his city.

Jean-Pierre pointed to the Biden administration’s efforts since the Feb. 3 derailment, saying agencies were ""on the ground very early on"" with an ""all-hands approach.""

""That is because of this president’s leadership, and that is because of what he has asked his team to do and what he’s asked the agencies to do,"" Jean-Pierre said before reiterating that the administration would hold the rail company Norfolk Southern accountable.

White House declares Russian invasion in Ukraine,"The White House is now calling Russian action in Ukraine an ""invasion,"" saying the ""swift and severe"" sanctions promised by the U.S. are on the way, Fox News has learned.

Russian troops arrived in eastern Ukraine hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would recognize the independence of two separatist regions, officials said.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: WHITE HOUSE DECLARES RUSSIAN 'INVASION', SAYS SANCTIONS COMING: LIVE UPDATES

Russian troops entered in Donbas, the name for the area where the two separatist regions, that have long fought Russia-backed rebels, Donetsk and Luhansk, are located, officials said, noting that they ""consider Donbas part of Ukraine.""

The Kremlin then raised the stakes further Tuesday, by saying that recognition extends even to parts held by Ukrainian forces.

A White House official told Fox News that administration officials are calling it an invasion.

""The invasion has begun,"" the official said. ""So our sanctions response has begun.""

RUSSIAN TROOPS MOVED INTO EASTERN UKRAINE'S BREAKAWAY REGIONS, EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SAY

Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer, during an interview on CNN Tuesday morning, was pressed on whether Russia’s latest activities would be considered an invasion.

""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine, and you're already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe,"" Finer said.

When pressed again, Finer said: ""I hear an invasion as an invasion and that is what is underway.""

But Finer noted that Russia has been ""invading Ukraine since 2014"" and have been occupying a ""large piece"" of Ukraine since then as well.

""Although they have denied it, Russian troop presence in exactly the two—what they call republics, but they’re really provinces of a sovereign Ukraine—that they recognized yesterday,"" Finer said, referring to Putin’s recognition of the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""So, Russia is essentially making overt what it has denied for some time, which is Russian troop presence in these places, and we’re taking steps in response to that,"" Finer said.

Pressed further, Finer again called the activities an invasion.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE: GERMANY STOPPING NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE APPROVAL

""I mean, again, I guess for the third or fourth time, I am calling it an invasion,"" he said. ""We are taking a severe response, including sanctions on Russia that will be rolling out in a matter of hours.""

As for sanctions, Finer told CNN that the public is ""already seeing the beginning of our response that we have said will be swift and severe.""

Finer pointed to President Biden’s executive order on Monday, which he said effectively blocked ""all economic activity"" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Finer said administration officials later Tuesday would announce ""additional sanction steps"" that they plan to take ""that go directly at Russia"" in response to ""the egregious step that they took yesterday away from diplomacy and down the further path toward war.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday morning said President Biden has ""made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward.""

Germany overnight said it is taking steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia over Moscow’s latest actions in eastern Ukraine.

""We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement,"" Psaki added. ""We will be following up with our own measures today.""

The 764-mile pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Germany has not begun operating. Nord Stream 2 is owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary of Russia state company Gazprom.

Earlier this month, Biden promised to ""bring an end"" to Nord Stream 2 if Russia invaded Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, appearing with Biden on his first official visit to Washington, was far less explicit about stopping Nord Stream 2, but said that the U.S. and Germany would have the same approach on punishing Russia financially.

The Nord Stream 2 has seen a faster development and deployment despite sanctions placed on it by the Trump administration. With those sanctions removed, Germany remains keen to see the pipeline activated sooner rather than later.

Scholz had insisted that the pipeline is a ""business project,"" according to German outlet DW.

Biden last year removed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, allowing construction and activation to proceed.

The plan to allow Russia to develop the pipeline to create leverage in times of political crisis may have backfired, as Germany has also rapidly grown dependent on the completion and activation of the pipeline.

White House says 'no indication' of misused Ukraine funds after Marjorie Taylor Greene calls for audit,"National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby told reporters in a White House briefing on Friday that there is ""no indication"" that any of the billions of dollars in defense aid the U.S. has sent to Ukraine has been misplaced or stolen as GOP lawmakers push for an audit.

On a call with reporters, Kirby said the White House takes accountability for the funds Congress has appropriated for Ukraine ""seriously"" and that the American people deserve to know their tax dollars are being spent wisely.

""We have seen no indication to date that any of the resources or weapons we've provided to Ukraine have been misused, misplaced, stolen, sold on the black market or captured by the Russians,"" Kirby said.

Alluding to how war can obscure some of the government's spending for Ukraine, Kirby said the White House is both supportive of and grateful for congressional oversight and welcomes accountability measures, noting that an inspector general is ""on the job"" to oversee how security assistance funding to the Ukrainians is administered.

Kirby's comments were made in response to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who announced on Thursday that she will file legislation to force an audit of the billions of dollars the U.S. has sent to Ukraine.

""I'm going to force Congress to give the American people an audit,"" Greene told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

Greene said an audit is needed ""because we have no idea where all this money's going.""

She said she would introduce a resolution of inquiry in the House of Representatives on Friday, which would begin the process of requesting information from the executive branch.

BIDEN ADMIN SCRAMBLES TO TRACK $20B IN UKRAINE AID AS HOUSE REPUBLICANS WARN OF AUDITS

Greene introduced the same resolution in November, when it gained support from House Republicans across the ideological spectrum and was narrowly defeated by a Democratic-led panel. However, Republicans were not in the majority at the time and in is unclear if they will continue to support an effort to audit Ukraine aid.

""I'm introducing this resolution, and I'm looking forward to seeing my Republican colleagues support it,"" Greene told Carlson.

She accused President Biden's administration of being ""so disconnected with what the American people want that they are literally going to lead us into World War III.""

""There’s not bipartisan support among the American people for fighting a war in Ukraine that does nothing for Americans except force them to pay for it,"" she added.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV, UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

Democrats (66%) favor supporting Ukraine until Russia is repelled, while Republicans (61%) want to set a time limit on U.S. support. Independents were split 49% in favor of a time limit and 45% in favor of sticking with Ukraine for as long as it takes.

The Biden administration on Friday announced several new actions in support of Ukraine's defense against Russia, including $2 billion in a new defense package, crushing economic sanctions on Russia's mining, tech, and electronics sectors, as well as financial institutions that support the nation's military supply chains, and new limitations on exports to Russia and higher tariffs on imported Russian goods.

"After Ukraine, Russian cyberattacks could come to US: How to defend yourself","Between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing cyberattacks, experts are warning about malicious cyber activity directed at the U.S., and some U.S. security pros spoke to Fox News about how to defend against technological assaults.

Russia is not likely to take President Biden’s new sanctions sitting down and has proven to be highly adept at cyber warfare, which has become part and parcel of active ""kinetic"" wars in the 21st century.

""This is not something to take lightly — cyber attacks don’t have borders,"" Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a tweet.

""I remain particularly concerned about the reports of cyber attacks…There’s historical precedent to suggest these could be devastating for individuals, businesses, and entire countries,"" Warner said in another tweet.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Russia has already launched what appears to be a series of cyberattacks on targets in the Ukraine. This past week, cyberattacks impacted the websites of several Ukrainian government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, according to Ukrainian officials. This follows cyberattacks on Ukrainian government sites and banks that have been attributed to the Russian military spy agency GRU.

How to defend yourself from Russian cyber warfare ‘spillover’

As Sen. Warner suggested, cyberattacks don’t have borders. As a result, cyber spillover campaigns could reach the U.S.

""With the Ukraine conflict now front and center and poised to widen, we expect a surge of cybersecurity attacks from Russia state-sponsored organizations,"" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, told Fox News in a written statement.

Here’s what to watch out for and how to defend yourself, according to cybersecurity experts that Fox News spoke with.

--Ransomware: The bane of InfoSec professionals, ransomware attacks lock out companies and individuals from critical data. Attackers then demand hefty payments. ""Businesses across the U.S. should be bracing for a variety of cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware,"" said John Dickson, vice president at Coalfire, a Westminster, Colorado-based provider of cybersecurity advisory services.

""Make sure that all critical and all internet-facing systems are fully patched to mitigate ransomware and data destruction,"" Lou Steinberg, cyber expert and founder of CTM Insights, told Fox News. ""Use multi-factor authentication to log in to critical systems … and to prevent unauthorized changes (like turning off power or opening a valve on a dam),"" Steinberg said.

--Denial of service attacks: Denial of Service, which renders critical computer services unavailable, and ransomware attacks are often ""outsourced,"" according Steinberg. ""Rather than the government directly performing them, they tend to be done by groups who believe they are being patriots by defending Russia's interests. It’s in [that] government's interest to enable this as it gives them deniability. You can’t trace an attack back to the Kremlin,"" Steinberg explained.

These outsourced actors ""may be less capable"" so companies can protect themselves if they take prudent cybersecurity measures, according to Steinberg.

AFT boss Randi Weingarten ripped for Ukraine trip,"The boss of the American Federation of Teachers is on a field trip — all the way to the Ukraine — on a visit paid in part by dues-paying rank and file members of her union.

Randi Weingarten told FoxNews.com she arrived in Kiev on Thursday as part of a delegation of teacher union leaders from five nations, including the United Kingdom, Poland, Denmark and Bulgaria, as an act of solidarity and to “promote democratic values.” The tab for the trip was split by AFT’s 1.5 million members and the Trade Union of Education and Science Workers of Ukraine (STESU), which invited the union bigwig.

Weingarten told FoxNews.com during a brief telephone interview from a coffee shop in Kiev that AFT has had a longstanding tradition of supporting democratic institutions around the world.

“It’s always been a part of who we are,” said Weingarten. “I decided it was important enough to go, and the most important thing I’ve learned during this trip is that the Russian propaganda about how the Ukrainian government is fragile and destabilizing is totally and completely wrong.”

But at least one critic said Weingarten should focus more on pressing domestic issues.

“It doesn’t sound like it’s really a policy matter; more publicity than policy,"" said Ted O’Neil, spokesman for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a Michigan-based nonprofit educational group. ""I would like to hear her say that her next trip with be here to Michigan to try and help Detroit’s public school, which is an AFT affiliate, rather than globetrotting.”

Weingarten, who earns $407,323 per year, did not indicate the cost of three-day trip, but said some of the expenses incurred by her and an assistant were paid by their Ukrainian union hosts. Weingarten said she sought to provide advice and to have “conversations about democracy and how to promote democratic values,” as well as to help repair the union’s central office building in Maidan Square, which was demolished by local police.

“And what we’ve seen is that people are clearly worried about safety,” Weingarten continued. “And the educators are very worried about what’s going to happen with public educations. There’s a lot of worry here.” Weingarten, who said she’s staying near Kiev University in the city’s downtown district, is scheduled to leave early Saturday.

The delegation was led by Education International, a global union federation of teachers and education support employees representing roughly 30 million members. The union’s general secretary, Fred van Leeuwen, is now seeking help to relocate STESU’s offices and to reestablish its contact with regional and local chapters.

“We must help them get back on their feet as the teachers’ organizations of the Ukraine play a vital role in uniting the country and strengthening the democratic movement,” he said in a statement.

But O'Neil said some teachers earning $40,000 per year and forced to pay union dues may be hard-pressed to understand why their leader is needed in Ukraine.

“It really points out why policies such as Right to Work are so important because I don’t necessarily know that this is what union dues should go for,” O’Neil said. “I’m sure there are a lot of AFT members who would be surprised to learn that their union is taking up foreign policy, so to speak.”",https://www.foxnews.com/us/aft-boss-randi-weingarten-ripped-for-ukraine-trip,N/A
"Elon Musk, Lindsey Graham feud over US handling of Ukraine-Russia War, referendum elections","Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Elon Musk are feuding over how the United States should handle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the result of their disagreement could prompt a shift in U.S. policy, the lawmaker suggested.

Musk, the founder of Telsa and CEO of SpaceX, offered a ""solution"" to the Russia-Ukraine War that included Ukraine handing over Crimea to Russia and Ukraine staying out of NATO, in return, Russia should quit any further militaristic invasion.

The lawmaker disagreed.

""With all due respect to Elon Musk - and I do respect him - I would suggest he needs to understand the facts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" Graham tweeted Wednesday.

PUTIN SIGNS LAWS ANNEXING 4 UKRAINIAN REGIONS OF DONETSK, LUHANSK, KHERSON AND ZAPORIZHZHIA

Musk, advocating for a more democratic approach, said the U.S. should respect the outcome of some referendum elections in Eastern Ukraine, which resulted in several Ukrainian regions voting to join Russia.

Experts believed elections in four Ukrainian regions — where Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia voted to join Russia — were orchestrated by the Russian government and conducted by pro-Russia separatists.

He said in a later tweet Kherson and Zaporizhzhia ""almost certainly do not want to join Russia"" but they were annexed by Russia ""to ensure a land bridge and water supply to Crimea.""

In February, Russia invaded Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine did not observe the results of similar elections in the eastern regions which similarly voted in Russia’s favor.

""Assuming you believe that the will of the people matters, we should, in any given conflict region, support the will of those who live there,"" Musk tweeted in response to the South Carolina Republican.

Musk added: ""Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia.""

FORMER CHINESE STATE MEDIA EDITOR THREATENS ELON MUSK ON TWITTER, WARNS HE WILL BE ‘TAUGHT A LESSON’

The Tesla founder also provided an unsourced electoral map, which he suggested shows Eastern Ukraine’s interest in becoming Russian.

A defiant Graham called Musk’s plan ""dumb"" and an ""affront"" to Ukraine’s defense of their country.

""Suggesting we end the Russian invasion by simply giving Russia parts of Ukraine - after all the suffering - is dumb,"" Graham tweeted. ""It is also an affront to the bravery of the Ukrainians fighting to defend their homeland.""

The senator also shared his own idea for a solution: Russia should observe the terms of their own 1994 agreement which included honoring the territorial integrity of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, he said.

NORTH KOREA SIDES WITH RUSSIA IN ANNEXATION OF UKRAINE

Graham ended the debacle suggesting the U.S. should direct its attention to changing electric vehicle tax credit, which intends to allow more Americans to purchase electric vehicles, as it benefits the Musk-owned Tesla.

""While we’re at it, maybe the Congress should revisit the electric vehicle tax credit boondoggle. It is where the credit is now solely benefiting electric vehicle manufacturers who have increased prices equal to the tax credit!"" the lawmaker said.

He added: ""It could be a good way to help save money by applying those funds to assisting Ukrainians in defending their homeland.""

US transfers military weapons stockpile from Israel to Ukraine,"The U.S. has transferred thousands of artillery shells from a military weapons stockpile in Israel to Ukraine for weapons aid.

The Israeli stockpile has traditionally been used to arm U.S. forces operating in the Middle East. The U.S. has begun relying on it to arm Ukrainians, however, as U.S. aid to the country cuts deeper and deeper into stores, the New York Times reported.

The stockpile in Israel is the second major store of weapons the U.S. has begun to drain, as it has also turned to stores in South Korea in recent months.

The location of the stores is politically sensitive, however, as both Israel and South Korea have vowed not to provide lethal aid to Ukraine. Neither of the countries has officially broken that promise, but some fear Russia could argue that allowing the U.S. to siphon arms from their stockpiles constitutes such aid, according to the Times.

China edges closer to sending lethal aid to Russia as UN votes to condemn invasion of Ukraine: report,"Russia is in talks with China to purchase 100 combat drones, according to a new report published just days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had evidence Beijing was weighing lethal aid to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

Der Spiegel reports that Moscow is looking to commission a Chinese manufacturer to mass produce the drones – with a delivery date as early as April.

Per the report, Xian Bingo Intelligent Aviation Technology, a Chinese drone manufacturer, has said it was prepared to make 100 prototypes of its ZT-180 drone, which carry a 35-50 kg warhead.

The drones are similar to Iran’s Shaheed-136, which Russia has used to kill hundreds of Ukrainians and damage infrastructure.

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Bingo had plans to establish a productive site for the drones in Russia.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Fox News Digital has contacted the State Department for comment on the report but did not hear back before publication.

Former intelligence officer Rebekah Koffler argued that China's decision calculus is ""entirely rational"" as helping Russia militarily keeps the U.S. bogged down in Ukraine and focusing on the European theater as Beijing eyes Taiwan.

""The biggest challenge for the United States would be to have to be engaged in two wars simultaneously, albeit by proxy – one with Russia, on behalf of Ukraine, and the other with China, on behalf of Taiwan,"" Koffler said. ""There are concerns within the Pentagon about how long U.S. stockpile would last if Russia and China were to challenge us in a two-theater war.""

The Der Spiegel report comes days after Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price warned Wednesday there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Also on Thursday, the U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution that calls for Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine and withdraw its forces. The resolution, drafted by Ukraine in consultation with its allies, passed 141-7, with 32 abstentions.

Friday will mark one year since Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The war has killed tens of thousands on both sides, has reduced entire Ukrainian cities to ruins, and its impact has been felt worldwide in higher food and fuel costs and rising inflation.

China releases 12-point peace plan for Russia-Ukraine war,"The People's Republic of China has called for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, releasing a 12-point ""peace plan"" on the one-year anniversary of the invasion.

China's position paper calls for an immediate end of violence in Ukraine and a return to dialogues with the aim of ending the conflict through diplomacy.

""All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiraling out of control,"" the peace plan states. ""All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire.""

CHINA TIGHTENS TIES WITH RUSSIA, CLAIMING BOTH PROMOTE 'WORLD PEACE' DESPITE UKRAINE WAR

China's plan for peace, outlined in 12 points, consists of the following: Respecting the sovereignty of all countries; Abandoning the Cold War mentality; Ceasing hostilities; Resuming peace talks; Resolving the humanitarian crisis; Protecting civilians and prisoners of war; Keeping nuclear power plants safe; Reducing strategic risks; Facilitating grain exports; Stopping unilateral sanctions; Keeping industrial and supply chains stable; Promoting post-conflict reconstruction.

A key complaint of the position paper is the increasing influence of military blocs across the globe, which China asserts pits nations against each other — China has historically expressed contempt for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""The security of a country should not be pursued at the expense of others. The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs,"" the paper stated. ""The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly. There is no simple solution to a complex issue.""

""The international community should stay committed to the right approach of promoting talks for peace, help parties to the conflict open the door to a political settlement as soon as possible, and create conditions and platforms for the resumption of negotiation.""

China promised to play a ""constructive role"" in peace negotiations.

Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski killed in Ukraine,"Veteran Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski has died after his vehicle was struck by incoming fire in Horenka, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, on Monday, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott announced Tuesday.

Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, 24, was also killed alongside Zekrzewski, Fox News confirmed later Tuesday. Kuvshynova was serving as a consultant for Fox News on the ground during the course of the Russian invasion.

FOX NEWS JOURNALIST KUVSHYNOVA KILLED IN UKRAINE

Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall was with Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova while newsgathering and was also injured. Hall remains hospitalized, Scott said.

""It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we share the news this morning regarding our beloved cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski,"" Scott said.

""Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,"" she added. ""His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched. Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February.""

""His talents were vast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field — from photographer to engineer to editor to producer — and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill,"" Scott continued. ""He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet. He was wildly popular – everyone in the media industry who has covered a foreign story knew and respected Pierre.""

Last year, he played a key role in getting Afghan freelance associates and their families out of the country after the U.S. withdrawal, Scott said. In December at Fox News' annual employee Spotlight Awards, Pierre was given the ""Unsung Hero"" award ""in recognition of his invaluable work,"" she added.

""Pierre was a constant in all of our international coverage. I, like countless others, always felt an extra sense of reassurance when arriving on the scene and seeing him with camera in hand,"" Fox News president and executive editor Jay Wallace said Tuesday. ""The legacy of his positive spirit, boundless energy and eye for the story will carry on.""

""We extend our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife Michelle and family,"" Scott wrote to Fox News Media staff. ""Please keep them all in your prayers. And please continue to pray for Benjamin Hall.""

Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst, who also is on the ground in Kyiv, memorialized his colleague on Tuesday, writing that Zakrzewski was ""as good as they come.""

""I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come,"" Yingst tweeted, sharing a selfie of them together. ""Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you.""

Other Fox News colleagues took to Twitter to remember Zakrzewski.

""Pierre, we miss you. We are devastated,"" White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich wrote.

National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin said, ""Such a fine man. Such a good friend. Such a fantastic war photographer and so much more. RIP Pierre Zakrzewski.""

""I worked with Pierre many times around the world,"" ""America Reports"" co-anchor John Roberts said. ""He was an absolute treasure. Sending our most heartfelt prayers to Pierre's wife and family.""

National correspondent Bryan Llenas reiterated how ""everyone in the industry knew of, admired and adored Fox News war zone photographer Pierre Zakrzewski.""

News of Zakrzewski's death comes two days after another American journalist and former The New York Times contributor, Brent Renaud, was shot and killed near Irpin while headed with a colleague to take photos of refuges fleeing the region outside of Kyiv. His colleague, identified in initial reports as U.S.-based journalist Juan Arredondo, was also wounded and taken to a nearby hospital by Ukrainian rescuers.

Initial reports indicated Renaud and Arredondo came under Russian fire when approaching a bridge in a car. From the roadside shooting scene, a Ukrainian police officer reportedly remarked to PBS correspondent Jane Ferguson, ""Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday addressed Zakrzewski’s passing at the top of her press conference, noting, ""He is someone who has served in many war zones over the course of time.""

""He was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure working there,"" Psaki said. ""Our thoughts, our prayers are with his family, with the entire community as well.""

With news of second foreign journalist killed in Ukraine in the last two days, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Tuesday acknowledged the ""devastating"" losses of Renaud and Zakrzewski.

"M1 Abrams tanks Biden promised Ukraine may not be sent this year or next, defense official says","The M1 Abrams tanks that President Biden promised to send to Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia may not arrive by the end of this year or potentially the next, a U.S. Army official said Thursday.

Last month, President Biden announced the U.S. military would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine to increase its defensive capabilities against Russia. However, the military does not currently have the available inventory to supply the tanks and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said Thursday that transporting the vehicles to Ukraine ""is not going to be a matter of weeks,"" according to DefenseNews.

""We’re looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks,"" Wormuth told reporters Thursday. She added: ""None of the options that we’re exploring are weeks or two months. There are longer timelines involved, but I think there are options that are less than two years, less than a year-and-a-half.""

On Friday, Feb. 24, the war between Russia and Ukraine reached its one-year anniversary. The Biden administration on Friday did announce $2 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, in the form of laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammo and more, along with new sanctions targeting Russia's economy.

OHIO MANUFACTURING PLANT PLAYS CRITICAL ROLE IN EFFORT TO ARM UKRAINE BY REFURBISHING TANKS

Wormuth said the Army was still determining whether the tanks could be shipped by the end of the year. ""There’s a lot of details still that need to be worked out,"" she said, DefenseNews reported.

RUSSIA REACTS TO US, GERMANY TANK DELIVERIES TO UKRAINE: ‘DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONFLICT’

On Jan. 25, President Biden, joined by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Defense Secretary Antony Blinken, announced the promised vehicles were the ""most capable tanks in the world"" and said they ""will enhance Ukraine’s ability"" on the battlefield.

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" he added at the time.

BIDEN APPROVES SENDING 31 M1 ABRAMS TANKS TO UKRAINE, IN REVERSAL

The announcement came in tandem with German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz saying Berlin would send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine ahead of an expected Russian offensive this Spring.

The next day, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh revealed the U.S. does not have enough M1 Abrams tanks in its stockpile to send to Ukraine.

""We just don’t have these tanks available in excess in our US stocks, which is why it is going to take months to transfer these M1A2 Abrams to Ukraine,"" Singh told the New York Post.

Berlin initially denied Ukraine’s request for tanks but reached an agreement to send the military vehicles as Washington promised to do the same.

Germany suggested unilaterally sending the tank could raise concerns over escalating the war.

The U.S. has already supplied thousands of combat vehicles, including 1,700 Humvees, and pledged to send another 500 armored vehicles of several types to Ukraine earlier this month.

"Russia's invasion of Ukraine failed on numerous fronts, so Putin turns to 'Plan D' to 'save face'","Former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland told Fox News Digital that Russia has fallen back on ""Plan D"" after failing to maintain a protracted siege in Kyiv.

Russia re-evaluated its strategy and on March 25 began to pivot focus toward securing eastern Ukraine, which culminated in the surprise withdrawal from Kyiv and surrounding cities – a move that some intelligence and military experts claim is little more than an attempt to save face after a military disaster.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""Their Plan A was to mass along the border as if to invade, and assume Ukraine would capitulate on NATO membership and Donbas,"" McFarland said. ""When Ukraine did not, Russia’s Plan B was to invade and be in control in a few days.""

""When that didn’t happen Russia moved to Plan C – protracted war and siege,"" she continued. ""When that didn’t work, they’ve moved to Plan D – consolidate in east and a frozen conflict along the border: spin it as a success back home, come back for rest of Ukraine in a few years.""

McFarland said the prevailing belief – hers included – prior to the invasion was that Russia would aim to take the Donbas/eastern provinces. She labeled the full invasion a Russian intelligence and military failure, stressing that Russia failed to anticipate the Ukrainian leaders and people.

""Presumably, they thought Ukrainian leaders had been bought and would flee, and Russia could install a puppet government,"" she added.

PUTIN SHAKES UP LEADERSHIP IN UKRAINE WAR AS DEFENSE OFFICIALS WARN OF EASTWARD FOCUS

Fredrick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, went a step further and said the Donbas region was little more than a ""consolation prize"" to make up for the ""sacrifice"" in Putin’s campaign.

""The overall objective of the invasion was to replace the Zelenskyy government with a government that Moscow could control,"" Kagan said. ""That effort has failed.""

Kagan explained that the ""Putin World"" explanation is that Russia has ""bizarrely"" claimed to have achieved its objective around Kyiv and is now working to secure the land claimed by proxy republics Moscow has recognized.

FORMER UKRAINE PRESIDENT: PUTIN IS CONDUCTING AN ‘ANTI-HUMAN WAR,' ATROCITIES ‘HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY’

But securing those regions could provide a long-term purpose, which is to continue eroding Ukrainian territory and improving future invasion efforts.

""The more Ukrainian territory Russia has the harder it is to keep an independent Ukraine alive over time, and the more opportunities Putin will have to invade again after he’s built up his military or to do other things to achieve his aim to bring down an independent Ukrainian government,"" Kagan argued.

The extreme losses in Ukraine have pushed Russia to ""frantically"" rush to build up the military again, with a more robust conscription effort and other short-cut methods that will allow them to field something of an army.

Ultimately, Kagan believes that as long as Putin or ""Putinism"" remains dominant in Russia, it will continue seeking to destroy an independent Ukraine.

""This was never about Donbas, and it’s also never been about NATO, primarily,"" Kagan said. ""[Putin] does not accept Ukraine has the right to an independent government, he does not accept Ukraine’s sovereignty and he does not accept its existence as an independent state.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/mcfarland-russia-plan-d-after-failing-siege-kyiv,N/A

North Korea soldiers in Ukraine would be logistical 'mess’ Putin won’t 'allow': Russia expert,"Climbing Russian casualties and reports suggesting that Russia is now looking to North Korea to aid its flagging troops raised eyebrows this week as some began to question whether Moscow would drag Pyongyang into its war in Ukraine.

Russia expert and former intelligence officer in Russian doctrine and strategy for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Rebekah Koffler, threw cold water on these claims and said they were ""implausible.""

""The Russian propaganda machine could say that 100,000 North Korean volunteers would fight on behalf of Russia, just to scare the West, but in reality, it’s disinformation,"" she said in answer to questions from Fox News Digital.

RUSSIA CREATES NEW VOLUNTEER GROUND FORCE AS TROOP NUMBERS FLAG, UK INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS EFFECTIVENESS

Reports claiming that North Korea may send up to 100,000 soldiers to aid Russia’s campaign in Ukraine began to circulate on Western and Russian news sites this week after the pro-Kremlin Regnum News Agency released an article earlier this month suggesting as much.

The article dated Aug. 2 said that ""North Korea, through diplomatic channels, made it clear that it is ready to help the LPR [Luhansk People’s Republic] and DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] in strengthening defense[s]"" and ""is ready to transfer up to 100,000 of its soldiers.""

""Pyongyang will be able to transfer its tactical units to the Donbas,"" the article continued.

The report never detailed whether the news outlet obtained the ""diplomatic channels"" referenced in the report but instead pointed to comments made by a Russian member of parliament who championed Pyongyang’s alleged willingness to help.

North Korea in March backed Russia when it joined it and three other nations in voting against a United Nations General Assembly resolution that condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

But Koffler said Pyongyang’s support for Russian President Vladimir Putin does not mean the Kremlin chief would actually allow North Korea to send ground forces into Ukraine.

""Putin will never accept — it’s implausible,"" she said. ""Just think about the sheer scale of it.""

Apart from the fact that Russia and North Korea have not held joint combat training and Pyongyang hasn’t even seen active combat in decades, the logistics of such an alliance would prove tricky.

""The command-and-control aspect of it is impossible. They do not speak Russian,"" Koffler said in reference to the average North Korean soldier. ""How are they going to use Russian weapons systems?""

RUSSIA LAUNCHES IRANIAN SATELLITE INTO SPACE AMID FEARS IT WILL BE USED TO SURVEIL UKRAINE

""It would make more of a mess than it would help,"" she added.

As Russian causalities in Ukraine continue to climb and Moscow continues to increase joint military drills with neighboring Belarus, some have become concerned Putin may add to his fighting force with the help of Minsk.

But Koffler said North Korea does not pose the same threat to the war in Ukraine that Belarus does.

""Remember, Belarussians, Chechens, Buryats, anyone from the former Soviet Union speaks Russian,"" she said. ""They are more integrated. Not only do they have the same, what we call tactics, techniques and procedures, but doctrinally they are on the same page [in their] war-fighting doctrine.""

Koffler said it is more likely that North Koreans could be used to assist Russia with its rebuilding efforts in eastern Ukraine if Moscow is successful in holding off Kyiv from retaking occupied territory.

The Russia expert also suggested Moscow could be looking to Pyongyang to assist its forces with more advanced weaponry like the KN-25 — which outranges the U.S. HIMARS — in the wake of Western arms supplies to Ukraine.

Pentagon awards Raytheon $1.2B bid to supply Ukraine with advanced surface-to-air missile systems,"The U.S. Army awarded a $1.2 billion contract to Raytheon Co., to help Ukraine bolster its air defenses by procuring six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), the Pentagon announced Wednesday.

Washington last month pledged to send Ukraine eight NASAMS as Kyiv and Western nations look to fend off Russia’s constant barrage of missile fire.

Two of the advanced systems are already operating in Ukraine, which have been ""extremely successful,"" according to a report by the U.S. Department of Defense this week.

BIDEN ADMIN PLEDGES ADDITIONAL $53M TO BOLSTER UKRAINE’S POWER GRID

The other six missiles will be sent to Ukraine once they have been built.

The NASAMS were first pledged to Kyiv under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in July, and bids were opened to military contractors for the development of the other six systems.

Providing arms to Ukraine under the USAI enables the Biden administration to procure weapons for Ukraine from industry contractors rather than using presidential drawdowns to send arms from existing weapons stocks.

The Raytheon contract also includes providing Ukraine with associated equipment, services and spare parts to keep the advanced air defense systems operational.

The work to develop the NASAMS, which will be performed in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, will be completed by Nov. 28, 2025.

Chief weapons buyer for the Army, Doug Bush, confirmed last week that the U.S. was accelerating its weapons acquisition process to more effectively replenish its weapons stocks as the war in Ukraine continues, reported Reuters.

""Acquisition speed and agility is a top priority,"" Bush said in a statement Wednesday. ""The rapid award of this contract is another example of the Army’s ability to accelerate the delivery of critical capabilities through our industry partners to our allies.""

"Putin sends Chechen fighters to Ukraine, with results unclear","Vladimir Putin’s move to send the battle-hardened and much-feared Chechen fighters to reinforce his invasion into Ukraine might have initially backfired, according to reports coming out of Ukraine.

Observers said the soldiers could have been sent in as headhunters to kill or capture senior Ukrainian politicians, but they say those initial efforts have been thwarted by Ukraine’s military.

The Chechens are part of a Russian national guard unit and are well known for fighting insurgencies, using brutal tactics that even jolted Russia during its two brutal wars in the '90s against them. The Chechens have been employed to hunt down terrorists in Syria and used by Russia to fight elsewhere, including in Georgia. They also fought the Ukrainians in Donbas when hostilities began there in 2014.

The Chechen Republic is a predominantly Muslim region in the Caucuses, and while it's still part of Russia, it has been granted a lot of autonomy by Putin, who is close to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov announced this weekend that his troops were in Ukraine.

Reports on their number varied from 7,000 to tens of thousands. Kadyrov said he supported Putin’s decision to invade and that his troops, ""will carry out his orders under any circumstances,"" Reuters reported. He also claimed none of his troops have died or suffered injuries, according to Reuters.

Yet, unconfirmed reports coming out of Kyiv claimed Ukrainian forces had taken out some 56 Chechen tanks and killed one of its high-ranking commanders on the way to the capital. While the Chechen leader denied his commander’s death, if true, observers said, even this early on in the campaign it could be a problem for Putin, given the massive fight of resistance being put on by Ukrainian military forces against the Russian aggressor.

Theodore Karasik, a fellow on Russia and Middle East affairs at the Jamestown Foundation, told Fox News Digital, ""The Chechens are getting hit for now, and it’s based on the fact that they [the Ukrainians] did their homework. They understood how Chechens fight.""

Karasik said even with the Chechens’ historic background of being lethal fighters on the battleground, during these early stages of the invasion, ""instead of the Chechens targeting them, (the Ukrainians) have targeted the Chechens. They got them before they had time to really act. That doesn’t mean the Chechen units are inactive, but they are getting slowed down tremendously in these first few days.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Karasik, who has written a book on Russia's actions in the Middle East, as well as on the Chechen conflict with Russia, said he saw these reports as adding to the anxiety of the Russian general staff. ""When [Sergei] Shoygu, the defense minister, has to go sit with Putin at a distance because Kadyrov was mouthing off and whining that they're getting their a--es kicked, this will send a shock wave about a response. So, this is why I think we're seeing a bigger aggression by Russia.""

""We are only in day 5, and the Chechens got surprised because of Kadyrov’s relationship with the Kremlin. This looks bad for him. So, his highly trained fighters, some of whom have trained in other theaters, have to go back and fight harder, and Putin knows that,"" Karasik said.

As the Ukrainian military is fighting to keep control of Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, observers expected to see the Chechen units moving in with them. Karasik warned that some of the Chechens likely will be assigned to ""a 'kidnap and kill' portion, since they have had a history of doing these types of operations.""

RUSSIA REPORTEDLY SENDS HUNDREDS OF MERCENARIES TO KYIV

Global affairs analyst Jonathan Wachtel, who as a journalist based in Moscow in the ‘90s, covered conflicts in the former Soviet Union, including Chechnya, told Fox News Digital that maybe one reason Putin sent the Chechens in so early on in the fighting was to boost the morale of the troops, given the heavy losses they’re taking.

Military service is compulsory in Russia, so many conscripts may not have the will to fight, particularly against people who are predominantly ethnic Slavs following similar cultures. Having the feared Chechen fighters in the arena might shake things up at this early stage.

""As fighters, they have a reputation that goes back centuries of being ferocious and instilling fear among invading armies that tried and failed to crush them. So, you end up with Chechen characters in novels by Tolstoy and Pushkin, some of the great literary giants of Russian literature, and this fear of the Chechens fighter is not for nothing,"" Wachtel said.

He continued, ""They're known for being extremely capable in battle, strategically shrewd, cunning, relentless and vicious -- they fight to the death even when they know that they are outnumbered.""

Wachtel, who worked under U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Kelly Craft, said when Putin came to power, he crushed Grozny, the capital city of Chechnya, and launched a ruthless military campaign, but the Chechens ran a ferocious counterinsurgency and acts of terrorism against civilian targets that caused the Russians plenty of problems.

He said while it seemed an unusual relationship between Putin and Kadyrov, the Russian president ""managed to work out a relationship with him and his fighters to have loyalty where they can maintain leadership of the region of Chechnya in exchange for Russian financial and infrastructure support.""

Wachtel concluded, ""In this fashion, and as ironic as it is, given the tangled and violent history between Russians and Chechens, he is essentially in Putin's pocket and that’s because it is helpful to him as well, he maintains power and control and ensures that his people are getting the support they need.""

Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, including 14 children, during Russia’s invasion. Some 2,000 citizens have also been hurt in the fighting so far.

Putin's war on verge of expanding outside Ukraine as it cries 'terrorism' in Moldova,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s deadly war in Europe is on the brink of expanding outside of Ukraine as Kremlin officials alleged Thursday that there have been ""acts of terrorism"" in Moldova.

Moscow set its sights on Moldova last week when a Russian general said its goal was to gain ""full control"" over not only eastern Ukraine, but regions along its southern that sit above the Black Sea.

This would allow Russia to gain better access to Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway state in Moldova with sympathetic ties to Russia.

""We are alarmed by the escalation of tension in Transnistria, where in recent days there have been several incidents of shelling, blowing up social and infrastructure facilities,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday. ""We regard these actions as acts of terrorism aimed at destabilizing the situation.""

Zakharova’s comments came after explosions were reported in the separatist region this week, one reportedly hitting the Ministry of State Security in the city of Tiraspol, the region’s capital.

A second target was reported Tuesday after radio antennas that broadcast Russian programs in Maiac, a town around seven miles from Moldova’s border with Ukraine, were struck down.

But despite a history of tense relations, Moldova and Transnistria have held a treaty agreement since 1992 and signs of a thawing Cold War mentality were evident even earlier this year.

As part of the 1992 peace treaty, Russia has maintained a presence in Transnistria with roughly 1,500 Russian troops stationed there as ""peacekeepers.""

ZELENSKYY WARNS RUSSIA WILL LIKELY INVADE OTHER COUNTRIES IF SUCCESSFUL IN UKRAINE

The similarities shared by the Moldovan breakaway region and the Ukrainian self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics in the Donbas – which served as Putin’s justification for his illegal invasion in February – has many concerned.

Reports surfaced this week suggesting that officials in the region suspect Russia was behind the attacks in Transnistria as a guise to support a second illegal invasion.

""We strongly condemn attempts to involve Transnistria in what is happening in Ukraine,"" Russia’s spokesperson claimed Thursday. ""Every now and then sensational statements are heard from there about the preparation of Russian peacekeepers, the Tiraspol airfield, Transnistria conscripts for some kind of offensive actions.

""But all these statements do not cast doubt on the fact that the situation on the left bank of the Dniester, including in the security zone, is reliably controlled by the joint peacekeeping forces,"" she added.

Reporter's Notebook: On the front lines of Putin's war against Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine – Boom! An explosion nearby. We turn to look, but the interview continues. Moments later an artillery shell whizzes overhead. Everybody hits the ground.

This type of artillery fire is an hourly occurrence along the Russian border, where we are reporting in the town of Kozacha Lopan.

Still we need to move, in case more shells are coming. The team quickly jumps into our armored car. As we speed down the road, looking for a safer location, we shoot a quick update.

As we were interviewing the commander, we could hear an artillery shell whiz overhead, I say to the camera. So we got back in our cars, and we’re headed to a safer location.

At our next stop – more incoming fire. Two more shells whistle and explode nearby. Finally, we make it to a destroyed school farther out of town and the incoming stops.

The heart-pounding experience highlights what Ukrainian soldiers deal with daily as they look to defend the northern border with Russia.

SENIOR NATO OFFICIAL: RUSSIAN NUCLEAR STRIKE WOULD LIKELY PROMPT 'PHYSICAL RESPONSE'

The Ukrainians launched a massive counteroffensive last month, retaking much of this territory, but battles continue. Further east, the fighting is even more intense.

The following day we visited the front lines in the eastern part of the Kharkiv region, going to a village that was liberated 48 hours prior. In the distance, constant artillery battles rage on.

At a destroyed Russian position, the body of a Russian soldier lay in the bushes.

Civilians wave and smile at Ukrainian soldiers as they drive by, but the moment is short-lived. These troops must head back out closer to the front and liberate more territory.

They are fighting for the very survival of their country. And despite the bloody and dangerous battles ahead, they have momentum and they plan to retake more land.

"Reporter's Notebook: Ukraine war one year on, human tragedies and triumphs","One year into Russia’s war in Ukraine and the media is full of anniversary stories detailing all the geopolitical dynamics of the situation. For me, looking back at our trips to Ukraine this past year, it’s the personal stories that stand out…as well as how my own life got intertwined with the tales of combat.

Our first trip to Kyiv was during the tense run-up to the invasion last January and February. It was a time of mixed messages. The U.S. was declaring, including in a backgrounder we got at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, that Moscow was going to attack. Various expert analysts told us the same thing. Right to the brink though, including at a press conference we were at, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was being cagey. He’d later say he didn’t want to spook the public.

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

But the public was getting the message. One cold Saturday before the invasion, we spent time with dozens of locals in a woody suburb of Kyiv, learning all there was to know about crawling under barbed wire…dodging bullets…and applying first aid. Some of which they used on me after I slipped down an icy hill and smashed my glasses into my face!

Shortly after that, I would get my own chilling news. My dear father, at the grand age of 108, had passed away. This cut short my trip to Ukraine in order to get back to New York for his funeral. Maybe appropriate, though, that this happened in the midst of news-gathering. Dad long ago instilled in me a passion for current events. When I went to the den in his home, I found the latest issue of the Economist magazine open to a story about Ukraine.

BIDEN CHALLENGES PUTIN TO 'END THE WAR' IN UKRAINE, THREATENS TO RAMP UP SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA

Which brings me to Feb 24, 2022. No, I wasn’t on the frontline of the invasion. I was in my pajamas in the dining room of our home in London in the early hours of the morning. I was getting the latest on every amazing detail of Vladimir Putin’s attack via a What’sApp group we had started in Kyiv earlier. Most important were the messages from our local producer 24 year-old Sasha Kuvshynova. I passed them on to Fox News via a mass email group. In those early confusing days Sasha was an invaluable source of information for the network and our viewers.

Naturally, I was anxious to get back in the mix, and two weeks later I was in Lviv, Ukraine. Even though it was on the far western side of the country, it too was impacted by Moscow’s offensive actions, including a base hit by Russian missiles. It was used by the U.S. and other NATO countries to instruct Ukrainian military. Now, it was as a training center for international volunteers. Nearby residents told us how shocked they were to see rockets screaming overhead.

On the way back to Lviv, I rang my dear friend and cameraman through thick and thin for the last 20y years, Pierre Zakrzewski. He was in Kyiv working with correspondents and friends Benjamin Hall and Trey Yingst, covering the incursions by Russian forces into the suburbs of the capital. They were reporting on the first waves of death, destruction and terror heaped on the Ukrainian people by Moscow. Pierre, as always, was deep in the mix. It would be the last time we’d speak.

Because on the next day, as were preparing for live shots at our Lviv hotel, my producer Baz Davies walked into the room and said, ""I’ve got some news that will change your life."" Reporter Hall, cameraman Zakrzewski and producer Kuvshynova were all missing after a Russian missile attack. We would learn, the next day the first was badly injured. The other two…killed.

My sign offs during the lives that night were essentially…Sad time for Ukraine…and a sad day for Fox News. At a proper Irish funeral in Dublin for Pierre the following week…we would lift several glasses. For those we lost. And the country that was under attack.

And yes, the battle did go on. Remarkably, the Ukrainians were fighting back with clever tactics and daring deeds. Crucially pushing the Russian troops back and away from the outskirts of Kyiv and driving them across the border as Putin’s ill-planned push to topple the Ukrainian leadership stumbled.

By the time we got there on my next trip to Ukraine in late April and May, it was quieter around Kyiv, but the scars were still there and the healing hadn’t really started.

UKRAINIAN TOWN DEFIES THE RUSSIANS AS RESIDENTS COME HOME AND VOW, 'WE WILL WIN'

We went to Bucha, one of the hardest-hit towns by Russian fighters and saw….a long smoothed-over patch of dirt next to the main church where bodies had been buried in a mass grave. We visited a long residential street…eerily still that day…a shooting gallery for Russian mercenaries a few weeks back. And spoke with residents still breaking down in tears over the horror heaped on them.

And we went to Borodyanka. Made infamous for a long apartment building. With the middle gashed out of it by Russian shelling…a statue to a Ukrainian poet with a bullet through its tin head…shops with their fronts knocked out. In many cases, we were told it was brave locals who stood up and fended off a first wave of Russian attacks. Only to get battered by nasty revenge attacks days later.

Throughout these trips we spoke with a lot of folks. Some innocents caught in the fire. Some helping to lead this young brave democracy. People like 26-year-old Sviat Yurash. He was our local producer during the early protests and Russian attacks in 2014. He would become the youngest member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became famous as images of his lanky frame walking patrols around Kyiv, a long gun slung over his shoulder spread around the world.

Now, he was doing duty back and forth between the front lines with a dog he rescued from the rubble of one Russian attack. His spirit intact. Confident like so many we spoke with that Ukraine would beat back the horrid Moscow land grab.

Still the war went on. Offensives and counter-offensives. By the time we returned in October and November, Kyiv had gained back more ground, but Moscow had a new tactic. It couldn’t win on the battlefield, so it would strike civilians. Or at least the infrastructure supporting regular folks. Power stations, power lines, water pumping stations, phone and internet relay stations.

That became the weekly drill. Air raid sirens. A distant or not so distant rumble. Then emergency teams racing to a site. Which we raced to. To record the damage. And hear from people recounting projectiles falling around them. And then being left without vital essentials. A one-two Putin punch.

A cemetery we visited in the heart of Kyiv also told the tale. Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war. We spoke with a mother who lost her son. A couple who lost a friend. Two others who were missing a colleague. Young and old. Black and white family photos. Teddy bears. Football scarves. Bits of life. Turned to death.

We were in Kyiv for our Thanksgiving. For all their suffering and struggle, the staffers at our hotel prepared a turkey meal that would be prized on any American table. On this day of transplanted American warmth, I thought back on my own losses. In addition to my father dying in the past year, I also lost his last remaining sibling, 92-year-old Aunt Mildred. And his long-time girlfriend, 96-year-old Alice.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: LEAVING UKRAINE AFTER THE 'BEST AND WORST OF TIMES'

Also always on our minds, the loss of Pierre and Sasha. We stopped a few times during our reporting to see the exact spot where Russian missiles stole their lives. All that’s left…some ugly divots and spray marks from shrapnel on the side of the road. Flowers and memorial cards left. What was positive, though, the remarkable recovery of Benjamin Hall from terrible wounds. We had a warm reunion upon our return from the latest trip.

And so back to this first anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. And what lies ahead. Frankly, not even us grizzled war correspondents know for sure. What seems likely is that Vladimir Putin will not give up. He has set himself on a road to a brutal take-over and until he comes close to achieving something, he’ll continue to throw his cannon fodder into the ugly mix.

So far, the U.S. and international allies don’t look like they’re giving up either. Most countries seem willing to up the ante. Though there are worrying signs, including in the U.S., of flagging enthusiasm.

"Romanian president, Moldovan president boost ties amid Russia's war with Ukraine","Romanian President Klaus Iohannis discussed energy, economic and security issues in Bucharest Thursday with his visiting Moldovan counterpart, as the two neighbors seek to boost ties amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Iohannis' office said the talks with Moldovan President Maia Sandu would aim to bring her country closer to the 27-nation European Union, to which Romania belongs.

Afterwards, Sandu said Moldova’s strategic partnership with NATO-member Romania is yielding ""concrete benefits.""

""Moldova is going through unprecedented challenges,"" Sandu said, adding that over the past year, her country has faced ""security challenges aimed at creating chaos and destabilizing our region."" Both countries border on Ukraine.

ROMANIA, MOLDOVA REPORT POTENTIAL UFOS IN AIRSPACE

Sandu’s visit came a week after she claimed Moscow was allegedly plotting to overthrow Moldova’s government, put the nation ""at the disposal of Russia,"" and derail its aspirations to join the EU. Russia strongly denied her claims.

""Some wanted our country to fall. To be able to establish a puppet government in Chisinau, servile to the interests of the Kremlin,"" Sandu insisted Thursday. ""The Republic of Moldova remains ... determined on its way to the EU.""

Over the past year, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

ANDREW TATE DETAINED IN ROMANIA ON SUSPICION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING: REPORTS

Since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Moldova has faced a string of crises. These include severe energy problems after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies; rocketing inflation; several missiles that have traversed its skies from the fighting next door, and a huge inflow of war refugees.

Iohannis vowed on Thursday to continue to support Moldova, saying it ""is not alone in facing these challenges.""

""I reiterate Romania’s firm condemnation of any Russian destabilization attempts,"" he said. ""Romania remains particularly vigilant towards Russia’s hybrid actions, which … are intensifying at the end of a year of war.""

On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed without evidence that Ukraine is planning an ""armed provocation"" against Moldova’s Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria.

"Russia launches missiles on Ukrainian towns on Christmas, claims Ukraine military","Russian forces continued to wage war on Ukraine over the holiday weekend, with more than 40 missiles being launched into Ukrainian towns on Christmas day, according to Ukraine's military.

According to Russian news agencies, which cited the country's defense ministry, three Russian military personnel were killed Monday by falling wreckage of a Ukrainian drone that was shot down as it was on its way to attack a base in Russia's Saratov region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated Sunday that he was open to negotiations and accused Ukraine and its Western allies of not engaging in talks. The U.S. has previously dismissed this stance from Russia as posturing given the ongoing attack on Ukraine.

""We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them - we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,"" Putin said in an interview on Rossiya 1 state television.

PUTIN CLAIMS RUSSIA IS READY TO NEGOTIATE; UKRAINE ACCUSES KREMLIN OF TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, responded on Twitter by saying Putin needed to acknowledge it was Russia that has not been open to talks.

""Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,"" the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said. ""Russia doesn't want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.""

Moscow launched its invasion into its eastern European neighbor on February 24, and attacks on Ukraine's power stations have left millions without electricity. Zelenskyy said Russia would attempt to make the final days of 2022 dark and difficult.

""Russia has lost everything it could this year. ... I know darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario,"" he said in a Christmas Day address.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES CLUSTER OF 13 IRANIAN-MADE DRONES AT KYIV IN SUSPECTED ENERGY ATTACK

Ukraine and Russia traditionally celebrate Christmas on January 7, but some Orthodox Ukrainians decided to celebrate on December 25 this year. Zelenskyy, Ukraine's prime minister and other officials in the country issued Christmas wishes on Sunday.

Ukraine's military said early on Monday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of towns in the prior 24 hours on the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzia regions.

""In the Kherson direction, the enemy continues artillery shelling of populated areas along the right bank of the Dnipro River,"" the military said.

The Ukrainian military also said its forces launched attacks on nearly 20 Russian targets.

Russia's defense ministry said Sunday that its forces had killed about 60 Ukrainian servicemen the previous day along the Kupiansk-Lyman line of contact, and that it had destroyed numerous pieces of Ukrainian military equipment.

The Kremlin vowed to fight until all its territorial goals are reached, but Ukraine says it will keep fighting until every Russian soldier is forced from the country.

Russia invades Ukraine in largest European attack since WWII,"Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since the Second World War.

Russia’s all-out attack on Ukraine has killed at least 57 people and wounded 169 during the first day of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s Health Minister Oleh Lyashko said Thursday.

President Biden said Thursday afternoon that he’s reached a full agreement with G7 leaders to limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy, stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military and impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In a public address from the White House, Biden said Putin has much larger ambitions than Ukraine and wants to ""reestablish the Soviet Union.""

Secretary of Defense Gen. Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of approximately 7,000 additional U.S. troops to Germany in a move aimed at bolstering NATO defense and deterring Russian aggression.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee the country. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

After several hours of fierce battle, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday raised concerns of repeated of the 1986 disaster.

A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Thursday that Putin’s goal appears to be seizing the capital of Kyiv, ""decapitating the government"" and ""installing his own method of governance.""

He claimed Putin indicated this himself during his overnight speech.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

According to the U.S. Embassy Riga, U.S. troops from the Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Latvia Thursday morning. They were the first U.S. forces being repositioned to the Baltics to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to Allies and bolster NATO’s eastern flank.

However, the defense official emphasized that, ""U.S. troops are not going to be fighting the war in Ukraine."" The U.S. military has no aircraft in Ukrainian airspace as of Wednesday morning, he said.

Russia has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles into Ukraine since its initial onslaught overnight. Starting around 9:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, Russian forces began launching missiles from land and sea-based platforms from the Black Sea toward key cities in central and eastern Ukraine, the official said.

The official said Russian forces were fighting all three major axes ""designed to take key population centers."" The heaviest fighting has been occurring near an axis from northeast of Ukraine to the south, starting from Belarus to an advance on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

A second axis extends from north central Ukraine to the south from Belarus toward Kyiv. A third axis in the south is spreading from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to the Ukrainian city of Kherson.

Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, called for Russia to be removed from SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, and for allies to support them through devastating financial sanctions against Russia, through defensive anti-air supplies, and by cutting all diplomatic ties with Russia.

Recognizing Ukraine is not a member of NATO, Markarova said she did not expect U.S. troops to defend Ukraine but expected other support give their ""strategic friendship.""

RUSSIA CRACKS DOWN ON ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, MORE THAN 1,700 DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine before the House of Commons Thursday and moved to freeze assets of Russian banks. He announced the ""largest ever"" set of sanctions against Russia and vowed to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas.

Anti-Russian demonstrations have popped up across Europe and in the U.S. in cities including New York, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, Russian authorities began cracking down on anti-war protests across the country, reportedly arresting more than a thousand demonstrators in several cities.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""

While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene, something Russian President Vladimir Putin warned would show grave consequences. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.

Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country, The Associated Press reported. Several dozen people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.

Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE IN LARGEST EUROPEAN ATTACK SINCE WWII

""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said Thursday, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.

Russia ""has embarked on a path of evil,"" the president said, but Ukraine ""is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks."" Zelenskyy said sanctions would be lifted ""on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""

The attacks came first from the air. Later, Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

In the north, video showed tanks rolling over the border from the Russian ally of Belarus through Senkivka. Russian forces also landed in the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol.

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone.

Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that it had shot down several Russian aircraft, according to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported. Highways outside of Kyiv swelled with traffic Thursday leading to Poland, and lines of people waited for gasoline, to withdraw money or to purchase other supplies, such as food and water.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Ukraine said columns of Russian troops were passing over the border into the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk, Reuters reported. Russian missiles also targeted several Ukrainian cities, and explosions could be heard before dawn in the capital of Kyiv, home to 3 million people.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""

Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

The incident came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which lands on Thursday. Ukrainian officials have warned for months that Russian forces plan to renew their offensive sometime around the anniversary.

Ukrainian defense officials also warned of a potential massive missile attack that could land on the anniversary or in the days following.

What’s next?","One year ago today Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Europe entered into a security crisis not seen since World War II and Black Sea blockades created global shock waves that prompted worldwide food shortages.

Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly believed his ""special military operation"" would take just days for his troops to storm across Ukraine and overthrow the capital of Kyiv – a belief that was shared by top U.S. officials.

But instead, the world watched as the real time David vs. Goliath story unfolded and Ukrainian troops held strong against one of the largest, most sophisticated militaries in the world – stopping Putin in his tracks.

Basic logistical failures like fuel shortages stalled Russian efforts within the first week of the invasion, showing a level of unpreparedness in Moscow’s ranks that flabbergasted Western defense officials.

US FORCES CHINA’S HAND IN REVEALING POSSIBLE LETHAL AID TO RUSSIA AMID WAR IN UKRAINE: EXPERTS

But Russia’s inability to quickly take Ukraine has led to what many believe will be a prolonged war of attrition, with casualties already mounting to rates not seen in a Western conflict in some 80 years and concerns growing over how long Kyiv can hold out.

""We are fighting a smart war,"" Yuriy Sak, top adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, told Fox News Digital. ""We are not prepared to use the tactics employed by the enemy, which is to use people as expendable resources – throwing them into this meat grinder, this slaughterhouse.""

Experts are divided on how or when the war will end, but they agree many more casualties are expected.

""The way that the Russian military fights is very different from the way that U.S. military and now Ukrainians being trained by the U.S. miliary [fight],"" former Defense Intelligence Agency intel officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy, Rebekah Koffler, said. ""The Russians don't really care for loss of life.""

Koffler pointed to Putin’s September mobilization order to add 300,000 Russian soldiers to his ranks, along with rumblings last month that suggested he may look to add another 500,000 conscripts.

Moscow in January also detailed plans to expand its military to 1.5 million personnel by 2026, up from 1 million.

Russia’s military expansion plans have been fueled by the West’s continuous pledges to back Ukraine for as long as it takes through arms support and humanitarian aid.

WHAT VICTORY FOR UKRAINE LOOKS LIKE BEYOND BORDER SECURITY: CHIEF DEFENSE ADVISER

The Pentagon has long claimed that Russian arms supplies are dwindling and brutal fighting in eastern Ukraine has prompted Russia to throw what it can in droves at the front lines – bodies.

""It is a relentless attrition of manpower,"" Koffler said. ""And he's clearly preparing for a very, very protracted battle.

""He's just going to throw more young Russian men into the meat grinder,"" she added explaining that Moscow plans to exhaust Ukrainian forces through the sheer number of men it can add to its ranks.

""Quantity does not necessarily mean a real battlefield advantage,"" Sak said, pointing to Russia’s months-long attempts to take Bakhmut. ""It just means we need more ammunition to destroy them.""

Defense officials and Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines have reported that the constant supply of Russian troops funneled into Ukraine are inadequately supplied, lack sufficient training and are being killed at increasing rates.

In mid-February a BBC Russia investigation found that in the confirmed deaths of over 1,000 conscripted men mobilized after Putin’s September order, 40% of them were killed after the 2023 New Year – signaling a spike in frontline deaths.

Kyiv has estimated that Russian forces have lost up to 1,000 men a day in the Bakhmut sector alone.

RUSSIA'S WAGNER CHIEF ACCUSES DEFENSE HEADS OF 'TREASON' AS FORCES FALL AMID AMMUNITION SHORTAGES

The last official estimate on the number of deaths reported by the Biden administration came in November when Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley told reporters that 100,000 soldiers on each side of the lines were believed to have been killed. Russian deaths are now believed to be closer to 150,000 while Ukraine’s losses remain more ambiguous.

""Their morale is down. It's exposed their bad logistics and bad tactics. The Russians are throwing a lot of cannon fodder. They're just grabbing guys from prisons, and showing absolutely no respect for the law in war – where you are supposed to distinguish between civilians and legitimate military targets,"" former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital in reference to Russia’s penal recruits for its Wagner mercenary group.

NATO and Ukrainian defense officials have been sounding the alarm for months that Russia is planning a major offensive in an attempt to turn the tide in Ukraine. Moscow saw significant setbacks in the final months last year when Ukraine retook Kharkiv in September, damaged the Crimean bridge in October, and pushed Russian forces across the Dnieper River in November, securing the city of Kherson.

It is now believed that Russia's offensive charge will come in waves closer to the spring time when the weather lets up and will likely not be one united push.

But Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told NATO partners just last week that despite the significant amount of arms and equipment that allies have recently pledged to Kyiv, it will take a couple of months for Ukraine to prepare an adequate counteroffensive.

""It's a war in which tactics and equipment and the smart use of modern technologies are a decisive factor, not the sheer number of armed forces,"" Sak explained, pointing to how the battlefield dynamic in Ukraine shifted once Kyiv had received High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) last summer.

PUTIN FURTHER ISOLATES RUSSIA FROM THE WEST IN HIS STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS

""That was a turning point,"" he said. ""We were able to reach the enemy – ammunition depots and command centers – deeper inside their territory.

""It's always important to try to be one step ahead of the enemy, not one step behind,"" Sak added.

Hoffman argued the West’s hesitancy and repeated decision reversals to send adequate aid to Ukraine is what has prolonged this war to begin with.

""We delayed. First, we said no on air defense then we gave it to them. Then we said no on tanks now we're giving it to them – it’s a year into the war,"" he said. ""What is our strategy here?""

""Could Ukraine win? Yeah, they could win. They should win,"" Hoffman added. ""If we gave them what they need to do it.""

Hoffman's comments were near synonymous among defense experts following the announcement by Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the weekend that the U.S. is now concerned that China is considering giving Moscow lethal aid.

""They're being too cautious,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""[It] makes it more likely that this war goes on longer – makes it more likely to give time for things like China to intervene and help Russia.""

Koffler took a bleaker view on the war’s future and argued providing arms will not be enough to end the war.

""I think it's going to end with a settlement,"" she said. ""It's unwinnable because of how the victory is defined right now.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Koffler said Ukraine will only claim victory once it has repelled Russian forces from all of its borders, including Crimea, which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014.

""Putin is just never going to let that happen,"" she added pointing to the Kremlin’s threat to escalate the war through the use of nuclear weapons. ""For the Russians, their definition of victory is very different. Their definition of victory is really protracted war – denying victory to us.""

Koffler argued that Putin’s true aim is in blocking Ukraine from being accepted into NATO, and so long as the nation is embroiled in a war it will not be eligible to join the military alliance.

The Russia expert warned that the war will continue until ""the three parties come to the realization that they've killed enough people,"" she said in reference to Ukraine, Russia and the United States.

""Until they realize it's time to wrap it up, it’s not going to happen,"" Koffler said, adding that she believes the war could continue for another two to five years.

Kyiv has said it intends to conclude the war by the end of 2023, though this end date is appearing increasingly unlikely after the U.S. and NATO, along with Putin this week, vowed to continue the war effort.

""We all should step up our efforts and shift into high gear so that we don’t allow this war to become a protracted war – it's not in the interest of anyone,"" Sak argued. ""It's not just about Ukraine. It's about the stability of Europe and the world.""

The Ukrainian defense adviser said that ultimately Ukraine will keep doing what it must in the continued face of Russian aggression – fight.

""Victory for us will mean not just throwing the enemy out and restoring our territorial sovereignty over all internationally recognized territories,"" Sak said. ""Victory will also mean establishing a Ukraine which will make such aggression impossible in the future.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/russias-war-ukraine-hits-one-year-mark-putin-digs-in-zelenskyy-pushes-victory-whats-next,N/A
Saving Ukraine: Looking for a world leader to stand up,"The world has rallied behind the Churchillian figure of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his bravery and resilience in the defense of his country. Zelenskyy in his speeches has thrown down the gauntlet to world leaders by telling them to stand up and do more to help.

""Slava Ukraini (glory to Ukraine),"" was how Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended a video address to Ukrainians last week. His opening remarks were also in Ukrainian. Johnson speaks regularly to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and observers think he could be the world leader to shine in absence of strong U.S. leadership.

Last week following the Russian attack on the Ukrainian nuclear station Johnson immediately called for a U.N. Security Council meeting on the attack, and Monday in London, Johnson seemed to be leading the way as he stood alongside the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and Canada’s Justin Trudeau to rally international support for Ukraine.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PREPARE FOR A ‘VERY LONG, DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD’

During his press conference Johnson announced that so far, the U.K. had given around $500,000 of aid to Ukraine and said the moment had come for ""Ukraine’s friends to create a coalition of humanitarian, economic and defensive military support to ensure that Putin fails.""

Speaking as if he had taken it upon himself to lead a type of coalition of the willing, Johnson noted that Putin ""has underestimated the unity of the West. And we will continue to strengthen that unity in the days ahead to ensure that Putin fails in this catastrophic invasion of Ukraine.""

Johnson was part of a secure video call with President Biden and the leaders of France and Germany on Monday, during which they discussed the latest in the crisis, according to a readout from the White House, as well as underscoring their commitment to assist Ukraine. Observers worry that while the U.S. is playing a leading and pivotal role in the Ukraine crisis, there is still a perceived lack of leadership coming from the president.

""Biden is not the leader of the free world right now, and for an American president to cede that role is career-threatening,"" Alan Mendoza the executive director of the Henry Jackson Society in England told Fox News Digital.

Mendoza believes Boris Johnson is one world leader who could be capable of filling the void on the world stage, even with an embarrassing scandal during the COVID crisis noting his impressive leadership skills.

""With the future of the free world in the balance, we clearly have bigger problems than debating the minutiae of coronavirus regulations. But I think the crisis also plays to his strengths as a communicator and a visionary — Boris has always been good about creating a clear message about an issue, creating the intellectual space for it in a public forum, and then working with others to provide the detail. It was the secret of his success as London mayor, and for the first time he has been able to transpose it to the world stage.""

Clifford May, founder, and president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD,) told Fox News Digital, ""Johnson has been articulate as always. More substantively, he’s pushing for the expulsion of ‘every Russian bank from SWIFT.’ He’s recognized that Europe needs to ‘wean itself off’ Russian oil and gas. And he’s on the record opposing ‘creeping normalization’ of Putin’s aggression. All that is helpful.""

Other world leaders who are getting some notice on the world stage include Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Bennett traveled to Moscow for a surprise visit with Putin over the weekend. Bennett was reportedly given the blessing by the U.S. for the meeting to try and mediate between the two sides.

Israel has good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, and Bennett is seen as having good ties to Zelenskyy, whom he has been in constant contact with over the last few days. Bennett also flew to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz before going back to Israel, according to the Associated Press.

Clifford May said Bennett needed to be applauded but that his task isn’t an easy one.

""Bennett is doing his best to be an honest broker. The Israelis are in a tough position because Russian military forces are — literally, not figuratively — just across their northern border in Syria, a nation that has been ravaged thanks to Putin and of course his friends in Tehran. Will Bennett’s diplomatic efforts succeed? Highly doubtful but I give him an A for effort.""

BIDEN MUST ADDRESS US HOSTAGES IN RUSSIA AMID UKRAINE WAR, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT SAYS

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is another name being touted as someone who has taken a stand on Russia having changed a years-old policy path on his country’s dealings with them. May told Fox News Digital, ""The most dramatic transition we’ve seen is Germany. Olaf Scholz now appears to recognize that Putin is a threat to Germany and the European Union.""

Yet while Scholz has changed his country’s post-war policy of not supplying lethal weapons to war zones by allowing weapons to be sent to Ukraine. The Associated Press reported that those included the shipment 1000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to air-missiles.

Yet still an Achilles heel for the Germans and some others in the European Union is their dependency on Russian energy. Reuters reported that Scholz on Monday said in a statement that sanctioning the Russian energy sector was still not on the cards.

The FDD’s May concluded that Scholz ""seems to understand, as his predecessor, Angela Merkel, never did, that close commercial ties with Russia would not be of mutual benefit. Scholz needs to do more — for example, he needs to persuade former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to sever his lucrative links with Putin — but what we’ve seen over recent days is encouraging.""

Yet while France tries to play a role in the crisis, especially on the humanitarian front, Alan Mendoza from the Henry Jackson Society says Macron has been an under-performer so far.

""Macron is playing domestic politics for his re-election and is being typically different to the rest of Europe in order to show his voters France still has a voice,"" Mendoza said, adding that it’s working since nobody thinks he is any danger of losing the election that is set for this coming April.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/saving-ukraine-looking-world-leader-stand-up,N/A

US forces China’s hand in revealing possible lethal aid to Russia amid war in Ukraine: experts,"The Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing this week that it suspects China is considering sending Russia lethal aid as Moscow’s war in Ukraine drags on, experts told Fox News Digital Tuesday.

""China has a difficult decision to make,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""They want Russia to win. On the other hand, they don’t want to lose their economic access to Europe.

""It’s impossible to know where they’ll come down,"" he added.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken first revealed the U.S.'s suspicions following his meeting with Beijing's top diplomat Saturday, after which he expressed concern ""that China’s considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine.""

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.

China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.

In recent weeks Beijing has struggled to keep a balance between maintaining constructive relations with the West while condemning the U.S. of ""hysterics,"" as Beijing did over the shooting down of the surveillance balloon and accusing it of escalating the war by providing defensive aid to Ukraine.

International security experts agree that China is trying to ""strike a balance"" between preserving its economic interests and its desire to see the U.S. fall in the global hierarchy.

""China needs Russia to help it change the rules-based world order,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Michael Ryan said. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] partner in trying to undermine U.S. influence in the world and to show that autocracy and not democracy is the superior form of government.""

Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.

Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Providing arms to Russia would have obvious consequences and change the dynamic on the battlefield, making it harder for Ukraine to win.

Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.

""This would increase the odds of the war in Ukraine becoming even more protracted,"" explained James Anderson, the former acting under secretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration. ""The longer the war in Ukraine drags on, the greater the chances it will spread to other countries in Europe.""

Iran and North Korea have already been providing some weaponry to Moscow, and Tehran’s drone contribution has allowed Russia to hit the one area that Ukraine is unable to effectively beat it — air defense.

But Russia needs munitions, tanks and armored vehicles — which is where China could step in and change the course of the war.

Experts agree that China’s involvement in the war would do more than aid Russia’s war effort, it would morph into a new ""Cold War with China.""

""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPY CRAFT

Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.

""[China] does not want to see Russia fail because it portends…Western support in terms of [the] Taiwan scenario,"" Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under the Trump administration, told Fox News.

""The Chinese have been caught by surprise,"" Klinck said pointing to not only Russia’s operational failures on the battlefield but the steadfast response from the U.S. and its Western allies.

Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.

""What is more important to China: ensuring Russian success?"" he questioned. ""Or is it being part of an international order?""

Ultimately experts agree that China has to consider whether it will more negatively be affected by the strategic implications of a Russian failure and its ally’s standing on the global stage or the economic repercussions that would directly impact Beijing.

""Those domestic implications are always what drive Chinese decision-making,"" Klinck argued.

Anderson also pointed out that the West will need to move quickly to decide how it will respond with economic repercussions should China involve itself in the war effort.

""This would be a real test of Western unity since many European countries have extensive trading relationships with China, and some of our allies and partners may well be reluctant to jeopardize them with sanctions,"" he said. ""Anything less than a massive sanctioning effort would likely fail.""

""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.

"Russia-Ukraine war: Knowledge of communist history will help Americans understand invasion, expert says","To understand the Russia-Ukraine war, one must understand the history of communism – and more specifically, Russian communism.

That’s according to Andrew Bremberg, president of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) and former U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.

""Young Americans know very little, and frequently nothing, about Josef Stalin – the brutal leader of the USSR that took over after Lenin and took his crimes under communism and really ratcheted them up,"" Bremberg said. ""I think people know nothing of the Holodomor, which was Stalin's planned famine in Ukraine that killed over 10 million people during the time.""

At the time of the Holodomor, known as the Great Famine, when Westerners were suffering from the Great Depression in the early 1930s, socialism and communism were ""very much in vogue,"" Bremberg explained.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

""It is a terrible chapter in human history of the 20th century, and the vast majority of young Americans truly know nothing about [it]. Just knowing that one fact, I believe, can really materially change how a person understands communism,"" he said. ""And, frankly, I think it has an effect on how people understand the attacks and crisis today"" in Ukraine.

VOC’s mission is to commemorate ""the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world"" and pursue ""the freedom of those still living under totalitarian regimes.""

The foundation published a report last year that found an increasing number of young Americans are unaware that some 100 million people have been killed by communist parties in power over the last century, and many are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany.

UKRAINE CRISIS: COMMUNISM VICTIMS ORGANIZATION CALLS RUSSIA'S INVASION ‘ILLEGAL’ AND ‘A WAKE-UP CALL’

While Russia is a socialist country today, Bremberg argued that it is being led by a ""dictator"" and former KGB leader, President Vladimir Putin, who is ""trying to legitimize and rehabilitate the image of Josef Stalin – specifically him as a person – and of the Soviet empire.""

""Putin knows the history of communism in 20th century, and if we do not, we are at a significant disadvantage in not understanding what is going on, why it is happening, and … the important historical context for what is happening,"" the former U.N. ambassador said.

BLINKEN SAYS PUTIN'S RHETORIC ON NUCLEAR THREAT IS ‘HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY’

Bremberg traveled to Europe before Putin invaded Ukraine to meet with heads of state in Romania, Poland and Hungary to discuss the countries’ respective histories battling communism in an effort to ""build a relationship"" with those countries and better tell their stories here in the U.S.

VOC is building a museum dedicated to victims of communism from more than 40 nations since 1917 in Washington, D.C., and it is set to open in May.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, however, the tone of Bremberg's conversations with foreign leaders has shifted. Officials have been reflecting on their own country’s battles against Russia and communism as Ukraine comes under Putin’s fire.

A century ago, the Red Army invaded Poland with the intent of taking over Central Europe, and Polish citizens stepped up during the invasion to help defend the country’s capital of Warsaw, which is reminiscent of Ukrainians defending Kyiv today.

After the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the Hungarian people helped defend Budapest when Russia invaded to stop the regime change.

""We can look at and see lots of parallels to what we're seeing in Ukraine today"" when looking at Central Europe’s previous battles against the Soviets, Bremberg said.

He said he fears ""Putin is so isolated and separate"" from the Russian people ""that regardless of how they may protest,"" the impact of sanctions – with ""Russia being basically cut off from much of the rest of the world"" – will be more significant on them than Putin and Russian oligarchs unless further sanctions, such as travel options, are directed toward the higher-ups personally.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-crisis-knowledge-communist-history-americans-understand-russia-invasion-expert,N/A

Russia has increasingly relied on aerial assaults and shelling of civilian infrastructure in an attempt to break Ukrainian morale by depriving the nation of heat, running water or electricity as the cold winter months set in – a move defense officials have said is down to Moscow’s failures on the front lines.

Russia ""has chosen a cynical strategy, aiming to destroy civilian infrastructure in order to put Ukraine on its knees,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday. ""The objective is clear: Respond to military defeats by spreading terror among civilians, try to break the back as it can’t maintain the front.""

""Every war ends in a diplomatic way. Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" Kuleba told the Associated Press on Monday.

""The United Nations could be the best venue for holding this summit because this is not about making a favor to a certain country.""

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres could serve as the mediator at a potential peace summit, Kuleba said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid out a 10-point peace plan at the G20 summit last month, including the release of all prisoners of war, the withdrawal of Russian forces and cessation of hostilities, nuclear safety and the ""establishment of the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression.""

Kuleba said Monday that Russia ""can only be invited to this step in this way,"" referring to a war crimes tribunal.

"Ukraine renews calls for US F-16s, German fighter jets after countries reverse decision on sending tanks","Ukrainian officials have renewed calls for the United States and Germany to supply them with fighter jets in their ongoing fight with Russia, after the two Western allies changed their decision on supplying tanks.

The U.S. and Germany previously said they would not send over the armored fighting vehicles but reversed the decision after further negotiations, ultimately agreeing to send more than 30 Abrams M1 tanks and 14 Leopard 2 tanks, respectively.

Ukrainian officials are now engaged in ""fast-track"" talks for long-range missiles and military aircraft, a top Ukrainian presidential aide said Saturday.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine’s supporters in the West ""understand how the war is developing"" and the need for planes capable of providing cover for the tanks they pledged to send.

UKRAINE SOUNDS COUNTRY-WIDE ALARMS AMID RUSSIAN DRONE STRIKES; WESTERN TANK TRAINING TO BEGIN

Podolyak said some of Ukraine's Western partners maintain a ""conservative"" attitude to sending advanced weaponry ""due to fear of changes in the international architecture.""

""We need to work with this. We must show (our partners) the real picture of this war,"" Podolyak said in remarks to online video channel Freedom. ""We must speak reasonably and tell them, for example, ‘This and this will reduce fatalities, this will reduce the burden on infrastructure. This will reduce security threats to the European continent, this will keep the war localized.’ And we are doing it.""

Podolyak did not identify any partnering countries.

Russia, which has received its own arms and supplies from China, North Korea, and Iran, has accused the West of providing Kyiv with increasingly sophisticated weapons. Russian officials say supplying Ukraine with weapons constitutes ""direct involvement.""

Germany and the United States announced Wednesday they would send advanced battle tanks along with the Bradley and Marder vehicles to Ukraine and train Ukrainian troops to use them in an effort to help Kyiv make breakthroughs in combat stalemates.

The decision was met with groans and criticism from the Kremlin, which continues to criticize Western interference.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense took to Twitter Wednesday to celebrate the start of the training.

"Ukraine reveals staggering cost of Russian war: up to 13,000 soldiers dead","Ukrainian forces have lost between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers in the war against Russia, according to a top advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenksyy.

In a Thursday night interview, Mykhailo Podolyak cited chief military officials when he revealed information that was detailed as ""classified"" by a Ukrainian armed forces spokesman earlier in the week.

""We have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to between 10,000 and 12,500-13,000 killed,"" Podolyak told a Ukrainian news outlet.

BIDEN HAS 'NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CONTACT' PUTIN, WILL ONLY SPEAK IF HE IS 'LOOKING FOR A WAY TO END THE WAR'

The comments were not only a rare announcement, but the figures are likely far lower than Western estimates, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said last month both Ukraine and Russia have ""probably"" seen ""well over 100,000"" soldiers killed and wounded.

A separate advisor to Zelenskyy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a Wednesday interview that Kyiv assessed the death toll in Russia’s ranks to be roughly seven times that of Ukraine’s, according to Reuters.

Podolyak did not provide any estimates on the number of soldiers who had been injured, but said, ""We are open in talking about the number of dead"" and noted that more soldiers had been wounded than killed.

RUSSIA ACCUSES US OF 'DIRECT' PARTICIPATION IN UKRAINE WAR, BUT LAVROV OPEN TO TALKS

Russia has remained silent on its reported dead and has not released any figures on its fallen soldiers in months.

In late March, Moscow claimed it had lost over 1,300 soldiers in what it has dubbed its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. However, after just one month of war, NATO officials had estimated that number was likely far higher and ranged between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military has not confirmed the figures provided by Podolyak, and head of the armed forces last reported in August that 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers had reportedly been killed.

Podolyak said in June that up to 200 soldiers were killed each day in the then four-month long war.

"Ukraine war: Russia withdraws troops from Lyman, strategic town in region Putin annexed","Russia suffered another setback during Ukraine's counteroffensive, confirming it withdrew troops from the eastern town of Lyman, within the newly annexed Donetsk region.

Ukraine’s armed forces on Saturday said they had ""liberated"" five settlements in the Donetsk region and encircled thousands of Russian soldiers.

""Due to the risk to be encircled, the allied forces were withdrawn from Krasny Liman to more advantageous frontiers,"" Russia's Ministry of Defense said Saturday.

""The Russian troops in the area of Lyman are encircled. Yampil, Novoselivka, Shandryholove, Drobysheve, and Stavky settlements are liberated. Stabilization measures are being conducted there,"" Serhii Cherevatyi, Speaker of the Eastern group of troops, told a Ukrainian news outlet reported Pravda.

The advancement comes one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a land grab for not only Donetsk but the Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions as well.

But Ukrainian forces have been making advances in western Luhansk and northern Donetsk as they inch toward the strategically important city of Sievierodonetsk, which Russia has occupied since June.

Cherevatyi said that some 5,000 to 5,500 occupiers were in Lyman, but noted it was difficult to estimate the number of troops in the areas surrounding the town due to the fluid movement of troops in combat zones.

BIDEN VOWS TO ‘DEFEND LITERALLY EVERY INCH OF NATO’ TERRITORY: ‘ARTICLE 5 IS A SACRED COMMITMENT’

Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, deploying troops across Ukraine’s eastern border while also sending troops to take control of the capital city, Kyiv.

Putin reportedly believed that the entire operation would take only a few days, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley echoed that sentiment as one of five possible outcomes if Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, saying that Kyiv could fall in as little as 72 hours.

""In early February 2022, Chairman Milley and several other officials briefed lawmakers during a classified briefing on the pending Russian invasion,"" Col. Dave Butler, spokesman for Chairman Milley, told Fox News Digital. ""In the briefing, Chairman Milley laid out several scenarios informed by interagency intelligence assessments, on the far end of a range of possibilities was the Russians taking Kyiv in several days. This is what we assessed the Russians planned to do.""

The intelligence about Russia’s capabilities ultimately proved egregiously wrong as Ukraine dug in its heels and maintained a staunch defense, supported by NATO and Western allies who supplied the country with weapons and supplies to wage an asymmetric war that has helped it reach the one-year mark unbeaten.

RUSSIAN UNION SUSPENDED FROM INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF JOURNALISTS FOR ACTIONS FOLLOWING UKRAINE INVASION

That defense has come at significant costs, which Russia expert Rebekah Koffler highlighted as a major concern moving forward, regardless of the conflict’s outcome.

""Putin and Russia are clear losers,"" Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital. ""Putin committed basically demographic suicide. Estimates are that Russia lost about 200,000 personnel either to death or injury, and he’s additionally mobilizing 1.5 million troops, preparing for a protracted war.""

""On top of that, Russia has become a pariah in the West; they’re not welcome in any way,"" she continued. ""Putin is hated everywhere – not that he cares about that.""

Koffler also argued that Ukraine is a ""clear loser"" due to its staggering losses in industrial and agricultural bases, devastated energy infrastructure and the slow slide away from true independence.

PUTIN TOUTS DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AS FEARS OF PROXY WAR IN UKRAINE LOOM

""[Ukraine] is going to permanently depend on the West for its gross domestic product, with the U.S. leading the rest of the countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid,"" Koffler said.

Koffler picked out only one clear winner from the conflict: China, which has seen its two biggest powerhouse competitors severely depleted through the conflict – as well as having some kind of preview of how the West might react to a Taiwan invasion scenario.

""China is witnessing two of its top perceived adversaries decimating each other’s weapons stockpiles. They’re using a lot of weaponry,"" she said. ""Some of these weapon systems will take from five to 18 years to replace.""

""We simply don’t have the production capacity to replace everything that we need, and in a potential conflict with China, that will be a big problem; and China has also witnessed the Western response to Russia’s strategies, and it can start planning counter-strategies.""

SEN. ROGER WICKER: BIDEN NEEDS TO MATCH HIS SPEECH WITH ACTION

Singleton, whose expertise focuses on China, agreed that Beijing will be closely monitoring the outcome of the war to determine where it stands with Russia, but China has already been able to negotiate ""very favorable energy deals.""

He also acknowledged that regardless of the outcome, Russia remains vulnerable to Chinese predation and could end up ""a vassal,"" but the relatively ""unproductive"" economy in Russia would make it more of a problem for Beijing.

""China will be eager to take advantage of opportunities to negotiate cheap, secure supplies of energy to meet its insatiable demand for energy resources, but at the same time, if the Chinese are perceived to have to keep Russia afloat, that is likely, I think, to exacerbate existing tension between the two countries,"" Singleton said.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that there would be ""tectonic differences"" in Europe’s power balance after the war, especially if Russia faced total failure.

""Because if Ukraine wins the war, I think it will surely also [be] the protest of the president of Belarus, people against the regime, and also surely I think the outcome of war could be also a game changer.""

Reinsalu called the outcome of the war decisive ""not only for Ukrainians but for many other countries."" He also stressed the need for a tribunal to investigate Russia for alleged war crimes, which Ukraine claims to have documented at least 60,000.

US advises Ukraine to hold off on major offensive until latest arms shipment: report,"The U.S. has advised Kyiv to hold off on any major counter-offensives against Russian forces in Ukraine until Washington’s latest supply of weaponry and trainings have been provided, a senior White House official said, according to Reuters Saturday.

Kyiv has not officially announced that it is planning another major counter-offensive just months after it successfully ousted Russian troops from Kharkiv in the north and from the city of Kherson in the south, though it has repeatedly warned it believes Moscow is taking steps to ramp up its war effort.

Months of brutal fighting over Bakhmut, which Western defense officials have argued is strategically insignificant, has prompted U.S. defense officials to encourage Ukraine not to attempt to keep up with Russia strike for strike.

US SENDING ANOTHER $2.5 BILLION IN MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE

A senior U.S. official told reporters that the U.S. believes Russia will gain an advantage when it comes to a war of attrition and therefore Ukraine needs to change the dynamic on the battlefield.

The U.S. has argued its tanks are too costly and difficult to maintain.

Instead, the U.S. this week said it would send 90 Stryker combat vehicles for the first time and another round of nearly 60 Bradley fighting vehicles, adding to the 50 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 100 Armored Personnel Carriers, 55 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles and 138 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles pledged earlier this month.

Wagner Group: What to know about Russian paramilitary group in Ukraine,"After a report indicated the Russian-backed Wagner Group deployed more than 400 mercenaries to Kyiv with the mission of assassinating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the private military company is receiving renewed attention from its past atrocities carried out at the behest of the Kremlin.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday that there are reconnaissance forces in Kyiv but could not confirm those forces were ordered to assassinate Zelenskyy.

The Times of London reported about the alleged mission to decapitate Zelenskyy and his government, and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko issued a 36-hour nightly curfew over the weekend, warning that any residents who go outside could be mistaken for enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups.

LIVE UPDATES: UKRAINE'S SECOND-LARGEST CITY BOMBARDED WITH SHELLING DURING PEACE TALKS

Russian President Vladimir Putin already blatantly invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine five days ago through an overt military operation, but former U.S. intelligence officials told Fox News Digital that using the Wagner Group, a private military company, allows him to escape attribution if Zelenskyy is killed.

""We’ve seen the Wagner Group active in the Middle East, certainly in Africa and even in Venezuela. They have caused no end of problems for U.S. policymakers, and there have been efforts to sanction some of their leaders,"" Dr. James Anderson, former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, told Fox News Digital Monday. ""Why they’re using them in Ukraine now is an interesting question because of the fact that Russia has already committed to an overt military effort. It could well be the case that these reports are true, they will be spearheading attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy and cabinet members.""

Since its inception in 2014, the Wagner Group has been considered a proxy group of the Russian state abroad, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

It was founded by Dmitry Utkiny, a veteran of both Chechen wars and a former member of the Main Intelligence Directorate, or the Russian intelligence agency abbreviated as GRU. He and other Wagner Group operatives participated in the Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

""I would also note that they have been active in the breakaway republics in Ukraine for a number of years,"" Anderson told Fox News Digital. ""I think it’s wise that the mayor of Kyiv, the territorial defense forces are instituting these curfews at night because they’re reducing the possibility that the un-uniformed Wagner personnel can blend in with the local populous.""

KREMLIN SENDS 400 RUSSIAN MERCENARIES INTO KYIV ON MISSION TO ASSASSINATE ZELENSKYY: REPORT

A different former U.S. intelligence official speculated to Fox News Digital that Wagner operatives have more likely been in Kyiv for months – longer than the five weeks reported by the Times – because Putin would have wanted them there to gather intelligence ahead of his planned military invasion of Ukraine.

In a move supported by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the European Union in December moved to sanction the Russia-backed Wagner Group and its associates for serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings, and destabilizing activities in countries including Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Should Wagner operatives be indicted in war crimes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine unfolds, Anderson said the International Criminal Courts could become involved to attempt to hold Russia accountable.

""I think the international legal community is probably working on a variety of briefs already in respect to Putin’s naked aggression in Ukraine and could imagine that they could be following the Wagner Group and reports of war crimes very closely,"" he said. ""This will become a part of the story moving forward.""

CSIS documented that in December Wagner operatives also began deploying to Mali as French forces began backing off on their military efforts against Salafi-jihadist groups in the region.

The Wagner Group has signaled other ties to Russia’s Ministry of Defense, as operatives have also regularly traveled on Russian military transport aircraft when deploying to Venezuela to assist President Nicolas Madura, in Libya and to and from Syria, according to the CSIS.
