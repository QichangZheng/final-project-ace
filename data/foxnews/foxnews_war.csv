"Meghan Markle ‘needs a win’ amid negative ‘South Park’ portrayal, legal war with estranged half sister: expert","Meghan Markle is believed to be strategizing her next chess move to reinvent her public image.

Amid all the media scrutiny following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Netflix docuseries ""Harry & Meghan"" in December, followed by Prince Harry’s bombshell memoir ""Spare"" in January, the former ""Suits"" star is looking to boost the couple’s image.

The mother of two is currently in a legal battle with her estranged half-sister Samantha Markle. She and Harry, 38, were also the recent subjects of a ""South Park"" episode in which the couple, depicted as cartoons, held ""we want our privacy"" and ""stop looking at us"" signs as they traveled around the world.

Kinsey Schofield, the host of the ""To Di For Daily,"" podcast, claimed to Fox News Digital that the former American actress has been quietly eyeing a relaunch of her lifestyle site ""The Tig."" A spokesperson for the duchess didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment about a possible relaunch.

MEGHAN MARKLE HAS BEEN 'UPSET AND OVERWHELMED' BY PORTRAYAL ON 'SOUTH PARK' EPISODE: REPORT

""I still believe the countdown to ‘The Tig’ 2.0 is on,"" said Schofield. ""Harry and Meghan thought that the book, Netflix series, and [Spotify] podcast would send them off in a completely different direction - a fulfilling and financially successful direction. We know from the Netflix series alone that they started developing some of these projects in late 2019.""

""I have heard that Meghan is dissatisfied with the public and media reaction to their recent projects,"" Schofield claimed. ""So much so that she is seeking guidance from mentors to redirect her pursuits. Meghan does not handle rejection well and is very sensitive to criticism. ‘Spare’ was the first real shift we saw from the general public about the Sussexes. They went from being seen as victims and heroes to a laughingstock. Lampooned during Hollywood award show monologues, late-night talk shows and now ‘South Park'… She is taken aback by it and unhappy with the negative attention.""

""Some might argue that Harry and Meghan tried to beat Hollywood to the punch by participating in quirky skits for Ellen DeGeneres and James Corden, but those fell flat… and are long forgotten,"" Schofield continued. ""… Meghan needs a win. Is it the judge throwing out the legal case involving Samantha? Maybe. Is it a new brand deal? Perhaps. A favorable interview and magazine cover? Could be.""

The duchess, 41, shut down ""The Tig"" months after she began dating Harry in 2017. A trademark for the blog was filed again in February 2022. Rumors were swirling earlier this year that Markle was eyeing a Valentine’s Day relaunch. Schofield said Markle may be putting any projects on pause to avoid further backlash.

""I don't think Meghan is comfortable launching a solo venture in the middle of such a negative PR storm because it will attract criticism,"" said Schofield. ""Aside from the digital pile-on, every article would mention litigation, ‘Spare,’ or ‘South Park.’ Meghan will feel confident enough to introduce us to a new product, project, or launch when she is riding high on a significant win. She was not expecting this.""

""The more Harry and Meghan talk, the more they are caught in contradictions,"" Schofield warned. ""They need to shift the focus and champion meaningful causes and charities and stop talking about themselves because the public is over it.""

""The Tig"" recently made headlines for a different reason. A resurfaced entry shared Markle’s candid thoughts about Kate Middleton’s wedding to Prince William. Markle originally claimed she ""didn’t know much"" about the British royal family.

""The blog post proves that Meghan always intended to be a ‘royal rebel,’"" said Schofield. ""It’s not a role she just fell into. It was her objective all along.""

MEGHAN MARKLE, KATE MIDDLETON'S ROYAL TAILOR SPEAKS OUT ON FALLOUT AMID PRINCE HARRY'S 'SPARE' RELEASE

The entry about Markle’s future sister-in-law was written in 2014, two years before the former American actress met her now-husband. For her blog, Markle interviewed Princess Alia Al Senussi, a descendant of Libyan royalty.

""Little girls dream of being princesses,"" wrote Markle. ""I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power. For those of you unfamiliar with the '80s cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength. We're definitely not talking about Cinderella here.""

""Grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy,"" Markle shared. ""Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the royal wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.""

Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King,"" told Fox News Digital the idea that Markle ""once complained about the endless conversation surrounding Kate's wedding and then went on to have a spectacular royal wedding of her own may seem either hypocritical or simply ironic, depending on your point of view.""

'SOUTH PARK' ROASTS PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE: FIVE WILDEST MOMENTS FROM PARODY EPISODE

Markle became the Duchess of Sussex when she married the British prince in 2018. The wedding drew in an estimated 29 million viewers in the U.S. alone, Nielsen data revealed.

""What I find most fascinating about this posting on ‘The Tig’ is that Meghan wanted to become not simply a princess but the superhero She-Ra, whose full title is ‘Princess of Power, the Most Powerful Woman in the Universe,’"" said Andersen. ""She-Ra is a take-no-prisoners warrior, a rebel, a disruptor - so in a sense, Meghan has become the princess she always wanted to be.""

Schofield alleged that Markle's focus has been how the public has been receiving the Sussexes lately.

""I am hearing that Meghan is fired up about everything happening right now,"" Schofield claimed. ""She feels like she is being shaded in coronation negotiations, she is not happy about the reaction to Harry's book... they have both become a punchline over it, and Meghan absolutely obsesses over litigation. She's in the middle of that right now with her half-sister… Maybe this just isn't the right time [to do a relaunch] with so much negativity surrounding [the Sussexes].""

Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital that following the Netflix docuseries and Harry's memoir, the couple will need to think of new ways to make money — with or without a blog.

MEGHAN MARKLE COULD BE RELAUNCHING PERSONAL WEBSITE; EXPERT CLAIMS: SHE'S 'TRYING TO RECLAIM HER IDENTITY'

""They’ve cashed the checks and now need to think about long-term sustainability,"" she claimed. ""… I think we’ve also seen that Hollywood has not accepted them in the way that they expected. Any goodwill they had has been blown up with the book. American audiences are sick of them. And there’s no mystique, which is the true power of the royal family’s exclusivity.""

""So no, it would not surprise me if she relaunched ‘The Tig,"" Felton Spence shared. ""… Why not try to be the next Gwyneth [Paltrow]? And if they had any understanding of who they are, and what they offer, or were willing to take any advice from experts, it’s probably exactly what she should have done during the pandemic. ‘At Home with the Duchess’ could find a real audience, and she could build a lifestyle brand from that.""

""I am not saying marrying a prince was her next career move,"" said Felton Spence. ""But… we’re not talking about Grace Kelly here.""

"Zac Efron, Russell Crowe star in ‘The Greatest Beer Run Ever’ based on wild true story about Vietnam war","Zac Efron is on a mission to bring cases of beer overseas to his friends serving in the Vietnam War in his new movie, ""The Greatest Beer Run Ever.""

The first trailer for Apple TV+‘s wartime comedy - based on a true story - gives a sneak peek at Efron’s role as Chickie Donohue, a real-life hero who traveled from New York to the front lines of the Vietnam War to gift soldiers American beer.

The film features Hollywood stars Russell Crowe and Bill Murray, and is based on the New York Times bestseller ""The Greatest Beer Run Ever: A Memoir of Friendship, Loyalty, and War"" by Donohue and J.T. Molloy.

""The Greatest Beer Run Ever"" is set in 1967 and focuses on Donahue's plan to support his friends fighting in Vietnam by personally bringing them beer. However, what started out as a great idea in Donahue’s mind quickly switches to a chaotic, life-changing journey.

OWEN WILSON SAYS MARVEL 'SCOLDED' HIM 'MULTIPLE TIMES' FOR SHARING INFORMATION ON HIS 'LOKI' ROLE

In the first few seconds of the trailer, the film captures the unbelievable story of friends preparing to ""run for [their] lives"" through a war zone – with text in the background that notes ""a real guy actually did this.""

&amp;amp;nbsp;

""It’s not going to be easy, but I'm going to show them that this country is still behind them,"" Donohue, played by Efron, remarked of the troops overseas.

""Smuggling beer into a war zone? That's not the smartest thing I've ever heard of. It's certainly not the worst, either,"" said Crowe, who co-stars in the film.

"Rare Civil War, WWI military items made by Tiffany & Co. to hit Illinois auction block","Rare and antique military items with a Tiffany & Co. touch are about to hit the auction block.

Rock Island Auction Company in Rock Island, Illinois, is putting three items with war ties up for auction during its event from Dec. 9 to 11.

Rock Island Auction Company interactive production manager Joel Kolander shared the details of each item in an interview with Fox News Digital.

AUCTION AMAZEMENT: BRITISH MAN TO SELL OFF COLLECTION OF AUTOGRAPHS FROM ALL 46 US PRESIDENTS

The auctioning expert explained that while today’s public thinks of Tiffany & Co. as a fine jewelry seller, the luxury brand has some of its earliest roots in Civil War-era weaponry.

""Tiffany & Co. is renowned as an American artisan,"" he said.

""Most of us know them for their silversmith capabilities — more contemporary for their jewelry and engagement rings ... but it wasn’t always that way.""

Tiffany & Co. was known for its ""fine presentation"" of officers’ swords during wartime, Kolander added.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, NOV. 21, 1864, ABRAHAM LINCOLN ‘PENS’ LETTER TO MRS. BIXBY

""Their emphasis on craftsmanship is apparent even 160 years ago,"" he said. ""They’re superb objects.""

He described these ""atypical"" pieces as a ""prize"" for sword collectors and other interested parties.

The first item on the auction block is the Gen. Sickles Excelsior Brigade sword made by Collins and embellished by Tiffany & Co.

The sword belonging to Gettysburg Commander Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles features golden artistry with intricate gilt and molding.

""Their emphasis on craftsmanship is apparent even 160 years ago.""

The handle is crafted into a knight’s head with a detailed torso, while the cross guard has a lion’s head carved into it.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, NOV. 23, 1859, WESTERN OUTLAW BILLY THE KID IS BORN IN NEW YORK CITY

""Excelsior"" is etched into the scabbard, which signifies its birthplace of New York.

This also refers to Sickles’ military unit in the Union Army, also known as the Excelsior Brigade.

The rest of the inscription reads, ""Presented to Gen. Sickles by his sincere friend.""

The scabbard and blade are decked out in foliage designs and patriotic motifs, such as American flags and an eagle.

The blade also has Tiffany & Co.’s marker acid-etched into it and is dated 1861.

""They definitely wanted people to know that this was their work, and they were proud of it,"" Kolander said.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCT. 28, 1886, STATUE OF LIBERTY UNVEILED TO THE US

""All the etching is immaculate and detail-oriented. It’s a fantastic piece belonging to a medal of [an] honor-winning Gettysburg commander.""

The Gen. Sickles Excelsior Brigade sword is expected to fetch $30,000 to $50,000 at auction, the auction company said.

The second item up for auction is another Civil War-era sword created in partnership with Tiffany & Co. and Prussia’s Peter D. Luneschloss Company.

The sword was presented to Lt. Col. Horace A. Manchester by the U.S. Marine Artillery, as labeled on an inscription on the scabbard.

Kolander pointed out that this sword looks ""significantly different"" due to its ironclad appearance.

This rugged look, he said, is on brand with the kind of cut-throat combat Manchester and his artillery took part in years ago.

SECRET OWNER'S $45 MILLION CAR COLLECTION UP FOR AUCTION

""They [were] actions of incredible violence that we don’t always hear about when it comes to the Civil War,"" he said.

""So, to have this rough and rugged-ready sword — very appropriate for what he was doing.""

Kolander said the ""very unusual"" use of iron throughout the sword is evidence that the weapon wasn’t built for being pretty, even though it is ""absolutely gorgeous.""

Perhaps the most fascinating feature is a small chip on the edge of the blade, said Kolander.

The blade comes with fine etchings and patriotic motifs, including the Great Seal of the United States, as well as Tiffany & Co.’s marker at the base.

But perhaps the most fascinating feature is a small chip on the edge of the blade, which Kolander said confirms the sword was used in combat.

The sword is expected to sell for $4,500 to $6,500, which Kolander considered an ""opportunity"" for collectors who want a Tiffany & Co. Civil War relic.

From Civil War swords, Tiffany & Co. extended its military presence into World War I.

KANSAS MAN AUCTIONING HIS AMAZING COLLECTION OF 15 RED CORVETTES

These Tiffany touches have shown up in naval aviator badges, which will be auctioned off by Rock Island as item no. 3.

Out of a set of 14 badges — including some 14-karat gold from both world wars — one pin, in particular, has been singled out as a Tiffany & Co. treasure from amid the Great War.

The pin is inscribed to World War I aviator Ensign William A. Magee Jr. and is dated Aug. 10, 1918.

Kolander noted the ornate craftsmanship of the piece, from the fine pinions on the wings to the stripes on the shield.

""It’s a very small piece with such a neat, large significance,"" he said.

""Compared relatively to some of the other badges, the Tiffany one does stand out a bit,"" he said.

The pre-auction estimated price range on the group of pins is $9,000 to $14,000.

The weekend-long auction will include nearly 5,000 items.

The collection features presidential marvels such as Teddy Roosevelt’s revolver and Abraham Lincoln’s Civil War presentation carbine.

A dog and his soldier: Lieutenant's prayers answered after beloved pup he bonded with overseas is rescued,"A soldier’s prayers for his best buddy to join him here at home apparently have been heard.

A stray dog found overseas by U.S. Army First Lt. Tad (full name withheld upon request) has been successfully rescued and brought to safety here in the U.S.

New York nonprofit Paws of War answered the soldier’s call earlier this month to retrieve the starving and abandoned pup named Gus.

DOG IN DANGER REUNITED WITH US SOLDIER FOR FIRST TIME SINCE THEY BONDED OVERSEAS: ‘MAGICAL MOMENT’

At the start of his deployment, Tad first found Gus, who is about two years old, searching for food near the overseas Army base.

The pair immediately connected — and became inseparable after several months of bonding, Paws of War told Fox News Digital.

However, Tad was assigned a deployment requiring him to relocate — so he’d soon have to leave behind his furry best friend.

""I sat with Gus before I left the old base and my heart just sank,"" Tad wrote in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.

""I prayed hard that he would be OK, but walking away for the last time haunted me.""

""I could tell he knew something was different, but he had no idea he was about to be alone again in a place [where] so many animals perish without someone to care for them.""

US NAVY SAILORS REUNITE WITH THE DOGS THEY RESCUED FROM NEAR-CERTAIN DEATH IN THE MIDDLE EAST

Leaving Gus behind involved ""more guilt than I could take,"" Tad said in his statement.

""He had helped me through deployment and [had] given me something to look forward to each day, and now I was about to betray him,"" he said.

""I prayed hard that he would be OK, but walking away for the last time haunted me,"" he continued.

The heart-wrenching goodbye on Jan. 2 of this year led Tad to reach out to New York-based Paws of War for help.

The organization was quick to tackle the complicated task of rescuing Gus from ""dangerous"" territory (exact location withheld upon request).

US SOLDIER CARES FOR INJURED DOG OVERSEAS, NOW HOPES TO BRING HIM HOME: ‘BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER’

When Paws of War’s overseas rescuers finally tracked Gus down, he was found alone on the base, still watching out in the distance ""expecting his soldier to return,"" the group noted.

""I can't wait to see him again.""

Gus was recently delivered to Tad’s family in Indianapolis, Indiana — where the dog will soon be reunited with his soldier and friend at the end of Tad's deployment this summer.

""The relief of knowing Gus is safe is indescribable,"" Tad said.

""I truly didn't think it would happen and that was so hard to deal with.""

He added, ""Now I can't wait to see him again knowing he'll never have to be alone another day in his life. I'm grateful beyond words.""

Paws of War’s ""War-Torn Pups and Cats"" program focuses on bringing animals rescued by soldiers overseas to the U.S. to be reunited with the men and women who saved them.

""We couldn't be more thrilled for Gus and Lieutenant Tad, and we thank everyone who makes what we do possible.""

""This is a perfect example of why our work is so important,"" Robert Misseri, co-founder of Paws of War, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""It's an amazing feeling every time to get another [pet to safety],"" he added.

""We couldn't be more thrilled for Gus and Lieutenant Tad, and we thank everyone who makes what we do possible.""

Misseri explained that what motivates the organization is witnessing the heartbreak felt by U.S. service members who are forced to leave behind animals they see ""as family members"" — and then being able to reunite them eventually.

""Our rescue missions for our soldiers and the animals they love are funded by the kindness of compassionate members of the public who believe in our work and want to help give back to our heroes,"" he said.

Explaining war to kids as Russia invades Ukraine: What to say and how to say it,"Most American children have been on high alert for many, many months due to COVID-19 and its far-reaching impacts.

As a result, some are already struggling with anxiety and worry, according to doctors and psychologists Fox News Digital consulted.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE TENSIONS: HOW FAMILIES AND KIDS CAN KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON

As Russia invades Ukraine and American parents and families watch the details play out on television, now is the time to ""keep kids calm,"" advised Dr. Meg Meeker, a pediatrician, author and creator of the Parenting Great Kids series.

""I've had to talk with kids of all ages (or coach parents) about war or national tragedies,"" said Dr. Meeker.

In the interest of trying to be helpful and offer reassurance where needed, here's some of the advice she shared for parents given the unfolding events in Europe.

Consider the age of the child. If a child is under 7-8, don't say anything unless the child asks, advises Dr. Meeker.

""Kids can't process issues that are this complex — and they begin to worry that their mom or dad might die.""

Keep dialogue simple. If a child is 8-11-ish, he or she will probably hear about what's going on from the news or at school — ""so you may need to have a discussion,"" said Dr. Meeker.

Suggestions for any discussion that does happen: ""Keep the dialogue very simple,"" said Dr. Meeker. ""State who is fighting whom and (very basically) why.""

""When kids see war scenes or hear about war repeatedly, they are traumatized,"" said Dr. Meeker.

She explains: ""Many parents fall into the trap of overspeaking, of giving too much information that kids can't handle or understand. So reassure them that the war will not come here — again, they worry about their lives and their parents' lives more than the lives of others fighting.""

Added Dr. Meeker, ""Tell them that wars have been fought for many years. If they ask questions, answer the questions but keep it simple. Remember, they can't process complex situations as adults can.""

Keep news on television for a short time. ""When kids see war scenes or hear about war repeatedly, they are traumatized,"" said Dr. Meeker. The situation can also be magnified in their minds, she said.

So, explain what is happening if the children are old enough (preteen-teen). If they are interested in political details, tell them — but don't force it.

""Even though they can understand more than youngsters, they still worry,"" said Dr. Meeker.

""So reassure them that now, this is not a war that will affect them. If it does later on, you'll deal with it then,"" she said.

Avoid political and divisive discussion. The reason for this advice? ""They will go to school and parrot what their parents say about President Biden, etc. — and this will cause division no matter how old they are,"" advised Dr. Meeker.

In memory of World War II veteran Lester Tanner: 'We are all Jewish',"A simple flagged-draped coffin rested on the altar on Sunday, in a Jewish funeral chapel on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

It could be any of the thousands of funerals for a World War II veteran.

The honor guard, a lone soldier, solemnly walks down the chapel's center aisle, stands at attention at the head of the casket — and salutes.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 7, 1941, PEARL HARBOR ATTACK KILLS 2,403 AMERICANS, LAUNCHES US INTO WORLD WAR II

A solo trumpet plays taps.

Another soldier makes the same trek and stands at the foot of the casket.

The two of them fold the flag with careful precision.

One soldier presses the triangular folded flag to his chest, faces the family, hands them the flag and salutes.

Then he says, ""On behalf of the president of the United States — thank you for your service to this country.""

‘Greatest Generation’ is leaving us

World War II vets are dying at an increased rate.

The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that by 2036, there will be only a few hundred remaining of the ""Greatest Generation.""

At a time when so many of them are leaving us, it's important that we not let their stories die with them.

Lester Tanner died last week. He was 99 years old.

At his service on Sunday, everyone talked about his incredible life, ordinary really — but full of the blessings that make life a joy.

A Harvard law degree, a thriving business, wife, children, stepchildren, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren with one on the way.

All of their lives touching other lives, bringing more lives into the world.

And it was all possible because nearly 80 years ago, one man was brave enough to stand in the gap and say, ""We are all Jewish.""

Tanner's story is entwined with the saga of Roddie Edmonds.

Tanner's story is entwined with the saga of Roddie Edmonds.

Edmonds was a master sergeant of the 106th Infantry Division, 422nd Infantry Regiment, in the United States Army during World War II.

He was the highest ranking officer at the Nazi's Stalag IX, a prisoner of war camp, that captured nearly 1,300 American soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.

The soldiers, some of them barefoot, had been marched brutally for miles in snow and cold.

Tanner and many others suffered severed frostbite, which made his feet scaly even decades later.

Tanner explained that in World War II, a man named Roddie Edmonds stood up for him. It became the defining moment in his life.

Edmonds never told his family about his experiences during the war.

His son Christopher, now a Baptist minister, was always curious.

Yet his father died in 1985 at age 65, never talking about his experiences in that POW camp.

But in 2008 an article appeared in The New York Times about Lester Tanner — who in 1980 sold his townhouse to former President Richard Nixon, after Nixon had been rejected from an apartment building because residents there didn't want him living near them.

Tanner, a devoted Democrat, thought that was terrible.

He reached out to the Nixons and said they could buy his place.

In explaining why he, a Democrat, would be gracious to a disgraced Republican, Tanner explained that in World War II, a man named Roddie Edmonds stood up for him.

It became the defining moment in his life — and made him committed to doing the same.

Roddie Edmonds saved the lives of at least 200 Jewish soldiers. He also inspired bravery in all the men and gave them hope that they could survive the camp and return home.

That article caught Christopher Edmonds' attention.

And that's when he learned what his father had done.

In January 1945 in that POW camp, the Nazi commandant ordered Master Sergeant Edmonds to have all the Jewish soldiers fall out the next morning.

REAGAN LIBRARY IN CALIFORNIA WILL HOST HOLOCAUST IN NEW YEAR: ‘SO EMOTIONAL,’ SAYS SURVIVOR

It meant that the Nazis would separate them for extermination, Hitler's final solution.

Edmonds told the men the night before that they weren't going to do that.

The next morning, all of the nearly 1,300 American soldiers lined up. The 19-year-old Tanner stood at Edmonds' right, and another young Jewish soldier, Paul Stern, was on his left.

The commandant was incensed. He approached Edmonds and yelled, ""They can't all be Jewish!""

Edmonds answered, ""We are all Jewish.""

The commandment cocked his pistol and put it to Edmonds' forehead, threatening to kill him then and there if he didn't have the Jewish soldiers fall out.

Christopher Edmonds first met Lester in 2013. Their friendship inspired a book as well as a documentary.

Edmonds refused. He said to the commandant that even if he were to kill him, ""We know who you are, and you will be tried on war crimes.""

The commandant relented, put his pistol back in the holster and walked away.

That day, Roddie Edmonds saved the lives of at least 200 Jewish soldiers.

He also inspired bravery in all the men and gave them hope that they could survive the camp and return home.

Christopher Edmonds first met Lester in 2013. Their friendship inspired a book as well as a documentary.

""It was the greatest honor to know Lester.""

Christopher Edmonds spoke at Lester's funeral, saying, ""It was the greatest honor to know Lester."" And that ""Lester was treasure.""

He quoted Psalm 118 knowing that it was as an unlikely scripture at a funeral, but it told the story of Lester's life: ""This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.""

In 2015, Roddie Edmonds was recognized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" by Yad Vashem, the world Holocaust Remembrance Center.

"National Vietnam War Veterans Day: History, facts and how to commemorate","Tuesday is National Vietnam War Veterans Day, a day when Americans thank and honor all those who served in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War.

The relatively new military holiday was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017, five years after President Barack Obama proclaimed the holiday in 2012, according to White House press release archives.

In his proclamation, Obama explained why it is important to create and recognize National Vietnam War Veterans Day.

VIETNAM VETERAN RECOGNIZED FOR HIS SERVICE 50 YEARS LATER

He wrote that the Vietnam War is ""a story of patriots who braved the line of fire, who cast themselves into harm's way to save a friend, who fought hour after hour, day after day to preserve the liberties we hold dear.""

""Yet, in one of the war's most profound tragedies, many of these men and women came home to be shunned or neglected — to face treatment unbefitting their courage and a welcome unworthy of their example,"" the proclamation continued later.

""We must never let this happen again.""

AMERICAN VETERANS, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TRAIN UKRAINIANS IN COMBAT CARE

The proclamation went on to explain that National Vietnam War Veterans Day is a way to ""reaffirm one of our most fundamental obligations: to show all who have worn the uniform of the United States the respect and dignity they deserve, and to honor their sacrifice by serving them as well as they served us.""

March 29 was chosen as the day to honor Vietnam War veterans because on March 29, 1973, the last of America’s troops left Vietnam and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam was disestablished, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.

The U.S. military was involved in Vietnam starting in the mid-'50s. The last American personnel were evacuated from Vietnam in April 1975, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.

During the Vietnam War, more than 58,000 Americans were killed and ""many thousands more"" were wounded, injured or determined missing, according to the Department of Defense.

Today, National Vietnam War Veterans Day honors everyone who served on active duty in the U.S. military from Nov. 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, the Vietnam War Commemoration says on its website.

In all, more than 9 million Americans served, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs blog post.

""We make no distinction between veterans who served in-country, in-theater, or who were stationed elsewhere during the Vietnam War period,"" the Commemoration website explains. ""All were called to serve and none could self-determine where they would serve.""

Today, there are believed to be more than 6 million living Vietnam War veterans living in the U.S. and abroad, according to the Vietnam War Commemoration.

One of the best ways that people can commemorate National Vietnam War Veterans Day is to thank the Vietnam War veterans in their life.

NationalToday.com recommends talking with family members who may have been involved either in the military or at home during the war, as long as they feel comfortable talking about it.

The website also suggests donating money to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.

"On this day in history, Feb. 9, 1942 feds enact Daylight Saving Time in darkest hours of World War II","The federal government enacted nationwide Daylight Saving Time amid the darkest depths of wartime fears on this day in history, Feb. 9, 1942.

""Passed by Congress and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the year-round daylight saving time required that clocks be moved ahead one hour for the remainder of the war as a national defense measure to conserve energy,"" notes Fishwrap, a blog of historic newspaper headlines.

The federal action went into effect just two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEB. 8, 1587, MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS, BEHEADED BY ORDER OF COUSIN QUEEN ELIZABETH I

The U.S. and its Allies struggled to contain Japanese advances in early 1942 and victory appeared hopeless.

The U.S. Army at the time was being overrun on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, while British Commonwealth forces were on the verge of losing Singapore.

The British defeat on Feb. 15 proved the largest surrender in U.K. military history.

America's surrender in April was followed by the brutal Bataan Death March.

The change in clock management was seen amid defeat and fear as a way ""to promote the national security and defense by establishing daylight saving time,"" according to the language in the statute — ""which is why it was nicknamed ‘war time,’"" the U.S. Department of Defense reports.

American time zones were renamed Eastern War Time, Pacific War Time, etc., across all five time zones in the United States and its territories at the time.

War Time remained in effect until after the surrender of Japan in September 1945.

Despite the war effort, the decision by the government was treated with the same controversy it suffers today in the minds of many Americans.

""Daylight savings time was passed to promote the national security and defense."" — Department of Defense.

""City yawns as new wartime goes into effect,"" read the front page headline of one American newspaper. The story noted that ""many workers have new experience, going to job in dark.""

Daylight Saving Time does not, of course, change the amount of daylight, as many people seem to believe. It merely means the sun rises later and sets later, according to our manmade measure of time.

DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME 2022: WHEN DOES IT END AND HOW DID IT COME TO BE?

Credit, or blame, wartime tinkering for the confusion over time — starting in World War I.

""In America, daylight saving time first became official on March 19, 1918, when the Standard Time Act was signed into law,"" writes the Defense Department.

""The part of that law pertaining to daylight saving time was only in effect for about a year and a half, though, before it was repealed due to the war’s end, despite President Woodrow Wilson vetoing the repeal.""

Great Britain was even more aggressive with its clock management during World War II. It moved clocks ahead two hours. It was called British Double Summer Time.

Among other consequences, it meant paratroopers who spearheaded the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, departed England in daylight around 11 p.m. on the night of June 5.

""Great Britain moved clocks ahead two hours during World War II. It was called British Double Summer Time.""

""The clocks were turned back to Greenwich Meantime at the end of summer 1945,"" notes the website Historic.UK.

""However, because of severe fuel shortages resulting from the harsh winter of 1946/47, the UK returned to British Double Summer Time during the summer of 1947.""

Confusion over the clock followed the end of wartime – and War Time – in the United States.

""The law was once again repealed, so individual states could establish their own standard time, writes the Defense Department.

""For the next two decades, there were no set rules for daylight saving time, which caused a lot of confusion for the transportation and broadcast industries.""

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, NOV. 18, 1883, NORTH AMERICAN RAILROADS CREATE TIME ZONES, RESHAPE GLOBAL LIFE

Congress passed the Uniform Time Act in 1966 that established daylight saving time across the country from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October. It was amended in 2005 to extend from March to November.

Controversy and confusion continue to plague the practice of so-called daylight saving time on both sides of the Atlantic.

""The first time zones were established by United States railroads in 1883.""

""Since its introduction, Daylight Saving Time has had both its advocates and critics. Advocates for the system claim the lighter summer mornings save energy, reduce traffic accidents and get people out and about and more active,"" notes Historic.UK.

""Critics, however, claim that if adopted all year round (known as British Standard Time), this would result in darker winter mornings, which would be more dangerous for children going to school.""

American families may face the same conundrum in the future.

The Senate last year passed legislation that would have made daylight saving time permanent this year, but momentum for the bill died amid other world affairs.

The notion of time zones is a fairly recent concept in human history.

""While daylight saving time is a federal mandate, states can opt out of it by passing a state law. Hawaii and Arizona don’t observe it, though the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona does. Most American territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam, don’t observe it, either,"" says the Department of Defense.

The notion of time zones is a fairly recent concept in human history.

The first time zones were established by United States railroads in 1883 in an effort to bring scheduling order to a chaotic system of timekeeping kept by local communities across the nation. Standardized times zones were soon adopted around the world.

"Putin's war against Ukraine may have spiritual, religious foundations: 'Good vs. evil'","The fuel behind Russian President Vladimir Putin's rage against Ukraine probably has more spiritual and religious foundations than most pundits have acknowledged.

For religious leaders, the war in Ukraine is a top concern.

For faith leaders in media, this conflict is not just about politics.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: LIVE UPDATES

Dirk Smith is one of the thousands of faith leaders in media who met last week in Nashville, Tennessee, for the National Religious Broadcasters convention.

He says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a simple spiritual matter.

UKRAINE PASTOR REMAINS AMID WAR TO HELP THE SUFFERING

""It's good versus evil … It is not Russians versus Ukrainians,"" Smith says. ""The Russian people — they don't want this.""

Smith heads EEM (Eastern European Ministry), an organization that has supplied millions of Bibles to Ukraine's public schools.

Yes, Ukraine's public schools — because the Ukrainian government has recognized the value of teaching the Good Book to young, impressionable minds.

UKRAINE'S REFUGEE CHILDREN: HOW TO HELP FROM AFAR

The relationship gives Smith insight into the Ukrainian spiritual mindset.

""Ukraine, to some extent, is kind of the Bible Belt of Eastern Europe. They have been pushing Christian values, they have been standing up for God for a long time, and they've been a beacon of light for quite some time now.""

Dr. Jeff Myers of Summit Ministries believes the spiritual is essential for helping put this war in context for young people.

""What is the physical aspect? What's the diplomatic aspect? All of those things are important,"" says Myers (summit.org).

He also notes that the ""spiritual aspect"" cannot be ignored with ""the rising generation."" ""What they're really asking is, ‘Why would God allow something like this?’""

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: AMERICAN PRIEST HELPING REFUGEES SAYS COUNTRY IS A ‘WAR ZONE’

For Sam Brownback, former ambassador-at-large of international religious freedom during the Trump administration, the Russian invasion is a holy war over the politics of religion.

Says Brownback, ""Vladimir Putin, at one point, painted himself as the defender of Christendom. That's how he fashions himself — that's part of the impetus.""

""We just know that God has told us to pray … God accomplishes things through prayer that we could not do on our own.""

Brownback, making the rounds at NRB, helped Christian leaders understand the foundation of Putin's rage. It's one most government officials failed to take as seriously as they should have.

Three years ago, the leader of the world's Orthodox Churches in Istanbul, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, granted the Ukraine Orthodox Church independence from the Russian Church in Moscow. It's called autocephaly.

To Western officials, it seemed a victory for religious freedom. But to Putin and the closely aligned Russian clergy, it was a shattering slap in the face.

Said Brownback, ""That blew a gasket with the Russian Orthodox church. They were livid. It was also 40 percent of their membership, roughly, in Ukraine.""

The break from Moscow was years in the making.

AS RUSSIA ‘DESTROYS LIVES,’ FAITH LEADERS SHARE OUTRAGE, PRAYERS, CONCERN

After signing the document, Bartholomew said, ""The pious Ukrainian people have been waiting for this blessed day for seven centuries.""

The Russian Orthodox Church was birthed in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 988, Prince Vladimir was baptized and left the pagan faith to become Christian.

""I believe it honestly is in [Putin's] own heart and soul as to why he thinks he's justified in doing this — which is just totally wrong.""

""So the whole nation was baptized,"" says Brownback. ""That's the start of the Russian Orthodox Church.""

""But then it was later moved to Moscow, their headquarters there. And so to Putin, this is part of Mother Russia. And the Ukrainians don't want to be part of Mother Russia.""

""I believe it honestly is in his own heart and soul as to why he thinks he's justified in doing this — which is just totally wrong,"" says Brownback.

He says there'll be a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacking, looking back on that decision that the West applauded.

It only poured salt into Putin's gashing wound.

But the hope, at least, for faith leaders who see this as a spiritual battle is that the solution is also spiritual.

Ron Harris, head of Medialliance (medialliance.cc), says God is still sovereign and is still in control.

"On this day in history, Feb. 24, 1914, Joshua L. Chamberlain dies, college professor turned Civil War hero","Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a bookish professor of rhetoric at Bowdoin College in Maine who became the Union's most celebrated combat hero of the Civil War, died on this day in history, Feb. 24, 1914.

Brig. Gen. Chamberlain was 85 years old.

""A veritable icon of Civil War legend, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is best known for his heroic participation in the Battle of Gettysburg,"" writes the American Battlefield Trust.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEB. 23, 1945, US MARINES RAISE AMERICAN FLAG OVER IWO JIMA, CAPTURED IN HEROIC PHOTO

""Prolific and prosaic throughout his life, Chamberlain spent his twilight years writing and speaking about the war.""

His death was attributed at least partly to some of the incredible six wounds he suffered and survived in battle 50 years earlier.

His ability to continue fighting despite numerous wounds, in an era in which whiskey and amputations were common treatments in battlefield medicine, was among his many remarkable successes as soldier.

Chamberlain is the last Civil War soldier to die of injuries suffered in combat, according to the Department of the Defense.

He was ""a veritable icon of Civil War legend."" — American Battlefield Trust

Colonel Chamberlain earned the Medal of Honor for his heroic leadership of the 20th Maine Infantry at Gettysburg.

He later had the honor of accepting General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox.

WWII LOVE LETTERS HIDDEN BEHIND WALL IN NEW YORK HOME DELIVERED TO FAMILY 80 YEARS LATER

He served four terms as governor of Maine, wrote a powerful chronicle of the last months of the war, ""The Passing of the Armies,"" and returned to academia, spending 12 years as president of Bowdoin.

Chamberlain's legend was forged on Little Round Top, on the far left flank of the vast Union army at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1863.

Chamberlain's 20th Maine repelled numerous Confederate charges but ran out of ammunition.

He could not retreat and he could not surrender — or the rebels might roll up the entire Union line and possibly win the war with a stunning victory in the northern state.

Chamberlain responded with a dramatic bayonet charge down the hill, a turning point in American history that was immortalized in the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 historical novel ""The Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara and again in the 1993 movie, ""Gettysburg.""

""Chamberlain raised his saber, let loose the greatest sound he could make, boiling the sound up from his chest."" — Michael Shaara

""Chamberlain raised his saber, let loose the greatest sound he could make, boiling the sound up from his chest,"" Shaara wrote in the dramatized account of the historically accurate encounter.

""Fix bayonets! Charge! Fix bayonets! Charge! Fix bayonets! Charge! He leaped down from the boulder, still screaming, his voice beginning to crack and give, and all around him his men were roaring animal screams,"" wrote Shaara.

""He saw the whole regiment rising and pouring over the wall, and beginning to bound down through the dark bushes, over the dead and dying and wounded, hats coming off, hair flying, mouths making sounds, one man firing as he ran, the last bullet, the last round.""

The frenzied charge swept away four Confederate regiments. About 2,000 men were killed, wounded, surrendered or retreated.

The rebel army lost the battle the following day, with the heroic but ill-fated disaster of Pickett's Charge.

Chamberlain's beautifully written work, ""The Passing of the Armies,"" published posthumously in 1915, serves as a foundation of scholarship of the final year of the Civil War and offers sobering insight into of the minds of men in combat.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WROTE ‘THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC’

""The hammering business had been hard on the hammer,"" he wrote of the tragic Union casualties suffered while trying to pound the Confederates into defeat at Petersburg in the final months of the war.

Chamberlain was later given the duty of accepting General Lee's surrender at Appomattox, adding to his legend among Civil War soldiers.

""Grant wished the ceremony to be as simple as possible, and that nothing should be done to humiliate the manhood of the southern soldiers,"" Chamberlain wrote in ""The Passing of the Armies.""

He ordered his columns to salute the defeated Confederate troops — helping set the tone of the peace in Lincoln’s stated hope ""with malice toward none and charity toward all.""

""It was not a 'present arms,' however … which then as now was the highest possible honor to be paid even to a president,"" Chamberlain later said.

""It was the 'carry arms,' as it was then known, with musket held by the right hand and perpendicular to the shoulder.""

""Throughout the war, Chamberlain was wounded six times, most grievously at Petersburg in June 1864,"" writes American Battlefield Trust.

""Believing this wound to be mortal, Congress promoted Chamberlain to the rank of brigadier general. Chamberlain, however, would survive the wound, and return to the front in time to play a pivotal role in the Appomattox Campaign.""

""Grant wished … that nothing should be done to humiliate the manhood of the Southern soldiers."" — Chamberlain on end of war

His achievements with both sword and quill make him one of the most remarkable soldiers in American history.

""Our place in human brotherhood, our responsibility not only in duty for country, but as part of its very being, came into view,"" he wrote of serving the nation in wartime.

His legend was cemented in that decisive moment of action on July 2, 1863, for which he was awarded the nation's highest honor for valor.

Some historians argue that the heroic Chamberlain not only saved the Union army at Little Round Top, but saved the cause of the Union itself.

""The regiment’s sudden, desperate bayonet charge blunted the Confederate assault on Little Round Top and has been credited with saving Major General George Gordon Meade’s Army of the Potomac, winning the Battle of Gettysburg and setting the South on a long, irreversible path to defeat,"" reports American Battlefield Trust.",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-feb-24-1914-joshua-chamberlain-dies-professor-civil-war-hero,N/A
"On this day in history, Jan. 21, 1977, President Carter pardons Vietnam War draft dodgers","President Jimmy Carter granted an unconditional and controversial pardon to the many thousands of men who dodged the U.S. military draft during the Vietnam War on this day in history, Jan. 21, 1977.

Ahead of the 1976 presidential election, then-candidate Carter promised to pardon those who evaded the draft as a way to close the nation's book on Vietnam.

The day after his inauguration, Carter kept his word — and pardoned draft dodgers who had not committed violent offenses.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 24, 1972, BOB HOPE DELIVERS LAST LIVE CHRISTMAS SHOW IN VIETNAM

Carter's presidential proclamation read, in part, ""Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States, do hereby grant a full, complete and unconditional pardon to: (1) all persons who may have committed any offense between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973 in violation of the Military Selective Service Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder; and (2) all persons heretofore convicted, irrespective of the date of conviction, of any offense committed between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973 in violation of the Military Selective Service Act, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, restoring to them full political, civil and other rights.""

Carter said during the presidential campaign that a pardon was needed ""to heal our country after the Vietnam War.""

He also said that while disagreements remained, ""we can now agree to respect those differences and to forget them.""

However — many people did not forget ""those differences.""

The American Legion, among many other groups, ""had been vocal in its opposition to any form of amnesty granted to anyone who dodged the draft while others went to war,"" as the organization notes on its website to this day.

THE AMERICAN LEGION TURNS 103: A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION FORMED TO AID WORLD WAR I VETERANS

""Carter had outlined his plan to pardon the violators at the 1976 American Legion National Convention in Seattle. The Legionnaires, many of whom booed the announcement, were adamantly opposed and explored possible legal and constitutional violations of such a pardon,"" the group notes.

After Carter issued his pardon, ""American Legion leaders warned what such a move would mean for national security in the event of a future draft.""

Adds the Legion on its site, ""The wartime veterans of the organization had argued … that no pardons should be granted, hearkening to the same position of the World War I American Legion founders who demanded justice for ‘alien slackers’ who lived in the United States but used their foreign citizenship to escape conscription during the Great War.""

Most draft dodgers fled to Canada

During the late 1960s to early 1970s, some 100,000 young Americans traveled abroad to avoid serving in the war, according to History.com.

About 1,000 Americans deserted the Armed Forces and also headed to Canada.

Ninety percent of them flocked to Canada — where they were eventually welcomed as immigrants.

Other people hid inside the United States.

About 1,000 Americans deserted the Armed Forces and also headed to Canada, too, History.com reports.

While the Canadian government had the right to prosecute these deserters, they were often left alone.

After the war ended, the U.S. government continued to prosecute draft dodgers until a total of 209,517 men were formally accused of dodging the draft.

Government officials estimated that another 360,000 men were never pointed out, according to History.com.

Those who were accused, upon returning home from Canada or from other locations, were threatened with prison sentences or forced military service.

Many people who fled the country returned home — while an estimated 50,000 Americans settled in Canada permanently.

"Anti-war protesters crash Biden's dinner out in Washington, DC: 'I hate to bother you but people are dying'","Code Pink, a left wing activist group focused on ending foreign wars, confronted President Biden Saturday at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., over his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war. The protesters called on Biden to seek peace and an end to the war rather than escalation before being asked to leave by the establishment's staff.

""President Biden, I hate to bother you, we need to end this war in Ukraine. We need to push through negotiations!"" one protester shouted.

""I hate to bother you but people are dying,"" she continued.

US WARNED RUSSIA OF BIDEN'S VISIT TO UKRAINE ‘HOURS’ BEFORE DEPARTURE

Code Pink posted a video of the incident on their Twitter profile.

""WATCH: We ran into President Biden at dinner in DC - he can eat peace when there’s peace for the people and planet too,"" the group tweeted.

The protester also called for the Biden administration to lift sanctions on Cuba.

""Please take Cuba off the state sponsor of terror list,"" she said.

""I hate to bother you, I'll happily leave but I hope that we push for peace talks and negotiations and take Cuba off the state sanctioned terrorist list,"" she said.

BIDEN UKRAINE TRIP: LATEST IN THE HISTORY OF SECRET PRESIDENTIAL VISITS TO COMBAT ZONES

The United States' support for Ukraine in its war against Russia has drawn increased criticism in recent months, with both conservatives and progressives growing increasingly wary of continued military aid to the embattled nation. Former President Trump has called for an end to the war, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also cautioned against a ""blank-check"" policy on aid to Ukraine.

In Congress, around a dozen house Republicans introduced legislation calling on an end to continued U.S. support for Ukraine. On the political Left, Sen. Bernie Sanders has long cautioned against too much involvement in the war on behalf of the United States. Additionally, late last year 30 House Democrats penned a letter advocating for the Biden administration to pursue diplomatic solutions to bring the war to a close.

Many on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns that continued American involvement can lead to escalation between the U.S. and Russia, two nuclear superpowers. Supporters of the continued aid argue it is necessary to maintain Ukraine's sovereignty and deter further aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Recent polling shows some Americans are becoming more opposed to continued aid for Ukraine. According to a Pew Research survey conducted late last month, 25 percent of Americans say the U.S. is giving too much aid to Ukraine, up from 19 percent in September.

Code Pink's protest drew mixed reactions online. Keith Olbermann, a progressive commentator, blasted the group.

""It's hard to believe you could dishonor the name ‘Codepink’ but you have. You need to be yelling that at Putin, you naive children,"" he tweeted.

Vietnam: One of modern history's most infamous conflicts unpacked in new Fox Nation special by Bret Baier,"46 years after the fall of Saigon marked the end of the Vietnam War, the 20-year-long conflict remains a contentious subject that has left an impact on nearly every America.

Now, Fox Nation dedicates a five-part deep-dive into the subject with ‘The Unauthorized History of the Vietnam War,’ bringing a fresh perspective on one of modern history’s most controversial conflicts. This five-episode series helmed by Fox News' Bret Baier traces the war from its initial breakout through the fall of Saigon.

Following World War II, the Iron Curtain descended upon the world as a new conflict emerged, plaguing the rest of the twentieth century with the Cold War. As Democratic and communist countries began expanding to secure dominance, Vietnam became the quintessential conflict of the Cold War with the United States, the USSR and China serving as defenders of democracy or communism.

As the special explores, Under Joseph Stalin, the USSR sought to expand communism and set up a border between free Western Europe and communist Russia. In response, the United States emphasized the policy of containment to prevent the spread of communism, becoming the main motivator for early conflicts and growing tensions between the USSR and the United States.

NATIONAL VIETNAM WAR VETERANS DAY: HISTORY, FACTS AND HOW TO COMMEMORATE

Prior to the Vietnam War, a wave of communism swept Asia with China falling to communism in 1949 and the Korean War splitting the nation into a communist North Korea and democratic South Korea in 1953.

By the time Vietnam broke free from the French, the United States and the USSR began supporting different leaders as Vietnam’s fate was yet to be decided. Episode one of the Fox Nation special hones in on the rising threat of Vietnam amid Cold War tensions.

CLICK HERE TO GET FOX NATION

As the Cold War expanded and tension increased into the 1960s, the United States’ involvement in Vietnam changed. The Kennedy administration supported a coup to kill and replace South Vietnam’s president, escalating America’s involvement in the war. Episode two dives deeper into the increased involvement during the Kennedy Administration.



""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty,"" President John F. Kennedy can be heard proclaiming in his inaugural address.



But the buck didn't stop with JFK.

Episode three covers Lyndon B Johnson’s leadership during the war following Kennedy's assassination.



After Kennedy's death, Lyndon B Johnson continued increasing American involvement in the war - including sending more American troops to Vietnam. The Tet Offensive - a surprise attack launched by North Vietnam at the start of 1968 - was considered a major turning point in the war, and allowed the harsh realities of the conflict overseas to resonate with the masses in the United States.

ON VETERANS DAY, THIS VIETNAM VET WANTS OTHER TO KNOW: ‘YOU ARE NOT ALONE’

As the war dragged on, Americans began a string of mass protests at home with some of the largest public protests in U.S. history. In 1973, the Paris Peace Accords formally ended America’s involvement in the Vietnam War and initiated the gradual removal of troops. Episode four of the Fox Nation special looks at the growing tensions on America’s home front and President Nixon’s work to end U.S. involvement.

In the final episode of ‘The Unauthorized History of the Vietnam War,’ the fall of Saigon comes into focus, as well as the developing relationships between the U.S. and Asian nations like China and Vietnam moving into the 21st century. In April 1975, the final evacuation of U.S. personnel and South Vietnamese support occurred while Saigon falls to the communist North Vietnamese – proving to be, what many Americans believe, a fruitless endeavor.



Though not all would agree.

The Vietnam War is perhaps one of the most controversial and impactful conflicts of modern warfare, and its influence still shapes geopolitics today despite massive changes in the government landscape of Asia after the fall of the USSR. Many relationships and perspectives are shaped by this war, despite this conflict being largely misunderstood.

New Zealand prime minister condemned for calling to regulate free speech as a 'weapon of war' at UN,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was blasted for comparing free speech online to ""weapons of war"" in a recent speech to the U.N. that critics called ""authoritarian.""

At the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Ardern announced a new initiative ""to help improve research and understanding of how a person’s online experiences are curated by automated processes,"" saying the work, done in partnership with companies and non-profits, will be ""important in understanding more about mis- and disinformation online - A challenge that we must as leaders address.""

The prime minister acknowledged that calling to regulate speech online in any way can seem problematic.

""As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech that we value so highly,"" she noted. ""But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to this challenge, I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it. To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value.""

FEDERAL COURT RULES BIG TECH HAS NO 'FREEWHEELING FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CENSOR'

Ardern then asked the audience how they could tackle various challenges if people are allowed to share opposing narratives online.

""After all, how do you successfully end a war if people are led to believe the reason for its existence is not only legal but noble? How do you tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld, when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology?"" she asked.

Ardern then suggested that online speech is a weapon often used by those with evil intent.

""The weapons may be different but the goals of those who perpetuate them is often the same. To cause chaos and reduce the ability of others to defend themselves. To disband communities. To collapse the collective strength of countries who work together,"" she claimed.

SUPREME COURT POISED TO RULE ON LAW ROLLING BACK BIG TECH ABILITY TO MUZZLE OPINIONS

The prime minister urged action from the gathered audience of U.N. leaders.

""But we have an opportunity here to ensure that these particular weapons of war do not become an established part of warfare. In these times, I am acutely aware of how easy it is to feel disheartened. We are facing many battles on many fronts,"" she said. ""But there is cause for optimism. Because for every new weapon we face, there is a new tool to overcome it. For every attempt to push the world into chaos, is a collective conviction to bring us back to order. We have the means; we just need the collective will.""

Footage of the New Zealand prime minister's speech went viral on Wednesday, with many commentators condemning her remarks.

Independent journalist and The Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald called out Ardern on Twitter.

""This is the face of authoritarianism - even though it looks different than you were taught to expect. And it's the mindset of tyrants everywhere,"" Greenwald wrote. ""This is someone so inebriated by her sense of righteousness and superiority that she views dissent as an evil too dangerous to allow.""

Diesel Jack Media CEO and author Nick Palmisciano appeared to sarcastically skewer Ardern's ideas.

""Yes, please bring on the government disinformation service. What could possibly go wrong? It’s not like we ever see government officials abuse their power to their own ends,"" he wrote.

RedState deputy managing editor Brandon Morse warned, ""This is the authoritarians admitting that your free speech is a threat to their rule.""

American Greatness CEO Ned Ryun made a similar comment, ""She’s an absolute authoritarian. In fact, evil.""

"Against Russia, Ukraine will lose a war of attrition","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As Russia’s war on Ukraine staggers into sixth month, Ukraine is on the verge of a key shift in strategy. And belatedly, President Biden is providing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with some of the weapons he so desperately needs to implement it.

Until recently, Ukraine’s military has been sustaining devastating losses trying to thwart the Russian onslaught in the Donbas, the eastern part of the country. Fighting bloody and ultimately losing battles in the streets of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, Ukrainian forces were unable to halt the Russian onslaught there. Russian troops occupied both cities.

Although Russia’s casualties were said to be higher than Ukraine’s, Zelenskyy estimated that 60-100 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day in the fighting. Other analysts put Ukrainian casualties even higher.

Finally, Zelenskyy acknowledged that trying to hold onto what he called ""dead cities"" against overwhelming Russian force was futile. Ukrainian forces withdrew.

THE UKRAINE WAR SHOCKED THE WORLD. WE MUST ACT NOW TO PREVENT THE NEXT ONE IN ASIA

But Zelenskyy also recognizes political reality: if the war continues to descend into a stalemate, or what New York Times columnist Tom Friedman called a grinding, ""somewhat boring slog,"" Ukraine will lose.

Given Russia’s size and strength, Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas, and the fecklessness of China, Indonesia, and the indifference of these and other states to Russia’s brutal aggression, a war of attrition would inevitably be Ukraine’s downfall and President Vladimir Putin’s victory. It has taken Zelenskyy months, however, to persuade Biden to provide him with the type and supply of weapons he needs to take the offensive and expel Russian forces from Ukraine’s territory.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive in southern Kherson, which Russian forces have occupied since early in the war, has now begun. Make no mistake: It must succeed if this egregious war is to end.

""The longer this war goes on, the worse it will be Ukraine,"" said retired Gen. Jack Keane, the U.S Army’s former vice chief of staff and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, which tracks Ukraine closely. ""Time is not on Ukraine’s side.""

President Biden should be praised for having immediately condemned Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine last February, for having led the campaign to support and arm Ukraine, and for having held together the fractious coalition of European Union and NATO member states whose economic sanctions and other anti-Russian measures are vital if Putin’s ruthless war of aggression is to fail.

But the president has also walked a political tightrope – balancing his desire to help Ukraine defend itself ""for as long as it takes,"" on one hand, but, on the other, avoid the escalation of a conflict that he has warned could result in World War III.

UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND HIS WIFE OLENA ARE AN INSPIRATION WITH REMARKABLE RESOLVE AND RESILIENCE

So while the Biden administration began providing Ukraine in June a limited number of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems – long-range missiles known as HIMARS – it has barred Kyiv from firing into Russian territory, no matter how grave the provocation. And because he fears provoking Putin, Biden has also refused to provide Army Tactical Missile Systems, with a range of over 190 miles, the longest-range missiles in Army inventory, which Ukraine has frequently requested. ""These missiles would be well suited for attacks inside Russia,"" said Keane, who supports their provision to Kyiv.

Other domestic and foreign analysts have also criticized Biden’s restrictions. ""The unfortunate conclusion to draw is that we in the West are telling Russia, ‘It’s OK for you to shoot from Belarus into Ukraine. It’s OK for you to shoot from Russia. But it’s not OK for Ukraine to shoot back into Russia,’"" said Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the retired supreme allied commander for Europe, at a recent virtual national security forum.

Ukraine needs such restrictions lifted. It needs to change the so-called rules of engagement in this brutal conflict if Kyiv and its Western allies are to prevail.

Pressure is growing from such prominent analysts as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and such American allies as French President Emmanuel Macron to give Putin a diplomatic ""off-ramp"" to end the war.

Zelenskyy has vowed to continue fighting rather than cede an inch of Ukrainian territory to Russia. But, increasingly, he is being pushed to stop trying to reclaim parts of the Donbas that Russian forces have conquered since February and abandon his claim to Crimea and territory in the Donbas that Putin seized in 2014. American legislators are quietly (and not so quietly) beginning to grouse about the more than $7.6 billion in security assistance and over $33 billion in aid that Biden and the Congress have given Kyiv.

In a recent essay in the Wall Street Journal, Jacquelyn Schneider, a Hoover fellow at Stanford University, warned that Washington was already depleting the stockpile of its own so-called legacy weapons systems, like versions of the antitank Javelin and antiaircraft Stinger missiles.

The U.S. already gave a third of its Javelin arsenal and a quarter of its U.S. Stingers to Ukraine in the first four months of the war. Washington will soon be unable to continue supplying Ukraine at this pace without ""significant reforms to its defense acquisition and production policies,"" Schneider writes. But given the gridlock and hyper partisanship on Capitol Hill, as well as resistance to change at the Pentagon, how likely is such reform?

China and the US are locked in a cold war. We must win it. Here's how we will,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy discuss this topic and more on ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum' at 3 pm ET.

The greatest threat to the United States is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). America spent decades pursuing policies that welcomed China into the international system. But since then, instead of embracing freedom or becoming a responsible stakeholder, Beijing has flouted international norms while exporting totalitarianism, aggression, and ideological control.

To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.

We must recognize that China’s ""peaceful rise"" was pure fiction and finally confront the CCP with the urgency the threat demands. To do that, House Republicans will establish a Select Committee on China in the new Congress.

CHINA PUTS THE WORLD AT MORE RISK THAN EVER BEFORE

Here's the good news: when the threat is dire, Americans have a proud history of coming together. There is bipartisan consensus that the era of trusting Communist China is over.

Two years ago, House Republicans proposed to create a bipartisan China Task Force. Sadly, Democrats refused to participate, but the Task Force released a comprehensive blueprint built on bipartisan proposals on how to confront the CCP. The establishment of the Select Committee on China will build on the work first laid out by that China Task Force, and it will do it in a bipartisan way.

The first step is to restore our supply chains and end critical economic dependencies on China. In 2021, the U.S. imported a quarter of its antibiotics from China. India, a key producer of generic drugs, depends on China for 80% of the underlying active pharmaceutical ingredients–demonstrating that even ostensibly friendly sources of lifesaving drugs oftentimes ultimately trace back to China.

prev next Image 4 of 5

prev Image 5 of 5

Meanwhile, in 2019, approximately 90% of the world’s rare earth metals, alloys, and permanent magnets were produced in China. The Select Committee will expose our dangerous dependence on China and advance policies to build secure sources for critical supply chains, either in the United States or in partnership with like-minded allies.

To win the new Cold War, we must respond to Chinese aggression with tough policies to strengthen our economy, rebuild our supply chains, speak out for human rights, stand against military aggression, and end the theft of Americans’ personal information, intellectual property, and jobs.

It will also work to prevent trillions of American dollars and millions of American retirees from financing communist genocide and military modernization by developing policies to prohibit state and local pension funds—the same entities evangelizing for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments—from investing in China. Our goal will be to promote overwhelming economic superiority. When we have a strong economy, we are safer.

PROTESTS IN CHINA ARE ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN COVID LOCKDOWNS

Confronting China is also about deterring aggression on the world stage, both military and economic. Taiwan and other allies increasingly find themselves in the crosshairs of military aggression by the CCP. Meanwhile, the CCP advances its Belt and Road Initiative to ensnare other countries into its debt trap diplomacy that only benefits the CCP. Further, the CCP engages in unfair trade practices and actively seeks to steal intellectual property from the United States and others.

We cannot afford to misread the CCP’s intentions. The Select Committee will make the urgent case for aiding Taiwan in its self-defense and build relationships with our other Indo-Pacific allies.

As China uses its growing economy to modernize its military, we must also develop new weapons and stockpiles to project power, preserve our global influence, and protect our forces, including in space and cyberspace.

Further, we will look at how the United States and freedom-loving countries can work together to push viable alternatives to the Belt and Road Initiative. The time-tested formula for victory—while deterring war— as President Reagan proved, is peace through strength.

In addition, winning the new Cold War with China requires defending our domestic institutions. The Select Committee will demonstrate how the CCP uses ""United Front Work"" and authoritarian tactics to cultivate foreign elites and silence criticism of CCP atrocities, as well as shed light on ongoing CCP interference and influence campaigns in a way the American public can easily understand.

The Select Committee will expose how the CCP uses lobbying at the local, state, and federal level to advance CCP dogma against our interests and provide recommendations for fixing our weak lobbying laws.

Finally, the Select Committee will investigate the CCP’s attempts at infiltrating our academic institutions and the rise and proliferation of Confucius Institutes in the United States as organs of the CCP, as well as how the CCP or affiliated entities purchases land in the United States to the detriment of our national and economic security.

We also will seek to shine a light on the CCP’s security services operating in the United States, especially how the CCP attempts to intimidate and spy on Chinese citizens and Americans here in the United States. In doing all this, the Select Committee will take care to distinguish between the Chinese people and the regime that oppresses them.

In the aftermath of the 20th Party Congress earlier this fall, General Secretary Xi Jinping is more emboldened than ever to pursue his aggressive agenda aimed at the pilfering of the American economy, the destruction of our international leadership, and the subversion of our institutions.

At the same time, recent large-scale anti-regime protests reveal the fundamental insecurity of Xi’s authoritarian rule. Through the Select Committee on China, the House will stand with all those in China oppressed by the regime while advancing policies that both deter war this decade and set the long-term path for victory in this new Cold War.

Biden's war on your kitchen continues with proposed gas stove ban,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One of the Trump administration’s final public policy campaigns was an effort to – as he put it – ""make dishwashers great again."" It was a slogan as over-the-top and eccentric as the former president. However, it did refer to a legitimate public policy concern. For years, the Department of Energy (DOE) had restrictions in place limiting the water usage of home appliances – not least among them were dishwashers. And, thus, one of Donald Trump’s last acts as president was to have DOE create rules to allow a new, legal class of more efficient dishwashers.

The logic was very simple. From 1983 to 2018, the average wash cycle time in the U.S. more than doubled from 69 minutes to 140 minutes. While, the appliances used less water, they ran for twice the time and did not perform as well. Naturally, 98 percent of the 2,244 people who submitted comments to the Trump DOE’s regulatory docket supported the proposal for the legalization of these new dishwashers. It was a commonsense proposal that would save American consumers time – and ultimately money.

Sadly, the Biden administration quickly did away with this rule change, reverting back to the old DOE standards. This once again relegated Americans to choosing between hand-washing their dishes one at a time – which would likely use as much, if not more, water – or running wash cycles that would take twice as long and even then might not get the job done.

Now, it seems the Biden administration’s war on convenience in the home is far from over. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has reportedly been weighing a rule that would ban gas stoves nationwide. This comes after prompting by Democrat Sen. Cory Booker and Democrat Rep. Don Beyer, who urged the agency to do something about gas stoves, claiming they are a ""cumulative burden"" on minority and low-income households.

BIDEN ADMIN TORCHED BY REP. GARY PALMER OVER POTENTIAL GAS STOVE BAN

This gas stove ban would be the latest proposed action being done in the name of protecting the vulnerable, while actually going after their way of life in a very tangible way. Despite reports that the agency is walking back this plan, it is far from out of character for this administration.

Arguments in favor of a ban are fairly deceptive. On average, gas stoves are 10 to 30 percent less expensive than their electric counterparts. So, yes, low-income communities do utilize gas stoves more frequently than the more financially advantaged classes. However, this also means that gas stoves are a more affordable alternative for low-income communities and – without them – they will be pressed even harder economically. A ban on gas stoves would act as a backdoor tax on those who would have to switch to more expensive models.

The data on which this newfound interest in gas stoves by the federal government stands on shaky ground. In December, the International Journal of Environmental Research (IJER) and Public Health published a meta-analysis, examining the link between childhood asthma and gas stoves in the home. The study analyzed 27 other manuscripts on the subject and combined the results. This is despite the fact that a similar meta-analysis was performed in 2013, which used 41 studies, indicating the IJER analysis may have selectively chosen its data.

Also, the primary author of the IJER meta-analysis works for the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a special interest group based in Colorado, which describes itself as a ""non-partisan, non-profit organization that works to transform global energy systems across the real economy… powering our homes and businesses without fossil fuels.""

RMI also received a 4.4 million dollar grant from the Department of Energy. According to Influence Watch, RMI’s top donors are dedicated left-wing groups like the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the Oak Foundation, and the ClimateWorks Foundation. Despite this, IJER cites no potential conflicts of interest in its analyses and conclusions.

Simply, there are a number of reasons American consumers would select a gas stove over an electric one. Gas stovetops give instant heat and have the ability to make immediate temperature changes while cooking. The stovetops are also more sturdy and compatible with a variety of cookware. This makes gas stoves more practical for restaurants as well. A ban could severely damage the business models of many independently owned restaurants, driving up costs which would either increase meal prices or – at worst – put them out of business.

Whatever the reason, consumers and restaurants should be free to make the choices best for them, knowing and weighing the potential risks on their own. The Biden administration should stay true to latest reports and stay far away from any sort of ban on these appliances.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-war-your-kitchen-continues-proposed-gas-stove-ban,N/A
"Bill O'Reilly: War on Christmas won by the good guys, but insurgents remain","You may remember about 10 years ago, “The O’Reilly Factor” began spotlighting companies that refused to say the words ""Merry Christmas.""

In fact, some of those businesses actually ordered their employees not to say that. Well, that culture war issue ignited. And we won. Most companies stopped the nonsense and Merry Christmas became a common greeting once again. For me, it was interesting to go through that, because some on the far left actually denied there was any controversy at all and claimed that I fabricated it. More lies from a crew that is incapable of telling the truth.

Anyway, this year the American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Miss., Elvis' hometown, has issued its annual “naughty or nice” list. That tells the public which businesses are Christmas-friendly and which are not. This year, the following companies are rated five-star nice: Cracker Barrel, Hobby Lobby, Kirkland's, Lowe's, Michael's and Walmart. I remember at one time, Lowe's was a problem. But obviously that's turned around.

Also on the Christmas-friendly list: Ace Hardware, Banana Republic, Bass Pro Shops, Bed Bath and Beyond, Books-A-Million, Dick's Sporting Goods, Home Depot, JC Penney, Kmart, L.L. Bean, Marshall’s, Neiman Marcus, Proflowers.com, Rite Aid, Sam's Club and Toys R Us.

All of those companies use the word “Christmas” in their advertising and promotion.

Now, the naughty companies that kind of marginalized Christmas: Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Foot Locker, The Gap, The Limited, Nordstrom, Office Depot, Office Max, Petsmart, Staples and Victoria's Secret.

According to the AFA, those companies are not in the Christmas spirit. And that’s bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.

“We're going to start saying Merry Christmas again!” he told a rally earlier this week. “How about all those department stores they have the bells and they have the red walls and they have the snow but they don't have Merry Christmas? I think they're going to start putting up Merry Christmas.”

Or they will be deported. But seriously, does the Christmas deal really matter? Since the War on Christmas has basically been won, this is a cleanup operation. But the information is valid. Many Americans celebrate Christmas because they believe that Jesus is the savior and his birth should be honored. And because it's a federal holiday, there is no reason to diminish Christmas or insult those who believe in it. Don't like Christmas? Ignore it.

Companies and stores that embrace Christmas obviously will attract folks who feel the same way. The O’Reilly Factor is just happy that most Americans see Christmas as a positive experience. And we're happy we could contribute to that.

Merry Christmas!

"China is preparing for war, not saving the planet","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

At the G-20 meeting in Indonesia on Monday, President Joe Biden met with the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping. But while Biden focused on climate change, the Chinese have been cloaking their preparations for war as a green energy push.

Rather than follow up on his mostly tough rhetoric on China over the past two years, Biden didn’t press Xi on the Chinese fentanyl that killed more than 71,000 Americans in 2021. Biden also didn’t mention China’s responsibility for unleashing the COVID-19 epidemic. Instead, Biden used his first meeting with Xi since becoming president to tout the restart of climate talks with China.

This is exactly what China wants.

Biden, who has consistently been wrong on major foreign policy matters since becoming senator from Delaware in 1973, said ""I absolutely believe there’s need not be a new Cold War... And I do not think there’s any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.""

Watch out.

‘AMERICAN FEEBLENESS’ WILL BE ON DISPLAY IF BIDEN DOESN'T ENFORCE RED LINES WITH CHINA: GORDON CHANG

How is China deceiving America? In military operations, a deception plan works best when an opponent shows the enemy something that enemy wants to believe is true. In China’s case, they know that American elites fear climate change, claiming it is an existential threat. As a result, China touts its massive effort to build wind turbines, deploy solar panels, and rapidly expand electric vehicle (EV) production, with almost half of the world’s EVs operating in China.

China even impressed Biden’s climate czar John Kerry, who said on Aug. 30 that China has ""generally speaking, outperformed its (climate) commitments"" and that America and China can help the world by ""working together.""

But what if China’s ""green"" energy push has nothing to do with the environment? Rather than look at China’s soothing words we should look at its deeds. What China’s actions tell us is that it is pursuing a path of energy independence largely founded on their massive coal reserves.

This matters because American strategists believe that potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan, Japan, India, or other nations in the Pacific would be held in check by China’s reliance on imported oil. China imports 72 percent of its oil, of which 85 percent transits the Strait of Malacca by Singapore. The U.S. Navy could easily choke off this flow. Thus, many reasons China wouldn’t risk conflict.

To counter this, China has been working with Russia to increase the latter’s pipeline capacity, increasing imports of both oil and natural gas from Russia. But this isn’t enough. Even with about 2 million barrels coming in from Russia via pipeline, China’s strategic reserves would be dry in about five months.

But China has been rapidly laying the groundwork to wean itself off imported oil and natural gas.

In 1996, China surpassed the U.S. in the use of coal to generate electricity. Since then, American coal-fired electric power has been more than cut in half while China now generates more than 5.3 times the amount of coal power as does the U.S. And China isn’t stopping—it’s now building or has plans to build the equivalent of the entire American coal powerplant fleet, even as we decommission our plants.

This means that all those clean green Chinese EVs are really coal-powered—thus, they don’t need imported oil to power them.

Now, here’s where things get frightening—and bad for the planet, too. China is rapidly increasing its coal-to-liquids capacity. Turning coal into high quality fuel and lubricants isn’t a new technology—the Germans used it in WW2 to make up for their lack of oil. Back then, it cost the Germans about $20 a barrel to convert coal into gasoline while American crude went for 98 cents a barrel. But now it costs about half as much to make gasoline from coal than to refine it from oil—the main problem being that it generates about double the amount of carbon dioxide emissions as simply burning oil does—assuming China even cares about that, which it doesn’t.

Simply put, China’s coal-to-liquids effort allows China to weather a U.S. Navy blockade of the Strait of Malacca, giving the Chinese Communist Party enormous latitude to pursue military aggression against its neighbors while keeping its economy running.

The end is near for Putin's war against Ukraine,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The end is near. For Putin’s military options in Ukraine, that is.

Wednesday in Moscow, Putin said he will call up reservists and hold political referenda in captured Ukrainian territory. And yet again, he threatened to use nuclear weapons if Russian territory is in danger.

Despite the scary language, Putin is not fooling anybody in NATO. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg lost no time pointing out that Russia doesn’t have enough weapons to equip more troops. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby immediately said the speech showed Putin was struggling. And at the UN, President Biden denounced Putin’s war.

Putin’s biggest problem is that Russia is losing and Ukraine has seized the initiative. Ukraine has two counter-offensives underway, in the north and the south. Ukraine scored a major victory by pushing Russian forces out of the town of Izyum two weeks ago, thus keeping control of a major highway and turning back territorial gains in the east. Russian forces broke and fled. The defeat around Izyum also showed that the battlefield performance of Russia’s forces is getting worse, not better. Ukraine is learning and improving while Russia is on the run.

ZELENSKYY LAYS OUT ‘PEACE FORMULA’ TO END WAR, BUT SAYS ‘RUSSIA WANTS WAR’

Wednesday’s announcement sounded to me like Putin had to do something to rally his own beleaguered military forces and attempt to convince the Russians he still has a plan. But here’s why his words rang hollow.

Putin announced a partial call-up of 300,000 Russian reserves. But the mobilization won’t happen overnight, or even over the next few weeks. Simply transporting new troops to the front lines will be difficult for Russia as Ukraine uses long-range weapons to target roads and supply depots. Russia’s military is losing this war despite their superior numbers; so calling for more troops tells you they don’t have a clue how to cope with Ukraine’s tactics and new weapons.

I think Putin may be trying to figure out how to sell his defeat. He’ll hold rigged referenda where occupied territories ""vote"" to join Russia. That’s part of his old plan, but it won’t help if Russia keeps losing ground to Ukraine’s forces.

The biggest sign of desperation was the renewed nuclear threat. All along, Putin’s nuclear threats have been intended to scare NATO, the U.S. and allies into halting military assistance to Ukraine. He’d like nothing better than to have Washington and London and Berlin and Warsaw cower and cool it on the aid.

But the simple fact is that Russia’s threats are not working. As of now, the U.S. military reports that Russian nuclear forces have not changed their posture, according to Kirby. That is a very significant point. It means that Russia is not unwrapping the nuclear weapons and activating units and people to employ them. Of course, the U.S. military has been watching Russia’s nuclear units closely since well before Feb. 24 and the Pentagon says the Russian posture had not changed over the last seven months. So, Putin says he’s ""not bluffing"" but for now his nuclear threats are all just words.

It's true that Russia has some rather nasty nukes. However, Putin well knows that use of a Russian nuclear weapon in Ukraine will blow back radiation on Russian forces and into Russia itself, due to prevailing winds. As Biden said, there will also be ""severe consequences"" should Russia use a nuclear weapon. If such a heinous event takes place, there is a full array of legitimate military retaliation options for allies to consider. Just imagine what a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber could do to military targets in Crimea with non-nuclear weapons. For that matter, nuclear powers Britain and France have options, too.

Detonating a Russian nuclear weapon will not win the war in Ukraine for Putin. Don’t forget China is already nervous about Russia’s military failures; use of a nuclear weapon by Putin could break up China’s vital energy purchases and isolate Russia even more.

The bottom line is that Ukraine’s success is closing off Putin’s options. More troops won’t fix Russia’s almost-insurmountable tactical problems such as poor command and control, an inability to maneuver, no air superiority, and high losses of helicopters and unmanned drones, to name a few.

Mexican cartels' war on Americans: Fentanyl crisis should be atop Biden's agenda at summit,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Enough to kill every American. That’s the amount of lethal doses of fentanyl – a total of 379 million – seized by the DEA in 2022.

The number is as disturbing as it is unsurprising: over the last decade, fentanyl related deaths in Americans have increased 4,860%, reaching its highest levels ever – over 80,000 – in 2021.

This is no mere drug epidemic. This is a national security crisis – a silent war being waged on America’s most vulnerable populations, using poison as the weapon of choice.

Cartels, in collaboration with China, are purposefully targeting vulnerable Americans, lacing additional drugs with fentanyl to increase rates of addiction and hiding fentanyl in counterfeit pain, anxiety and ADHD medications.

‘THREE AMIGOS’ SUMMIT WE NEED: BIDEN, OTHER LEADERS MUST GET SERIOUS ON ENERGY, CHINA, CARTELS

This intentional effort to spread addiction and death is increasingly affecting American teenagers, whose overdose rates have doubled since 2019 thanks to these practices.

Part of the reason for this explosive growth is the growth of the cartels themselves. These criminal gangs now have at least partial control over 70% of Mexican territory, resulting in some of the highest homicide rates in Mexican history.

Unfortunately, Mexico’s current security approach of ""hugs, not bullets"" is unsurprisingly ineffective in curtailing this trend. Crime is committed with impunity, with only 1.3% of cases solved in Mexico, and attacks on journalists are on par with the war-torn nations of Syria and Afghanistan.

BIDEN'S NEW BORDER SECURITY PLAN WON'T WORK. HERE'S WHAT WILL

At the same time, Mexico is undergoing a similar type of democratic backsliding as Venezuela under Hugo Chavez. Just as in Venezuela, Mexico is increasingly expanding the scope of activities for the Mexican Army, deploying them to oversee social programs, militarizing police forces, and in effect turning the army into the president’s political base. This combination of violence, corruption and human rights violations are a petri dish for the rise of cartel drug smuggling and power.

Monday, President Biden is in Mexico to participate in the annual North American Leaders Summit, where he will be meeting with the Mexican and Canadian presidents. Despite the tens of thousands of deaths caused by our open border, Biden has inexplicably described his priorities during the summit as ""climate and the environment, migration, diversity and inclusion.""

Security cooperation should be our only priority.

If we have any hope of reducing the amount of fentanyl that takes American lives, President Biden must make addressing the drug crisis a national priority. We cannot turn a blind eye to our fellow Americans who have fallen victim to substance abuse. They, like all Americans, have an inherent right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and our national project mandates we strive to ensure those rights.

I'VE BEEN TO THE BORDER AND HERE IS MY MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN

The summit is an important opportunity to do just that. It is only with strong, reliable cooperation from Mexican security forces that we can effectively curtail drug flows. Unfortunately, this cooperation has declined in recent years thanks to Mexico’s 2020 Foreign Agent’s Law. We must reverse this trend, and make it abundantly clear that stopping cartels is a direct national security priority of both the United States and Mexico.

This is especially true now that Mexico is itself beginning to experience an uptick in fentanyl-related addiction and death, and as cartel violence threatens democratic processes and results in the murders high-ranking officials. In recent days, President Lopez Obrador arrested Ovidio Guzman, son of drug kingpin ""El Chapo,"" and put the cartel-ridden state of Sinaloa in lockdown. President Biden should insist such steps be the start of a new security approach for Mexico, not merely a one-off signal in advance of the coming summit.

Biden should also hold Mexican government officials at the state level accountable for their complicity in the drug trade, including by expanding the use of the Kingpin Act to target those officials who enable or turn a blind eye to cartel activity. The Guacamaya hack, which includes information held by the military on ties of local mayors in Mexico to the cartels, should be mined for information and combined with existing U.S. intelligence for Kingpin designations and the ""prudential revocation"" of non-immigrant visas.

Of course, Biden needs to commit to securing the border from our side, investing more heavily in customs inspections at our ports of entry where the vast majority of drugs enter the United States and end what has effectively been our open border policy. In 2022, cartels made an astronomical $13 billion from smuggling immigrants – an increase of $12.5 billion from just four years prior. This money serves to further fuel violence and addiction on both sides of the border.

Mexican cartels are engaged in an intentional campaign against American citizens – a campaign that has, in a single year, murdered more Americans than were killed in 9/11, Pearl Harbor, and American casualties in every war over the last 30 years combined. The United States must deploy all resources at its disposal to stop this.

Putin's war against Ukraine will ruin Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, a young St. Petersburg student, Rodion Raskolnikov embarks on a murder spree to validate his pride. His motivation is simple—he seeks to be exceptional in the same way that Napoleon was exceptional. But, after confessing to his crimes and being dispatched to Siberia, Rodion experiences a spiritual metamorphosis and repents for his sins.

Somewhere in the bowels of the Kremlin, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, KGB killer and former Mayor of Dostoyevsky’s own St. Petersburg, is pondering the impacts of his 300-day special military operation. But there is no chance for a Rodion-like redemption here.

Putin believes he is the reincarnation of Russia’s Imperial and Soviet past. There is no crime, no matter how horrible, that warrants reflection much less redemption when that crime is committed for the advancement of the Russian state. Rodion saw himself as Bonaparte; Putin believes he is the reincarnation of Peter the Great, Alexander I, and Stalin. Peter the Great built cities and opened his country to European thought and mores. Tsar Alexander marched into Paris after vanquishing Napoleon. Stalin subjugated Eastern Europe and terrorized the planet. Putin’s ethno-messianism however may be putting Russia on the road to oblivion.

Review the bidding. Putin has blown up apartment buildings in Moscow, shot down planes, waged numerous wars on his neighbors, engineered the assassinations of rivals across the globe including dozens of oligarchs last year who kept falling out of hotel and hospital windows. Like Stalin he has turned the Russian Orthodox leadership into flaks for the state so much so that Pope Francis admonished the Patriarch of Moscow for being Putin’s ""altar boy."" The Russian economy is wrecked and unlikely to recover for decades.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: MORE BLOODSHED TO COME WITH NO END IN SIGHT

He has waged a war of human extermination on Ukraine and in so doing lost twice as many troops in a year than did America in a decade in Vietnam. Six million refugees have flooded the borders of Eastern Europe and perhaps three million Ukrainians—primarily women and children—have been dispatched to Russia for reeducation. The Ukrainian War has left behind trails of crimes not seen on this scale in Europe since 1945.

Putin has been outfought and outgeneraled by a smaller nation led by a man whose profession was once the comic stage. Moscow’s depots of tanks and artillery are gone, and Putin’s planes dare not fly over Ukraine’s battlefields. His penal colonies have been emptied and the ""freed"" criminals told to charge into battle or be shot by the security services. Putin has let loose two mercenary armies—the Wagner Group and Chechen killers—who operate free from the orders of the Russian General Staff and international Geneva norms. His regular soldiers are deserting. They have no winter gear. The Russian people know this, and Putin’s ""Holy Russia"" propaganda is no longer believed. One visual that captures this is Russians seeking to leave Russia during the mobilization

The Russian high command is exposed as gangsters, racketeers, and yes-men. This is a cabal that with each defeat resembles more and more the cast of psychopaths and dead-enders who stuck it out with Adolf Hitler in the Berlin Bunker. Like Hitler, Putin now seeks refuge with the world’s pariahs—in this case Iran and North Korea. Shockingly for him, China has not come to his rescue, and he has received the back of the hand from the leaders of India and Turkey.

Once dismissing Europe as a spent force, Putin’s brutality has rearranged the continent’s map. Russia’s northern forces are now staring directly across at the modern and highly capable armies of Finland and Sweden, whose countries have emerged from a neutral slumber to challenge their ancient enemies. He will have a hard time defending decisions to Russian posterity that led to the revitalization of NATO with Poland now assuming a leadership role once coveted by Germany and reinforced the primacy of the Anglo-American alliance (no matter how indifferent the Biden Administration is to the historic ties between Washington and London as the most reliable lasting bulwark against global tyranny).

Karl Marx’s collaborator Friedrich Engels famously called the Russian Empire a ""prison of peoples."" Ronald Reagan pointed to the Soviet Union as ""the focus of evil in the modern world."" If the West stays the course and that is not a given with the Biden administration and an appeasement chorus in Berlin and Paris, Putin’s legacy will be an impoverished third world Russia. It is ironic the imperialist dreams of the small-time policeman might lead to the final death knell of the Russian/Soviet Empire. Dostoyevsky would have known the type.

Are Putin and Zelenskyy near to ending Russia-Ukraine war?,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Common sense dictates the Russia-Ukraine conflict must end, and serious effort should be invested in achieving the peace settlement.

Consider the costs in lives and treasure. Despite the unimaginable toll in lives and the vast spending and commitment of arms by the U.S. over the past 10 months, victory for either side is not on the horizon.

One hundred thousand Ukrainian troops have been killed or injured since Russia's invasion in February, according to the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen. The Pentagon assessed the number of dead or injured Russian troops at 100,000 and dead Ukrainian civilians at 40,000.

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley admitted to reporters in November that the ""probability of Ukrainian military victory happening anytime soon is not high."" The U.S. weapons arsenal is severely depleted. There’s a $19 billion backlog of weapons that will not reach Taiwan on schedule, according to The Wall Street Journal, jeopardizing Taiwan’s ability to defend itself from an invasion by China.

WHAT IS PUTIN THINKING? WHERE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR STANDS NINE MONTHS AFTER INVASION

The Pentagon has used up, in 10 months of the war, 13 years worth of Stinger production and five years worth of Javelin production, according to Raytheon’s CEO. U.S. defense industry production capacity to restock those inventories is extremely limited. U.S. security aid in November reached $68 billion, and the Biden administration has asked Congress for another $37.7 billion.

But the probability of a peace settlement remains extremely low. Moscow, Kyiv and Washington — the key stakeholders in the current war — maintain irreconcilable positions while pursuing unachievable goals.

Russia’s position. Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite tactical setbacks on the battlefield, insists on the West’s recognition of Crimea, which Russia invaded in 2014, and four other recently annexed territories in Eastern Ukraine, as Russian. This is a non-starter for the U.S. or Europe, as such a concession would amount to handing victory to Putin.

On Tuesday, Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov ruled out peace negotiations, insisting that Russia ""will achieve the goals it has set."" Putin almost certainly is preparing for a protracted war of attrition, having noted on Wednesday that ""to start seeing the results of the special operation will be a long process.""

FIVE REASONS WHY BIDEN MUST MOVE TO DE-ESCALATE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR NOW

In November, Russia completed a partial mobilization, the first since World War II, having added 318,000 military personnel and increased its 2023 military budget by $13.6 billion to $84 billion.

Moscow also continues covert mobilization, upgrading recruitment centers, drafting new call-up lists and releasing convicts from prisons and sending them to the front. Putin is betting that by subjecting Ukrainians to unimaginable suffering, depriving them of heat, electricity and drinking water as Russian forces are pounding Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, he can compel Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept Russia’s demands.

Ukraine’s position. Zelenskyy also continues to pursue unrealistic war aims. In early November, he set conditions for ""genuine peace talks"" with Russia. Kyiv seeks to restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity by driving the Russians out of the entire country, including Crimea, get compensated for the destruction of the nation by Russia and have key Russian officials and some soldiers tried by the International Criminal Court. Until recently, Zelenskyy insisted he would only negotiate with a new Russian president, clearly not a serious condition.

So far, the charismatic former actor has been very successful at convincing American and European governments to part with large amounts of cash from their countries' treasuries to help defend his country from the Russians. U.S. aid to Kyiv has exceeded 50% of Ukraine’s 2021 GDP of $200.1 billion. A recently released poll, however, reveals that support among Americans for indefinite aid to Ukraine has dropped, and nearly half of Americans (47%) believe that Washington must urge Kyiv to settle for peace.

It is unlikely that Zelenskyy’s recent appeal for another $55 billion to cover budget shortfalls and reconstruction will find many supporters. Even Elon Musk, whose donation to Ukraine through his company SpaceX to provide Starlink satellite communications is projected to reach $100 million by the end of the year, indicated that there are limits to his generosity. Without Starlink internet terminals, on which the Ukrainian military is reliant for command and control, Kyiv’s ability to continue the fight will be severely degraded.

The Biden Administration position. While Washington has scaled down its goals for this proxy war with Russia, it still operates in the wishful thinking paradigm. Calls for Putin’s removal by Biden and others betrayed how removed from reality Washington politicians are. Contemplating a regime change in a country that possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and whose president enjoys a 75% approval rating is wishful thinking. So was the objective articulated by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in April to ""weaken"" the Russian military ""to the degree it cannot do the kind of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.""

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken articulated a much more modest agenda on Tuesday: drive Russians back to pre-invasion lines, letting Putin keep the strategic peninsula of Crimea and parts of Donbas. Expelling the Russians from captured and annexed territories would require massive additional outlays in military hardware and involves the risk of Russia’s use of weapons of mass destruction.

On Wednesday, Putin issued yet another veiled nuclear threat as he and his security council are mulling a response to Ukraine's strike on Russian nuclear missile carriers stationed in a strategic aviation airbase in Russia proper. Paragraph 19 of the Russian nuclear doctrine allows the Kremlin to press the ""red button"" to launch a retaliatory strike when its strategic weapons facilities are attacked.

The Biden administration understands there’s a credible threat of Putin authorizing a nuclear strike with a low-yield tactical warhead in Ukraine. This is why the Pentagon secretly modified the long-range HIMARS rocket launchers before shipping them to Kyiv to prevent Ukrainians from firing missiles deep into Russian territory.

It’s also why, on Tuesday, Blinken insisted that the U.S. did not encourage or help Ukrainians carry out strikes inside Russia. The Biden administration likely is coming to a realization that at some point you run out of taxpayer money and your own defensive arsenal if you continue fueling a war that is unwinnable — even though it may be a just war.

The Russians have a very high tolerance for casualties, having sacrificed more than 20 million during World War II. Unless Washington steps in and compels Zelenskyy to negotiate an end to this bitter, devastating stalemate, Putin will fight till the last Ukrainian standing.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/putin-zelenskyy-near-ending-russia-ukraine-war,N/A
Putin's pivot in Ukraine will bring about permanent war in Europe,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Last week, Russia announced that it will make ""major changes"" to strengthen its armed forces’ during the 2023-2026 time period, a sign that Moscow is recasting its approach in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s new strategy is focused on fighting a large-scale war rather than a ""special military operation."" Here’s why this change will likely result in a permanent conflict in the European theater.

The roots of the war

Russia and US-led NATO -- a proxy party to the war -- view each other as their respective top security threats. Biden’s current National Security Strategy describes Russia as an ""immediate threat."" Russia’s post-Soviet military doctrine has codified NATO as the ""primary danger.""

Ukraine is the buffer state that each side seeks to rely on in the event of a direct NATO vs. Russia war. Trading territory for enemy’s blood to protect the heartland is the essence of this approach. It is why the question of control over Ukraine has been festering since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, and it is where the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries.

Having won the Cold War, the U.S. has been incorporating Ukraine into the Western orbit, allowing the U.S. and Europe to reduce their military posture in Europe. Ukrainians are valiantly fighting the Russians, having sacrificed thousands of military personnel and 20,000 to 40,000 civilians to death or injury to hold the line, while the majority of NATO countries, 22 of 30, fail to contribute the required two percent of GDP towards common defense. Washington views the arming of Ukraine as a sound investment to bleed the Russian military.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR AN OUTLOOK FOR 2023: MORE BLOODSHED TO COME WITH NO END IN SIGHT

Russia, which has been invaded three times in the last 200 years and has seen its buffer zone with NATO reduced to as little as 100 miles, after the Baltic states joined NATO in 2004, has drawn a red line over Ukraine.

Moscow views NATO expansion into Ukraine in the same way as if a Russia-lead Collective Security Treaty Organization moved into Mexico. In other words, the outcome of this war is existential for Putin, who is determined to keep Ukraine away from NATO, even if he has to destroy it.

All Out War Strategy

Putin believes his ultimate fear of having to fight a conventional war with NATO is becoming reality. The arrival of 100 Ukrainian troops in Oklahoma to train on the Patriot missile defense system and the Pentagon’s commitment to provide 50 Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Kyiv is taking the conflict to a new level.

Putin is moving to an all-out war strategy, developed on his orders after the Russian military strategists forecast a direct confrontation with NATO a decade ago.

In anticipation of retaliation by Ukraine and possibly NATO to his massive escalation in the theater, Putin is fortifying Moscow, to protect himself, his family, and the Russian elites.

Pantsir anti-aircraft systems were reportedly installed on several rooftops in central Moscow, including near the Kremlin, on top of the ministry of defense building, and near Putin’s Valdai residence in Russia’s Novgorod region. The system is placed on combat alert.

On December 22nd, Putin, for the very first time, referred to the conflict in Ukraine, as war, rather than a ""special military operation."" Fighting a large-scale war, based on the Russian military doctrine, is a different animal than a ""special operation."" It involves a lot more personnel, new generation weapons, and cyber and space warfare capabilities. Russia believes what it views as America’s low tolerance for casualties and reliance on technology as vulnerabilities.

PUTIN'S FASHION FAUX PAS: RUSSIAN MILITARY UNIFORMS UNSUITABLE FOR COMBAT IN BRUTAL WINTER FIGHT

On December 21, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced a plan to beef up Russia’s military from 1 to 1.5 million. Towards this goal, Russia is adding half-a-million conscripts, according to Ukraine’s defense intelligence, to the previously mobilized 315,000 additional soldiers.

Last week, Shoigu emphasized Russia’s goal to augment, naval, aerospace, and nuclear forces, in order ""to guarantee the military security of the state."" Earlier, Putin also assigned the chief of the military general staff, Valeriy Gerasimov, to lead combat operations in Ukraine, a notable move as Gerasimov is the author of a special anti-U.S. doctrine.

Endless War in the European Theater

Putin, consistent with Russian warfare traditions, is preparing for a long-term war of attrition. Russia’s way of winning wars is relentless attrition of manpower. It is how Russia has fought every war for centuries – throwing millions into the meat-grinder to prevail.

The Russians sacrificed 25 million lives in World War II and their current losses are approximately 100,000. Given Russia’s population of 143 million, there’s a lot more bleeding that lies ahead before Washington could reach its goals of Ukrainian victory and weakening Russia.

The upcoming admission of Sweden and Finland into NATO will create a permanent flashpoint in the region. Contrary to Washington’s belief, this move is more likely to further destabilize Europe than bring peace.

Russia shares an 832-mile border with Finland. These two countries’ acceptance into the alliance will automatically double the border between NATO and Russia, from around 750 miles to about 1,600, exacerbating Russia’s security worries.

Russia shares a turbulent past with both Sweden and Finland dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, having fought multiple wars with them. In fact, Russia defeated Sweden and ended the Great Northern War in July 1709 at the battle of Poltava, which today is located in the eastern part of Ukraine.

Long-range disruptions

The lives of millions of people have already been upended by the war, with more upheavals on the way. The disruptions caused by migration, human tragedy, food insecurity, and energy shortages will go far beyond the immediate crisis, straining the U.S. and European economies, militaries and societies.

The International Monetary Fund warned in a recent study that ""geo-economic fragmentation"" could decrease global gross domestic product by up to 7% over an unspecified ""long-term"" period, reversing the economic integration and globalization trends of recent decades.

The IMF forecasted greater impact, 8-12%, on low-income and emerging economies, attributing it to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries are heavily dependent on Russia and Ukraine for food imports and on Russia, for energy. The World Bank recently issued a similar report, highlighting the food crisis as the ""most alarming concern.""

Russia-Ukraine War an outlook for 2023: more bloodshed to come with no end in sight,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As we have welcome the New Year, many on both sides of the Atlantic are wondering whether the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the biggest war in Europe since World War II, will come to an end this year. The largest country on the continent, Ukraine, is being depopulated, having lost more than 100,000 of its citizens to death or injury. Europe itself is being destabilized by financial woes and influx of refugees from war-torn areas.

Contrary to the hopes of many, not only will 2023 not bring peace, it will likely see the most bloodshed yet, as the key warring parties – Moscow, Kyiv, and Washington, D.C. – are all postured for decisive escalation. Here’s why we are probably entering the ""hottest"" phase of this war.

Putin signals escalation to ""defend Motherland""

In his New Year address, Vladimir Putin signaled resolve to take the fight to the finish, portraying the conflict as existential for the future of Russia.

Dressed in a dark suit and tie and surrounded by what was meant to be perceived as his troops, Putin delivered a stern nine-minute message, likely intended to galvanize support among Russians, put fear into his detractors, and show to the West that he has placed the entire Russian nation on a wartime footing.

The Russian president reminded his citizens that ""defending our Motherland"" is the ""sacred duty we owe to our ancestors and descendants."" He contrasted those who display ""courage and heroism"" and ""with those who show ""betrayal and cowardice."" Putin blamed the West for using Ukraine to ""weaken and fracture"" Russia and noted that in ""every challenging period in Russian history"" the Russians united behind their ""comrades-in-arms.""

ZELENSKYY’S PLEA FOR MORE AMERICAN AID TO 'SPEED UP VICTORY' IN UNWINNABLE WAR

Meanwhile, the Russian military unleashed yet another massive bombardment of Ukraine, using missile and drone attacks that came in waves over several days and targeting vital infrastructure.

Last Wednesday, Putin deployed a frigate , Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov, armed with hypersonic Zircon cruise missiles to the Atlantic Ocean, having remarked during a video teleconference with his Defense Minister that Zircon ""has no analogues in any country in the world.""

In another attempt to signal Moscow’s readiness for escalation, Putin said, ""I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats.""

The Kremlin’s biggest fear is the deployment of U.S. and NATO troops into the theater in Ukraine. Moscow military planners have previously concluded that war between Russia and the United States is inevitable , given that the two Cold War adversaries have been in a confrontation for geopolitical control over post-Soviet states since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So, escalation is not an unthinkable option for Putin.

Zelenskyy emboldened to out-escalate Russia

In a New Year’s message of his own, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promised victory to his countrymen. In a 17-minute, emotional video, like his Russian counterpart, Zelenskyy stressed unity and pride and ruled out any other option but to win.

One week ago, Ukrainian forces launched a deadly counterattack of their own, hitting a facility in Russia-occupied city of Makiivka in Donbas, killing scores of newly mobilized Russian troops and injuring many more.

Last Wednesday, Ukraine’s military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov, in an interview to ABC News, vowed more strikes ""deeper and deeper"" into Russia, including into Crimea, which Moscow annexed and has fully controlled since 2014. Kyiv’s spy chief warned about the ""hottest"" fighting coming in March and promised a Ukrainian victory in 2023.

Kyiv’s confidence can be attributed to Zelenskyy’s recent stellar performance before Congress, during his surprise visit to Washington four days before Christmas and the subsequent congressional approval of an additional $45 billion in military aid to Ukraine , showing Zelenskyy is still in Washington's ear.

FIVE REASONS WHY BIDEN MUST MOVE TO DE-ESCALATE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR NOW

Washington grows and invests in Russia’s defeat

Having poured $100 billion in security assistance into Ukraine, Washington has been steadily expanding the scale and scope of matériel it’s providing. What started off as blankets and non-lethal aid has grown into a steady stream of top-of-the-line military hardware. A partial list includes 8,500-plus Javelin anti-armor systems, 32,000-plus other anti-armor systems; 1,400-plus Stinger anti-aircraft systems; hundreds of armored Humvee vehicles and 440 mine resistant vehicles; and 200 M113 armored personnel carriers. Among the most sophisticated pieces provided are 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.

What seemed impossible just a few weeks ago is now on the way – a Patriot missile system and precision-guided bomb technology. There are even talks within the European combatant command whether to fulfill Ukraine’s request for F-16s, the world’s most advanced 4th generation multi-role fighter aircraft. Such discussions were viewed by some officials as a step too far, out of concern of escalation.

Members of the Washington officialdom now openly acknowledge that arming Ukraine is a low-cost way of bleeding Russia of manpower and matériel, arguing that it would prevent a larger European conflict. This justification contradicts the results of several years worth of wargaming conducted by the U.S. government to simulate a direct Russia-NATO kinetic conflict. These table-top military exercises revealed that continued escalation of hostilities in a contested post-Soviet territory eventually drags the U.S. into a broader war, spiraling out of control.

Ukrainians are not shy about asking for more and more. Budanov is expecting U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles, which ""will significantly improve the combat ability of our units."" No wonder he is confident that the ""hottest"" yet fight is coming. ""I promise it will not take too long now … We will change this world together,"" Budanov told ABC. On New Year's Day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged the allies to stockpile weapons for Ukraine.

Realizing that the conflict is firmly on an escalatory path, Moscow is laying the justification for whatever dramatic action it may decide to take by portraying the West as coming for Putin’s head. In a bizarre statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the U.S. on December 28th against carrying out a ""decapitation blow"" targeting the Russian strongman. He called it a ""threat to physically eliminate the head of the Russian state.""

Russia-Ukraine War at One Year: Congress should not offer another dime until these 4 questions are answered,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Much good would come from the defeat of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. It would prevent future Russian aggression in Europe and deter Chinese expansionism by demonstrating western resolve and lethality. It is essential, however, that in providing Ukraine with the support it needs, Washington does it in a way that provides full accountability to the American people and neither adds major unfunded liabilities for the U.S. taxpayer nor consumes resources required to counter the People’s Republic of China.

Retaining the ability to confront Russia and China simultaneously will require some of our European allies to do more toward supporting the effort in Ukraine. This will enable the U.S. to shoulder the bulk of the load deterring China in the Pacific.

Absent a plausible plan to help Ukraine win the war in a fiscally responsible manner, conservatives should not support additional Biden administration requests for funding Ukraine.

'FROZEN CONFLICT': A LOOK BACK AT 2022'S KEY MOMENTS IN UKRAINE'S FIGHT WITH RUSSIA

To date, U.S. aid has been vast in scale, blanket in nature, and lacking an overarching strategy. As we contemplate the one-year anniversary of Putin’s brutal invasion, it is past time to ask the administration hard questions about the U.S. strategy regarding the conflict, its goals and objectives. As yet unanswered questions include:

*How has the administration adjusted to the intelligence failure that, on the eve of the invasion, assessed the invasion would produce a quick Russian victory?

*How much additional funding does the administration estimate will be required to enable Ukraine to win the war?

*What does the administration see as the end game for Ukraine?

*How does the administration reconcile its actions and policies that appear to be in direct conflict with winning the war in Ukraine, notably the release of ""Merchant of Death"" Viktor Bout and components in the Inflation Reduction Act that depress domestic U.S. energy production?

TOP 5 REASONS AMERICA MUST SUPPORT UKRAINE AND HELP IT DEFEAT RUSSIA

While Congress pursues clarity on these points, lawmakers should also be pondering what they can do responsibly to foster a victory in Ukraine that will deter China and prevent future Putin aggression.

Here are some ideas:

1. Help Ukraine win.

For the United States victory would be a Putin regime that is unable to mount a subsequent attack on a NATO country that could obligate our direct involvement in a European war.

2. Unleash American energy dominance.

President Biden should lay out a strategy to insulate the American people (and our allies) from the fallout of Putin’s energy war. This will require maximizing our production of and access to reliable fuels (oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear) and constructing pipelines and export terminals to move fuels where they are needed for domestic consumption and export.

3. Prevent the use of nuclear weapons.

President Biden has justified restricting certain military aid to Ukraine in the hopes of preventing Putin from using a nuclear weapon, but this only allows Putin to hold our aid hostage with nuclear threats as he has been doing since the beginning of the war. The PRC will not be a constructive partner of any sort on Ukraine, but Beijing could help dissuade Putin from using a nuclear weapon if they believe it would harm their own interests.

4. Ukraine’s leadership must work with conservatives in Congress.

President Biden has politicized the Ukraine issue in Congress. Ukrainian leadership could help restore bipartisan support for assistance to the war effort by more actively engaging with congressional conservatives and addressing their concerns about corruption and a drift into endless war.

5. Opening Ukraine’s reconstruction to the PRC is a hard stop for the U.S.

Congress should set the terms for reconstruction if Ukraine expects American taxpayer investment or U.S. government support for American entities that participate in the reconstruction process. All Americans need to hear directly and unequivocally from President Zelenskyy that their money will not be spent on contracts with PRC entities or to free up other resources for this purpose.

Many Americans remain unconvinced that continued engagement in Ukraine is in our vital national interest. The burden is on the Biden administration to make this case. Currently, less than half of the country approve of the way he is handling the situation.

If President Biden refuses to work closely with conservatives on Capitol Hill on Ukraine strategy, he risks undermining a year of concerted U.S. engagement, allowing Putin to regroup for potential future aggression and failing to deter China—all of which would be a sad waste of the $100 billion already committed to Ukraine.

Don't believe propaganda: Russia is waging a full-scale war against Ukraine,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitriy Peskov categorically denied reports Wednesday that Putin was mobilizing the entire Russian nation for to move to a full-scale war on Ukraine on May 9th, the 77th anniversary of Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.

But as usual, Putin’s chief propagandist is seeking to deceive everyone about what the Kremlin is up to, so that its enemies do not preempt its plans. Because Russia is already mobilized for full-scale war.

RUSSIA RAMPS UP AGGRESSION IN KHERSON WITH HUMANITARIAN BLOCKADE AND CAPTURE OF UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS

Caught in a check-mate, by Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, whose forces have displayed unprecedented resistance against a much more powerful adversary, Putin is desperate to turn around battlefield dynamics. The Russian strongman has realized that he is up against a much more formidable opponent than he anticipated, as Washington provides to Kyiv formidable defensive weapons, superior training, and real-time targeting intelligence, which has helped Ukrainians kill a dozen of Russian generals.

As we all wade further in this, President Biden must understand that Vladimir Putin has switched to a ""total war, against the West,"" phase and that mentality is fraught with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Strategic deception is a classic Russian statecraft tactic, which Putin practices routinely against US leaders. The target of the KGB operative’s most recent ruse was President Joe Biden, whom Putin tricked into believing that Russia wasn’t going to invade Ukraine. Putin gradually assembled 190,000 troops, which almost encircled Ukraine, while Moscow ""diplomats"" were ""negotiating"" with Washington’s gullible amateurs over so-called ""security guarantees.""

A committed realpolitiker and student of history, Putin, who rules a country that has been at war for two thirds of its existence, decided a decade ago that preparing for war was a prudent step. Believing that America and Russia are on a geopolitical collision course, given that both are vying for influence over post-Soviet states like Ukraine, Putin in his mind, turned the famous phrase by Carl von Clausewitz on its head, deciding that that politics is but a continuation of war, instead of the reverse.

Putin in fact initiated the process of moving Russia in the direction of a wartime footing as early as 2013, hatching a plan to take over Ukraine’s Crimea, which he did in March 2014. For him, Ukraine is a red line, a buffer with the West needed to keep NATO from encroaching. Memories of the German invasion in World War II are always at the forefront of the Russian mind.

In spring 2014, Putin’s ""new mobilization plan of the state economy"" went into effect, directing the ""defense industry, including approximately 800 companies, to gear up for a sudden increase in capacity, instead of conserving its capacity."" This was probably the result of Putin declaring a so called ""special period,"" a legal regime that enables the Russian government to take emergency measures aimed at the intensive preparation of the country, the armed forces, and the state security forces for war. Realizing that economic sanctions were Washington’s key instrument of war, Putin began sanction-proofing Russia’s economy by de-dollarizing Russia’s sovereign wealth fund in favor or the Chinese Yuan, the Euro, and gold. Putin also directed the implementation of an import substitution program to reduce Russia’s reliance on foreign products. This is why, at least in part, Western sanctions, as draconian as they have been, have not changed Putin’s calculus on waging war on Ukraine.

Moving Russia to a wartime footing entails a state-wide coordination effort across the military, economy, state administration, and, indeed, across the entire Russian society, to ensure the country’s readiness for war. The Russian General Staff, in addition to its annual strategic-level military exercises, introduced frequent so-called ""snap"" exercises to test the combat readiness of the Russian Armed Forces. In the run-up to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, Russia conducted a joint nuclear drill with Belarus, which subsequently changed its constitution to accommodate the hosting of Russian nuclear forces on its territory. This move is designed to give Putin an option of launching a nuclear strike from Belarus on Ukraine.

Belarus recently announced snap military drills, which is probably a cover (‘maskirovka’) for Moscow’s next move. Russia and Belarus are already part of The Union and have a joint military doctrine, which gives Putin freedom of action to use Belarus as a launchpad for the Russian armed forces’ offensive against Ukraine.

In December 2014, Putin established the National Center for State Defense, a wartime structure similar to Stavka VGK, the Soviet command and control center from which Joseph Stalin, another ruthless dictator, commanded the armed forces of the USSR during World War II. Putin’s Stavka coordinates the activities across all Russian armed forces and operates a 24/7 watch center, which now monitors the security environment for any intelligence indicators of the US and NATO intervention in the conflict on behalf of Ukraine.

During the ""special period,"" Putin can dictate whatever emergency measures he believes are necessary to prepare Russia and its citizens for war. On February 27th, three days after the invasion, Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on a ""special"" heightened ""combat readiness regime,"" which remains in effect today.

As Washington ""experts"" are struggling to predict Putin’s next move, the Kremlin’s number one propagandist, Peskov is the last person that the Biden administration should be taking seriously. Putin thinks he has nowhere to go but to escalate. This is exactly why he has trained his forces in ""limited nuclear warfare doctrine"" and rehearsed himself pressing ""the button."" Unlike Biden who has a habit of announcing to his opponents what America will or will not do, Putin keeps his plans close to his vest.

May 9th is approaching fast, adding pressure on Putin to claim a victory in a conflict in which Russian armed forces have become a laughingstock in Western national security circles for their tactical ineptness. The Russian strongman is well on his way to popping a tactical nuke on Ukraine or to going for an electro-magnetic pulse strike, which would knock out all communications around Kyiv. Because make no mistake, this is a full-scale war against Russia that Zelenskyy, and increasingly, the United States, is fighting.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/russia-war-ukraine-electro-magnetic-pulse-rebekah-koffler,N/A
Schools' war on merit is a real threat to our kids' futures,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

In southern California, outside Los Angeles, Culver City School District officials are making headlines for an outrageous scheme in which they have eliminated honors classes from the curriculum at Culver City High School. That’s to the chagrin of many students and parents, understandably angry about advanced learners left behind in the name of ""equity.""

The Wall Street Journal reported, ""To Increase Equity, School Districts Eliminate Honors Classes."" The subhead added, ""Supporters say uniform classes create rigor for all students but critics say cuts hurt faster learners.""

Documents I’ve obtained in the course of reporting my new book, ""Woke Army,"" reveal what we parents know: Culver City school board officials have been playing a long war on merit. Look no further than the ""Equity, Social Justice & Inclusion Plan"" discussed at a board meeting on Aug. 4, 2020, in the midst of America’s ""racial reckoning,"" and approved for its work from 2020-2023.

55 CHICAGO SCHOOLS REPORT NO STUDENTS PROFICIENT IN MATH OR READING

Some of the highlights reveal the war on merit by the Woke Army’s self-described ""equity warriors."" School district officials have been seeking ""equitable education"" not equal. Their plan included ""Learning workshops on the concept of Critical Race Theory"" for parents and ""Professional Development on the concept of Critical Race Theory in the Classroom.""

Page 13 of the report has the zinger now making headlines: ""Grade Span/Level colleague examining equity: re Grading, AP, Honors Courses.""

School district officials didn’t hide the ideology behind their work, citing the book, ""Critical Race Theory in Teacher Education,"" as a reference. Excellence is mentioned only once, citing a book, ""Excellence through Equity."" School district officials also used the work of an equity warrior in the Woke Army, California-based consultant Glenn Singleton and his dubious training, titled, ""Courageous Conversations.""

The elimination of honors classes at Culver City High School in the Culver City Unified School District is emblematic of a wider trend in which ""equity"" is being used as an excuse to take away opportunities from advanced learners and high achievers to cover up the miserable failures of public-school officials who have not been able to close the achievement gaps between Black and Hispanic students with Asian and white students. It’s leading to new racism.

The word ""merit"" is never mentioned in the document.

From California to Virginia, we are seeing a war on merit. A Woke Army of self-described ""equity warriors"" is waging a war on merit on America’s kids and in America’s classrooms, because one of their goals is to dumb down America. A young generation generated unable to read, write and do arithmetic at grade levels makes for a malleable audience for indoctrination.

I saw this reporting my book, in my journey becoming an accidental activist when ""equity warriors"" went after my son’s high school, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, in Alexandria, Va., eliminating the merit-based admissions test and replacing it with new system that a federal judge ruled is unconstitutional. Then this fall, we discovered they withheld National Merit awards.

It’s not just a war on merit. It’s a war on kids and the future of America.

In the 1950s and 1960s, communists in China targeted intellectuals for murder and labor camps during the violent Cultural Revolution of China’s past, and, in the same way, social justice warriors in America’s Woke Army have kids in honors classes in their crosshairs.

The Wall Street Journal reported, ""To Increase Equity, School Districts Eliminate Honors Classes."" The subhead added, ""Supporters say uniform classes create rigor for all students but critics say cuts hurt faster learners.""

They have a simple mantra: ""equal outcomes for every student without exception,"" as an equity consultant declared in Fairfax County, Va., as did the new superintendent, Michelle Reid in a video. The consultant, founder of Performance Facts Inc., even told Princeton, N.J., school district officials in a recorded video, that they must be ""purposefully unequal"" in their work.

In a Feb. 8, 2023, announcement, the Fairfax County, Va., school district just rebranded its equity battle plan with a word salad, claiming on a new webpage that it wants ""Excellence, Equity and Opportunity."" That’s just word salad.

TUCKER CARLSON: There is no limit to the war in Ukraine,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

There is a poignant, but recognizable thing that happens to powerful men as they decline. They get bursts of irrational energy. An 85-year-old tycoon marries a stripper. On the face of it, the marriage does not make sense. Everybody groans. How is this arrangement going to work out for him really? How about for his children?

The tycoon doesn't care. He isn't thinking long term. He's reacting against what he feels inside, which is the steady loss of his power as a man. The faster that power recedes, the more frantically he asserts it. He is raging against the dying of the light. These last embarrassing decisions are, in fact, his death throes. It's sad, really.

Unfortunately, what happens to men also tends to happen to the systems they create. For the last 80 years, our world has been governed by a system formed in the final months of World War II. Its features define our life: free and open global trade routes guaranteed by the U.S. Navy, a universal currency called the dollar and overseeing it all, one supreme power, the world's largest economy, the United States of America.

ENERGY EXPERTS BASH KAMALA HARRIS OVER DUBIOUS ENERGY PRICE CLAIM: 'COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH'

It's been a great system in most ways, but for many reasons, including the passage of time, that system is dying. What comes next is not entirely clear, but how to influence it to America's greatest possible advantage is the most important task that faces any U.S. government. Nothing else comes close to that.

Sadly, the Biden administration, geriatric and irrational in its best moments, is not up to that task. No one in the White House even seems aware that the architecture of the world is changing. They call themselves progressives, but the Biden people think it's 1961 when American power seemed unlimited. Just today, our elderly Treasury secretary scolded the Chinese government like a tardy servant. Shape up, China. We’ll send you back to the cellar. Watch this.

JANET YELLEN: We have made clear that providing material support to Russia or assistance with any type of systemic sanctions evasion would be a very serious concern to us, and we will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdiction about what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences they would face for violating them.

We're going to tell them what the rules are. Once they hear the rules, they'll obey. Janet Yellen seems shocked and outraged that China has decided to align with Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine. It's an outrage. It's unbelievable. Who could have seen this coming? Well, almost everybody, actually. It was obvious to the world it was going to happen because it was always going to happen if we didn't force a peace in Ukraine.

But somehow the Biden administration didn't see this coming. Now that it has happened, now that the world's largest country has joined with the world's largest economy, which also has the world's largest population, in order to fight a war against us, what do we do? Well, if you're Janet Yellen, you just order them to stop. Stop it, you naughty Chinese, stop it. Otherwise, we will impose some serious consequences on you. We can't tell you what they are, but trust us, they are serious. They might even include further statements of outrage. So, shape up Chinese people.

Pretty amazing to watch, a lady who's never been in a fistfight ordering the Chinese military around like she owns it. You can imagine the laughter in Beijing tonight. Next, we'll have Admiral Rachel Levine wagging his perky finger at Chairman Xi. Surrender your arms, China, because transwomen are women. It's all pretty amusing until you realize it's real. Caught in the middle of a historic global pivot and one of those rare moments when everything changes forever, the Biden administration has decided to live in the past and to pretend that the United States is still capable of imposing unilateral decisions on the rest of the world because we said so. Here's Joe Biden once again playing Churchill to Putin's Hitler.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for as long as it takes and that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President. For as long as it takes.

JOHN KIRBY: As the president has said, and we're going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes.

KAMALA HARRIS: Again, the United States will continue to strongly support Ukraine, and we will do so for as long as it takes.

YELLEN: As President Biden has said, we will stand with Ukraine in its fight for as long as it takes.

CHINA BLAMES US GUN POLICIES FOR GLOBAL VIOLENCE, SAYS AMERICA EXPORTS ‘WOES AND INSTABILITY’

Silly, ineffectual buffoons. The world is laughing, the adults are laughing. and in this country it's a measure of our media's total corruption that no one ever asks anyone in the Biden administration what the United States is hoping to accomplish in Ukraine. As long as it takes to do what exactly?

Now, the original answer was, well, to push Russia back to where it was a year ago before it invaded Ukraine and that seemed like a reasonable and measurable objective. The public seemed behind that. Then, without fanfare or even official notice, the goal changed and became taking the Russian port of Crimea just because it would be nice to have that. Always, wanted it. Why not take it now?

Then the goal became overthrowing Putin and putting American tanks in Red Square because sure, we could manage Russia once we overthrow the dictator. We're good at that. We did it in Iraq. We did it in Libya. Now the objective appears to be winning World War III against both Russia and China, a war that would, by definition, include the use of nuclear weapons and the deaths by incineration of hundreds of millions of people.

At this point, there is no limit to the war in Ukraine. It is all that matters. The war in Ukraine is the focus of the entire U.S. government, all branches, both parties. It is also, as our own economy degrades as huge companies lay off thousands, the war in Ukraine is one of our main expenses. Here's Janet Yellen to explain.

YELLEN: Our economic assistance is making Ukraine's resistance possible by supporting the home front, funding critical public services and helping keep the government running. In the coming months, we expect to provide around $10 billion in additional economic support for Ukraine.

OK, so just to be clear, in case you weren't listening carefully, and it's hard to understand what she's saying, but we have the transcript, that's not 10 billion more in war aid. That's to fund critical services in the government, which is Zelenskyy's political party, which has banned a Christian denomination and arrested priests. That's what we're paying for. And leaving aside the aims, that's still $10 billion more in tax dollars. That's on top of the $113 billion that Congress has already approved. That's $123 billion pledged to Ukraine in a year. And then when you add a thousand other off the book sources of aid, the entire intel world, you're looking at perhaps $200 billion to Zelenskyy and his wife in 12 months. $200 billion! It's truly crazy. How much money is that?

US STATE DEPARTMENT HINTS AT 'CONSEQUENCES' IF CHINA PROVIDES LETHAL AID TO RUSSIA FOR UKRAINE WAR

Well, to make it easier, let's pretend we'd only spent 100 billion in Ukraine so far. We know we have. What can we do with $100 billion here in the United States. For one thing, and this is kind of in the news recently, we could modernize our rail system to avoid the thousand derailments we have every year and the mushroom clouds over Ohio that sometimes result from them. $100 billion is more than five times the entire discretionary budget of the Department of Transportation. There's just 13 billion in the DOT's budget for transit and less than $3 billion for Amtrak. Remember that? The artery that connects the cities on the East Coast. Then there's the FAA. That's the government agency that sought to prevent planes from crashing into each other and killing hundreds of Americans.

The FAA got $20 billion in the last budget. $20 billion! So given that planes seem to be coming very close to hitting each other lately, it might be worth funding the FAA a little more. Oh, but no Zelenskyy's political party needs it.

And then, of course, with that money, we could do things that matter long term, like building a wall along our southern border. We could build four of them for that. That would save, in addition to a lot of other things, hundreds of thousands of American lives by blocking drug traffickers from entering the country, and then you wouldn't have a cartel war in Texas and Arizona, which we're absolutely going to get.

With $100 billion, we could pay off half the medical debt in the entire country. We could pay for two years of community college tuition for every young person in the United States. We could fund all out-of-pocket expenses for cancer patients for five years. That's a lot of money. We could do a lot with it. Why isn't Bernie Sanders doing the math on this? Why isn't he even talking about it? Why is it left to some right-wing TV show to figure out what could be done with that money domestically? Bernie Sanders is all for saying that money to Ukraine and it turns out most so-called progressives are.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Sandy Cortez, voice of the people, she's for it, too. It's fascinating. Of course, we could also keep the money. That'd be useful. We need it. Our national debt is now over $31 trillion. It's bigger than our GDP. Our debt is bigger than our GDP. In just the last 27 months, the Biden administration has increased the national debt by $7 trillion. How much is that? I mean, it's an incomprehensible number, but here's the context. It took 215 years from George Washington to George W. Bush to accrue that much debt.

Interest payments on that debt have hit more than $400 billion this year. So, according to calculations by Pew, that's $100 billion more per year than we spent on elementary and secondary education, disaster relief, agriculture and environmental protection combined. Within the next decade, interest costs on the debt will be greater than spending on national defense and Medicaid. Within 30 years interest payments will be the single largest expenditure in the entire federal budget, bigger than Social Security. And a lot of that debt, you should know well over a trillion dollars is owned by China, the country we're now fighting in Ukraine.

You see how this works? Most Americans do see how it works and they oppose it. They're afraid of it. They should be. Polls show clearly they oppose it, but here's the interesting thing. Neither party in Washington cares what their voters think. Here, for example, is Republican Michael McCaul. He is the Republican Party's head foreign policy genius in the House, a man completely controlled by the intel agencies, but here he is on television explaining that in a democracy, it doesn't matter what voters think.

KAMALA HARRIS DISMISSES UNPOPULARITY AMONG DEMOCRATS AHEAD OF 2024: 'POLITICAL CHATTER'

PAMELA BROWN: And a new poll is showing support among Americans for arming Ukraine is dropping. How concerned, Congressman McCaul, are foreign leaders you're speaking to that American support for Ukraine, particularly within your own party, is weakening?

REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: I would say that support is still very strong and this delegation, this bipartisan, very strong support for Ukraine, I think we're you're seeing a split from the administration, though and I have to say, this is bipartisan as well, is that for the past year, we've been very slow in getting these weapons in the name of it being too provocative, whether it be stingers, javelins, these short range artillery, now longer range artillery attack ATACMS they can take out the Iranian drones in Crimea and also aviation like F-16. If we put this stuff in from the very beginning of this conflict, a year from now may have been very different.

You'll notice that whenever there's a bipartisan consensus on something in Washington, it's a bad idea. Usually, it's the worst idea. There's no bipartisan consensus on saving middle class America or rescuing rural Americans from fentanyl. There's no bipartisan consensus on that. Nobody cares. The bipartisan consensus is that we should send the contents of the U.S. Treasury to a corrupt Eastern European country to facilitate World War III

And why is that? Well, the truth is, Washington is so dysfunctional that funding a war, destroying things is like the one thing they can do. And that's why they love it so much, because they can get something done. Of course, it's purely destructive.

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

So, we wanted to talk to Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas, the foreign policy genius, more about this. You don't care what your voters think, really? So, we asked to come on tonight. Why do you support a war that your constituents oppose? How does this benefit the United States? Were you proud that you helped Russia and China align in a bloc that's more powerful than the United States? Is that good for us? How does that work, Congressman?

He can't make it, unfortunately. Congressman Mike Turner can't come either. He represents Ohio. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah didn't respond at all. Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell were, of course, hard no's. No way. We're not going to answer questions. Shut up, we'll do CNN first.

You should know that everyone we just mentioned is a Republican. They can't defend this, of course. Only a very tiny number of Republicans voted to stop this insanity before it destroys the economy of the United States and triggers World War III, and they've been punished for it. And a lot of Republicans care because on MSNBC, if you're against World War III, you're an agent of Putin. Watch.

NICOLLE WALLACE: Ten House Republicans voted against military aid for Ukraine, the usual suspects, but I'll read them out here: Andy Biggs, Dan Bishop, Warren Davidson, Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Thomas Massie, Ralph Norman, Scott Perry and Tom Tiffany. The point is Marjorie Taylor Greene and Vladimir Putin and too often than I think anyone would like to acknowledge, Tucker Carlson, are all on the same page.

We're on Putin 's side. It's funny how the people who hate the United States the most, spend the most time tearing it down – oh, it's tainted by the original sin of slavery. It's a terrible country! 1619 project – truly hate the United States, are the ones who accuse people trying to save the United States from being destroyed in a pointless war of siding with a foreign dictator.

TUCKER CARLSON: The point of the Ukraine war is regime change in Russia,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

This week marks the seven-month anniversary of the beginning of the war in Ukraine , something that is still going on and isn't talked about quite as much anymore. The day that war began, which was February 24, two things were very obvious. The first was that there was no way the Ukrainian army would be able to win a decisive military victory over Russia and the reason was simple. Russia is too big. Ukraine is too small. The Russian military is many times the size of the Ukrainian military. Plus, of course, it has nuclear weapons.

Russia itself is the largest country on planet Earth. It's got a relatively huge economy for the region and it's got 145 million people who live there. Ukraine has a population of about 40 million. It's the poorest country in Europe. It's got an average annual income that is much lower than Albania's.

So, just by looking at the most basic Wikipedia level numbers, it was clear right away that if Ukraine wanted to remain a sovereign country and of course, all of us wanted that for Ukraine, Ukraine was going to have to reach some kind of negotiated settlement with Russia. Pitched battles were not going to do it. Now, that's not a moral judgment. You can root for the Ukrainian military all you want, but it's still a fact and there's no getting around it.

The second thing that was immediately evident about this war was how unusually destructive it was and was going to be. It wasn't just Ukraine that was getting pummeled, though it certainly was. It was the entire Western economy, including our economy. Russian energy fuels Europe. A recession in Germany was certain to lead to a recession here and in the months since, it has, a bad one. The longer this war goes on, inevitably the poorer everyone is going to be, with the exception probably of Vladimir Putin.

PUTIN INITIATES CONSCRIPTION TO BOLSTER MILITARY INVASION AS UKRAINE MOUNTS COUNTEROFFENSIVE

We are breaking things that are very hard to rebuild. Again, this was very obvious the first day of the war. You weren't allowed to say it at the time. Anyone who did was denounced as a Russian spy. But it was still clearly true and the Ukrainians certainly understood it. Back in April, according to an account in Foreign Policy magazine, negotiators from the governments of Russia and Ukraine met secretly and ""appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement to end the war.""

The terms of the deal were simple. Russia would withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Ukraine would promise not to join NATO, so each side would get the thing that it wants most simple and effective, and it might have worked.

But the Biden administration adamantly opposed this settlement. Biden's advisers didn't just want the Russians to leave Ukraine. That's what they told us they wanted on television, but no. Biden's advisers wanted a total regime change war against Russia, apparently to avenge the election of Donald Trump, which they believed Putin was responsible for, and they were willing to fight to the last Ukrainian to get it.

On April 9 of this year, the White House dispatched its hapless cutout, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian news media, Johnson communicated two messages to the Zelenskyy government, ""The first is that Putin is a war criminal. He should be pressured, not negotiated with and the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, the West is not.""

In other words, who cares what the Ukrainians want. America and the U.K. demand total war with Russia, regime change war with Russia and of course, the Ukrainians caught in the middle had no choice but to concede. So, days later, the peace negotiations fell apart. This was virtually unreported at the time, but it was the turning point in the war in Ukraine. This was the moment where the goal changed from restoring Ukraine to what it was before the invasion – and that seems reasonable to everyone in the West – to something very different, to a war designed to topple Vladimir Putin, just like we toppled Saddam Hussein and then hoping for the best afterward. That is clearly insane and dangerous, but that's where we are and from that point on, everything changed and that is how we got to where we are today, which is the closest we have ever been to nuclear conflict in history.

REP. WALTZ URGES BIDEN TO BE TOUGH ON 'WAR CRIMINAL' PUTIN AS UKRAINE WAR RAGES ON: 'RHETORIC MATTERS A LOT'

This week, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine gave an interview to the left-wing newspaper, The Guardian and in it, he casually called for the United States to nuke Vladimir Putin. ""The other nuclear states need to say very firmly that as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes on foreign territory, in this case the territory of Ukraine, there will be swift retaliatory nuclear strikes to destroy the nuclear launch sites in Russia."" Parse that, and we're quoting, ""as soon as Russia even thinks of carrying out nuclear strikes"" – meaning before Russia actually launches missiles – ""the U.S. needs to launch nuclear weapons against Russia."" In other words, we need to launch nuclear weapons now. Why now and how do we know that's what Zelenskyy meant? Because the Zelenskyy was responding to this warning from the Russian government on Wednesday.

PUTIN: I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction and for separate components, more modern than those of NATO countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use means at our disposal. It's not a bluff.

""It's not a bluff,"" says Putin, who we are told is insane, so we probably should take it seriously. He is, after all, running a country with the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet and he's talking about using nuclear weapons if the West continues to threaten Russia's territorial integrity. It's a conditional warning and, of course, threatening Russia's territorial integrity was never part of the deal. Right? You remember this? It's why you wore a Ukrainian lapel pin or put a Ukrainian flag in front of your house. Ukraine was invaded. The point was to kick the Russians out. That seems reasonable by any standard of fairness and decency, but that's not what the Biden administration is pushing for. They're pushing for toppling the government of Russia and once again, hoping that everything will be fine after that, someone better will somehow take over. ""He's bad. Let's kill him."" Heard that story before?

ACTIVISTS SUING DESANTIS OVER MARTHA'S VINEYARD FLIGHTS RECEIVED OVER $1.3M FROM GEORGE SOROS NETWORK

In response to what Putin just said, Ukraine's government called for an immediate nuclear attack on Russia, an attack that would without question result in the immediate destruction of New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, the deaths of tens of millions of Americans. That's what he just said. Sane people do not talk this way, ever. If there was a moment for the Biden administration to shut this whole thing down and force negotiated peace, which they could do in an instant, that moment is right now before huge numbers of people die, but that's not what the Biden administration is doing. They are moving in the other direction at high speed and doing all they can to bring the West to the brink of destruction.

At the U.N. yesterday, Joe Biden accused Russia, not Ukraine, of making overt nuclear threats. Watch.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: This war is about extinguishing Ukraine's right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine's right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not, that should make your blood run cold. President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the nonproliferation regime. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia's aggression. Period.

OK. Putin is bad. Fine. Agree, but Putin is making nuclear threats. Whatever the reason, he is making them, the fact he is making them and the Ukrainians, of course, are also making explicit nuclear threats, is enough for any responsible person to say, ""now we stop,"" especially if that person is the leader of the United States, the country which is funding this war and that could end this war tonight by calling Ukraine to the table. Russian troops leave. Ukraine promises not to join NATO, everything is as it was in January of this year, and everything's fine. We don't have to worry about New York getting nuked.

But that's not what they want. So, Joe Biden didn't say a word about America's responsibility here. Again, we are funding this war. We could end it. They're choosing not to. He didn't say a word about that at the United Nations, of course, because they want war and neither did Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Watch.

SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN: President Putin picked this week as most of the world gathers at the United Nations to add fuel to the fire that he started. Shows his utter contempt for the U.N. Charter, for the General Assembly and for this council. The very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes. We cannot, we will not, allow President Putin to get away with it. Every council member should send a clear message that these reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.

AIR FORCE ACADEMY DIVERSITY TRAINING TELLS CADETS TO USE WORDS THAT 'INCLUDE ALL GENDERS ,' DROP 'MOM AND DAD'

OK. So Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, is a buffoon and a failed rock musician, reading some paper posturing like a cable news segment about how Putin's bad. Yeah great. Got it. But sitting behind him in the shot you just saw is someone who is not a buffoon at all and that would be Toria Nuland, one of the people responsible for the disaster in Iraq. Now in a functioning country anyone who had a hand in the 20-year tragedy of Iraq in which America's prestige was gravely degraded, in which thousands of Americans died, in which we got much poorer for no good reason, anyone who was involved in that, including the lie that got us into it, would be disqualified from participating in American foreign policy forever, but Toria Nuland just ascended, ascended, ascended until she brings us to the brink of nuclear war with Russia.

So Tony Blinken is telling the United Nations and the rest of us that it's okay for Ukraine to threaten nuclear war on behalf of the United States and the rest of the world looks on with their jaws open, including China, of all places. Here's China's foreign ministry spokesperson yesterday. Watch.

WANG WENBIN, CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire and stop the war through dialog and negotiation and to find a solution that takes into account the legitimate security concerns of all parties as soon as possible. We also hope the international community will create the conditions and space for this.

We call on all parties to achieve a cease-fire like the one they nearly had in April before the Biden administration blew it up because they want regime change in Russia. Now, that's coming from China, which has a human rights record that help makes Russia seem like Sweden and of course, China has benefited almost as much from this war as Putin has and Raytheon and Lockheed has, but even the Chinese are not crazy enough to want nuclear Armageddon. In the end, all they want to do is do business and dominate through business.

They don't want their customers to blow themselves up and they understand they're coming incredibly close. Only Tony Blinken and lunatics like Toria Nuland really want that and they are fully behind Ukraine's president as he declares that his goal is not ending the war and getting his country back, which is a fine and admirable goal, that most Americans support. No, his goal is toppling Vladimir Putin and turning Russia into another failed state. Oh, good plan. Here he is.

ICC TO RETURN TO UKRAINE NEXT WEEK TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, 'PIERCE THE FOG OF WAR'

ZELENSKYY: A crime has been committed against Ukraine and we demand just punishment. The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations and Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. This is the first item of our peace formula, comprehensive item punishment.

So, a corrupt Eastern European authoritarian leader in a t-shirt is lecturing us about the community of nations and telling us this is really about the punishment that Ukraine demands. It's not about self-defense or getting their territory back. It's about regime change. Specifically, they're demanding a nuclear strike from us. How do we get involved in this anyway? But almost nobody in Washington is standing back to ask that question. They're full speed ahead on this. This is insane, but they're all for it.

Adam Kinzinger just tweeted this: ""By the way, any target within Russia that contributes to the war is fair game, by law of armed conflict. There's no escalation possible by a country fighting for survival. Anyone claiming Ukraine is escalating should stop.""

Anyone saying things that stupid in public should immediately resign from public office and be silent until wisdom comes, please. Then over in the Senate, Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are in agreement on just that same point. They've announced that Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism.

SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Russia should be declared a state sponsor of terrorism because the events of these past days and weeks have shown the need more powerfully than ever that Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism.

PUTIN TAKES EXTREME ACTION TO FILL RANKS, UNVAXXED HEROES STILL STUCK IN LIMBO AND MORE TOP HEADLINES

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think bipartisanship is strong when it comes to supporting Ukraine over Russia. I want to thank the administration for doing more. We have our differences about the next step, but Speaker Pelosi's in our camp. She has said from her point of view, Russia has earned the designation in U.S. law of being a state sponsor of terrorism.

The fact that Lindsey Graham can go on television, as he so often does, and claim to be conservative and someone who cares about the United States, it's beyond. So, this is part of the endless posturing about how Russia's bad and sure, Russia's bad. Fine, Russia's bad, but it's the words, as always, that matter. They're telling you that Russia is now a state sponsor of terror. Why are they saying that? And you're probably nodding. ""Yeah. It seems like a bad place with a bad leader, fine, but state sponsor of terror?"" It's important for them to define Russia very specifically as that. Why? Because what do we do with terror states? We topple their governments. We go on the offensive. We take the fight to them and that's the position of Washington on a bipartisan level and it's particularly the position of people who believe falsely, speaking of election-related conspiracy theories, that Vladimir Putin stole the 2016 election and no one believes that lunacy more fervently than the lady who lost. Here she is.

HILLARY CLINTON: They're getting the weapons they need to defend themselves and they're now on offense and I think we have to keep supporting them, helping them. They were attacked by an unprovoked act of war and they've held out and they've done better than anybody could have predicted and Zelenskyy has been a true wartime leader. I'm so impressed with him and I think, you know, the United States should stand with them.

BIDEN OFFICIAL GRILLED AFTER LATEST TAIWAN DECLARATION CONTRADICTS POLICY: 'HE SAID IT FOUR TIMES'

If you're one of the millions of good-hearted Republicans who, when this broke out in February, thought ""Well, this is awful. You shouldn't invade a sovereign country"" and of course, we agreed with that, we should stand with Ukraine, you may feel a little fooled at this point, because what you're watching is classic mission creep. We arrive for one purpose and we extend the stay for an entirely different purpose that you didn't sign up for and that will absolutely hurt the United States long-term.

When Hillary Clinton says we're going to stand with Zelenskyy as he goes on the offensive, that does not mean expelling Russian troops from his country, which everyone would agree with. That means toppling Vladimir Putin and creating a black hole in the center of Eastern Europe, the place where Asia meets Europe in a country with some of the biggest energy reserves on the planet and the largest nuclear arsenal. How is that going to work out? Well, let's listen to the Pentagon spokesmen. They're going on television to explain.

RETIRED LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG: What we need to do is instead, we just need to reverse. We say, ""all in"" and we haven’t done that. For example, we haven’t given the Ukrainians systems like the attack cruise missile which can reach all of Crimea. It’s a 200-mile range, 500-pound warhead, 300 bombers to it. It really can put the Russians at threat, but we haven’t done that. And I think we should put them at threat. Until he really believes that we’re seriously going after him, he’s going to continue to make these threats

So again, anybody who had a hand in, say, like the last five wars that diminished American power, killed Americans, made us poorer, hurt the United States long-term in very real ways, anyone who participated in any of that should probably bow out of the conversation about the latest war for the same reason that you wouldn't say take financial advice from someone who has gone bankrupt or go to marriage counseling with someone who's been divorced three times because they've demonstrably failed in their area of so-called expertise and that would include virtually everyone you hear talking about this stuff. ""He is going to continue making these threats,"" meaning Putin.

So, these are apparently the only threats that we object to. If Ukraine wants us to launch a preemptive nuclear strike in their behalf, that's totally fine. This is complete craziness. This is a ""strategy"" that could very easily bring the total destruction of the West and soon and maybe that's the point.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-no-limit-war-ukraine,N/A
Ukraine war anniversary: Time for Russian sanctions with real teeth,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As we approach the second year of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, a false narrative has emerged that the West is doing everything it can to responsibly support Ukraine, without escalating the conflict.

That narrative belies an uncomfortable but necessary truth: The current path risks defeat, and a better path to victory is crippling Vladimir Putin’s massive web of wealthy enablers – who are still living the high life in the Western countries they claim to detest but love to invest, vacation and live in.

The recent announcement that the United States will send the M1 Abrams tank was billed as a major shot in the arm for Ukraine’s historic fight for independence. The news came shortly after Davos, where attendees whispered compliments about their strong support for Ukraine, which in their view is a victory in and of itself.

I have been on or near the front lines of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine for most of the last year, providing tens of millions of dollars in medicines, generators and basic supplies to help the Ukrainian people - and witnesssing the torture and murder of civilians, systemic rape and other crimes against humanity by Russian forces.

US DETERMINES RUSSIA HAS COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN UKRAINE, VP HARRIS SAYS

Many Western elites and policymakers, are divorced from reality in their belief that loophole-ridden sanctions and slow-walking new aid will win the war.

The United States and its allies deserve enormous credit for uniting to provide military and humanitarian aid to help brave Ukrainians defend their nation. But they must do more.

To bring a halt to the savagery, the West must hit the Russian government where it hurts and target the vast network of oligarchs that prop it up. The media breathlessly reports on the occasional seizure of a luxury yacht but the hard truth is that the Russian elite have managed to successfully evade the toothless sanctions currently in place.

Just look at London’s Billionaires Row, France’s swankiest shopping districts and ski resorts like Courchevel, or the resorts in Maldives and Dubai. They are all jam-packed with big-spending, Kremlin-connected Russians enjoying legal impunity and living like the gods they think they are. I suspect that nearly every $25,000-a-night hotel room in the world is occupied by a Russian.

Until this changes, these powerful oligarchs will continue to support Putin’s bloody war. They currently aren’t paying any price. Thus, targeting and seizing the wealth of Putin’s many collaborators is an essential part of any real strategy to end his disastrous invasion of Ukraine.

What does that mean specifically? Take Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corp., and a longtime Putin confidante. His $80 million 737 airplane continues to travel around Europe, despite sanctions imposed on Chemezov. How? Last year his plane was re-registered in Serbia, and now it travels freely to Serbia, Switzerland, Croatia and Austria. That plane is ripe for seizure in any number of European jurisdictions.

Or look at Roman Abramovich, the longtime owner of the Chelsea football club. He may have been forced to sell his team, but a new investigation from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reveals that he is still getting financing from Credit Suisse, despite sanctions.

Finally, consider Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of The Wagner Group, a Russlan paramilitary organization whose mercenaries are fighting for Russia in Ukraine. One might assume that Prigozhin is exactly the kind of businessman the West would target most vociferously with sanctions, given his direct role in the war. And yet, the British government apparently issued a special carveout allowing him to hire lawyers in the U.K. to sue a journalist.

These kleptocrats are near the top of any public, let alone classified, list of Putin enablers. And they are prime examples of how weak current sanctions are. If Prigozhin, a potential successor to Putin, gets special treatment from No. 10 Downing Street, imagine the warm welcome the rest of the Russian kleptocracy receives from banks, realtors, top tier schools, and the most exclusive resorts across the world.

The West helped create the elaborate schemes and accounting structures that oligarchs use to maintain and grow their fortunes. That’s why the West must uncover and eradicate them. The U.S. in particular must also insist that its allies cease enabling Russian oligarchs

The United States and its allies must make three major changes quickly to save the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians and bring an end to Russia’s bloodshed.

First, they must put meaningful manpower behind sanctions implementation, recruiting the best expertise from the private sector to enforce the sanctions that have been announced and give them real teeth.

Second, expand the list of Russians who are subject to sanctions. The current list only scratches the surface of those who are supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Finally, the West must deny Russian oligarchs the safe harbors around the world where they reside, vacation and invest their ill-gotten wealth. If they want to support Putin, let them sit in Moscow with him.

That kind of crackdown on the Kremlin’s oligarchs will have long-term benefits for the future security of Europe. And for Russia. Putin won’t be in power forever. But whoever comes next will find themselves surrounded by an intelligence service, military, mercenary industry, and economic elites deeply invested in corruption, organized crime and violent nationalism. Unless Europe and the U.S. decide that enough is enough.

The new tanks will only buy Kyiv time before Russia’s seemingly unlimited military manpower and willingness to absorb massive battlefield losses will start another conversation about what other weapons systems Ukraine needs. It’ll be Groundhog Day, all over again.

The best way to break the current deadly stalemate reminiscent of the trenches in World War I is to try a new approach. Show Putin’s vast army of enablers that their lifestyles and wealth aren’t safe as long as Russia continues to wage war against innocent Ukrainian civilians.

Ukraine war: One year later... and the years ahead,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

A year of warfare in Ukraine has shown that President Biden is a terrible leader. The saving grace? Vladimir Putin is far worse.

That said, reliving the past is not what is most important now. There are no do-overs in war. Americans must think about what is next – the future of the U.S. in Europe. And because of Putin’s many misjudgments, that future could be very promising indeed.

The U.S. has a serious stake in a peaceful and prosperous Europe. That’s why we are still in NATO. The alliance helps protect us and our interests.

That is also why Russia and China want NATO gone and America out of Europe. The invasion of Ukraine was their biggest, boldest step toward that goal.

WAR IN UKRAINE: HERE'S HOW WE DEFEAT RUSSIA AND DETER CHINA

What happened? Well, for starters, Putin appears to be the worst war leader in modern memory. He not only can’t defeat Ukraine, he can’t even consolidate control over the occupied territory.

Still, persistent concerns that he might escalate the war remain. Well, who knows what Putin will do? But if he can’t defeat Ukraine, will he really venture attacking others (say, Moldova) as well? For the last year, Putin has fought every day, and every day his conventional land forces are weaker than they were the day before. It’s hard to see that changing.

As we mark the anniversary, we should not forget that, as titular Leader of the Free World, Biden’s leadership has often been MIA. It started before the invasion. Biden came into office sending strong signals he didn’t care about Europe, Ukraine or Russia. Then, when Russia was on the march, he spent a year doing nothing more than finger wave and threaten tepid sanctions.

Once the fighting began, Biden’s brave first act was to encourage Ukraine’s president to run away. If not for his humiliation in Afghanistan and the fact that Ukrainians refused to fall, Biden would have turned his back on Ukraine.

BIDEN CHALLENGES PUTIN TO ‘END THE WAR’ IN UKRAINE, THREATENS TO RAMP UP SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA

Now, we have Biden recasting himself as a hero. Sorry, that doesn’t sell. In his surprise trip to Kyiv, Biden declared, ""We will be with you as long as it takes."" That statement surely rings hollow in the ears of Afghans now living in Taliban hell.

Blank-check Biden is also apparently not concerned about spending. Little surprise. He treats the American taxpayer like his personnel ATM. Still, Ukraine support represents but a fraction of the $5 trillion deficit rung up under Biden. Most of it was wasted on pet domestic ""woke"" projects.

Even the trip to Ukraine is less admirable than it appears. If he wished to show American resolve, Biden should have gone to Kyiv when Ukraine was in maximum peril. Instead, he withheld weapons that might have ended this conflict faster. But now he shows up – after first checking with Putin to make it was safe enough to go. Spare me.

Let’s be honest. There are feckless leaders in both Moscow and Washington. While we should have little faith in them, we can have faith in ourselves to make the best of the way forward.

First, we need to put an end to the profligate ways of Blank-check Biden. The U.S. has already earmarked almost $200 billion in aid to Ukraine. Thankfully, we have new leadership in Congress that looks up to the task.

Second, we need to think about what the future U.S. footprint in Europe ought to look like. Since the Russian conventional threat is greatly diminished, and our allies are waking up to their responsibilities to do more in their self-defense, a more limited presence makes sense. More forces could be rotational, but they have to be persistent and forward present on NATO’s eastern frontier to deter future Russian recklessness.

Third, we need to start building better partnerships in Europe. Europe knows Biden is a fair-weather friend. There are many and a growing number of center-right governments in North, Central and Southern Europe. Italy is but one example.

These governments are pro-U.S., pro-NATO, anti-Putin and anti-China. They have proven remarkably resilient through the tumult of inflation, energy prices, and the unsettling war in Ukraine They are increasingly pro-family, pro-life, pro-parent directed education, and anti-woke.

Ukraine war wouldn’t take so long if Biden would commit to victory,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year into Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, it is important to remember why the United States and our allies are supporting Ukraine.

If we had the opportunity to help Poland stop Adolf Hitler in 1939, imagine the horrors that could have been prevented and the blood and treasure that could have been saved. We have that opportunity now as the U.S. and its allies once again face strategic adversaries in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

Currently, Russia is engaged in a new offensive in the east. If successful, President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces could then attempt to occupy Ukraine’s entire southern coastline. The economic and humanitarian consequences of this would be significant.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Reminiscent of Stalin’s genocide of Ukrainians, known as the Holodomor, Russia is using its stranglehold of the Black Sea and attacks on Ukraine’s farmland to not just starve Ukraine, but also exacerbate food insecurity worldwide. Ukraine’s economic self-sufficiency and future exploration of energy reserves in surrounding waters also will be impossible without control of its Black Sea coastline, leaving it dependent on Western aid.

Despite what is at stake, the administration is still too slow in getting critical weapon systems to Ukraine. Ukraine right now has only enough weapons to prevent an outright Russian takeover, but not to secure victory in driving Russian forces out of the country. This strategy of incrementalism and hesitation will only prolong this conflict and lead to more Russian war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities.

The administration has recently committed to provide M1 Abrams tanks, as well as longer range Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) – this is encouraging. Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.

For Ukraine’s offensive to reach its full potential, which will likely begin in the spring, they still need more air defense systems, longer-range artillery, armor, armed drones, fighter jets and most urgently, Ukraine needs the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can hit critical Russian targets currently out of range. These targets include the military bases, fuel and ammunition depots and staging areas for Iranian drones in Crimea.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration has consistently been a step behind throughout this war. They have repeatedly claimed sending certain advanced weapon systems – from Stingers, to HIMARS, to Patriot air defense systems, to Western main battle tanks – would somehow provoke Putin. Yet, when these provisions were eventually sent, months later, there was no Russian retribution.

We commend the United Kingdom for their generous support. They were the first to provide Western battle tanks to Ukraine, helping unlock German approval for the Leopard 2 tanks along with the U.S. decision to send the Abrams.

Additionally, the U.S. and allies should join the British in training Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard fighter jets. Moreover, if smaller countries like the Baltics and Poland can provide such outsized support to Ukraine, larger ones have no excuse not to.

This is not only the morally right thing to do; it’s in the U.S. national security interest. With just over $30 billion just in U.S. security assistance, which is about 3% of the U.S. defense budget, Ukraine has crippled the military of America’s second-greatest adversary without placing a single U.S. servicemember in harm’s way.

Meanwhile, Congress will continue to conduct stringent oversight of U.S. funding to Ukraine, so the American people can rest assured their generous support is being used as intended in Ukraine.

Putin’s revisionist agenda does not stop at the Ukrainian border. If his dream of restoring the Soviet Empire turned its sights on a NATO ally next, then American boots on the ground would be required.

There is also a clear long-term, national security interest in destroying the Russian military now to prevent that scenario. And a Russian victory will only embolden China’s Chairman Xi to threaten the Indo-Pacific, to include Taiwan, and play into his propaganda that the West is in decline.

A US-Russia war over Ukraine would be catastrophic,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

As a former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) officer and specialist in Russian doctrine and strategy who participated in dozens of war games that simulated a U.S.-Russia conflict, I am gravely concerned about the high risk of Washington going to war over Ukraine.

If you thought $2 trillion and 6,000 American lives were a steep price to pay for a no-victory outcome of a 20-year engagement in Afghanistan, you ain’t seen nothing yet.

U.S. costs and losses in a war with nuclear Russia would be catastrophic. Such a war is unwinnable, and it is not worth sacrificing American lives to wage.

WHEN ‘OLD FRIENDS’ BIDEN AND CHINA'S XI MET, IT WAS BAD FOR AMERICA

Russia’s elevated force posture along the Ukrainian border – including 114,000 soldiers, special forces, intelligence operatives and heavy weaponry, counting tanks – is reminiscent of Putin’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine. This, along with recent high-risk encounters between U.S. warships and the Russian navy in the Black Sea, and Putin’s warning on Nov. 13 about the U.S. throwing down the gauntlet to Moscow, constitute what’s called in the intelligence business ""indications and warnings"" of an impending crisis.

Concerned about the high probability of Russia’s outright invasion of Ukraine, U.S. intelligence has warned European allies that there is but a narrow window of opportunity to deter Putin.

Predictably, Washington ""experts"" discharge advice that is not grounded in reality, failing to understand that while Ukraine is part of Russia’s vital interests, it is not part of America’s. Some advocate accelerated acceptance of Ukraine into NATO, which in their ""expert"" view would guarantee Ukraine’s security by virtue of obligating the U.S. and NATO to step into a Russo-Ukrainian conflict on behalf on Kiev. Others call for troop deployments into the region to deter KGB spymaster Putin.

For centuries, Russia has viewed Ukraine as its security buffer against foreign invasions.

Beleaguered and bullied, Ukraine should be free to pursue its own development path. But sadly, its geostrategic location, bordering on three sides the much bigger and military stronger Russia, dictates its destiny in the harsh world of realpolitik. Certainly, at least, in Putin’s world.

The Russian leader has stated multiple times that the admission of Ukraine into NATO – a military alliance that Russia views as its top threat – would cross a ""red line."" For centuries, Russia has viewed Ukraine as its security buffer against foreign invasions. Not that this is justified or good. But that is how it is and has been.

Ivan Il’in, a Russian Orthodox Christian thinker whose ideas Putin drew from in developing his own ideology, stated in his writings that an independent Ukraine would be an unthinkable ""madness."" Like Il’in, Putin firmly believes that it is essential to rule all the lands of Imperial Russia together to ensure its self-defense. While the maintenance of empires may be alien and anachronistic to U.S. thinkers, it dominates the Russian mindset.

Washington ""experts,"" who are notoriously bad at understanding what motivates America’s foreign adversaries, have no clue about the visceral, centuries-old sense of possessiveness that Russia feels about Ukraine. The reintegration of Ukraine and other post-Soviet states into a Russian-led union is something that is viewed by Moscow as a matter of national survival. It is this mentality that is at the root of Putin’s actions and policies, such as the annexation of Crimea.

Putting U.S. troops in the theater, in Russia’s backyard, would be interpreted by the Kremlin as a precursor to possible U.S. kinetic action against Russia. The very presence of U.S. deployed forces so close to a conflict would increase the pressure on Washington, which was just chased out of Afghanistan, to intervene on behalf of Ukraine.

Such an action would spur Moscow to activate its preemptive ""self-defense"" response, targeting the U.S. homeland with destructive cyber and space warfare attack. With Russia’s recent anti-satellite missile strike test, Putin has demonstrated Russia’s ability to cripple U.S. satellites, on which we are reliant not only for our war fighting capability but for countless civilian purposes.

Putin, who fears becoming a target of Washington’s doctrine of ""regime change"" that has claimed the likes of Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi, is primed for overreaction. Once the shooting starts, the war could very well go nuclear and involve debilitating cyber strikes on America’s power grid.

What is Putin thinking? Where the Russia-Ukraine war stands nine months after invasion,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Washington will soon debate sending billions more to Ukraine to assist its war effort. Lawmakers may want to first conduct a reality check on where Russia stands in this nine-month war and on Putin’s decision calculus. This suggests that U.S. funding will not produce quick results, may not produce any results or may also produce very bad results for America and Ukraine.

This is how, when wishful thinking is set aside, things actually look:

The Battlefield

Multiple areas across Ukraine are still under Russian assault, even as Ukrainian forces are gaining momentum with an effective counter-offensive, pushing to reclaim territories captured by Russia. On Friday, special units of Ukraine’s armed forces entered the strategic city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, following the retreat of the Russian troops as directed by the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. As Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy was championing another victory, the Kremlin warned that Kherson’s status didn’t change, despite the retreat, claiming that the city was still ‘part of Russia.’

The Russians are unlikely to permanently abandon Kherson or any of the three regions that Moscow recently ""annexed."" The Russian ground forces who assumed defensive positions on the left bank of the Dniepr River, will probably not engage in a mano-a-mano battle with Ukrainians, having lost so many men and so much military hardware. The withdrawal is a potential ruse to lure Ukrainian troops into a radioactive chamber. Russian Spetsnaz operatives reportedly left a nasty message on a door of one of the buildings. Addressed to Ukrainians, the message warned that this was ""the territory of the Russian Empire,"" that Putin was ""our and your Czar"" and that the Russian troops went ""on vacation.""

PUTIN’S CYBER ARMAGEDDON DOCTRINE SEEKS TO EXPAND RUSSIA'S OFFENSE BEYOND BATTLEFIELD

For weeks, Moscow has been accusing Kyiv of planning to use a ""dirty bomb,"" also called a radiological dispersal device (RDD), an improvised nuclear device containing dynamite laced with radioactive powder. Unlike traditional nuclear bombs, RDDs have low military value but produce panic and terror in the opposing force and population. They cause severe burns, irradiation sickness, and they contaminate food and water. Driving Ukrainians out of the region by contamination would be consistent with Russia’s most recent military doctrine, which envisions use of radiological, chemical and biological warfare for ""defensive"" purposes. The Russians have a special military branch, Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces (RKhBZ), that are trained in decontamination and clean up.

A New Strategy of Indirect Action

Russia has all but exhausted its conventional combat power, having fired around 4,000 missiles and, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, have lost some 100,000 personnel to death or injury. Morale is low. Special units are sent to the front lines to shoot retreating soldiers and deserters. Multiple Russian commanders have failed to secure victory.

However, despite Washington’s expectations, Putin will not abandon the fight. His regime views the stakes as existential for him and for Russia. Moscow wants Ukraine to remain part of its strategic security perimeter, on which it relied for centuries. Putin will continue to enforce his version of the Monroe Doctrine to keep NATO troops and influence out of a country that has a 1400-mile border with Russia.

FIVE REASONS WHY BIDEN MUST MOVE TO DE-ESCALATE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR NOW

Under the new ""asymmetric"" strategy, Moscow is targeting critical infrastructure to leave Ukrainians without water, electricity and heat as winter approaches. Missile and drone strikes on Kyiv’s electrical grid have left half a million homes without power. Local authorities are mulling evacuation plans should the city become unlivable.

Forty percent of the country’s energy infrastructure has been crippled, and multiple industries have incurred devastating cyber strikes. Loss of power will result in lack of water, causing sewage problems that will spread disease. In late October, Ukraine’s intelligence services uncovered Russia’s plot to blow up the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam to trigger a massive flood in southern Ukraine. Couple that with a dirty bomb in Kherson, and a large swath of the country will become an environmental disaster. The main target in this phase of war is the population, its psychological state and its will to fight.

Putin’s Health and Regime Stability

Endless rumors abound about Putin’s deteriorating physical and mental condition – anything from thyroid to pancreatic cancer, to Parkinson’s, a mysterious mental illness caused by COVID-related isolation, and more. It is impossible, even for U.S. intelligence, to assess Putin’s health with high accuracy. Putin takes extreme measures – including having his security personnel collect his excrement and urine when he travels - to safeguard information about his health. There is no credible evidence Putin has a chronic condition like cancer. Instead, Putin appears ""entirely too healthy,"" as CIA Director William Burns recently assessed.

Two weeks ago, the Russian strongman put on a three-hour performance, including a speech and Q&A, at the annual international ""Valdai"" conference hosted by Russia. Putin was lucid, forceful, confident and looked healthy. There is no credible evidence suggesting the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, his ouster or forced retirement into a sanatorium.

What the future holds

Putin is preparing for the long haul and even an all-out war, anticipating NATO intervention. Moscow has mobilized additional 318,000 men and mandated basic military training in high school. It has expanded military cooperation with Iran and North Korea to replenish its depleting weapons supply. Russia is standing up bomb shelters, training police in wartime protocols and conducting emergency evacuation drills.

The Biden administration’s solution to the Russia-Ukraine problem has been to hit Russia with more sanctions, deprive another Russian oligarch of his yacht or palace and send billions in aid to Ukraine. This is naïve and simplistic. The question of control over the post-Soviet space has been festering since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, and the balance of power in Eurasia has been contested for centuries. So victory is not around the corner, nor will it be defined by President Biden. That the Washington establishment is dragging America into yet another geopolitical experiment as Ukrainians are being slaughtered and their country ruined is irresponsible and dangerous.

2003 clip backs up Trump on Iraq War opposition,"After all the clamor for moderators to fact-check the candidates during Monday night's presidential debate, Donald Trump flipped the script on Lester Holt by rejecting his assertion Trump backed the war in Iraq - and history backs The Donald.

Holt began one question by stating that Republican nominee Trump “had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion,” a frequent claim from critics that Trump has adamantly disputed during the primary and general election seasons. Holt on Monday, and many in the media before him, pointed to a September 2002 interview Trump gave to Howard Stern in which he said “Yeah, I guess so” in response to a question about whether President Bush should go to war.

When Trump pushed back on Holt, saying “I was against the war in Iraq,” Holt countered: “The record does not show that.”

Then Trump laid out his case.

“The record shows that I’m right,” he said. “When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, I said, very lightly, ‘I don’t know, maybe, who knows?’ essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important [than going to war].”

Holt repeated that his reference was to 2002 and then tried to move the discussion along.

But Cavuto himself picked up the thread post-debate on Fox Business Network, unearthing the clip Trump referenced, from January 28, 2003 – Nearly two months before the Iraq War began on March 20. In the video, Cavuto asks Trump how much time President Bush should spend on the economy vs. on Iraq.

“Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,” Trump said. “They’re getting a little bit tired of hearing ‘We’re going in, we’re not going in.’ Whatever happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? Either do it or don’t do it.”

Trump continued: “Perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. And perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations.”

After the invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent fallout, Trump became a much stronger and far more vocal critic of the war.

“Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in,” he said in an August 2004 issue of Esquire. “I would never have handled it that way…Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he’ll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam [Hussein] didn’t have.”

Yet despite the Cavuto clip, and the ambivalence of Trump’s own on-the-fence answer during the 2002 Stern interview, post-debate fact-checkers nearly universally wrote that Trump had lied during the exchange with Holt.

"Americans' concerns about nuclear war and energy conflicts grow, new survey finds","Americans are growing more concerned over a number of threats and issues facing the country — including thermonuclear war and a rising tension among countries access to energy resources — according to a poll first obtained by Fox News Digital.

Respondents to a survey from the Reagan National Defense Forum (RNDF) expressed steady or increasing concern about a number of threats that could result in economic hardship or disparity for Americans, from thermonuclear war and terrorist attacks on the homeland to political violence and the use of surveillance to suppress human rights.

Those who took part in the questionnaire gave President Biden the lowest approval rating among the last eight U.S. presidents. Some 43% of those who were surveyed said they hold a ""very"" or ""somewhat"" favorable view of Biden, down 5% from those who said the same for former President Trump (48%) and a 17-point drop from those who said the same for former President Obama (60%).

Concerns of nuclear war and terrorist attacks are on the minds of Americans as tension increases between the U.S. and China, as well as other countries like Russia who are currently engaged in war.

AMERICANS VIEW MILITARY AS OVERLY POLITICIZED; HALF THE COUNTRY CONCERNED THE PENTAGON IS TOO 'WOKE'

The survey found 69% of respondents said they are ""extremely"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the threat of thermonuclear war within the next five years. That number is up eight percentage points from the same survey that was released in November 2021. Additionally, 29% said they are ""not very"" or ""not at all"" concerned with the threat.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the Biden administration's unwillingness to capitalize on domestic oil production have raised concerns over the past year about access to energy amid skyrocketing inflation and rising energy prices.

When asked whether they were concerned that countries will fight wars in the next 10 years over access to oil, coal and other energy resources, 81% of respondents said they were ""extremely"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the issue. Only 17% said they were ""not very"" or ""not at all"" concerned that war would arise over the issue.

The RNDF survey found 76% of respondents are ""extremely"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the threat of terrorist attacks on America, a six point drop from last year's survey that posed the same question. In a November 2018 RNDF survey, 85% of respondents expressed concern over the same threat.

Additionally, concerns about political violence in America remain steady. A majority of respondents, 85%, suggested they are ""extremely"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the rise in political divisions leading to violence in the United States. That number is unchanged from the RNDF's November 2021 survey that asked the same question.

Americans are also growing more skeptical about the use of surveillance. In lockstep with previous RNDF's polls, the new survey revealed that 80% of Americans remain concerned about the use of surveillance technology to suppress human rights. Fifteen percent said they are ""not very"" or ""not at all"" concerned with the threat.

"Biden challenges Putin to 'end the war' in Ukraine, threatens to ramp up sanctions against Russia","President Biden on Tuesday challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the war"" against Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies around the world will continue to support Ukraine and push for new sanctions on the Kremlin.

Biden delivered that warning from Warsaw, Poland, nearly a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a day after making a surprise visit to Ukraine.

""One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv,"" Biden said. ""Well, I just came from Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong. Kyiv stands proud. Kyiv stands tall. And most importantly, Kyiv stands free.""

""Putin is confronted with something today that he didn’t think was possible a year ago — the democracies around the world have grown stronger, not weaker; but the autocrats around the world have grown weaker, not stronger,"" Biden said.

""One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction; he doubts our staying power; he doubts our continued support for Ukraine; he doubts they can remain unified,"" Biden said. ""But there should be no doubt — our support for Ukraine will not waiver. NATO will not be divided and we will not tire.""

""Every day the war continues, this is his choice. He could end the war with a word,"" Biden said. ""It’s simple: If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war.""

Biden said that the United States and a ""worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations"" will continue to ensure that Ukraine stands able to defend itself.

""We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed in any country in history, and we're going to announce more sanctions this week, together with our partners, to hold accountable those who are responsible for this war.""

""This is obviously among the most consequential but also complex relationships that we have and probably the same can be said by many other countries around the world, and of course, we’re in a vigorous competition with China and that’s something we’re not at all shy about,"" Blinken told NBC host Chuck Todd during an interview aired on ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

Todd, noting how the U.S. is expanding its military presence in Guam, the Philippines and Australia, helping Japan change its national security posture and continuing to arm Taiwan, challenged Blinken, ""If it's not a Cold War, what is it?""

""We intend to compete very vigorously. We’ve taken important steps over the last couple of years to invest in ourselves so that we can compete effectively, but also to align with allies and partners around the world so that we have a shared approach to some of the challenges that China poses,"" Blinken continued in response.

On climate, on global health, on the macroeconomic situation around the world,"" he added. ""And we have a responsibility to at least try to do that. So that’s why I saw you can’t reduce this to a bumper sticker or to a label. It’s complicated. It’s consequential. And we need to manage it responsibly.""

Blinken also appeared on ABC’s ""This Week"" and CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on the heels of what’s been reported as a ""confrontational"" meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Blinken reportedly spoke directly to Wang about the ""unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law"" by China flying a high-altitude surveillance balloon across the U.S., warning that the ""irresponsibly act must never again occur.""

Blinken confirmed to ABC host Martha Raddatz that the Chinese diplomat offered no apology for the episode.

On the contrary, Wang said at the Munich Security Conference that the U.S. military shooting down the Chinese spycraft off the coast of South Carolina, after the surveillance balloon was detected above Montana and traversed the U.S., was ""absurd"" and ""hysterical,"" claiming ""Cold War mentality is back.""

""More than 40 countries have had these balloons go over their territory,"" Blinken told ABC. ""So there’s a real concern I’m hearing here from other countries, allies and partners alike, about this program.

California Gov. Newsom's latest war on oil is off to a rough start,"Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to limit oil companies' profits was met with criticism by Democrats, Republicans and experts alike at a state hearing earlier this week.

During the hearing — hosted Wednesday by the state's Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications — experts balked at a proposal to punish oil exploration and refining companies with a financial penalty if found to increase gasoline prices ""excessively."" The hearing was held to consider SBX1-2, legislation backed by Newsom and proposed by Democratic state Sen. Nancy Skinner in December.

""Enacting SBX1-2 is not in the best interests of the consumer, will not reduce retail pump prices and is not in the best long-term economic interests of California,"" said Michael Mische, a professor at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business. ""There are better alternatives.""

He added that the bill ""will only make matters worse for the California consumer"" and ""serve as a disincentive for investing in supply and new technologies for the refiners.""

CALIFORNIA'S GRID FACES COLLAPSE AS LEADERS PUSH RENEWABLES, ELECTRIC VEHICLES, EXPERTS SAY

""Enacting it will reduce supply, force out producers and reduce employment in a high-paying sector,"" Mische continued, adding that gas and energy prices would increase as a result of the bill.

In December, Newsom announced aggressive actions to punish oil companies for ""lying and gouging Californians to line their own pockets."" The comments came after he called on the state's legislature to develop legislation cracking down on excessive energy price increases, backed Skinner's legislation and called on the Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications to hold Wednesday's hearing.

In addition to Mische, Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) president and CEO Catherine Reheis-Boyd also criticized Skinner's proposed bill during the hearing.

GAVIN NEWSOM'S 2024 CHANCES COULD BE THREATENED BY CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID STRUGGLES

""Our industry is strongly opposed to Senate Bill X1-2 because it misguidedly focuses on profits, rather than the root cause of price spikes — a lack of supply,"" Reheis-Boyd said. ""The way to address prices and provide relief at the pump is to increase a reliable and safe supply.""

""As the California Energy Commission and several state Attorneys General have repeatedly acknowledged, California continues to face serious supply constraints as it relates to crude oil, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel,"" she added. ""These supply constraints, coupled with demand driven by the world’s fourth-largest economy and 35 million internal combustion engine vehicles, are the primary drivers of fuel costs in the state.""

And Democrats, including leadership, on the committee also expressed concerns with the proposal at the hearing.

""In our pursuit to address gasoline prices, we must ensure our actions that we take first [do] no harm to consumers,"" state Sen. Steve Bradford said, according to Politico.

EXPERTS BLAME GREEN ENERGY POLICIES FOR EUROPE'S FULL-SCALE ENERGY CRISIS: 'A WARNING TO THE US'

""There is clearly a belief out there among many people that oil companies were profiting off the backs of Californians,"" added state Sen. Dave Min. ""At the same time, we don’t really have a smoking gun as far as I can see, that shows intentional collusion.""

Following the hearing, Newsom said, ""Big Oil’s lobbyists again used scare tactics and refused to provide answers or solutions to last year’s price spikes"" and that ""even in a panel of experts, the oil industry’s influence was on full display.""

""What we saw from the first hearing was broad support for taking action to prevent future gas price spikes and a strong desire for long-overdue transparency measures,"" Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor told Fox News Digital.

""Even with that, Big Oil’s influence was on full display — four of the seven ‘independent’ experts who testified have taken money from the oil industry,"" he continued. ""We always knew this would be an uphill battle, and it’s one the governor is more than willing to wage.""

Over the course of the last year, California has consistently recorded the highest average gas prices of any state , even surging past $6 per gallon in both June and October, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. While pump prices have fallen considerably in the state over the last two months, at an average of $4.76 a gallon, they are still the highest in the nation, barring Hawaii.

Meanwhile, the state has continued to place restrictions on the oil and gas industry as part of its climate agenda and push to rapidly boost renewable energy supplies.

Petroleum refining capacity, which is required for production of products like gasoline and jet fuel, has fallen by more than 17% in the West Coast region that includes California since it peaked in 2010, according to federal data. Overall, domestic consumption of all fuel types has increased about 5% during that same time period.

""California consistently is the most expensive state in the nation for gasoline prices due to extensive regulations,"" Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, previously told FOX Business in an interview. ""Unfortunately, it's the reason why prices are so high. Because politicians in California have chased away investment, they've chased away oil refineries.""

""You compare it to a state like Texas where the oil industry is welcomed and regulatory burdens are much lower and, obviously, gas prices are lower,"" he said. ""You can't convince me in a solid argument that oil companies are only ‘gouging’ or profitable in California.""",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-putin-thinking-russia-ukraine-war-nine-months-after-invasion,N/A

Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview he is worried about the level of focus on social issues at the Pentagon.

""Hardly anybody joins the military to be part of the culture wars,"" he said. ""They join the military because they want to serve their country and, if necessary, defend our country in real war — not culture war.""

Miller said his ""frustration"" is with senior leadership.

""The Chinese must be laughing hysterically as our political system and as our senior officials and senior leaders in the Pentagon get caught up in it,"" Miller said. ""We’re just hurting ourselves.""

Miller told Fox News Digital the focus on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion in the U.S. military ""just takes away from combat readiness and focusing on the future.""

""I just have to think the Chinese are laughing as we basically consume ourselves in these silly political fights within our military,"" Miller said, explaining that the military is ""the neatest meritocracy in the world.""

""It is probably one of the few places in America where if you work hard and you do your job, you will be rewarded, you will receive benefits, you will get promoted if that’s what you want,"" Miller added. ""And, you know, it has absolutely nothing to do with race, creed, color, sexual orientation — any of that. It all comes down to combat effectiveness. And that’s what people in the field really, really care about.

""I know they get frustrated having their leaders drag them into these woke issues,"" Miller added. ""And I think most of them don't even know what that means. They just want to do their jobs.""

Miller details how ""wokeness"" has infected the Pentagon in his new book, ""Soldier Secretary: Warnings from the Battlefield & the Pentagon about America’s Most Dangerous Enemies,"" which is set to hit stores Feb. 7.

Prior to serving as acting defense secretary, Miller served as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which oversees policies to protect the nation from terrorist attacks. He is also a former Special Forces commander and Green Beret.

Miller's book focuses on his military career, includes stories of missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and gives an inside look at the ""tumultuous final days"" of the Trump administration.

When asked what he thinks the greatest threat facing the United States is, Miller quipped, ""I think its lack of imagination to tell you the truth.""

Miller said he's worried that Pentagon leadership only focuses on ""one thing at a time."" He warned that by focusing on just one threat, the U.S. military is ""playing right into the hands of our enemies.""

SERVICE MEMBERS SOUND ALARM AGAINST 'EXTREMELY WOKE' MILITARY

""We defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War by outspending them. We were more technologically sophisticated, and they just couldn’t keep up with us,"" he explained. ""And my concern right now is we have the Chinese almost doing the same thing every time.

""They have hypersonic weapons, all of these extremely exquisite weapons systems, and we are constantly trying to defend against those.

""What I’m worried about, really, is this thinking in the Pentagon where all we’re going to do is fight the Cold War again. We can’t do that,"" he said. ""We can’t afford to do that, and I think that’s what the enemy — our opponents — want us to do. They want us to spend ourselves into bankruptcy.

""I just want more creative thought on how we do things, and there are people at the Pentagon that can do that. They are really smart and creative.""

""I thought we lived in a world that had said no to that kind of activity. And I hope diplomacy will win.""

""But it could have a profound negative impact on the climate obviously. You have a war and obviously you’re going to have massive emissions consequences to the war. But equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose certainly big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know, I think hopefully President Putin would realize that in the northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.""

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk,"" he added. ""And the people of Russia are at risk. And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry, who has faced criticism for his own impact on climate change, made similar comments Sunday when he told GZERO Media’s Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what’s necessary"" to curb emissions, and it will be ""very tough for the climate agenda, there’s no question about it.""

Kerry's made the comments days before Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since World War II.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

The Democratic Socialist said the fight against climate change is war and that it’s “our World War II.”

While a steady stream of international reports have raised alarm about climate change, they stop markedly short of predicting the end of the world.

Rep. McCaul on Air Force general’s prediction of 2025 war with China: 'I hope he’s wrong … I think he’s right',"Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, weighed in on the prediction from four-star Air Force Gen. Mike Minihan, who warned his commanders to prepare for war with China in roughly two years' time.

Minihan predicted that fighting will come after China takes advantage of the U.S. being preoccupied with the 2024 election to take action against Taiwan, which will be focused on their elections next year as well.

""I hope he's wrong,"" McCaul told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream. ""I think he's right though, unfortunately.""

McCaul explained that China very much wants ""reunification"" of Taiwan with mainland China. He said that could come about through influencing the Taiwanese elections in early 2024.

""But if they don't win in that one they are going to look at a military invasion, in my judgment. We have to be prepared for this.""

McCaul said ""as long as Biden is in office projecting weakness,"" there are ""very high"" odds of this happening. He cited the Biden administration's failure with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he said led to Russia invading Ukraine.

Later in the program, House Armed Services Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., disagreed with McCaul and Minihan's assessment of possible war with China.

US leads the rest of the world with $196 billion given to Ukraine amid war with Russia,"The United States continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in promised or sent aid, as the U.S. ally continues its fight against Russia.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

These figures do not include loans sent to Ukraine or additional contributions that were approved by their respective governments between Dec. 2022 and Feb. 2023.

MATT GAETZ RIPS ‘BIPARTISAN COALITION’ THAT FAVORS WAR IN UKRAINE

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited each of these top contributing countries, except Estonia.

The growing figures come as the Ukraine-Russia war nears its one-year mark. Russia first invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

""How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?"" asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. ""Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which redline we set will we not later cross?""

The proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations.

The ""Ukraine Fatigue Resolution"" has at least 10 co-sponsors and calls for the U.S. to ""end its military and financial aid to Ukraine and urges all combatants to reach a peace agreement.""

The resolution notes the U.S. has been the top contributor to the Ukrainian war effort, providing financial, military, and humanitarian aid to the U.S. ally.

BIDEN SAYS PUTIN HAS ‘ALREADY LOST UKRAINE’

In January, President Biden approved additional security assistance, including 31 Abrams M1 tanks to Ukraine. On top of that, reports suggest another $2 billion could be in the pipeline.

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" Biden said last month.

Gaetz’s resolution claims the U.S. is inadvertently contributing to civilian casualties by providing weapons and potentially prolonging what he called an ""everlasting conflict.""

""America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,"" said Gaetz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ""We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately.""

US State Department hints at 'consequences' if China provides lethal aid to Russia for Ukraine war,"U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday warned there would be ""consequences"" if China were to provide lethal aid to Russia in its war against Ukraine, but when pressed on just what those consequences might be, he was more ambiguous.

Wednesday’s comments came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met with China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Munich over the weekend, said the U.S. has evidence China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.

Price clarified that the U.S. has not seen concrete evidence of direct support, but added ""we don’t believe they’ve taken it off the table, either.""

Price said China’s providing of lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine ""would cause real consequences in our bilateral relationship.""

PUTIN SAYS CHINA HAS ‘AGREED’ ON PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITING MOSCOW

""The [People’s Republic of China] understands what’s at risk were it to proceed with providing material support to Russia’s war against Ukraine,"" he said. ""We’ve been clear we will not hesitate to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions, and we’re monitoring very vigilantly for potential violations.""

Price predicted that China would suffer ""reputational costs"" if it were to follow through with providing Russia with lethal aid.

""Already, it is providing diplomatic support. It is providing economic support. It is … spewing propaganda that serves to amplify the lies, the distortions, the myths, the half-truths that are emanating from Moscow,"" he said.

Later in the press conference, a reporter questioned what possible leverage the U.S. has as a deterrent if China sides with Russia.

Price said there was ""an advantage to some degree of ambiguity.""

""We have been clear with the PRC about the fact that consequences would befall them if they were to provide lethal assistance, but we think it’s most effective if we leave that ambiguous and we continue to warn consistently of those consequences,"" Price said.

Experts have argued that the Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing its suspicions that China was considering providing Russia with lethal aid.

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation — including China — will see severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war against Ukraine.

Chilling World War III 'wargames' show US forces crushed by Russia and China,"Scary World War III ‘wargames’ show U.S. forces crushed by Russia and China in certain hot spots around the globe.

Research organization RAND has run dozens of wargames simulating major conflict scenarios in what it describes as Russia and China’s “backyards.” The wargames suggest that the U.S. forces in those locations would get attacked by a vast array of both conventional and cyber weapons.

RAND Senior Defense Analyst David Ochmanek discussed the simulations at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) in Washington D.C. last week. “In our games, where we fight China or Russia … blue gets its a** handed to it, not to put too fine a point on it,” he said, during a panel discussion. Blue denotes U.S. forces in the simulations.

AIR FORCE BUILDS NEW DEEP STRIKE 'SPY NETWORK' FOR AIR ATTACK

“We lost a lot of people, we lose a lot of equipment, we usually fail to achieve our objectives of preventing aggression by the adversary,” Ochmanek added during the CNAS discussion.

Based on the wargames, a clash with Russia in the Baltic states would result in the rapid defeat of U.S. forces and their allies, Ochmanek told Fox News. “Within 48 to 72 hours, Russian forces are able to reach a capital of a Baltic state,” he said. On the other side of the world, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, while a massive military gamble for China, would also pose a huge challenge for U.S. forces in the area, according to Ochmanek.

Russia and China have amassed large inventories of precision-guided cruise missiles and ballistic missiles that can reach hundreds of miles and strike military targets, the researcher said. Set against this backdrop, U.S. military outposts and aircraft carriers in the contested regions could face a potential devastating barrage of missiles.

ABRAMS TANK SET FOR 'LETHALITY' UPGRADE

In RAND’s wargames and analysis, Russia, and particularly China, unleash so many missiles that they overcome U.S. defenses. “They send salvos that are so great that we cannot intercept all the missiles,” Ochmanek said.

The researcher notes that the key “domains of warfare” are contested from the start of hostilities. The U.S., he explains, should not assume air and maritime superiority over the battlespace. American space assets could also face attacks, while U.S. command and control systems could be targeted by electromagnetic and cyber weapons.

To combat these threats, U.S. forces could ramp up their deployment of so-called ‘standoff’ missiles that can be fired from large distances, such as cruise missiles, according to Ochmanek, along with highly robust reconnaissance systems and jam-resistant communications.

AIR FORCE FAST-TRACKS NEW NUCLEAR MISSILES

“For a sustained investment of an additional $8 billion a year between 2020 and 2030, the U.S. Air Force could buy the kit needed to make a difference,” he said, noting that similar sums would be required for the Army and Navy.

President Trump’s fiscal 2020 budget plan proposes $750 billion for defense, up 5 percent from fiscal 2019.

America’s posture is also key when it comes to challenging potential adversaries such as Russia, according to Ochmanek. “It’s putting more combat power back into Europe, and putting it on Europe’s eastern flank,” he said.

NAVY PLANS 'BLUE FORCE' OPEN WATER WEAPONS STRATEGY FOR NEW FRIGATE

The U.S. National Defense Strategy, which was released by the DoD last year, cites the restoration of “America’s competitive edge by blocking global rivals Russia and China from challenging the U.S. and our allies,” as one its key goals.

“Long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase in the future,” the strategy explains.

Treasure hunter claims FBI is covering up discovery of Civil War-era gold worth millions: 'Double-crossed',"The FBI is covering up a trove of Civil War-era gold the agency dug up in Pennsylvania, one treasure hunter claimed – and he's determined to expose the alleged truth.

""We feel we were double-crossed and lied to,"" said Dennis Parada, co-owner of Finders Keepers.

The FBI had searched a remote area in Dents Run in 2018 for a cache of gold worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but the agency said it did not find anything. The area is allegedly where an 1863 shipment of Union gold disappeared on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.

Parada sued the Justice Department last year to force the FBI to release records on the search of the excavation site, and a judge ruled in favor of the agency.

TREASURE HUNTER FINDS BURIED KEYS TO NEW CAR. COULD YOU SOLVE THE RIDDLE THAT LED HIM TO THEM?

After reviewing the newly released documents, Parada said the FBI is distorting key evidence and improperly withholding records in an apparent effort to conceal the recovery of the historic gold cache.

TREASURE HUNTER WHO REFUSED TO DISCLOSE LOCATION OF SHIPWRECK’S 500 COINS MARKS 6TH YEAR IN JAIL

""The truth will come out,"" said Parada, who's looking to earn a finder’s fee from the potential discovery.

A federal judge overseeing the case will decide if the FBI must release its operational plan for the gold dig and other records it wants to keep secret. The judge could also order the FBI to keep looking for additional materials to turn over to the treasure hunter.

Fox News Digital reached out to the FBI Sunday morning about Parada’s claims of a coverup, but did not immediately receive a response. The FBI declined comment to The Associated Press.

The FBI confirmed last year that the agency had searched the area for gold, but did not recover anything, adding that it ""continues to unequivocally reject any claims or speculation to the contrary.""

TREASURE HUNTER DIGS UP $40K RING, FINDS ORIGINAL OWNERS: ‘I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT’

Parada and his consultant, Warren Getler, suspect the FBI conducted a late-night dig of the area and found the gold in 2018.

""We have compelling evidence a night dig took place, and that the FBI went to some large effort to cover up that night dig,"" said Getler, co-author of ""Rebel Gold,"" a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.

Parada and his son, Kem Parada, had searched for the gold for years, eventually finding a remote woodland area that contained a large quantity of metal. The duo's work eventually led the FBI to obtain a warrant to search the area in March 2018, which was documented by a videographer.

GIRL, 9 YEARS OLD, DISCOVERS RARE PREHISTORIC MEGALODON TOOTH IN MARYLAND WATERS: 'I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT'

Parada suspects that between the first and second days of the court-authorized excavation, the agency found the historic gold during a clandestine, overnight dig. Residents previously reported hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight – when the dig was supposed to have been paused – and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles, including large armored trucks.

The FBI has denied it conducted an overnight dig.

"US still making payments to relatives of Civil War veterans, analysis finds","If history is any judge, the U.S. government will be paying for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for the next century as service members and their families grapple with the sacrifices of combat.

An Associated Press analysis of federal payment records found that the government is still making monthly payments to relatives of Civil War veterans — 148 years after the conflict ended.

At the 10 year anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, more than $40 billion a year are going to compensate veterans and survivors from the Spanish-American War from 1898, World War I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the two Iraq campaigns and the Afghanistan conflict. And those costs are rising rapidly.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray said such expenses should remind the nation about war's long-lasting financial toll.

""When we decide to go to war, we have to consciously be also thinking about the cost,"" said Murray, D-Wash., adding that her WWII-veteran father's disability benefits helped feed their family.

Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator and veteran who co-chaired President Barack Obama's deficit committee in 2010, said government leaders working to limit the national debt should make sure that survivors of veterans need the money they are receiving.

""Without question, I would affluence-test all of those people,"" Simpson said.

With greater numbers of troops surviving combat injuries because of improvements in battlefield medicine and technology, the costs of disability payments are set to rise much higher.

The AP identified the disability and survivor benefits during an analysis of millions of federal payment records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.

To gauge the post-war costs of each conflict, AP looked at four compensation programs that identify recipients by war: disabled veterans; survivors of those who died on active duty or from a service-related disability; low-income wartime vets over age 65 or disabled; and low-income survivors of wartime veterans or their disabled children.

—The Iraq wars and Afghanistan

So far, the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the first Persian Gulf conflict in the early 1990s are costing about $12 billion a year to compensate those who have left military service or family members of those who have died.

Those post-service compensation costs have totaled more than $50 billion since 2003, not including expenses of medical care and other benefits provided to veterans, and are poised to grow for many years to come.

The new veterans are filing for disabilities at historic rates, with about 45 percent of those from Iraq and Afghanistan seeking compensation for injuries. Many are seeking compensation for a variety of ailments at once.

Experts see a variety of factors driving that surge, including a bad economy that's led more jobless veterans to seek the financial benefits they've earned, troops who survive wounds of war and more awareness about head trauma and mental health.

—Vietnam War

It's been 40 years since the U.S. ended its involvement in the Vietnam War, and yet payments for the conflict are still rising.

Now above $22 billion annually, Vietnam compensation costs are roughly twice the size of the FBI's annual budget. And while many disabled Vietnam vets have been compensated for post-traumatic stress disorder, hearing loss or general wounds, other ailments are positioning the war to have large costs even after veterans die.

Based on an uncertain link to the defoliant Agent Orange that was used in Vietnam, federal officials approved diabetes a decade ago as an ailment that qualifies for cash compensation — and it is now the most compensated ailment for Vietnam vets.

The VA also recently included heart disease among the Vietnam medical issues that qualify, and the agency is seeing thousands of new claims for that issue. Simpson said he has a lot of concerns about the government agreeing to automatically compensate for those diseases.

""That has been terribly abused,"" Simpson said.

Since heart disease is common among older Americans and is the nation's leading cause of death, the future deaths of thousands of Vietnam veterans could be linked to their service and their benefits passed along to survivors.

A congressional analysis estimated the cost of fighting the war was $738 billion in 2011 dollars, and the post-war benefits for veterans and families have separately cost some $270 billion since 1970, according to AP calculations.

—World War I, World War II and the Korean War

World War I, which ended 94 years ago, continues to cost taxpayers about $20 million every year. World War II? $5 billion.

Compensation for WWII veterans and families didn't peak until 1991 — 46 years after the war ended — and annual costs since then have only declined by about 25 percent. Korean War costs appear to be leveling off at about $2.8 billion per year.

Of the 2,289 survivors drawing cash linked to WWI, about one-third are spouses and dozens of them are over 100 years in age.

Some of the other recipients are curious: Forty-seven of the spouses are under the age of 80, meaning they weren't born until years after the war ended. Many of those women were in their 20s and 30s when their aging spouses died in the 1960s and 1970s, and they've been drawing the monthly payments since.

—Civil War and Spanish-American War

There are 10 living recipients of benefits tied to the 1898 Spanish-American War at a total cost of about $50,000 per year. The Civil War payments are going to two children of veterans — one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee— each for $876 per year.

Surviving spouses can qualify for lifetime benefits when troops from current wars have a service-linked death. Children under the age of 18 can also qualify, and those benefits are extended for a lifetime if the person is permanently incapable of self-support due to a disability before the age of 18.

Citing privacy, officials did not disclose the names of the two children getting the Civil War benefits.

Their ages suggest the one in Tennessee was born around 1920 and the North Carolina survivor was born around 1930. A veteran who was young during the Civil War would likely have been roughly 70 or 80 years old when the two people were born.

That's not unheard of. At age 86, Juanita Tudor Lowrey is the daughter of a Civil War veteran. Her father, Hugh Tudor, fought in the Union army. After his first wife died, Tudor was 73 when he remarried her 33-year-old mother in 1920. Lowrey was born in 1926.

Lowrey, who lives in Kearney, Mo., suspects the marriage might have been one of convenience, with her father looking for a housekeeper and her mother looking for some security. He died a couple years after she was born, and Lowrey received pension benefits until she was 18.

Now, Lowrey said, she usually gets skepticism from people after she tells them she's a daughter of a Civil War veteran.

California officials told residents over the summer that they should conserve electricity and warned that they could face blackouts due to extreme heat stressing the power grid. Democrats blamed climate change for the intense heat, but critics like The Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board pointed to liberal policies shifting energy reliance away from fossil fuels and toward less reliable renewable sources.

WEST VIRGINIA COAL MINERS RESCUE COUPLE STRANDED IN BROKEN-DOWN ELECTRIC CAR: ‘YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS STUFF UP'

Biden, meanwhile, at a November campaign event said coal plants were too expensive and that his administration would be ""shutting these plants down all across America"" to shift toward renewable energy. Since 2009, when Biden became vice president, the United States went from nearly 600 plants to 269 in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration, an almost 55% drop.

Power outages are ""likely to occur if we continue down this path of shutting down these plants,"" Hamilton said.

Coal is used to generate nearly 22% of the nation's power in 2021, while all fossil fuels account for about 61%, according to the EIA. Meanwhile, less than a quarter of U.S. electricity relied on renewable energy sources.

The White House's rush toward green energy has put the ""electric grid and the reliability of household and industrial power at such risks,"" Hamilton said. ""We're going into the winter months now and our fleet of renewable, intermittent windmills and solar panels are not going to be able to pick up the load.""

Since taking office, Biden has pledged to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and has pushed a climate agenda that moves the nation toward green energy and away from fossil fuels. The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has enacted rules to limit pollutants, created stricter requirements for waste disposal and tightened air quality standards for coal-fired power plants, making the business more difficult to maintain.

""This president and members of Congress have received warning after warning that they're closing too many coal plants and with coal plants goes your base load generation,"" Hamilton told Fox News. ""There's a natural gravitation towards green energy, but it's going to take decades.""

Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, in a memo to all air wing commanders and other Air Force operational commanders said, ""I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me [we] will fight in 2025.""

Minihan said he believes war with China is imminent in the next two years due to the upcoming 2024 elections in the U.S. and Taiwan, which he claimed will ""distract"" Washington and Taipei and enable China to make a move on the island.

The general said a ""a fortified, ready, integrated, and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain"" needs to be established to prepare for the looming fight.

Minihan directed his Air Force commanders to report back by Feb. 28 on steps they will take to prepare for the war against China.

He also said all personnel should ensure their records and emergency contact information are up-to-date and to ""consider their personal affairs and whether a visit should be scheduled with their servicing base legal office to ensure they are legally ready and prepared.""

The general reportedly urged his fighting forces to ""run deliberately, not recklessly,"" but said they need to accept some risk in training.

"AP IMPACT: After 40 years, $1 trillion, US War on Drugs has failed to meet any of its goals","MEXICO CITY (AP) — After 40 years, the United States' war on drugs has cost $1 trillion and hundreds of thousands of lives, and for what? Drug use is rampant and violence even more brutal and widespread.

Even U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske concedes the strategy hasn't worked.

""In the grand scheme, it has not been successful,"" Kerlikowske told The Associated Press. ""Forty years later, the concern about drugs and drug problems is, if anything, magnified, intensified.""

This week President Obama promised to ""reduce drug use and the great damage it causes"" with a new national policy that he said treats drug use more as a public health issue and focuses on prevention and treatment.

Nevertheless, his administration has increased spending on interdiction and law enforcement to record levels both in dollars and in percentage terms; this year, they account for $10 billion of his $15.5 billion drug-control budget.

Kerlikowske, who coordinates all federal anti-drug policies, says it will take time for the spending to match the rhetoric.

""Nothing happens overnight,"" he said. ""We've never worked the drug problem holistically. We'll arrest the drug dealer, but we leave the addiction.""

His predecessor, John P. Walters, takes issue with that.

Walters insists society would be far worse today if there had been no War on Drugs. Drug abuse peaked nationally in 1979 and, despite fluctuations, remains below those levels, he says. Judging the drug war is complicated: Records indicate marijuana and prescription drug abuse are climbing, while cocaine use is way down. Seizures are up, but so is availability.

""To say that all the things that have been done in the war on drugs haven't made any difference is ridiculous,"" Walters said. ""It destroys everything we've done. It's saying all the people involved in law enforcment, treatment and prevention have been wasting their time. It's saying all these people's work is misguided.""

In 1970, hippies were smoking pot and dropping acid. Soldiers were coming home from Vietnam hooked on heroin. Embattled President Richard M. Nixon seized on a new war he thought he could win.

""This nation faces a major crisis in terms of the increasing use of drugs, particularly among our young people,"" Nixon said as he signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act. The following year, he said: ""Public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.""

His first drug-fighting budget was $100 million. Now it's $15.1 billion, 31 times Nixon's amount even when adjusted for inflation.

Using Freedom of Information Act requests, archival records, federal budgets and dozens of interviews with leaders and analysts, the AP tracked where that money went, and found that the United States repeatedly increased budgets for programs that did little to stop the flow of drugs. In 40 years, taxpayers spent more than:

— $20 billion to fight the drug gangs in their home countries. In Colombia, for example, the United States spent more than $6 billion, while coca cultivation increased and trafficking moved to Mexico — and the violence along with it.

— $33 billion in marketing ""Just Say No""-style messages to America's youth and other prevention programs. High school students report the same rates of illegal drug use as they did in 1970, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says drug overdoses have ""risen steadily"" since the early 1970s to more than 20,000 last year.

— $49 billion for law enforcement along America's borders to cut off the flow of illegal drugs. This year, 25 million Americans will snort, swallow, inject and smoke illicit drugs, about 10 million more than in 1970, with the bulk of those drugs imported from Mexico.

— $121 billion to arrest more than 37 million nonviolent drug offenders, about 10 million of them for possession of marijuana. Studies show that jail time tends to increase drug abuse.

— $450 billion to lock those people up in federal prisons alone. Last year, half of all federal prisoners in the U.S. were serving sentences for drug offenses.

At the same time, drug abuse is costing the nation in other ways. The Justice Department estimates the consequences of drug abuse — ""an overburdened justice system, a strained health care system, lost productivity, and environmental destruction"" — cost the United States $215 billion a year.

Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miron says the only sure thing taxpayers get for more spending on police and soldiers is more homicides.

""Current policy is not having an effect of reducing drug use,"" Miron said, ""but it's costing the public a fortune.""

___

From the beginning, lawmakers debated fiercely whether law enforcement — no matter how well funded and well trained — could ever defeat the drug problem.

Then-Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel, who had his doubts, has since watched his worst fears come to pass.

""Look what happened. It's an ongoing tragedy that has cost us a trillion dollars. It has loaded our jails and it has destabilized countries like Mexico and Colombia,"" he said.

In 1970, proponents said beefed-up law enforcement could effectively seal the southern U.S. border and stop drugs from coming in. Since then, the U.S. used patrols, checkpoints, sniffer dogs, cameras, motion detectors, heat sensors, drone aircraft — and even put up more than 1,000 miles of steel beam, concrete walls and heavy mesh stretching from California to Texas.

None of that has stopped the drugs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy says about 330 tons of cocaine, 20 tons of heroin and 110 tons of methamphetamine are sold in the United States every year — almost all of it brought in across the borders. Even more marijuana is sold, but it's hard to know how much of that is grown domestically, including vast fields run by Mexican drug cartels in U.S. national parks.

The dealers who are caught have overwhelmed justice systems in the United States and elsewhere. U.S. prosecutors declined to file charges in 7,482 drug cases last year, most because they simply didn't have the time. That's about one out of every four drug cases.

The United States has in recent years rounded up thousands of suspected associates of Mexican drug gangs, then turned some of the cases over to local prosecutors who can't make the charges stick for lack of evidence. The suspects are then sometimes released, deported or acquitted. The U.S. Justice Department doesn't even keep track of what happens to all of them.

In Mexico, traffickers exploit a broken justice system. Investigators often fail to collect convincing evidence — and are sometimes assassinated when they do. Confessions are beaten out of suspects by frustrated, underpaid police. Judges who no longer turn a blind eye to such abuse release the suspects in exasperation.

In prison, in the U.S. or Mexico, traffickers continue to operate, ordering assassinations and arranging distribution of their product even from solitary confinement in Texas and California. In Mexico, prisoners can sometimes even buy their way out.

The violence spans Mexico. In Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of drug violence in Mexico, 2,600 people were killed last year in cartel-related violence, making the city of 1 million across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, one of the world's deadliest. Not a single person was prosecuted for homicide related to organized crime.

And then there's the money.

The $320 billion annual global drug industry now accounts for 1 percent of all commerce on the planet.

A full 10 percent of Mexico's economy is built on drug proceeds — $25 billion smuggled in from the United States every year, of which 25 cents of each $100 smuggled is seized at the border. Thus there's no incentive for the kind of financial reform that could tame the cartels.

""For every drug dealer you put in jail or kill, there's a line up to replace him because the money is just so good,"" says Walter McCay, who heads the nonprofit Center for Professional Police Certification in Mexico City.

McCay is one of the 13,000 members of Medford, Mass.-based Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, a group of cops, judges, prosecutors, prison wardens and others who want to legalize and regulate all drugs.

A decade ago, no politician who wanted to keep his job would breathe a word about legalization, but a consensus is growing across the country that at least marijuana will someday be regulated and sold like tobacco and alcohol.

California voters decide in November whether to legalize marijuana, and South Dakota will vote this fall on whether to allow medical uses of marijuana, already permitted in California and 13 other states. The Obama administration says it won't target marijuana dispensaries if they comply with state laws.

___

Mexican President Felipe Calderon says if America wants to fix the drug problem, it needs to do something about Americans' unquenching thirst for illegal drugs.

Kerlikowske agrees, and Obama has committed to doing just that.

And yet both countries continue to spend the bulk of their drug budgets on law enforcement rather than treatment and prevention.

""President Obama's newly released drug war budget is essentially the same as Bush's, with roughly twice as much money going to the criminal justice system as to treatment and prevention,"" said Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance. ""This despite Obama's statements on the campaign trail that drug use should be treated as a health issue, not a criminal justice issue.""

Obama is requesting a record $15.5 billion for the drug war for 2011, about two thirds of it for law enforcement at the front lines of the battle: police, military and border patrol agents struggling to seize drugs and arrest traffickers and users.

About $5.6 billion would be spent on prevention and treatment.

""For the first time ever, the nation has before it an administration that views the drug issue first and foremost through the lens of the public health mandate,"" said economist and drug policy expert John Carnevale, who served three administrations and four drug czars. ""Yet ... it appears that this historic policy stride has some problems with its supporting budget.""

Carnevale said the administration continues to substantially over-allocate funds to areas that research shows are least effective — interdiction and source-country programs — while under-allocating funds for treatment and prevention.

Kerlikowske, who wishes people would stop calling it a ""war"" on drugs, frequently talks about one of the most valuable tools they've found, in which doctors screen for drug abuse during routine medical examinations. That program would get a mere $7.2 million under Obama's budget.

""People will say that's not enough. They'll say the drug budget hasn't shifted as much as it should have, and granted I don't disagree with that,"" Kerlikowske said. ""We would like to do more in that direction.""

Fifteen years ago, when the government began telling doctors to ask their patients about their drug use during routine medical exams, it described the program as one of the most proven ways to intervene early with would-be addicts.

""Nothing happens overnight,"" Kerlikowske said.

___

Until 100 years ago, drugs were simply a commodity. Then Western cultural shifts made them immoral and deviant, according to London School of Economics professor Fernanda Mena.

Religious movements led the crusades against drugs: In 1904, an Episcopal bishop returning from a mission in the Far East argued for banning opium after observing ""the natives' moral degeneration."" In 1914, The New York Times reported that cocaine caused blacks to commit ""violent crimes,"" and that it made them resistant to police bullets. In the decades that followed, Mena said, drugs became synonymous with evil.

Nixon drew on those emotions when he pressed for his War on Drugs.

""Narcotics addiction is a problem which afflicts both the body and the soul of America,"" he said in a special 1971 message to Congress. ""It comes quietly into homes and destroys children, it moves into neighborhoods and breaks the fiber of community which makes neighbors. We must try to better understand the confusion and disillusion and despair that bring people, particularly young people, to the use of narcotics and dangerous drugs.""

Just a few years later, a young Barack Obama was one of those young users, a teenager smoking pot and trying ""a little blow when you could afford it,"" as he wrote in ""Dreams From My Father."" When asked during his campaign if he had inhaled the pot, he replied: ""That was the point.""

So why persist with costly programs that don't work?

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, sitting down with the AP at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, paused for a moment at the question.

""Look,"" she says, starting slowly. ""This is something that is worth fighting for because drug addiction is about fighting for somebody's life, a young child's life, a teenager's life, their ability to be a successful and productive adult.

""If you think about it in those terms, that they are fighting for lives — and in Mexico they are literally fighting for lives as well from the violence standpoint — you realize the stakes are too high to let go.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-state-department-hints-consequences-china-provides-lethal-aid-russia-ukraine-war,N/A
Children take center stage in UN meeting on Russia’s war in Ukraine: ‘World gone mad’,"Children in crisis amid Russia’s war in Ukraine took center stage during a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday as UN members cited numerous staggering statics and once again called on Moscow to end the war.

World leaders condemned Russia’s deadly invasion and the effects it has had on global food shortages, the spike in internationally displaced people and the energy crisis it has helped plunge the world into.

""Last Thursday, the UN released its global humanitarian overview for 2023 which set another record with 339 million people in need of assistance and a price tag of $51 billion,"" U.S. Ambassador Lisa Carty said Tuesday. ""Russia's aggression triggered one of the largest refugee and displacement crises since World War Two.""

UKRAINE SAYS 60 OF 70 RUSSIAN MISSILES STRUCK DOWN AMID BARRAGE OF STRIKES

""President Putin has focused his ire and fire on Ukraine's civilian population,"" she continued noting Moscow’s constant attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.

""These consequences are horrific and cause needless suffering,"" she added. ""Children cannot attend school and doctors cannot treat the sick.""

Two-thirds of all children have been displaced, 2,500 schools destroyed or damaged, and 5 million children are unable to attend school, officials detailed.

But aside from the devastation, Russia’s war has caused to Ukraine’s infrastructure, UN officials also pointed to the psychological effect it has taken on Ukraine’s youngest generations.

""1.5 million children are at risk of suffering from depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions which require mental health interventions,"" the ambassador to Mexico said.

Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said some 765,000 children have received psychosocial support to help them cope with the effects of the war.

""I don't apologize for the stream of really terrifying statistics,"" Griffiths said. ""Since February, 1,148 children have been killed or injured, while millions have fled, uprooted from their homes, separated from their families, or put at risk of violence.""

World leaders also said they were concerned by sexual and gender-based violence, as well as human trafficking that children have fallen victim to.



PUTIN HOLDS COUNCIL MEETING ON DOMESTIC SECURITY FOLLOWING 3 AIRBASE 'EXPLOSIONS'

""Thousands of Ukrainian children have reportedly been transferred to Russia for adoption and neutralization through simplified and accelerated procedures without consent from their parents or legal guardians,"" the delegate to Norway said.

""The statistics we have heard from the UN today are shocking,"" UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward added. ""The trauma inflicted by Russia will last for generations.""

The delegate for Ireland echoed these sentiments and said Ukrainian children have been ""robbed of their childhoods"" and their ""right to education denied.""

Russia rejected the international condemnation it once again faced Tuesday and suggested its troops were targeting civilian areas because Ukraine had erected air defense systems in those areas.

Roughly 40 percent of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed and is contributing to the nearly 18 million in Ukraine who are in need of humanitarian assistance, including the nearly 7 million who have been internally displaced.

Officials on Tuesday warned that the repercussions of Russia’s war would affect not only generations to come in Ukraine but across the globe.

""Humanitarian needs are accelerating, and this is especially true for winter,"" the Under Secretary-General warned. ""But I place that within that larger context of a world gone mad, which sees 1 in 23 people in need of humanitarian assistance around the globe.

China releases 12-point peace plan for Russia-Ukraine war,"The People's Republic of China has called for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, releasing a 12-point ""peace plan"" on the one-year anniversary of the invasion.

China's position paper calls for an immediate end of violence in Ukraine and a return to dialogues with the aim of ending the conflict through diplomacy.

""All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiraling out of control,"" the peace plan states. ""All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire.""

CHINA TIGHTENS TIES WITH RUSSIA, CLAIMING BOTH PROMOTE 'WORLD PEACE' DESPITE UKRAINE WAR

China's plan for peace, outlined in 12 points, consists of the following: Respecting the sovereignty of all countries; Abandoning the Cold War mentality; Ceasing hostilities; Resuming peace talks; Resolving the humanitarian crisis; Protecting civilians and prisoners of war; Keeping nuclear power plants safe; Reducing strategic risks; Facilitating grain exports; Stopping unilateral sanctions; Keeping industrial and supply chains stable; Promoting post-conflict reconstruction.

A key complaint of the position paper is the increasing influence of military blocs across the globe, which China asserts pits nations against each other — China has historically expressed contempt for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

""The security of a country should not be pursued at the expense of others. The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs,"" the paper stated. ""The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly. There is no simple solution to a complex issue.""

China promised to play a ""constructive role"" in peace negotiations.

China spy balloon shows country is preparing citizens for war that could come at ‘any time’: expert,"A Chinese spy balloon flying over U.S. airspace in Montana signals that the country is preparing its citizens for war, an expert on U.S. and China relations told Fox News Digital.

""We know what the Chinese are doing,"" Chang explained. ""They’re engaged in the fastest military buildup since the Second World War. They’re trying to sanctions-proof their regime, and most ominously they’re preparing China’s civilians for war.""

Chang pointed to a recent move from Chinese President Xi Jinping shortly after he was appointed to his precedent breaking third term as General Secretary at the National Congress in October, when he appointed what is being referred to as the ""war cabinet.""

Chang continued, ""The Chinese have engaged in a number of activities that violate our sovereignty, and some of those activities constitute acts of war, and we did not respond. And it's not just not responding in February 2023, it's not responding over the course of decades. So, of course, the Chinese have this mentality right now.

"European officials say US profiting from Ukraine war, call Inflation Reduction Act 'very worrying'","Top European officials have attacked President Biden's actions amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and have even questioned whether the United States remains an ally as gas prices soar and U.S. green energy policies have put Europeans into ""full-blown panic mode,"" according to a report.

Russia and Ukraine, together considered the breadbasket of the world, accounted for nearly 30% of global wheat exports before the war, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute. But Russia has attacked Ukraine’s ports and has formed a blockade against it in the Black Sea.

""The war in Ukraine has destabilized the world as it relates to food,"" Segar said. ""It is not just a war against Ukraine. It is a war against humanity.""

""Many countries are suffering, and millions of people are going to suffer even more because of this war,"" he added.

The World Food Programme, a branch of the United Nations, serves about 140 million people, according to Segar. But he said the group is having to cut food rations.

""Imagine telling your child that they're going to go from two meals a day down to one,"" Segar told Fox News.

Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, there were looming food shortages.

""The global economy coming into this was already a bit of a stressed situation because of COVID and the impact of the past couple of years on shipping and on production,"" World Food Programme’s deputy director of emergencies, Brian Lander, told Fox News.

The number of severely food insecure people has doubled to 135 million since the pandemic began, according to the World Food Programme. More than 800 million people face chronic hunger.

""Pre-COVID years, we talked about famine, but it was relatively rare,"" Segar said. ""Today, we have this domino effect of climate and COVID and cost and conflict, and they're all beating up on each other.""

""COVID really knocked down the supply chain,"" Segar added. ""That had dramatic consequences on communities that are really hungry.""

He also said that during lockdowns – and in countries where lockdowns are still in place – farmers couldn’t bring their food to market.

Meanwhile, some countries are facing abnormally severe droughts, according to Segar. That ""basically makes it impossible for them to harvest and to keep livestock alive,"" he said.

East Africa, for example, is facing its worst drought in decades, and up to 20 million people risk severe hunger, the BBC reported in May.

ZELENSKYY'S GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS PREDICTION MAY BE 10 WEEKS AWAY, UN OFFICIAL SAYS: 'SEISMIC'

Effectively, the Ukraine war tightened an already short supply, which has helped increase the food costs – along with global inflation, according to Segar.

""Costs are going up … so that food is becoming less affordable for people here in the United States, but in particular, people who are about to enter the phase of starvation around the world,"" Segar told Fox News. He said the issue is particularly bad in some developing countries where people make $1.90 a day.

""You can't survive when you're earning $1.90 a day and the cost of food has gone up by 50%,"" Segar said.

The World Food Programme’s monthly operations cost have increased 50% since 2019. The $71 million increase could feed 3.8 million people once a day for one month, according to the UN branch.

Russia’s invasion also affected the World Food Programme’s ability to obtain food. About 50% of its wheat came from Ukraine, according to Segar.

""There's enough food between corn maize and wheat and oil that's stored in silos or on container ships in Ukraine to feed 400 million people,"" he said.

""Imagine if we can't get that food to those who are starving, to those who are hungry,"" Segar continued. ""It is going to have a devastating effect on the world.""

Almost all of Ukraine’s grain exports were shipped out of the Black Sea prior to the war, according to the World Food Programme. But moving the food by land is ""a very daunting task"" – and expensive – task, Lander told Fox News.

Additionally, Ukrainian farmers, who normally harvest in July and August won’t have anywhere to store their product unless ports reopen, meaning it could go to waste.

""I don't have an immediate solution at all apart from: stop the war in Ukraine,"" he said. ""There's no reason to have a war in Ukraine, and there's no reason for us to be facing this kind of additional pressure on vulnerable populations around the world.""

""One reaction that everyone should have is outrage,"" Lander added. ""You know, outrage that in a world in this century and this modern world, that we have this amount of people, let alone one person going starving.""

Lander said a longer-term solution would be to develop other countries’ ability to export high-quality food at a high-volume to diversify available sources.

""But in order to do that, you need to inject the resources for those farmers to be able to have the ability to produce grain at that type of level of that quality and that scale,"" Lander told Fox News. ""It's an investment.""

He said there’s already ""enough food around the world to feed everybody on the planet."" But the issue is successfully moving it to people in need.

""We can feed them. That's not an issue,"" Lander told Fox News. ""We can get that food. We can move it to the places where it needs to be, but we need the funds to be able to do that.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/air-force-general-predicts-war-china-2025-i-hope-i-am-wrong,N/A

NATO head warns Russia using 'winter as weapon of war',"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday warned that Russia is using ""winter as a weapon of war"" as Western nations like the U.S. ready themselves increase energy aid to Ukraine.

""What we have seen since President Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine is that President Putin is failing in Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg told reporters from Bucharest, Romania. ""He is responding with more brutality, attacking gas infrastructure, power lines, and trying to deprive the Ukrainians of water, electricity, lights and heating.""

""Therefore, we need to support Ukraine because what we see is that President Putin is trying to use winter as a weapon of war,"" he added.

NATO SAYS RUSSIA 'ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE' FOR DEATHS IN POLAND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FROM AIR DEFENSE MISSILE

The U.S. on Tuesday announced another round of aid to Ukraine, though this time it will be solely directed towards repairing Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure as Russia continues to bombard the war-torn nation with aerial attacks.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday said the U.S. would provide $53 million to support the acquisition of ""critical electricity grid equipment.""

""This equipment will be rapidly delivered to Ukraine on an emergency basis to help Ukrainians persevere through the winter,"" the department said in a statement. ""This supply package will include distribution transformers, circuit breakers, surge arresters, disconnectors, vehicles and other key equipment.""

The package will be used to help restore emergency power and heat various municipalities across Ukraine that have been impacted by Russia’s attacks.

The U.S. has provided nearly $32 billion to Ukraine since Russia invaded over nine months ago, including $145 million to help Ukraine’s power sector.

NATO leaders met Tuesday with Ukrainian Minster of Foreign Affairs Dymtro Kuleba to address Kyiv’s immediate needs when it comes to keeping Ukraine warm as the winter months close in.

Pope calls for end to 'senseless' war in Ukraine during Christmas message,"Pope Francis spoke out against the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine during remarks on Christmas, calling for an end to the conflict.

Speaking at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, the pope focused on the human toll that has resulted from the war, which has been raging since February.

""May the Lord inspire us to offer concrete gestures of solidarity to assist all those who are suffering, and may he enlighten the minds of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapons and put an immediate end to this senseless war!"" the pope said, according to Agence France-Presse.

Biden calls Putin a 'war criminal' after saying Russia is inflicting 'appalling devastation' on Ukraine,"President Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the U.S. Congress for more assistance in the fight against Russian forces invading his country.

The president had initially said ""no"" when asked by Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich if he considers Putin a war criminal, but circled back about 30 seconds later and said, ""Did you ask me whether I would call… Oh, I, I think he is a war criminal.""

Earlier in the day, Biden condemned Russia's invasion and said the U.S. is sending more weapons to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft, anti-armor weapons, body armor, guns, and drones.

""Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals. I mean, it's God awful,"" Biden said. ""The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.""

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing that the president's remarks ""speak for themselves,"" but that a ""legal process"" is still underway at the State Department.

""He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what we’ve seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country,"" Psaki said.

Putin claims 'assured' victory in Ukraine will end conflict as war nears 1-year mark,"Russian President Vladimir Putin made sweeping claims during a recent press tour, including promises that the Russian military will end its operations in Ukraine – with victory.

""In fact, full-scale hostilities in the Donbas have not stopped since 2014, with the use of heavy equipment, artillery, tanks and aircraft. It all happened,"" Putin told veterans and residents in Saint Petersburg. ""Everything we do today, including in a special military operation, is an attempt to stop this war. That is the meaning of our operation.""

He claimed that victory in Ukraine would ""protect our people who live there, in these territories.""

""Russia has come to terms with this event, despite the fact that these are our historical territories. Nevertheless, we could not but react to what began to happen there,"" he noted, according to Russian state-owned news outlet RIA Novosti.

At another event, during which he visited workers at the Obukhov Plant in Saint Petersburg, Putin announced that the ""defense industry is now loaded,"" meaning the government can look at ""granting a deferment to those who should be called up for military service,"" according to the Russian state-owned TASS news agency.

""In terms of achieving the end result and the victory that is inevitable, there are several things. ... It is the unity and cohesion of the Russian and multinational Russian people, the courage and heroism of our fighters ... and of course the work of the military-industrial complex and factories like yours and people like you,"" Putin said. ""Victory is assured, I have no doubt about it.""

Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine and Strategy and a former DIA intelligence officer, told Fox News Digital that Putin is seeking to ""sow confusion among Western analysts"" with his rhetoric, with Russian headlines proudly touting that its officials ""aim to end hostilities in Ukraine.""

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine remain an item of keen interest as the conflict nears the one-year mark: Putin in December 2022 insisted that Russia was ""ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions,"" but an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin ""needs to come back to reality.""

""Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens. There are no other 'countries, motives, geopolitics,'"" Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted. ""Russia doesn’t want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.""

Putin operatives trying to turn Germans against Ukraine war: report,"Pro-Putin operatives with connections to the Kremlin have joined forces with fringe political movements in Germany in an attempt to push Europe's largest economy away from its support of Ukraine.

""We must stop being vassals of the Americans,"" right-wing German politician Markus Beisicht said at a rally in Cologne of over 2,000 people that was aimed at pressuring Berlin to break away from its support of Ukraine, according to a report from Reuters Tuesday.

The report said Beisicht is one of several people working inside Germany for friendlier relations with Moscow amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, helping lead a movement that has attempted to tap deep emotional connections between Russia and Germany in hopes Europe's foremost economic power will change course.

Those joining Beisicht include pro-Putin operatives who have been linked to Moscow and factions of Germany's far-right movement, including a former Russian Air Force officer formerly named Rostislav Teslyuk who settled in Germany under the name Max Schlund.

'FROZEN CONFLICT': A LOOK BACK AT 2022'S KEY MOMENTS IN UKRAINE'S FIGHT WITH RUSSIA

Over the last few months, Schlund reportedly traveled to Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine and Moscow for a conference where President Vladimir Putin was the keynote speaker, a trip that was paid for by a Russian government agency.

The group is joined by leaders of factions of Germany's far-right, who often go by aliases both in pro-Russian internet posting and at rallies in support of Russia in recent months.

BIDEN TO DELIVER PATRIOT MISSILES TO UKRAINE AS ZELENSKYY VISITS WASHINGTON

""Destabilization of an adversary from within through subversion is part of Putin’s playbook,"" Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer and the author of ""Putin’s Playbook: Russia’s Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" told Fox News Digital.

Germany is the European Union’s largest economy and a leader of what has been a united Europe, a delicate coalition of countries who have so far been steadfast in their support of Ukraine. If any movement to turn Berlin against Kyiv were to succeed, it would deal a critical blow to a country that has depended on Western military assistance to survive under an onslaught of Russian forces.

""Russia seeks to fracture NATO but cannot use military force because it would trigger Collective Defense Clause, starting World War III,"" Koffler said. ""So, on Putin’s orders, a special strategy was developed called ‘indirect action,’ which Russia uses to target Germany and other NATO countries. It regularly infiltrates spies into these countries and recruits human assets within those governments in order to influence their policies in favor of Russia and Putin.""

Germany has sent over 1 billion euros in humanitarian aid, military equipment and advanced air defense systems to Ukraine since the war began, and polls show the majority of Germans still support Ukraine. But the polling also indicated support for German military support for Ukraine may be waning as Berlin attempts to tackle the steep rise in energy costs facing its citizens.

GERMAN AUTHORITIES CONTINUE HUNT FOR MEMBERS IN COUP PLOT

Germany also represents a unique opportunity for Putin to turn Europe against Ukraine, with the country sharing deep historical and cultural roots and a population of several million Russian speakers.

The story comes after authorities in Germany last month foiled a coup attempt by far-right members of the Reichsbürger movement, with the government saying the ""domestic terrorist organization"" planned to overthrow the German government and install a ""prince"" related to the former German royal family.

It's also less than a month after an employee of Germany's foreign intelligence service was arrested on suspicion of treason, with prosecutors alleging the employee passed ""state secret"" information to Russian intelligence services.

According to Koffler, Russia's experience in East Germany also gives the Kremlin a leg up on running such a campaign.

""Germany is a special case where Russian intelligence services have a competitive advantage,"" Koffler said. ""While stationed in Germany during his KGB days, Putin was running spy networks and collecting compromising information on government officials.""

As the war nears its second year, Ukraine will continue to depend on the support of a united Europe and the U.S. But as energy costs continue to rise, the pro-Putin movement within Germany threatens to capitalize on the economic situation and push Berlin away from Kyiv.

According to Koffler, the groundwork for such a success was laid by Moscow long ago.

""The Kremlin is capitalizing now on all that work done during the Cold War,"" Koffler said. ""Why do you think Germany has grown dependent on Russian energy? Why has it always been soft on Russia?

Putin's thug army: Russia deploys soccer hooligans to Ukraine as war drags on,"Russia will deploy violent soccer fans, known as ""hooligans"" or ""ultras,"" to Ukraine in an effort to bolster troop numbers as the conflict enters its 11th month.

""He will use hooligans, prisoners, and any sort of thug to continue flowing fighters into Ukraine, to keep it from becoming part of NATO. The mission is this important.""

""[Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime view the outcome of this war as existential for Russia and for themselves personally,"" she added.

News broke last month that Putin had looked to recruit extremist Russian football fans to fight in Ukraine as part of the 106th Airborne Division and the Vostok battalion, The Daily Mail reported.

RUSSIA'S LAVROV FLAT-OUT REJECTS ZELENSKYY'S CONDITIONS FOR ‘PEACE FORMULA’

Stanislav ""Spaniard"" Orlov, a commanding officer of the hooligans, said that the death of one of their members in combat has already spurred the others to ""stay and fight,"" declaring, ""Our comrade died here, and now this is our place.""

""The combat part of the detachment are people who have military experience or have served in the army,"" Orlov explained to Russian news outlet Vechernyaya Moskva. ""After a short training course, they directly fight in the zone of the special operation. Russian fans form small infantry reconnaissance and assault groups or send them to sapper and engineering works.""

At the outset of the war, Putin drew on support from Chechen mercenaries, later trying - and failing - to recruit Syrian mercenaries and even prisoners to help bolster his forces as the war dragged on for months longer than Russian command had anticipated.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that while the department was ""not in a position to confirm these reports,"" it was ""another indication that Putin is scraping for additional personnel to throw into this fight – troops who will just be cannon fodder for his needless, brutal, and failing war of aggression. Rather than withdraw his troops and stop this needless loss of life, Putin has chosen time and again to escalate.""

In 2018, Putin said he would ban the hooligans in his country from attending games as the world watched Russia stage the 2018 World Cup. Now, he appears to have let the fans back into the fold to help boost his military’s numbers.

KYIV, LVIV WITHOUT POWER AFTER RUSSIA LAUNCHES ‘MASS’ AIR AND SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK ACROSS UKRAINE

The Russian fans famously attacked England supporters during the 2016 European Cup matches, with two men jailed after the hooligans allegedly ""mounted an urban guerilla offensive, like paramilitaries,"" the BBC reported.

Koffler explained that hooligans started leaving Russia for Ukraine when the government first started cracking down on violence at stadiums, but those fans turned up for Russia when Putin announced the partial mobilization in September.

""When Russia announced partial mobilization, founder of the All-Russian Association of Fans Andrey Malosolov announced in an interview with the radio station ‘Moscow Speaks’ that 500 of these football ultras formed a volunteer subdivision to go fight in Donbas,"" Koffler explained.

""Putin, who originally was looking to ban this movement when they were creating chaos at sports events, realized that he could put them to use as heavy attrition of Russian soldiers started setting in after months of grueling fighting,"" she said.

""The authorities directed these fighters to put aside their differences and varying allegiances and fight as a unified team for Mother Russia. This unit of what the Russians call ‘near-footballers’ come from different clubs … they have varying levels of experience with some having never being in combat,"" Koffler continued.

"Reporter's Notebook: Ukraine war one year on, human tragedies and triumphs","One year into Russia’s war in Ukraine and the media is full of anniversary stories detailing all the geopolitical dynamics of the situation. For me, looking back at our trips to Ukraine this past year, it’s the personal stories that stand out…as well as how my own life got intertwined with the tales of combat.

Our first trip to Kyiv was during the tense run-up to the invasion last January and February. It was a time of mixed messages. The U.S. was declaring, including in a backgrounder we got at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, that Moscow was going to attack. Various expert analysts told us the same thing. Right to the brink though, including at a press conference we were at, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was being cagey. He’d later say he didn’t want to spook the public.

But the public was getting the message. One cold Saturday before the invasion, we spent time with dozens of locals in a woody suburb of Kyiv, learning all there was to know about crawling under barbed wire…dodging bullets…and applying first aid. Some of which they used on me after I slipped down an icy hill and smashed my glasses into my face!

Shortly after that, I would get my own chilling news. My dear father, at the grand age of 108, had passed away. This cut short my trip to Ukraine in order to get back to New York for his funeral. Maybe appropriate, though, that this happened in the midst of news-gathering. Dad long ago instilled in me a passion for current events. When I went to the den in his home, I found the latest issue of the Economist magazine open to a story about Ukraine.

Most important were the messages from our local producer 24 year-old Sasha Kuvshynova. I passed them on to Fox News via a mass email group. In those early confusing days Sasha was an invaluable source of information for the network and our viewers.

Naturally, I was anxious to get back in the mix, and two weeks later I was in Lviv, Ukraine. Even though it was on the far western side of the country, it too was impacted by Moscow’s offensive actions, including a base hit by Russian missiles. It was used by the U.S. and other NATO countries to instruct Ukrainian military. Now, it was as a training center for international volunteers. Nearby residents told us how shocked they were to see rockets screaming overhead.

On the way back to Lviv, I rang my dear friend and cameraman through thick and thin for the last 20y years, Pierre Zakrzewski. He was in Kyiv working with correspondents and friends Benjamin Hall and Trey Yingst, covering the incursions by Russian forces into the suburbs of the capital. They were reporting on the first waves of death, destruction and terror heaped on the Ukrainian people by Moscow. Pierre, as always, was deep in the mix. It would be the last time we’d speak.

Because on the next day, as were preparing for live shots at our Lviv hotel, my producer Baz Davies walked into the room and said, ""I’ve got some news that will change your life."" Reporter Hall, cameraman Zakrzewski and producer Kuvshynova were all missing after a Russian missile attack. We would learn, the next day the first was badly injured. The other two…killed.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ONCE-LIVELY UKRAINE CITY TURNS NEARLY SILENT

My sign offs during the lives that night were essentially…Sad time for Ukraine…and a sad day for Fox News. At a proper Irish funeral in Dublin for Pierre the following week…we would lift several glasses. For those we lost. And the country that was under attack.

And yes, the battle did go on. Remarkably, the Ukrainians were fighting back with clever tactics and daring deeds. Crucially pushing the Russian troops back and away from the outskirts of Kyiv and driving them across the border as Putin’s ill-planned push to topple the Ukrainian leadership stumbled.

By the time we got there on my next trip to Ukraine in late April and May, it was quieter around Kyiv, but the scars were still there and the healing hadn’t really started.

UKRAINIAN TOWN DEFIES THE RUSSIANS AS RESIDENTS COME HOME AND VOW, 'WE WILL WIN'

We went to Bucha, one of the hardest-hit towns by Russian fighters and saw….a long smoothed-over patch of dirt next to the main church where bodies had been buried in a mass grave. We visited a long residential street…eerily still that day…a shooting gallery for Russian mercenaries a few weeks back. And spoke with residents still breaking down in tears over the horror heaped on them.

And we went to Borodyanka. Made infamous for a long apartment building. With the middle gashed out of it by Russian shelling…a statue to a Ukrainian poet with a bullet through its tin head…shops with their fronts knocked out. In many cases, we were told it was brave locals who stood up and fended off a first wave of Russian attacks. Only to get battered by nasty revenge attacks days later.

Throughout these trips we spoke with a lot of folks. Some innocents caught in the fire. Some helping to lead this young brave democracy. People like 26-year-old Sviat Yurash. He was our local producer during the early protests and Russian attacks in 2014. He would become the youngest member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became famous as images of his lanky frame walking patrols around Kyiv, a long gun slung over his shoulder spread around the world.

Now, he was doing duty back and forth between the front lines with a dog he rescued from the rubble of one Russian attack. His spirit intact. Confident like so many we spoke with that Ukraine would beat back the horrid Moscow land grab.

Still the war went on. Offensives and counter-offensives. By the time we returned in October and November, Kyiv had gained back more ground, but Moscow had a new tactic. It couldn’t win on the battlefield, so it would strike civilians. Or at least the infrastructure supporting regular folks. Power stations, power lines, water pumping stations, phone and internet relay stations.

That became the weekly drill. Air raid sirens. A distant or not so distant rumble. Then emergency teams racing to a site. Which we raced to. To record the damage. And hear from people recounting projectiles falling around them. And then being left without vital essentials. A one-two Putin punch.

A cemetery we visited in the heart of Kyiv also told the tale. Long rows of fresh graves a symbol of the massive toll of this war. We spoke with a mother who lost her son. A couple who lost a friend. Two others who were missing a colleague. Young and old. Black and white family photos. Teddy bears. Football scarves. Bits of life. Turned to death.

We were in Kyiv for our Thanksgiving. For all their suffering and struggle, the staffers at our hotel prepared a turkey meal that would be prized on any American table. On this day of transplanted American warmth, I thought back on my own losses. In addition to my father dying in the past year, I also lost his last remaining sibling, 92-year-old Aunt Mildred. And his long-time girlfriend, 96-year-old Alice.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: LEAVING UKRAINE AFTER THE 'BEST AND WORST OF TIMES'

Also always on our minds, the loss of Pierre and Sasha. We stopped a few times during our reporting to see the exact spot where Russian missiles stole their lives. All that’s left…some ugly divots and spray marks from shrapnel on the side of the road. Flowers and memorial cards left. What was positive, though, the remarkable recovery of Benjamin Hall from terrible wounds. We had a warm reunion upon our return from the latest trip.

And so back to this first anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. And what lies ahead. Frankly, not even us grizzled war correspondents know for sure. What seems likely is that Vladimir Putin will not give up. He has set himself on a road to a brutal take-over and until he comes close to achieving something, he’ll continue to throw his cannon fodder into the ugly mix.

So far, the U.S. and international allies don’t look like they’re giving up either. Most countries seem willing to up the ante. Though there are worrying signs, including in the U.S., of flagging enthusiasm.

"Romanian president, Moldovan president boost ties amid Russia's war with Ukraine","Romanian President Klaus Iohannis discussed energy, economic and security issues in Bucharest Thursday with his visiting Moldovan counterpart, as the two neighbors seek to boost ties amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Iohannis' office said the talks with Moldovan President Maia Sandu would aim to bring her country closer to the 27-nation European Union, to which Romania belongs.

Afterwards, Sandu said Moldova’s strategic partnership with NATO-member Romania is yielding ""concrete benefits.""

""Moldova is going through unprecedented challenges,"" Sandu said, adding that over the past year, her country has faced ""security challenges aimed at creating chaos and destabilizing our region."" Both countries border on Ukraine.

ROMANIA, MOLDOVA REPORT POTENTIAL UFOS IN AIRSPACE

Sandu’s visit came a week after she claimed Moscow was allegedly plotting to overthrow Moldova’s government, put the nation ""at the disposal of Russia,"" and derail its aspirations to join the EU. Russia strongly denied her claims.

""Some wanted our country to fall. To be able to establish a puppet government in Chisinau, servile to the interests of the Kremlin,"" Sandu insisted Thursday. ""The Republic of Moldova remains ... determined on its way to the EU.""

Over the past year, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted EU candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

ANDREW TATE DETAINED IN ROMANIA ON SUSPICION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING: REPORTS

Since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, Moldova has faced a string of crises. These include severe energy problems after Moscow dramatically reduced gas supplies; rocketing inflation; several missiles that have traversed its skies from the fighting next door, and a huge inflow of war refugees.

Iohannis vowed on Thursday to continue to support Moldova, saying it ""is not alone in facing these challenges.""

""I reiterate Romania’s firm condemnation of any Russian destabilization attempts,"" he said. ""Romania remains particularly vigilant towards Russia’s hybrid actions, which … are intensifying at the end of a year of war.""

"Russia accuses US of 'direct' participation in Ukraine war, but Lavrov open to talks","Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the U.S. and NATO on Thursday of ""direct"" participation in its war in Ukraine but claimed Moscow was still open to talks.

In an annual news conference from Moscow, the foreign minister began his comments by defending Russia’s barrage of missile fire on civilian targets like Ukraine's energy sector and attempted to claim it was a defense tactic to halt Western arms.

""We disable energy facilities [in Ukraine] that allow you [the West] to pump lethal weapons into Ukraine to kill Russians,"" Lavrov said, according to a translation by Reuters.

""So don't say that the U.S. and NATO are not participants in this war - you are directly participating,"" he continued. ""Including not only with the supply of weapons, but also with the training of personnel – you train the [Ukrainian] military on your territory.""

Lavrov was referring to international efforts to train up Ukrainian servicemen with NATO tactics in nations like Britain, Germany and Italy – comments which were made after reports surfaced this week suggesting that Washington may expand its training of Ukrainian soldiers on U.S. bases in Germany.

Russia has been accused by NATO of using winter as a ""weapon of war"" by forcing Ukrainian citizens to endure increasingly harsh conditions without electricity, heat or running water as the cold months set in.

The West has further claimed that Moscow is targeting civilian populations as a way to try and force Kyiv to capitulate as Russian forces have seen significant losses on the front lines.

It remains unclear what the general sense in Russia is when it comes to Moscow’s deadly war in Ukraine, though cities across Russia have canceled their Christmas and New Year’s celebrations in recognition of the costly war.

Western estimates regarding the toll that the war has taken on Russian troops suggest that they have seen at least 80,000 casualties since the war began in February.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will not engage in peace talks until Russia completely withdraws all troops from Ukraine.

Diminished relations between Russia and the West remains a major geopolitical concern, particularly after Moscow pulled out of scheduled talks with Washington this week on the nuclear New START Treaty.

Lavrov on Thursday suggested that Russia remains open to talks with the U.S. and NATO member nations, but said it was ""naive"" of the U.S. to think it would engage in nuclear talks at this time.

"Russia's Putin says Ukraine war could be 'long process,' insists he has not 'gone mad' on nuclear weapons","Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed concern that the threat of nuclear war is rising as his country continues its invasion of Ukraine — a conflict that he said ""might be a long process.""

Putin, asked by a member of the Human Rights Council to state unequivocally that Russia would not use a nuclear weapon except in retaliation, stated that such a promise could not be made — maintaining that a promise to never use the weapons first is a promise to simply never use them.

""The threat of nuclear war is growing — no need to hide this sin,"" the Russian president said. ""If Russia does not use nuclear weapons first under any circumstances, then it will not be the second to use them either.""

MISSILES HIT UKRAINIAN CITIES, EXPLOSIONS ROCK RUSSIAN AIR BASES AS FIGHTING INTENSIFIES

Russian doctrine maintains that the nation has a right to deploy nuclear weapons in retaliation to hostile forces threatening its sovereignty.

The world leader pushed back against accusations that he is becoming militarily reckless, insisting that Russia's nuclear arsenal remains a purely defensive resource.

""We haven’t gone mad, we realize what nuclear weapons are,"" Putin said Wednesday. ""We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that’s an obvious fact.""

He added, ""But we aren’t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor.""

""The question about nuclear weapons was almost certainly planted during this teleconference,"" Rebekah Koffler, a Russia expert and former DIA intelligence officer for Russian Doctrine and Strategy, told Fox News Digital.

She continued, ""The goal was to give Putin an opportunity to threaten the West, using his typical intentional ambiguity. Putin’s MO is to keep U.S. and Western politicians, analysts, and media on edge at all times by issuing veiled threats that Russia may use nuclear weapons.""

Putin also commented during the meeting that the war in Ukraine ""might be a long process"" — one of the first explicit acknowledgments from the leader that Russia's early optimism of a swift victory has waned.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now in its 10th month. Ukraine has seen a rollercoaster of victories and losses as its comparatively ragtag forces struggle to regain ground lost early in the invasion.

Putin on Tuesday called a meeting with his security council to discuss the country's domestic defenses after three airbases saw ""explosions"" this week.

The Kremlin did not release details of the meeting but said that Russian officials looked to shore up the nation's ""internal security.""

The meeting appeared to take place just hours after a third airbase was struck in the Russian city of Kursk north of the Ukrainian border and one day after explosions were reported at two separate airbases hundreds of miles inside Russian territory.

""Today, the main priorities for us are the preservation of life and health of subordinate personnel, and the elimination of threats to the safety of the civilian population,"" he said speaking to Russian media outlets. ""The special military operation will continue until the tasks assigned by the Supreme Commander are completed.""

Putin has refused to call his war in Ukraine an invasion and has instead dubbed it a ""special military operation.""

UKRAINIANS BRACE FOR BELARUS-LED LAND INVASION BY JULY, ESCALATING PUTIN'S WAR

Moscow has remained ambiguous when it comes to its intended goal in Ukraine, but Putin’s invasion has resulted in the greatest humanitarian crisis and security threat in Europe since World War II.

At the onslaught of the invasion, Putin claimed his troops would ""demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine.""

Western and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly refuted Russia’s claims of Nazi oppression in Kyiv and have pointed to the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, was democratically elected.

Russia’s original intentions became apparent as it made immediate attempts to take Ukraine’s capital city and showed overt aggression towards Zelenskyy after Russian forces reportedly attempted to storm the presidential palace twice.

""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" Zelenskyy said in February.

However, after a month of intense fighting, Moscow failed to take Kyiv and withdrew its troops to be refitted before announcing its second wave operation would focus on taking ""full control"" over eastern and southern Ukraine.

President Biden said Monday that he does intend to visit Poland, though he said he did not know when that would be in response to reports that suggested his trip would coincide with the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion.

Biden infamously referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""butcher"" after meeting with Ukrainian mothers and children outside of Warsaw, roughly 170 miles from the shared northern Ukrainian border.

One month into the war, the U.N. had assessed that 3.7 million people had fled Ukraine to neighboring nations with Poland having received the vast majority with 2.2 million refugees.

The number of Ukrainian refuges spread across Europe has since climbed to 8 million with nearly 6 million internally displaced inside Ukraine.

RUSSIA NOT COMPLYING WITH NUCLEAR ARMS TREATY, STATE DEPARTMENT WARNS CONGRESS

Defense officials have been sounding the alarm that Russia is expected to launch a major offensive in Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary as it looks to turn the tide in the war.

Russia has seen little gains for months after losing significant territory with the liberation of Kharkiv in September followed by Russia’s withdrawal from the city of Kherson in November.

Moscow has continued to bombard Kyiv through shelling campaigns, and brutal fighting has continued despite winter conditions in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Kherson also continues to be pummeled by Russian forces despite their withdrawal to the eastern side of the Dnieper River, which U.K. authorities claimed on Wednesday, is part of Russia’s plan to deter a counter-offensive across the river.

"Russia-Ukraine War pushes ‘Doomsday Clock’ closest point to midnight in history, scientists say","The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has pushed the ""Doomsday Clock"" up to just 90 seconds before midnight – the closest point to cataclysm in history.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which unveiled the updated clock on Tuesday, said the Russia-Ukraine War has played a crucial role in upending global stability.

""Russia’s thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict – by accident, intention, or miscalculation – is a terrible risk,"" the Bulletin said in a statement that ""the possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone’s control remains high.""

""We are really closer to that doomsday,"" former Mongolian president Elbegdorj Tsakhia said Tuesday at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists annual announcement rating. He and former Ireland President Mary Robinson joined scientists to underscore what they consider a gathering of several existential threats, with Russian leader Vladimir Putin's actions and words chief among them.

RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR AGENCY HELPS MILITARY SIDESTEP SANCTIONS: REPORT

""People and scientists are warning us and we have to wake up now,"" he said.

The Doomsday Clock is a symbol created at the beginning of the Cold War in 1947 to represent the threat of nuclear weapons, which, the Bulletin says have the potential to destroy civilization as we know it.

The Bulletin has moved the clock 10 seconds closer than last year, making it the closest it has ever been to striking 12. It's been as much as 17 minutes from midnight after the end of the Cold War but in the past few years, the group has changed from counting down the minutes to midnight to counting down the seconds.

Last August, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world as entered ""a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.""

""We are sending a message that the situation is becoming more urgent,"" Bulletin President Rachel Bronson said at the online announcement. ""Crises are more likely to happen and have broader consequences and longer standing effects.""

Underscoring the outsized role Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had on moving closer to theoretical doomsday, the Bulletin said it was also announcing the clock movement in the Russian and Ukrainian languages for the first time.

Scientists and activists at the Bulletin announcement also mentioned nuclear weapon proliferation in China, Iran increasing its uranium enrichment, missile tests in North Korea, future pandemics from animal diseases, pathogens from lab mistakes, ""disruptive technologies"" and worsening climate change as other existential threats to humanity.

"Russia-Ukraine war: Western nations sending tanks 'prolongs the war, Croatia's president says","NATO-member Croatia’s president on Monday criticized Western nations for supplying Ukraine with heavy tanks and other weapons in its campaign against invading Russian forces, saying those arms deliveries will only prolong the war.

Zoran Milanovic told reporters in the Croatian capital that it’s ""mad"" to believe that Russia can be defeated in a conventional war.

""I am against sending any lethal arms there,"" Milanovic said. ""It prolongs the war.""

""What is the goal? Disintegration of Russia, change of the government? There is also talk of tearing Russia apart. This is mad,"" he added.

BIDEN SAYS NO TO F-16 FIGHTER JETS FOR UKRAINE, FRANCE CONSIDERS SENDING WAR PLANES

Milanovic won the presidential election in Croatia in 2019 as a left-leaning liberal candidate, a counterpoint to the conservative government currently in power in the European Union and NATO-member state. But he has since made a turn to populist nationalism and criticized Western policies toward Russia as well as the Balkans.

Milanovic has built a reputation of being pro-Russian, which he has repeatedly denied. Yet in recent months, he has openly opposed the admission of Finland and Sweden into NATO as well as the training of Ukrainian troops in Croatia as part of EU aid to the embattled country.

On Monday, the Croatian president expanded his narrative by saying he believes that Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, will never again be part of Ukraine.

After months of hesitation, the U.S. said it will send 31 of its 70-ton Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, and Germany announced it will dispatch 14 Leopard 2 tanks and allow other countries to do the same.

NORTH KOREA DENIES SUPPLYING RUSSIA WEAPONS, WARNS US CROSSING ‘RED LINE’ BY SENDING BATTLE TANKS TO UKRAINE

Milanovic said that ""from 2014 to 2022, we are watching how someone provokes Russia with the intention of starting this war.""

""What is the goal of this war? A war against a nuclear power that is at war in another country? Is there a conventional way to defeat such a country?"" Milanovic asked on Monday. ""Who pays the price? Europe. America pays the least,"" he said.

""A year has passed and we are only now talking about tanks,"" Milanovic said. ""Not a single American tank will go to Ukraine in a year. Only German tanks will be sent there.""

Although the presidential post is mostly ceremonial in Croatia, Milanovic is formally the supreme commander of the armed forces. His latest anti-Western outbursts have embarrassed and irritated the country’s government which has fully supported Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s aggression.

""But it's a really good experience and we'll prove once again that Russia cannot be defeated,"" he added.

""The situation for us will clearly get worse,"" Russian military analyst and retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok said on Russian state TV this week. ""The biggest problem with our military and political situation is that we are in total geopolitical isolation.

""The whole world is against us – even if we don't want to admit it,"" he added.

What’s next?","One year ago today Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Europe entered into a security crisis not seen since World War II and Black Sea blockades created global shock waves that prompted worldwide food shortages.

Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly believed his ""special military operation"" would take just days for his troops to storm across Ukraine and overthrow the capital of Kyiv – a belief that was shared by top U.S. officials.

But instead, the world watched as the real time David vs. Goliath story unfolded and Ukrainian troops held strong against one of the largest, most sophisticated militaries in the world – stopping Putin in his tracks.

Basic logistical failures like fuel shortages stalled Russian efforts within the first week of the invasion, showing a level of unpreparedness in Moscow’s ranks that flabbergasted Western defense officials.

US FORCES CHINA’S HAND IN REVEALING POSSIBLE LETHAL AID TO RUSSIA AMID WAR IN UKRAINE: EXPERTS

But Russia’s inability to quickly take Ukraine has led to what many believe will be a prolonged war of attrition, with casualties already mounting to rates not seen in a Western conflict in some 80 years and concerns growing over how long Kyiv can hold out.

""We are fighting a smart war,"" Yuriy Sak, top adviser to Ukraine’s defense minister, told Fox News Digital. ""We are not prepared to use the tactics employed by the enemy, which is to use people as expendable resources – throwing them into this meat grinder, this slaughterhouse.""

Experts are divided on how or when the war will end, but they agree many more casualties are expected.

""The way that the Russian military fights is very different from the way that U.S. military and now Ukrainians being trained by the U.S. miliary [fight],"" former Defense Intelligence Agency intel officer for Russian Doctrine & Strategy, Rebekah Koffler, said. ""The Russians don't really care for loss of life.""

Koffler pointed to Putin’s September mobilization order to add 300,000 Russian soldiers to his ranks, along with rumblings last month that suggested he may look to add another 500,000 conscripts.

Moscow in January also detailed plans to expand its military to 1.5 million personnel by 2026, up from 1 million.

Russia’s military expansion plans have been fueled by the West’s continuous pledges to back Ukraine for as long as it takes through arms support and humanitarian aid.

WHAT VICTORY FOR UKRAINE LOOKS LIKE BEYOND BORDER SECURITY: CHIEF DEFENSE ADVISER

The Pentagon has long claimed that Russian arms supplies are dwindling and brutal fighting in eastern Ukraine has prompted Russia to throw what it can in droves at the front lines – bodies.

""It is a relentless attrition of manpower,"" Koffler said. ""And he's clearly preparing for a very, very protracted battle.

""He's just going to throw more young Russian men into the meat grinder,"" she added explaining that Moscow plans to exhaust Ukrainian forces through the sheer number of men it can add to its ranks.

""Quantity does not necessarily mean a real battlefield advantage,"" Sak said, pointing to Russia’s months-long attempts to take Bakhmut. ""It just means we need more ammunition to destroy them.""

Defense officials and Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines have reported that the constant supply of Russian troops funneled into Ukraine are inadequately supplied, lack sufficient training and are being killed at increasing rates.

In mid-February a BBC Russia investigation found that in the confirmed deaths of over 1,000 conscripted men mobilized after Putin’s September order, 40% of them were killed after the 2023 New Year – signaling a spike in frontline deaths.

Kyiv has estimated that Russian forces have lost up to 1,000 men a day in the Bakhmut sector alone.

RUSSIA'S WAGNER CHIEF ACCUSES DEFENSE HEADS OF 'TREASON' AS FORCES FALL AMID AMMUNITION SHORTAGES

The last official estimate on the number of deaths reported by the Biden administration came in November when Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley told reporters that 100,000 soldiers on each side of the lines were believed to have been killed. Russian deaths are now believed to be closer to 150,000 while Ukraine’s losses remain more ambiguous.

""Their morale is down. It's exposed their bad logistics and bad tactics. The Russians are throwing a lot of cannon fodder. They're just grabbing guys from prisons, and showing absolutely no respect for the law in war – where you are supposed to distinguish between civilians and legitimate military targets,"" former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital in reference to Russia’s penal recruits for its Wagner mercenary group.

NATO and Ukrainian defense officials have been sounding the alarm for months that Russia is planning a major offensive in an attempt to turn the tide in Ukraine. Moscow saw significant setbacks in the final months last year when Ukraine retook Kharkiv in September, damaged the Crimean bridge in October, and pushed Russian forces across the Dnieper River in November, securing the city of Kherson.

It is now believed that Russia's offensive charge will come in waves closer to the spring time when the weather lets up and will likely not be one united push.

But Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told NATO partners just last week that despite the significant amount of arms and equipment that allies have recently pledged to Kyiv, it will take a couple of months for Ukraine to prepare an adequate counteroffensive.

""It's a war in which tactics and equipment and the smart use of modern technologies are a decisive factor, not the sheer number of armed forces,"" Sak explained, pointing to how the battlefield dynamic in Ukraine shifted once Kyiv had received High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) last summer.

""That was a turning point,"" he said. ""We were able to reach the enemy – ammunition depots and command centers – deeper inside their territory.

""It's always important to try to be one step ahead of the enemy, not one step behind,"" Sak added.

Hoffman argued the West’s hesitancy and repeated decision reversals to send adequate aid to Ukraine is what has prolonged this war to begin with.

""We delayed. First, we said no on air defense then we gave it to them. Then we said no on tanks now we're giving it to them – it’s a year into the war,"" he said. ""What is our strategy here?""

""Could Ukraine win? Yeah, they could win. They should win,"" Hoffman added. ""If we gave them what they need to do it.""

Hoffman's comments were near synonymous among defense experts following the announcement by Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the weekend that the U.S. is now concerned that China is considering giving Moscow lethal aid.

""They're being too cautious,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""[It] makes it more likely that this war goes on longer – makes it more likely to give time for things like China to intervene and help Russia.""

Koffler took a bleaker view on the war’s future and argued providing arms will not be enough to end the war.

""I think it's going to end with a settlement,"" she said. ""It's unwinnable because of how the victory is defined right now.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Koffler said Ukraine will only claim victory once it has repelled Russian forces from all of its borders, including Crimea, which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014.

""Putin is just never going to let that happen,"" she added pointing to the Kremlin’s threat to escalate the war through the use of nuclear weapons. ""For the Russians, their definition of victory is very different. Their definition of victory is really protracted war – denying victory to us.""

Koffler argued that Putin’s true aim is in blocking Ukraine from being accepted into NATO, and so long as the nation is embroiled in a war it will not be eligible to join the military alliance.

The Russia expert warned that the war will continue until ""the three parties come to the realization that they've killed enough people,"" she said in reference to Ukraine, Russia and the United States.

""Until they realize it's time to wrap it up, it’s not going to happen,"" Koffler said, adding that she believes the war could continue for another two to five years.

Kyiv has said it intends to conclude the war by the end of 2023, though this end date is appearing increasingly unlikely after the U.S. and NATO, along with Putin this week, vowed to continue the war effort.

""We all should step up our efforts and shift into high gear so that we don’t allow this war to become a protracted war – it's not in the interest of anyone,"" Sak argued. ""It's not just about Ukraine. It's about the stability of Europe and the world.""

The Ukrainian defense adviser said that ultimately Ukraine will keep doing what it must in the continued face of Russian aggression – fight.

""Victory for us will mean not just throwing the enemy out and restoring our territorial sovereignty over all internationally recognized territories,"" Sak said. ""Victory will also mean establishing a Ukraine which will make such aggression impossible in the future.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/reporters-notebook-old-style-gear-to-fight-current-day-ukraine-war,N/A
US forces China’s hand in revealing possible lethal aid to Russia amid war in Ukraine: experts,"The Biden administration might have forced China’s hand after revealing this week that it suspects China is considering sending Russia lethal aid as Moscow’s war in Ukraine drags on, experts told Fox News Digital Tuesday.

""China has a difficult decision to make,"" chief political scientist with the Atlantic Council Matthew Kroenig said. ""They want Russia to win. On the other hand, they don’t want to lose their economic access to Europe.

""It’s impossible to know where they’ll come down,"" he added.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken first revealed the U.S.'s suspicions following his meeting with Beijing's top diplomat Saturday, after which he expressed concern ""that China’s considering providing lethal support to Russia in its aggression against Ukraine.""

CHINA THREATENS US WITH 'CONSEQUENCES' OVER SPYCRAFT SHOOTDOWN, SAYS IT WILL NOT 'FLINCH'

The U.S. and its NATO allies have repeatedly warned that any nation, including China, will see swift and severe economic sanctions if they are found aiding Russia’s war effort.

China has toed the line when it comes to the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion but also failing to provide arms to its chief international partner.

In recent weeks Beijing has struggled to keep a balance between maintaining constructive relations with the West while condemning the U.S. of ""hysterics,"" as Beijing did over the shooting down of the surveillance balloon and accusing it of escalating the war by providing defensive aid to Ukraine.

International security experts agree that China is trying to ""strike a balance"" between preserving its economic interests and its desire to see the U.S. fall in the global hierarchy.

""China needs Russia to help it change the rules-based world order,"" former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Michael Ryan said. ""[Russian President Vladimir Putin] is [Chinese President Xi Jinping’s] partner in trying to undermine U.S. influence in the world and to show that autocracy and not democracy is the superior form of government.""

Ryan explained that the partnership between Russia and China is down to the joint interest of Moscow and Beijing to see Western influence drop to enhance their global ambitions, particularly in the southern hemisphere.

But the ramifications of Chinese lethal aid to Russia could have global consequences.

Security analysts have long argued that the war in Ukraine is about more than the survival of Kyiv, it is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S.

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO’

Providing arms to Russia would have obvious consequences and change the dynamic on the battlefield, making it harder for Ukraine to win.

Ukraine is outmanned when it comes to the sheer number of personnel Russia can dedicate to its front lines, but the training, munitions and defensive aid it is receiving from the West is giving Kyiv an edge on the battlefield — an advantage that could be taken away if Russia is able to start better arming its troops.

""This would increase the odds of the war in Ukraine becoming even more protracted,"" explained James Anderson, the former acting under secretary of defense for policy during the Trump administration. ""The longer the war in Ukraine drags on, the greater the chances it will spread to other countries in Europe.""

Iran and North Korea have already been providing some weaponry to Moscow, and Tehran’s drone contribution has allowed Russia to hit the one area that Ukraine is unable to effectively beat it — air defense.

But Russia needs munitions, tanks and armored vehicles — which is where China could step in and change the course of the war.

Experts agree that China’s involvement in the war would do more than aid Russia’s war effort, it would morph into a new ""Cold War with China.""

""It really would turn into more of a global proxy battle between democracies on one side — the United States and its democratic allies with the Europeans and South Korea, Japan, Australia of course supporting sanctions against Russia — and then on the other side Russia, North Korea, Iran and China,"" Kroenig laid out.

BLINKEN MEETS WITH CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE DOWNING OF SPY CRAFT

Experts agree that it is unlikely the proxy conflict would lead to direct ground warfare between the U.S. and NATO troops against Russia and Chinese forces — though the conflict brewing over Taiwan could be a different story.

""[China] does not want to see Russia fail because it portends…Western support in terms of [the] Taiwan scenario,"" Heino Klinck, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia under the Trump administration, told Fox News.

""The Chinese have been caught by surprise,"" Klinck said pointing to not only Russia’s operational failures on the battlefield but the steadfast response from the U.S. and its Western allies.

Klinck said that the revelation that China is considering arming Russia underscores that there are debates in Beijing over how it should act and the ""strategic calculus"" of its actions.

""What is more important to China: ensuring Russian success?"" he questioned. ""Or is it being part of an international order?""

Ultimately experts agree that China has to consider whether it will more negatively be affected by the strategic implications of a Russian failure and its ally’s standing on the global stage or the economic repercussions that would directly impact Beijing.

""Those domestic implications are always what drive Chinese decision-making,"" Klinck argued.

Anderson also pointed out that the West will need to move quickly to decide how it will respond with economic repercussions should China involve itself in the war effort.

""This would be a real test of Western unity since many European countries have extensive trading relationships with China, and some of our allies and partners may well be reluctant to jeopardize them with sanctions,"" he said. ""Anything less than a massive sanctioning effort would likely fail.""

""History shows that sanctions imposed in a piecemeal fashion have a poor track record of inducing good behavior in bad malign actors,"" he added.

"Ukraine reveals staggering cost of Russian war: up to 13,000 soldiers dead","Ukrainian forces have lost between 10,000 and 13,000 soldiers in the war against Russia, according to a top advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenksyy.

In a Thursday night interview, Mykhailo Podolyak cited chief military officials when he revealed information that was detailed as ""classified"" by a Ukrainian armed forces spokesman earlier in the week.

""We have official figures from the general staff, we have official figures from the top command, and they amount to between 10,000 and 12,500-13,000 killed,"" Podolyak told a Ukrainian news outlet.

BIDEN HAS 'NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CONTACT' PUTIN, WILL ONLY SPEAK IF HE IS 'LOOKING FOR A WAY TO END THE WAR'

The comments were not only a rare announcement, but the figures are likely far lower than Western estimates, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said last month both Ukraine and Russia have ""probably"" seen ""well over 100,000"" soldiers killed and wounded.

A separate advisor to Zelenskyy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a Wednesday interview that Kyiv assessed the death toll in Russia’s ranks to be roughly seven times that of Ukraine’s, according to Reuters.

Podolyak did not provide any estimates on the number of soldiers who had been injured, but said, ""We are open in talking about the number of dead"" and noted that more soldiers had been wounded than killed.

RUSSIA ACCUSES US OF 'DIRECT' PARTICIPATION IN UKRAINE WAR, BUT LAVROV OPEN TO TALKS

Russia has remained silent on its reported dead and has not released any figures on its fallen soldiers in months.

In late March, Moscow claimed it had lost over 1,300 soldiers in what it has dubbed its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. However, after just one month of war, NATO officials had estimated that number was likely far higher and ranged between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military has not confirmed the figures provided by Podolyak, and head of the armed forces last reported in August that 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers had reportedly been killed.

Podolyak said in June that up to 200 soldiers were killed each day in the then four-month long war.

Ukraine-Russia war: Germany agrees to send 2 battalions of Leopard 2 tanks after heavy pressure,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz formally announced Wednesday that after weeks of stalling and frustrating negotiations Berlin has agreed to send two battalions of Leopard 2 A6 tanks to Ukraine.

In a statement the government said it would initially send one company of 14 tanks to Kyiv, though its aim is to send up to 88 tanks from its own stockpiles.

Scholz said, ""This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability. We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally.""

Some 15 other EU nations that possess the German-made tanks in their own stocks and had increased the pressure on Berlin in recent weeks to approve re-exports to Ukraine as the war nears the 12-month mark.

""Germany will issue the appropriate transfer permits to partner countries that want to quickly deliver Leopard 2 tanks from their stocks to Ukraine,"" confirmed the Wednesday statement.

It is unclear when the tanks from Germany or allied nations will be in Ukraine, though the statement said training Ukrainian troops in Germany would begin ""quickly.""

Western officials have been sounding the alarm that allied nations could not stall anymore on the issue as Russia looks to launch a massive counter-offensive in the near future.

Europe has not seen a war this brutal or hard fought since World War II as fighting continues in the trenches and the sky while deadly shelling continues to pummel Ukraine's 1,500-mile long frontline.

NATO chief Jens Stotlenberg on Tuesday referred to the fighting as a ""grinding war of attrition"" that will come down to a ""battle of wills and a battle of logistics.""

NATO CHIEF SAYS WAR IN UKRAINE IS BATTLE OF 'ATTRITION,' WARNS WINTER 'WILL BE HARD'

Western allies, NATO and Kyiv have championed Ukraine’s ability to hold off Russian forces as a major success, and Ukrainian defense officials have said they plan to turn the tide on Russia with a major counter-offensive.

Both sides remain largely stalled with the U.K. defense ministry assessing Wednesday that Russia has made ""minimal progress"" as major battlefronts remain highly contested from Ukraine’s north in Kharkiv to its southern port city of Mykolaiv.

However, despite Ukrainian claims that it has a counter-offensive plan, Russia expert and former intelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin will also be using this moment to strategize.

""With the Russia-Ukraine stalemate in the actual theater of combat operations, the battlefield has expanded into the rear, behind the enemy lines,"" she said. ""Putin needs to rethink strategy now. It takes time to plan something dramatic and meaningful from the military standpoint, that would change the balance of forces and the dynamics on the battlefield.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy warned that Russia could be planning ""something particularly nasty"" and ""particularly cruel"" for Ukraine’s Independence Day Wednesday.

Ukraine has yet to see anything out of the ordinary in the way of kinetic military action.

Koffler warned that given recent events involving the assassination of the daughter of top Putin ally Alexander Dugin and recent attacks in Crimea, Russia will not sit idle.

""Putin will almost certainly escalate [the war] and is likely looking for the best opportune moment,"" Koffler explained. Additionally, she believes Putin could be ""planning to do something big,"" like a crippling cyber-attack.

""Russia is big on symbolism and this is why it launches attacks or non-kinetic strikes on national holidays that are meaningful for the adversary,"" she continued. ""To shake the adversary psychologically and make maximum impact.""

Putin, who has refused to refer to his war as an invasion and instead has dubbed it a ""special military operation,"" has claimed that Russia has yet to throw its full might at Ukraine.

Western defense officials in July countered this and a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News that Russia is using 85% its fighting force.

However, concerns remain high that Russia could turn to nuclear weapons – a threat Koffler warned could become increasingly likely as the war once again shifts with renewed focus on Crimea.

Though Ukraine is still working to repel Russian forces from territory it has captured since its February, Kyiv has already made a point to say it will not cease its counter-offensive until it restores all of its sovereignty – including in Crimea.

Russia annexed the southern peninsula in 2014, though the international community and Ukraine view this annexation as illegitimate.

As the focus shifts to Crimea, Koffler warned this could escalate the war even further.

""Ukraine is highly unlikely to take back Crimea without significant support from NATO,"" she said, noting that direct NATO’s involvement in Crimea could ""escalate the conflict into the nuclear realm.""

Russia-Ukraine war: Where does the Russian church stand?,"Russian society is split about the war in Ukraine, and we really don't know just how much. Polls are not believed to be reliable. A new law threatening jail time for ""fake"" news and discrediting the military has sent a silencing chill across the country.

One bloc of the population said to support the war is Russia's Orthodox Church.

Anna Vavilova, a correspondent for Tsargrad TV, Russia's main religious television channel, attempted to explain the church's position.

Vavilova casts it in the context of Russia and Ukraine (and Belarus too) being part of the same spiritual and historical family from the days of Kievan Rus, which became the cradle of Eastern Orthodoxy over 1,000 years ago. These are lines we've heard President Vladimir Putin voice too. But for the church, it's about culture wars.

UKRAINE HUMANITARIAN CEASEFIRE WITH RUSSIA NOT HOLDING: LIVE UPDATES

""Well, it's not the point of the military operation, but we don't want a Western way of life here,"" says Vavilova. ""We don't want it close to our families and our society.""

She claims the ""Ukrainization"" that has happened over recent centuries is illegitimate. And she believes Ukraine falling under Western influence is a threat to everyone in the region.

The Russian Patriarch Kirill has whittled it down even further, summing it up in one phrase. People in the Donbas ""are being forced to accept gay parades,"" Kirill said at a mass earlier this month.

""I am quite skeptical about the so-called 'metaphysical battle' or the war for values, especially when entire cities are razed to the ground in this war. What values ​​can justify that?"" a Russian Orthodox priest in Italy named Vladimir Zelinsky told Fox News.

The patriarch may have condemned the Western way of life, but he has not voiced regret for the bloodshed — the plight of millions of refugees fleeing their homes, the deaths of thousands within a month.

It's a silence many say has been deafening.

""He's never said anything about the military operation, but he's always praying for peace. We can't make a politician out of him,"" Vavilova said.

HUNDREDS OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CLERGY URGE TO ‘STOP THE WAR' IN UKRAINE

But Kirill is political, seen to be giving Russian President Putin spiritual cover, if not inspiration, for this war.

According to Father Vladimir, the patriarch ""is fully incorporated in the authoritarian state. Not only his opinions but also his post, his mode of life, even his life itself eventually depend on a (spiritually) crazy dictator.""

But the war and the patriarch's position on it appear to be backfiring in the land where the supposed struggle for traditional values has turned into a bloody battlefield. Reportedly, fifty communities that answered to Kirill in Ukraine have recently switched sides. They have joined the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Russian President Putin wears his faith on his sleeve.

Asked how intense piety could square with the waging of a bloody war, Vavilova said she couldn't answer on Putin's behalf. But she says she has already made the case for what's happening in Ukraine.

Father Vladimir, on the other hand, questions Putin's faith.
