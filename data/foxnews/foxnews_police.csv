Michigan K-9's mugshot goes viral after police accuse pup of stealing officer's lunch,"A police K-9 named Officer Ice was recently ""under investigation"" for allegedly stealing from one of his own colleagues.

This month, the Wyandotte Police Department (WPD) in Wyandotte, Michigan, shared a now-viral image of Ice's mugshot following his recent criminal charges.

As the post stated, Officer Barwig was in the middle of his lunch when he was called into the WPD jail for assistance.

Upon his return, Barwig's lunch had vanished and Ice was seen leaving the break room while ""licking his chop,"" according to the WPD's post, which was shared on Facebook 11,000 times.

The presumed guilty party, Ice, has garnered quite the following since his story spread across social media platforms.

""The response from the Facebook post was great,"" Chief Brian Zalewski of the WPD told Fox News Digital. ""There was an immediate defense of Ice and calls for the department charges to be dismissed.""

""Although Ice is getting a little gray in the beard and not on everyday patrol, he is still very much a part of our department."" — Chief Brian Zalewski

""Since Ice has been with our police department for so long, he is well known and loved in our community,"" Zalewski added. ""People coming to his defense was immediate.""

""Plus the overall public just doesn’t believe he is guilty. No video has been produced,"" the WPD wrote in a caption beneath a photo of Ice and a tray of sandwiches. ""That being said Ofc Ice will not face any internal discipline or criminal charges.""

The post went on, ""The public has spoken. #nochargesforIce.""

Detective Sergeant Kenneth Groat is Ice’s handler. Groat and Ice have been working together for more than 10 years, since Ice was six months old, Zalewski said.

""Although Ice is getting a little gray in the beard and not on everyday patrol, he is still very much a part of our department,"" Zalewski said.

""Ice is extremely well trained and still maintains his K-9 certifications. Ice has assisted dozens of law enforcement agencies over his decade of service,"" he added. ""He was one of the most requested Police K-9’s for drug search warrants, vehicle searches and suspect tracking.""

Aftermath of defund the police movement in spotlight after street racing incident: 'We created these monsters',"A street racing incident in Austin, Texas, over the weekend that left one police officer injured and several patrol cars damaged has reignited the debate over the impact of the defund the police movement.

Street racers took over an intersection at South Lamar Boulevard and Barton Springs Road on Saturday, drifting in the middle of the street and setting off fireworks. An Austin City Council member was reportedly on hold with 911 for 28 minutes after calling about the takeover as the city grapples with a staffing crisis.

Fox News' Will Cain said Monday on ""The Five"" the anarchy that occurred in the city's streets is ""symbolic of what's happening across this nation where bad policies create bad culture, and then you get a bad town.""

""You have the former Mayor Steve Adler. You have this councilman, Greg Cassar, who was part of the 'let's defund it' to the tune of one-third of the police budget,"" he explained. ""Although they tried to refund it one year later, the police left in droves. They haven't been able to rehire to the levels that [are] necessary - this leads to moments like this.""

AUSTIN POLICE, 911 STAFFING LEVELS QUESTIONED AFTER STREET RACERS TAKE OVER MAJOR INTERSECTION, INJURE COP

Cain added that he lived in Austin for three years, but sees the city headed in the same direction as San Francisco.

""It will be lost [but] I hope the entire state can protect itself from turning into California,"" he said.

Co-host Judge Jeanine Pirro argued the young teenagers and adults involved in the incident feel empowered, knowing they won't be held accountable due to soft-on-crime policies.

""They're saying things like, ‘You know, sorry, the police officer got hurt, but he should have stayed in his own lane.' You know, and 'they can't catch us,'"" she said.

""We created these monsters. We have allowed them to get away with it. We, as a society, are allowing anarchy to take over in our streets.""

Pirro added that ""social justice nonsense"" has played a key role in emboldening criminal activity.

""You violate the law, you go to jail. It's really as simple as that. We've given them criminal privilege,"" she said. ""They know they've got criminal privilege; they're empowered. And the irony of all of this is that they are playing by the rules. And the rules today are no bail. Well, you're not going to be able to catch us. And even if you do catch us, I'm going to get away with it.""

"Austin, Texas residents 'living in fear' as critics blame street racing chaos on police staffing 'crisis'","Some Austin, Texas residents say they're ""living in fear,"" warning that the city continues to grow in population without enough police officers to handle rising crime.

Austin resident Patricia Potyka and ""Save Austin Now"" co-founder Matt Mackowiak joined ""Fox & Friends First"" Tuesday to discuss how the growing capital city is facing police shortages, leaving residents feeling concerned for their safety. It comes after a video went viral over the weekend showing a chaotic scene in which people engaged in street racing in the city and threw fireworks at police vehicles.

""Crime does not know gender, economic status, age, and it's scary. Everyone that I've spoken with, whether it's at my daughter's school or church, is living in fear,"" said Potyka.

She then called out the city council for giving themselves a 30% raise last year after they ""defunded our police department a couple of years ago to the tune of $100 million.""

""Austin is growing, yet the people in power to keep us safe is shrinking.""

Mackowiak said the city is in the midst of ""the most profound police staffing crisis"" in its history.

Mackowiak said the reason the city is facing a ""cascading"" crisis since 2020, down about 350 officers.

""We have something like 230 vacancies and because the council is not passing a mutually negotiated four-year police labor contract, we are at risk of losing another 100 officers here in the next six weeks.""

Mackowiack said the new mayor, Kirk Watson, ran on hiring more police and improving public safety and that cops need a new four-year contract.

Previous Austin mayor, Steve Adler spearheaded the defunding of the city's police department

Potyka said the city has seen 13 homicides as of February 13th.

""Last year, Austin is ranked a C-minus in terms of national crime. You have a one in 24 chance of being a victim of violent crime,"" said Potyka.

Watson condemned the downtown street takeover that injured one officer and left several police vehicles damaged over the weekend, but accused the police union of making ""false comments"" that ""wrongly conflate this illegal incident with important community conversations about safety and oversight.""

Car clubs blocked off multiple intersections throughout Austin on Saturday evening, drifting in the middle of the street and setting off fireworks as large crowds looked on at the chaos.

One Austin Police Department (APD) officer was injured, while several APD vehicles were damaged. A spokesperson for the Travis County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital that two of their patrol vehicles also had to be towed from the scene after the windows were busted out.

The incident came just days after the Austin City Council ditched a four-year contract with APD that officials had been negotiating for several months.

That contract called for hiring 200 officers by the end of 2024, and another 200 officers by the end of 2025, additions that the city's understaffed force desperately needs. Officers would also get a 14% raise over four years under the contract.

Seattle reverses course on defunding police as crime ravages locals: 'A huge crisis',"Seattle residents Victoria Beach, Eli Hoshor and Jonathan Choe said police shortages have left their city in dire straits in the aftermath of officials' anti-law enforcement rhetoric.

Homicides skyrocketed by 24% while motor vehicle thefts climbed by 30% in the city last year. Overall crime ticked up by 4%.

Mayor Bruce Harrell pushed for increased police presence to curb the issue Tuesday, saying, ""We need immediate action and innovation to respond to our public safety issues… Seattle saw a 4% rise in reported crime last year… We need more officers to address our staffing crisis.""

Still, some residents' outlook is less than optimistic.

OPINION: SEATTLE'S CRIME SURGE SPREADS STATEWIDE THANKS TO DEMOCRATS' PROGRESSIVE POLICIES

""Right now, I don't have a lot of hope,"" Beach told Todd Piro Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends First.""

""I think the mayor is on the right track, but Seattle is in a huge crisis. Our city has been destroyed, and we're not going to get it back anytime soon,"" she added.

Beach said she agrees that the city needs more police to help cut back on crime, saying the situation is currently a ""free for all.""

""If you want to commit a crime, move to Seattle,"" she said.

Piro reported data from Seattle's city's budget office showing funding for law enforcement increased for the first time since a major slash was made in 2020.

Hoshor, another resident, says the uptick is not enough to reduce crime.

""The crime is just getting worse and worse,"" he said. ""There's a homeless encampment that's right next to my son's school that's been there for over a year, and it's doubled and tripled in size.

""It's ridiculous that that's even possible.""

Choe, a reporter from the area, slammed the ""Defund the Police"" movement for being behind the crime rise as well as the ""woke"" activist class who he said are perpetuating the problem.

""[It's] a failed social experiment,"" he told Piro. ""They're still standing by this and doubling down on it…""

He added that seeing how ""Defund the Police"" supporters respond to Harrell's push for more police and the uptick in funding for the department should be ""interesting.""

Jason Rantz: 5 reasons why Seattle police are ditching the city,"Cop bashing has become a sport in Seattle -- literally and figuratively. Police face physical assaults from Antifa thugs and other radicals. And the City Council continues its defunding efforts, even as the city reached a 26-year high homicide rate.

It’s precisely why a historic number of police officers have left the Seattle Police Department, with scores more on their way out.

Since 2020, I have exclusively reported that at least 270 officers have separated from the force. That’s almost one-third of the department. Some resigned, others retired, and many have made lateral moves to agencies more supportive of police. There are at least 100 more officers ""unavailable,"" according to an internal HR document. Many are burning their accrued sick and vacation time before leaving the department for good.

Consequently, Seattle is in the middle of a staffing crisis that’s leaving citizens vulnerable. The department has the lowest deployable staff since the 1980s with, at times, precincts at or below staffing minimums. It’s been a long-time coming: the crisis pre-dated the Left’s war on cops that defined 2020. Seattle got a head start, constantly pushing back against police.

EX-TOP COP BRATTON: DEFUND THE POLICE? WE'RE AT THE CENTER OF THE STORM, DOING THE JOBS NO ONE ELSE WANTS

So why are cops finally ditching the department in such huge numbers? Here are the top five reasons.

1. City and state took away essential tools and strategies of policing: Although Seattle saw months-long violence from Antifa and Black Lives Matter radicals, police were the ones reprimanded for supposed violence.

Cops put down dangerous riots, endured a violent insurrection leading to an autonomous zone, and were under physical assault for months. Still, politicians and activists deemed the cops to be the enemy.

The Council unanimously banned tear gas, a non-lethal way for officers to disperse violent crowds without risking injury by entering into them. While a federal judge stepped in to overturn the ban, the Council didn’t relent, promising more reforms where they could. They’ve already removed 911 operations from the police, transferring it to civilian control.

Months later, the Democrat-controlled state legislature went even further, bringing Seattle-style anti-police bills statewide. Thanks to Seattle’s influence at the capitol, their legislation went further than Seattle.

Chokeholds and neck restraints were banned, along with ""no-knock"" warrants, while restricting when an officer can engage in vehicular pursuits. They severely limited the use of tear gas, forcing agencies to seek permission from elected politicians before deployment. And they installed a dizzying and impossible-to-satisfy set of de-escalation criteria to meet before being able to use force legally.

SEATTLE PARENT BLASTS SCHOOL BOARD FOR ‘NOT ADMITTING’ HOMELESS CAMP IS ‘DANGEROUS’

2. Seattle is STILL defunding police: While some cities have seen the errors of their ways, the Seattle City Council continues its defunding efforts. Indeed, the far-Left Council is currently debating how much to cut from the budget after passing a 20% reduction last year.

A recent bill to cut $5.4 million more from the budget failed because, in part, Councilmembers didn’t think it cut enough. It was punishment against the SPD for going over budget. They went over, thanks to overtime pay to make up for the low staff.

The department was in a lose-lose situation. They could have ditched extra staffing during summer 2020 riots or during shifts where they were at or below staffing minimums, which would have put the public at risk, but saved money. They chose public safety, angering the Council.

""This is a funding crisis of the department’s own making,"" socialist councilmember Tammy Morales disingenuously argued.

Now, the police are paying the price.

3. The ‘Silent Majority’ doesn’t speak up: While officers cling to the belief that the ""silent majority"" of Seattlites support the police, it’s loud community activists who smear police whenever they can. And it’s wearing on officers.

""Often times people on the streets will call you derogative names and throw insults,"" one former officer wrote in his exit interview. ""...It is hard sometimes to stay positive when some days it feels like some people of Seattle don’t want you there.""

SEATTLE'S $700M 'WOKE' WATERFRONT MAY BACKFIRE, CRITICS WARN

Making matters worse, Capitol Hill Pride announced they were banning LGBTQ police from attending the Pride rally and march at the end of June. The more mainstream rally, Seattle Pride, is still determining whether or not they will allow police to attend next year’s march (this year’s event is online). The SPD has many gay officers. They were battered by the slight.

""I grew up in a time in a small city where I had to be closeted, where the main group of people said, ‘be seen, don’t be heard. We don’t need to know about it. Keep yourself in the closet, and you can get along with us.’ Well, in essence, that’s what Capitol Hill Pride is doing to us. They just put gay police officers back in the closet,"" 17-year SPD veteran Sergeant Doug Raguso told me on my Seattle-based radio show.

PARENTS OUTRAGED AS SEATTLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NEAR HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT FACES BREAK-IN, LOCKDOWNS

4. Politicians don’t support the police: Councilmembers and local politicians were quick to use the death of George Floyd to forward dramatic police reforms. But to tie the tragedy in Minneapolis to the reality in Seattle, local politicians had to create a false and dangerous narrative that would end up ratcheting up the anti-police sentiment.

The worst offender was Socialist councilmember Kshama Sawant, who officers routinelycite for leaving (or wanting to go) the force. She falsely accused police of ""targeted"" shootings against the black community. She forwarded a baseless conspiracy that cops reacting to rioters were possibly ""prepared with instructions to orchestrate violence.""

Concurrently, she was a key cheerleader for the Antifa radicals who created the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in an armed insurrection that took over six city blocks in Seattle. Sawant, on CNN, called it an ""incredible movement… this uprising, this rebellion… is incredibly inspiring to the vast majority of American people."" She even helped lead part of the protest that eventually led to CHAZ’s creation.

Sawant is not alone in unfairly targeting police.

Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda defended a protester threatening to murder cops, several councilmembers said they would look to fire only white officers, the Seattle Inspector General asked police to ban most traffic stops inferring racist police pose a threat to black motorists, and an all-staff email from the Department of Finance and Administrative Services implied the SPD was full of white supremacists.

The only time a Seattle politician or activist is silent on policing is when an officer comes under physical assault by the mob. Despite months of attacks on officers, including the son of a former Democratic lawmaker hitting an officer in the head with a bat and Antifa sealing a police precinct’s door shut with quick-dry cement while activists tried to set fire to the building, the Council said nothing.

5. There’s a crusade to investigate cops -- even without evidence. The Office of Police Accountability (OPA) is a civilian-led agency that investigates complaints against officers. But it’s overzealous and often abused by activists who are harassing police. Officers complain even frivolous complaints can hound them for months, making it more difficult to get jobs at other agencies.

Four of every 10 SPD employees had a complaint filed against them last year. Indeed, there were over 19,000 complaints filed against police at rallies and riots in 2020. Sounds like Seattle has a police problem, doesn’t it? It doesn’t mean that. It was part of a public strategy by activists to flood the agency with complaints.

Many were either frivolous, duplicates, based on tweets (not actual ""victims"" or even witnesses), or didn’t amount to anything serious. It’s why, out of 19,000, there were only 15 suspensions.

What’s worse, the OPA is currently investigating six police officers for attending former President Donald Trump’s speech on January 6. There was never evidence presented that any of the officers violated the law. None of them have been charged with crimes by federal authorities. But their mere presence was enough to trigger an investigation that has been ongoing since January.

According to the Seattle Police Officers Guild president Mike Solan, the six officers have been ordered, under threat of termination, to turn over personal documents from their vacation in D.C., including receipts, itineraries, text messages, and photos. Solan says they were even asked ""political questions.""

There’s a certain type of person who is drawn to law enforcement jobs. It is not a glamorous job nor does it pay particularly well for the risks they are asked every day to endure.

But for a long time, the profession was respected. Everyone knew we needed police for a functioning society.

Last year, when the Black Lives Matter protests turned into riots all over the country, police were maligned as the enemy. The foolish idea ""Defund Police"" spread among the left and took up residence among policy makers. The idea sounded like a joke and yet cities across the country made cuts to their police departments in response to activist demands.

'DEFUND THE POLICE' LOSES BIG IN DEMOCRATIC CITIES NATIONWIDE

When the predictable crime spikes arrived, cities tried to back-pedal. But after months of maligning the men and women protecting our streets it wasn’t quite so easy to rebuild.

In Minneapolis, where George Floyd had been killed in May of 2020 by a police officer, the rage against police ran white hot. That December, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey signed a budget cutting $8 million dollars from the police force.

What happened next was obvious. In 2019, Minneapolis had recorded 48 murders. By September of 2021, that number was 67.

DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT STILL HURTING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES

By November, voters rejected a ballot initiative to replace the police department with a Department of Public Safety which would have taken a ""comprehensive public health approach"" to criminal activity.

Rebuilding a demoralized police department won’t be easy. According to the New York Post, in the same study on the NYPD, a ""staggering 80 percent of the officers, detectives, sergeants, lieutenants and captains surveyed now fear aggressively fighting crime because of the threat of criminal liability, being sued, or being unfairly disciplined.""

After over 40 years of experience as a homicide detective, federal agent, and lawyer I should have known better.

"Biden has called to redirect police funding, but stopped short of ‘defund’ embrace","President Trump had a heated moment with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace during their interview that aired Sunday, when the president claimed that Joe Biden wanted to defund police -- only for Wallace to swiftly interject and say that was not true.

Trump defended his assertions, citing the charter for a partnership between Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., known as the Unity Task Force.

But the task force’s recommendations for the Democratic platform do not mention defunding police, and do not talk about abolishing police as Trump also asserted. Further, Biden's campaign has said the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee does not support the ""defund"" movement.

However, Biden has voiced support for shifting some funding away from the police.

When asked during a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan if he agrees “that we can redirect some of the [police] funding,” Biden responded, “Yes, absolutely.”

Further, the charter in question mentions investing in partnerships with non-police professionals to address certain situations.

CHRIS WALLACE ON TRUMP INTERVIEW: HE TOOK ALL THE QUESTIONS, BIDEN HASN'T FACED THE SAME SCRUTINY

“Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in, and make smart investments to incentivize departments to build effective partnerships with social workers and mental health and substance use counselors to help respond to frontline public health challenges,” the document says.

While the recommendations say nothing of defunding police, these goals are similar to some of the stated aims of the defunding movement, which include helping communities through assistance aside from police presence. They call for “[f]ederal funding to create a civilian corps of unarmed first responders such as social workers, EMTs, and trained mental health professionals, who can handle nonviolent emergencies[.]”

The idea of taking some police funding – but not all of it – and redistributing it elsewhere is consistent with the concept put forth by Black Lives Matter Managing Director Kailee Scales.

BIDEN SAYS SOME FUNDING SHOULD 'ABSOLUTELY' BE REDIRECTED FROM POLICE

In a video posted to the organization’s website, Scales explained that defunding police could mean taking just a portion of the money currently going to police and reallocating it to other programs.

“What if we used our tax money to put toward other services like education, like health care, like housing, like employment opportunities?” Scales asked in the video, adding, “In some cities, just by defunding the police by 5 percent would double the budget for public health.”

To be sure, the ""defund"" movement has been complicated by inconsistent messaging. Some advocates argue they're merely calling for cuts. Others want to literally end police funding and departments.

The confusion was made apparent during a June interview Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., did with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

""When we talk about defunding it can show up in multiple ways,"" she said. First, she said that the purpose of defunding police is so that other programs have the funding they need, but when asked why that money has to come from police, she said that some police departments should not have the “warlike weaponry” that they have.

BIDEN COMES OUT AGAINST DEFUNDING POLICE

Then there are those who go beyond defunding police and call for abolishing police, which Trump also said Biden’s charter supports. This idea too has proven to have different definitions. In Minneapolis, councilmembers have supported abolishing the city’s police department, but at the same time they called for replacing it with a Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention that could include a Division of Law Enforcement Services, which would be made up of officers who would operate under the supervision of the Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.

Essentially, this would not be an elimination of law enforcement officers, but a restructuring of how law enforcement is handled. The Unity Task Force recommendations, which don't go that far, do say that Democrats wish to “reimagine policing for the benefit and safety of the American people.”

But Biden certainly has not backed a full-blown defunding or elimination of police departments, as Trump appeared to suggest.

Meanwhile, a June New York Times opinion piece by activist Mariame Kaba went all the way, declaring, “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police.” In it, Kaba explains that her desire to redistribute funds does not mean just taking a portion of the police money or still having officers but under a different name.

“We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete,” Kaba wrote. She went on to say: “We should redirect the billions that now go to police departments toward providing health care, housing, education and good jobs. If we did this, there would be less need for the police in the first place.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-has-called-to-redirect-funding-from-police-but-stopped-short-of-defund-embrace,N/A
Biden says some funding should 'absolutely' be redirected from police,"Joe Biden said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should “absolutely” be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to ""defund the police"" in the wake of the protests across the country.

Biden's campaign has said he does not support defunding the police. But in a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan, the presumptive Democratic nominee said that police forces don’t need surplus military equipment, saying this is what leads them to “become the enemy” in a community.

“But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden.

“Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president.

Biden went on to call for police reforms.

""One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing way we deal with our prison system,"" he said. ""It should be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system. We’re going to make sure you're qualified for every single right you had before you went to prison if you served your time.""

BIDEN COMES OUT AGAINST DEFUNDING POLICE

In early June, the Biden campaign said that Biden does not believe that police should be defunded.

“As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,” Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said at the time. “He hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain.”

Bates added that Biden supports “the urgent need for reform,” which he said includes “funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing — so that officers can focus on the job of policing.”

The Biden campaign has pointed to the former vice president’s criminal justice plan, which proposes an additional $300 million for community policing. Bates said that the funding would “improve relationships between officers and residents” and would “provide the training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths.”

“This funding would also go toward diversifying police departments so that they resemble the communities in which they serve,” Bates added, noting that there is need for “additional funding for body-worn cameras.”

In response to Biden's new comments, Trump 2020 campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark wrote on Twitter it looked like Biden had “changed his position” on defunding police, adding a clip from the Now This interview.

But Biden's campaign denied it signaled a change in his position.

“I'd like to thank Donald Trump - for hiring an illiterate comms staff. Biden is running on *more* COPS funding for community policing,” Bates, Biden’s director of rapid response, shot back. “The same sentiment you're taking out of context RE: local budgets is *in* the articles about him opposing defunding.”

Biden in the interview also said he believes it is the job of the federal government to ""go in"" and ""systemically change what's going on.""

He specifically called for banning no-knock warrants and improving police transparency.

DC police chief gets passionate in crime meeting: 'Something going on within the culture of our young people',"Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser held a meeting with neighborhood leaders Saturday to discuss government plans to combat the rapidly rising crime rate.

Appearing alongside Bowser was Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee, who spoke about the influence and dangers of modern youth culture.

DC COUNCIL SOFTENS PENALTIES FOR VIOLENT CRIMES BY OVERRIDING MAYOR'S VETO OF CRIMINAL CODE REWRITE

""It's showing up in schools. Ask the principals. They'll tell you,"" Contee said. ""They're scared. Parents are scared. Everybody in this room is feeling this.""

Contee went on to decry the alarming rise of robbery and other violent charges as first offenses among youth.

WASHINGTON DC MAN WHO HELPED PASS CRIMINAL CDE OVERHAUL SHOT AND KILLED

""Their first offense, their first introduction to the criminal justice system — 100 young people for robbery,"" the chief of police lamented. ""I looked at a video about two days ago at a charter school, where three young people took another person's shoes off them — while they're in school — and put the shoes in a trash can while somebody else recorded it.""

Contee could not place a concrete, overarching influence driving young people toward crime at such alarming rate, but he warned that something sinister is creeping into youth culture.

""Something going on in within the culture of our young people,"" he added. ""When you look at the juvenile gunshot wound victims. . . .

Cori Bush won't drop 'defund the police' slogan even though Dems fear it's poison at the polls,"Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., is refusing to back away from the ""defund the police"" slogan, despite pushback from members of her own party who fear political consequences from its use.

""I always tell [fellow Democrats], 'If you all had fixed this before I got here, I wouldn’t have to say these things,'"" Bush told Axios Tuesday.

REP. BUSH NOT BACKING DOWN ON ‘DEFUND THE POLICE,’ SAYS CONGRESS INACTION HAS ‘COST LIVES’

The progressive ""Squad"" member's commitment to defunding the police comes amid growing concern about the 2022 midterm election among members of the Democratic Party, who fear ""defund the police"" rhetoric may have led to disappointing results in the 2020 election.

But Bush said that the party needs to do a better job of explaining to voters what it means by ""defund the police,"" arguing that some funding could be better spent on preemptive social services.

The Missouri Democrat also dismissed concerns about Democrats losing this year's election, saying a defeat should be blamed on the party's inability to pass sweeping reforms such as President Biden's Build Back Better legislation.

""'Defund the police' is not the problem,"" Bush said. ""We dangled the carrot in front of people’s faces and said we can get it done and that Democrats deliver, when we haven’t totally delivered.""

""If [Republicans] take the majority, it’s just done as far as trying to get the legislation across,"" she added.

Bush's comments come as violent crime has been on the rise throughout the U.S. in the past two years, with murders rising 5% last year and 44% since 2019, according to a Council on Criminal Justice study.

The rise in crime and 2020's difficult down-ballot election results have caused Democrats to attempt to distance the party from the ""defund the police"" movement, with Bush saying that some colleagues have told her the slogan is unhelpful in their districts.

Not all Democrats agree with Bush. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., who is running for Mayor of Los Angeles, called for more police Tuesday, saying that residents of Los Angeles ""don't feel safe,"" while vowing to get the city's police department back to its 9,700 authorized officers.

""Whether you’ve had your car broken into, your backpack stolen, your property damaged — or you’ve seen news coverage of home robberies, or violent assaults — more and more Angelenos I speak with tell me crime has touched them personally, and they feel scared,"" Bass said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Some in the party have discussed a piecemeal approach to larger police reform bills, such as the failed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, but Bush argues there's little chance of seeing even small reforms come to fruition.

""If we couldn’t get George Floyd done back when millions of people were marching in the street, then how do we expect to get more than one thing done [on policing] over the next few years?"" Bush said.

DeSantis kicks off pro-police tour in Democrat-run cities as White House rumors swirl,"EXCLUSIVE: Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is set to kick off a pro-police tour starting in New York City to speak with law enforcement officers in blue-led cities who feel unsupported.

DeSantis will begin the tour Monday morning by speaking with police officers and law enforcement union officials at a diner in red-leaning borough of Staten Island. The governor will then head to Fort Washington, a Philadelphia suburb, and Elmhurst, Illinois, near Chicago, where he will meet with sheriffs, chiefs of police and other local law enforcement officials, his political team told Fox News Digital.

Paul DiGiacomo, president of New York City's Detectives' Endowment Association, will be in attendance at Monday’s event. He told Fox News Digital that New York’s bail reform law that ended cash bail requirements for many criminal charges has endangered law enforcement.

RON DESANTIS SENDS TWO PLANES OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD

""It’s a law enforcement rally to send a message back to some of our elected officials that the laws that they have enacted in the state of New York are not working – specifically the bail reform laws – and it’s putting my members, detectives and cops in danger, as well as the public,"" he said. ""It’s gone too far to the left over the last couple of years.""

DeSantis is expected to tout his efforts to support law enforcement and reduce crime in Florida, where he recently proposed legislation to strengthen bail laws, toughen penalties for sex criminals and other anti-crime measures.

According to the governor’s office, DeSantis implemented the largest recruitment package for law enforcement officers in state history last year, awarding $5,000 signing bonuses to officers willing to relocate to Florida from blue states.

News of DeSantis’ upcoming trip to Chicago caused a backlash last week, prompting Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker to condemn the Florida governor as ""homophobic.""

""Well he doesn’t represent the values of the people in Illinois,"" Pritzker told WGN 9. ""In fact, he is the antithesis of that. He’s demonstrated that he’s homophobic, that he has tendencies to promote racism.""

Gallagher uses China’s illegal police stations on American soil to sound alarm on threat to US sovereignty,"House China Select Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher will host an event today at a former illegal Chinese Communist Party police station in downtown Manhattan in an effort to shine a light on the threat the CCP poses to the United States and the need for the Biden administration to act ""aggressively"" to defend U.S. sovereignty.

Gallagher, R-Wis., the chairman of the new committee, is convening a bipartisan group of lawmakers in front of the former CCP police station, which the FBI recently raided. Members of the committee, including Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., and Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla., are expected to join Gallagher for the event.

""It’s not just happening here on American soil — it’s happening around the world,"" Gallagher told Fox News Digital, noting that more than 100 unauthorized CCP police stations have been identified globally.

""They are used to intimidate members of the Chinese Diaspora — Chinese citizens,"" Gallagher said. ""This isn’t happening in Beijing or Hong Kong or in some distant province. It is happening right here on American soil.""

SHUT THEM DOWN: MORE CHINESE SECRET POLICE STATIONS REPORTEDLY FOUND, PROMPTING CALL FOR CONSULATE CLOSURES

Last year, the pan-Asian human rights organization Safeguard Defenders published an investigation called "" Patrol and Persuade "" that said another 48 Chinese police service stations were operating abroad in addition to the 54 the group had identified in September. The reported locations span 53 countries , including four U.S.-based stations — two in New York City, one in Los Angeles and one set up by the Nantong Public Security Bureau in an undisclosed location.

Safeguard Defenders has said there are potential human rights abuses associated with the stations, including the use of harassment and intimidation methods, such as threatening the family members of the overseas citizens. The stations have also served as centers to spread Chinese government propaganda and monitor the behavior and opinions of Chinese nationals.

REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM BIDEN OFFICIALS ON REPORT CHINA OPENED POLICE ARM IN NYC

The CCP's overseas police stations allow Chinese authorities to ""carry out policing operations on foreign soil"" and have aided a CCP campaign to combat citizens living abroad. Since the campaign’s launch in April 2021, 230,000 Chinese nationals have been ""persuaded to return"" home to face prosecution for alleged crimes, according to the Ministry of Public Security in China.

China’s Foreign Ministry has denied that it's running undeclared police forces and said the locations provide services to its citizens living abroad, like renewing IDs and driver's licenses.

Gallagher said he hopes Saturday's event will ""draw attention to the issue"" but also put pressure on the Justice Department and the FBI.

""We want the FBI and DOJ to be acting aggressively to defend our sovereignty and, certainly, defend American citizens,"" Gallagher said.

Gallagher told Fox News Digital the ""least understood"" form of CCP aggression is its so-called ""United Front,"" which he said is a ""combination of intelligence and influence operations.""

""This is probably one of the most brazen expressions of it,"" Gallagher said of the strategy, which is used to influence foreign countries. ""They’re highly active in the United States, as well as is the Ministry of Public Security, which is China’s closest analogue to the KGB,"" he said.

Gallagher told Fox News Digital he plans to introduce legislation to give the FBI more tools to go after the CCP threat ""more aggressively.""

Gallagher acknowledged the work the FBI is already undertaking on China, and said ""people are starting to wake up.""

""We just need to make sure we have the right strategy,"" he said.

Gallagher said the legislation has not yet been introduced, but the framework would be to increase the penalties for criminal harassment if it is coming from a foreign adversary or being done on behalf of a foreign adversary like China, North Korea, Russia or Iran. The legislation could also increase the penalties for people failing to register as a foreign agent.

""There are already penalties that exist right now, but if you can increase the threshold, it would sort of practically force the FBI to tackle this more aggressively and have a deterrent effect,"" he said, noting legislation would allow the DOJ and FBI to ""go after these illegal police stations more aggressively.""

FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing last year he was aware of the stations’ existence and found the issue deeply concerning. But he declined to detail the bureau's investigative work on the matter.

""To me, it is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let's say, without proper coordination,"" Wray said. ""It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes.""

Gallagher said the Chinese threat is a bipartisan issue and said his committee will ""identify the bipartisan center of gravity"" to work on both sides of the aisle.

""The China discussion is a human rights issue. It is illegal targeting of certain groups and repression of certain groups,"" Gallagher said. ""I am cautiously optimistic we’re going to be able to operate in a very bipartisan fashion.""

Gallagher said he has been working with the Biden administration and is hopeful.

""I doubt I’m going to agree with the White House’s position on climate change any time soon, but there are issues we’re just going to have to agree to disagree but other areas where we can work together,"" Gallagher said, saying a ban on TikTok is one of those areas.

""I think we can find parts of the executive branch that we are aligned with and work with them, and where I disagree or where I feel like the White House is doing something that is undermining our posture with respect to the Chinese Communist Party, I feel I have a duty to speak out and be honest, not just to dunk on Biden, but hopefully to improve our policy,"" Gallagher said.

""We all want America to win this competition, and that’s what it is all about.""

GOP congressman warns of Chinese 'police stations' in US: 'How have we allowed this to happen?',"House China Select Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher hosted a press event Saturday at a former illegal Chinese Communist Party police station in downtown Manhattan.

""This innocent-looking building that you see behind me has an unauthorized secret police station linked to the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Gallagher. ""The nonprofit Safeguard Defenders discovered over 100 of these illegal police stations around the world, including at least two more on United States soil.""

Gallagher was joined by Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., and Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla. in an effort to shine a light on the threat the CCP poses to the United States and the need for the Biden administration to act ""aggressively"" to defend U.S. sovereignty.

Last year, the pan-Asian human rights organization Safeguard Defenders published an investigation called "" Patrol and Persuade "" that said another 48 Chinese police service stations were operating abroad in addition to the 54 the group had identified in September.

""It's rare to find someone who hasn't experienced at least some low-level form of digital harassment from CCP agents,"" Gallagher said at the Saturday press conference. ""How have we allowed this to happen on American soil? The answer, in my opinion, is that we have been blind while the CCP has been very cunning.""

He continued, ""They buy our politicians, multinational organizations, companies and in some cases, law enforcement. They use muscle and threats instead of persuasion. And like the Mafia, they aren't afraid to make people disappear.""

REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM BIDEN OFFICIALS ON REPORT CHINA OPENED POLICE ARM IN NYC

Reported locations of these illegal police stations span 53 countries , including four U.S.-based stations — two in New York City, one in Los Angeles and one set up by the Nantong Public Security Bureau in an undisclosed location.

Gallagher was joined by Chinese activist Zhuo Fengsuo, who was a student leader hunted by the CCP after participating in the protests that sparked the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

""This is the first time that the Chinese basic community feel that their grievance is heard by American public,"" Zhuo said after taking the podium.

CHINA HAS OPENED OVERSEAS POLICE STATIONS IN US AND CANADA TO MONITOR CHINESE CITIZENS: REPORT

Zhuo was forced into exile after being named one of the CCP's most wanted criminals for his participation in the student protests in 1989. He was arrested multiple times, beaten, and tortured by government officials.

""We want justice,"" Zhuo said. ""We cannot allow this to happen in America. We cannot allow this to happen. It is the land of the free and the brave. We are here because we believe in freedom. And we will fight for freedom.""

Torres also spoke on the issue, saying, ""Even though Chair Gallagher and I come from opposing political parties, the unity we are projecting sends a powerful message that the defense of human rights from the abuses of the CCP ... is not a Democratic value or a Republican value. It's an American value.""

""We are here because we're Americans who believe in the rule of law and human rights and freedom for every single person, including the Chinese dissidents here in the United States,"" Torres added.

Gallagher announced that the House China Select Committee will be holding a hearing, titled ""The Chinese Communist Party Threat to America,"" next week to take proactive measures against CCP actions in the U.S.

The committee hopes it will be a bipartisan collaboration.

""Nobody agrees on 100 percent of everything. I don't even agree with my own family on 100 percent of everything,"" Gallagher said. ""But we want to identify what the bipartisan center of gravity is.""

He concluded, ""We believe — and [House Speaker Kevin McCarthy] believes — that where possible, if Congress can speak with one voice when it comes to standing up against and pushing back against Chinese Communist Party aggression, America is stronger, the world is stronger, the free world is stronger.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-congressman-warns-of-chinese-police-stations-in-us-how-have-we-allowed-this-happen,N/A
Law enforcement groups skeptical police reform talks can succeed after Tyre Nichols death,"The nation's top law enforcement organizations are signaling that they are willing to work with Congress again to reach a bipartisan compromise on police reform following the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, but many are not optimistic that there will be a positive legislative outcome.

A first bipartisan push to reform policing in the wake of George Floyd's death led by Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., stalled in the Senate in 2021 due to disagreements between Republicans and Democrats. Now, lawmakers hope to revive reform negotiations following the brutal killing of Nichols, and charging of five police officers in conjunction with his death.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told ABC that Booker and Scott should ""sit down again quickly to see if we can revive that effort.""

""We need a national conversation about policing in a responsible, constitutional and humane way,"" Durbin said.

""Sen. Scott has been working on police funding and reform for the better part of the last decade,"" a spokesperson for Scott told Fox News Digital Monday evening. ""He never left the negotiating table and has encouraged his colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join him in his continued efforts to increase safety in our communities.""

FORMER MEMPHIS COP CHARGED IN TYRE NICHOLS' DEATH ALLEGEDLY BEAT UP INMATE IN 2015

Major Cities Chiefs Association Executive Director Laura Cooper told Fox News Digital that if Congress resumes negotiations, the MCCA ""stands ready"" to develop a ""bipartisan compromise.""

""The Association worked in good faith with leaders in the House and Senate to advance reform negotiations following the murder of George Floyd. Should Congress choose to restart these negotiations, the MCCA stands ready to help develop a bipartisan compromise that is evidence-based, sustainable, and thoughtful while ensuring law enforcement has the tools and resources it needs to keep our communities safe. Reform and public safety are not mutually exclusive, which is something MCCA members demonstrate every day,"" she said.

Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs' Association, called the death of Nichols ""horrible,"" and said the sheriffs have always been open to achieving a ""commonality of interests"" on reform, as they did by backing the Sen. Tim Scott bill in 2021.

""I think if there are those that are truly interested in getting to ‘yes,’ we are willing to try and achieve it,"" he said. ""If they are seeking nothing more than political gain, then perhaps they should rethink their strategies.""

However, Thompson warned that finding a consensus on police reform would be difficult.

""There are a lot of things that we have commonality of grounds here, and we certainly want to work with anybody who is seriously interested in making changes that are effective and that are lasting,"" Thompson said. ""The challenge I think we're all going to have is what are the lines in the sand that some on the Left are going to want, and what are the realities out of Washington?""

One of the challenges he said that will always pose a problem is the issue of qualified immunity, which he says many people don't understand.

SIXTH MEMPHIS POLICE OFFICER INVOLVED IN TYRE NICHOLS INVESTIGATION RELIEVED OF DUTY

""However, one of the challenges we will always face is that there are some that want to think that qualified immunity is the ‘be all end all.’ It is not. Qualified immunity will not prevent those individuals from being charged, will not prevent them from being either acquitted or prevent them from being found guilty. It has nothing to do with it because there's negligence,"" Thompson noted.

Qualified immunity prevents government officials from being sued for violating citizens' rights while reasonably doing their jobs, and it became a sticking point in the 2021 negotiations.

Gene Voegtlin, director of policy and governance for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, told Fox News Digital that the organization ""stands ready"" to restart negotiations.

""As our approach has always been, the IACP will meet with any stakeholder, anywhere, to improve policing and make communities safer. We stand ready to restart discussions to put forth federal legislation that is meaningful, evidence-informed, and deliberative,"" he said.

Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), called what happened to Nichols ""inhumane and indefensible"" and a clear ""criminal act.""

Cosme told Fox News Digital that the organization is ""engaging Congress on this, and we are in preliminary discussions that are being held and believe this is a critical and is critical to understanding the full context of use of force incidents.""

Whether reform stands a chance after stalled negotiations in 2021, Cosme said the ""divided Congress"" provides ""an opportunity for compromise and bipartisanship. And I think that that's possible.""

""Obviously, it's going to be difficult. But the professional vision and effectiveness of law enforcement on this issue matters to millions of Americans,"" he continued, noting that he has a meeting with Attorney General Merrick Garland Thursday to discuss further.

Pat Royal, spokesperson for the National Sheriffs' Association, told Fox News Digital that the ball is in Congress' court to get a reform bill across the finish line, after lawmakers dropped the ball in 2021.

""Sheriffs have been working with Congress every day over last two years to reform policing systems, and they look forward to continuing to have those conversations,"" Royal said.

""Every law officer wants their policing to be better — better trained, better equipped, better staffed, better led and better motivated. Any reform package must put better policing first,"" Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund President Jason Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""Most of the current proposals only seek to hinder law enforcement’s ability to protect and serve the public. This is not a productive 'reform' — in fact it’s counterproductive when crime is rising and many of the best officers are fleeing the profession.""

House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that there may not be anything Washington can do to prevent what happened to Nichols from happening again.

""I don't know that there's any law that can stop that evil that we saw,"" said Jordan. ""That is just I mean, just difficult to watch. What strikes me is just the lack of respect for human life. So I don't know that any law, any training, any reform is going to change.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week: ""We all must recommit ourselves to the critical work that must be done to advance meaningful reforms.""

Paul Pelosi video shows hammer attack after police arrive,"A California court on Friday released surveillance and bodycam video of the October 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at their San Francisco home.

The San Francisco County Superior Court made the footage public after Judge Stephen Murphy denied a request two days earlier by prosecutors to keep it secret.

The Oct. 28 attack sent Paul Pelosi, 82, to the hospital for emergency surgery on a skull fracture.

One portion of the footage shows police knocking on the door of Pelosi's home, before the door opens to reveal Paul Pelosi and suspect David DePape.

DAVID DEPAPE BREAKING INTO PELOSI HOME CAPTURED ON US CAPITOL POLICE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

""What's going on, man?"" an officer asks.

""Everything is good,"" DePape responds as he and Pelosi each have one hand on a hammer, with DePape also placing a hand on Pelosi's wrist. Pelosi appears to be holding an object in his other hand.

""Drop the hammer!"" the officer then says as he shines his flashlight at the two men.

""Umm, nope,"" DePape responds, before starting to pull the hammer away from Pelosi, who says, ""Hey! Hey, hey, hey!""

The hammer then breaks free and DePape is seen swinging it at Pelosi, who appears to attempt to retreat before being struck.

""Oh, s---!"" one of the officers says as police burst into the home and apprehend DePape.

Another clip, taken in black and white, shows DePape approaching the Pelosis' San Francisco house and dropping multiple bags onto the ground. He then rummaged through the bags before he apparently pulled a hammer out of his clothing and started swinging at a glass door, eventually entering the home.

DePape, 42, has pleaded not guilty to all state charges in the case, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. He also has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of assaulting an immediate family member of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal officer for the alleged home invasion.

FEDERAL INDICTMENT REVEALS WHAT PAUL PELOSI ATTACK SUSPECT WAS WEARING WHEN POLICE ARRIVED

Rep. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the incident.

When asked by reporters Friday for her reaction to the footage, she replied, ""I'm not going to say anything right now, but I may shortly.""

Fox News was among the news organizations pushing for the release of the videos.

Audio clips of a 911 call and a San Francisco Police interview with DePape also were released Friday alongside the videos.

""He was asleep. Like all that noise, he could not hear,"" DePape told a detective with the San Francisco Police Department when discussing the initial break-in.

""Until he basically wakes up,"" DePape continued, noting during the interview that Pelosi was in a bed.

""I kind of told him that I'm like looking for Nancy Pelosi and he was like, 'She's not here,' DePape also said. ""He was like, ‘How can we resolve this?'""

When San Francisco police arrived at the home around 2:30 a.m., they found Pelosi in his pajamas and the intruder wearing shorts, sneakers and a sweatshirt, according to court filings.

The encounter lasted just 15 seconds from when Pelosi opened the door for officers to when the hammer attack took place, according to a filing.

""The two officers opened the door to see the foyer of the Pelosi Residence, Mr. Pelosi, wearing a long-sleeved shirt, DEPAPE in shorts, running shoes and a sweatshirt, and DEPAPE and Mr. Pelosi jointly gripping a hammer,"" an indictment read.

The attack caused Pelosi to suffer a skull fracture and other injuries, according to authorities.

Police called an ambulance to treat Pelosi, who was bleeding from a head wound.

Investigators also said that DePape researched homes of Pelosi and two other targets on an alleged hit list two days before breaking into the House speaker’s $8 million hilltop Pacific Heights mansion.

Officers from the U.S. Capitol Police also had live video surveillance outside the Pelosis' San Francisco residence, but weren't watching it when DePape allegedly attacked Paul Pelosi, sources told Fox News shortly after the incident.

The officers were monitoring a live-feed of many cameras, which include surveillance of the Capitol complex, but also monitor some points away from the Capitol, which include the Pelosi residence.

According to sources, an officer was monitoring the feeds and saw police lights on a dark street outside the Pelosi residence. If the officers were watching the feed monitoring in real-time, the break-in would have been seen.

Police groups divided on Biden's executive order on law enforcement reform,"Large law enforcement organizations throughout the U.S. are weighing in on President Biden's new executive order on police reform, with some saying it's a step in the right direction and others expressing concerns that it's just ""political theater"" that will demoralize and endanger police officers.

Biden signed the ""Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices to Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety"" Wednesday afternoon on the two-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer.

The executive order ""is a measure of what we can do to heal the very soul of this nation,"" Biden said.

The executive order comes as crime rates are skyrocketing across the nation and a record number of police officers have been shot in the line of duty. Officers say morale is low among their departments and are having trouble hiring. It also comes several months after legislation to reform policing stalled in the Senate due to disagreements between Republican and Democratic lawmakers.

REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP UNVEILS 'BACK THE BLUE' LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES IN ANTICIPATION OF MIDTERMS RED WAVE

Senior administration officials have told Fox News that the action will target a wide range of reforms including: directing the Attorney General to establish a National Law Enforcement Accountability Database, banning the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints unless deadly force is authorized, restricting the use of no-knock entries, strengthening pattern and practice investigations and limiting the transfer of military vehicles and equipment to police departments.

The National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) told Fox News Digital that the organization was not consulted by the Biden administration in crafting the action.

NSA President Sheriff Vernon Stanforth said, ""There are potentially elements of this Order that make sense and could be beneficial to all law enforcement. However, Sheriffs are disappointed that the President chose opaqueness over transparency in drafting this order.""

""By choosing not to listen to elected law enforcement the President missed hearing from the rest of the Country. Unfortunately, [he] hand-picked who he and his staff would share the actual verbiage with and who they would take input from. Law enforcement operates in every county in America, not just in East and West coast cities.""

""This process leads us to believe the President had preconceived notions of our opinions and perspectives. Importantly, elected Sheriffs represent and protect 300,000,000 citizens, operate 90% of the Nation’s jails, protect 90%+ of the courthouses, and operate 90% of the 911 systems in the Nation. This effort can only be perceived to be biased against the nation’s 3,086 Sheriffs,"" continued Stanforth.

In addition, the National Police Association (NPA) called Biden's action ""political theater,"" which may endanger the lives of police officers and the public.

Spokesperson Sgt. Betsy Branter Smith told Fox News Digital that restrictions on military equipment transfers is ""one area in which, in the name of making the public safer, may endanger the lives of police and the public.""

""If the president is going to inhibit the ability of law enforcement agencies to obtain these lifesaving vehicles it is incumbent upon him personally to provide a substitute that will be equally effective in protecting police and the public,"" Smith said.

Smith told Fox News Digital: ""The death of George Floyd was tragic, our justice system has dealt harshly with those involved, and now isn’t the time to tell the public that American law enforcement is 'systematically racist' and needs to be further limited in our methods to stop the criminal activity that continues to plague our nation. It would be most helpful if the president would declare a war on crime so that criminals would once again know the president doesn’t have their back.""

Jason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF) told Fox News Digital: ""This Executive Order is a political response to activist demands. If the administration really wishes to help law enforcement improve its training and continue to increase professional standards, it can be done. But that requires working with law enforcement leadership and the various labor organizations that represent law enforcement officers.""

""I sincerely hope the administration will recognize that, while politically expedient, unjustified restraints on law enforcement has had and will have a deleterious effect on public safety.""

However, other law enforcement groups that were more involved behind the scenes in crafting the executive order are optimistic that it is a step in the right direction.

BIDEN TO SIGN POLICE REFORM EXECUTIVE ORDER ON TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER: REPORTS

The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) told Fox News Digital that they had been engaged in ""extensive discussions"" with the Biden administration to develop the executive order, saying that it ""marks a significant step in our continuing efforts to strengthen the trust of the public in police and the criminal justice system.""

""During our discussions, the IACP and FOP remained focused on communicating the challenges facing the policing profession and making clear that our profession is comprised of dedicated individuals who are committed to the preservation of human life, maintaining the highest ethical standards, and treating all individuals with dignity and respect, while holding themselves and others accountable for their actions,"" the groups said.

The organizations see the order as a ""blueprint"" for additional Congressional action and said they remain ""steadfast in our commitment to working with all interested parties who are willing to take an evidence -based approach to enact effective and lasting change to build a safer future for our communities and the men and women peace officers that serve them.""

""A broader approach to overall systemic issues needs to be a priority of all elected officials and, just as our organizations have done from the start, stand ready to work together to make the entirety of our criminal justice system fairer and more equitable for all,"" the IACP and FOP said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) also said the administration ""extensively consulted"" with MCCA while developing the executive order, but warned that executive action ""in lieu"" of congressional action is ""not a sustainable"" means of instituting change.

""Instituting effective and meaningful reform without jeopardizing law enforcement’s ability to keep our communities safe is exceptionally complex. Therefore, as this Executive Order moves to the implementation phase, the Administration must continue to collaborate with law enforcement stakeholders like the MCCA. It is critical to ensure implementation does not result in unfunded mandates or infringe on officer privacy, due process, or other important protections,"" the group said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""The MCCA has consistently held that executive action in lieu of congressional action is not a sustainable means of achieving and instituting change. Therefore, while today’s Executive Order is an important first step, the MCCA encourages Congress to come together to develop and pass bipartisan legislation that promotes transparency and accountability while supporting the brave officers who protect and serve our communities.""

The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association president Larry Cosme said the action ""will usher in a new era for federal law enforcement.""

The organization, which played ""an integral"" part in developing the executive order, says the order ""strikes the correct balance between understanding the public need for accountability and understanding the law enforcement needs for ensuring all communities are safe and protected.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland sent a memo to law enforcement agencies on Friday notifying them that the federal government has updated its use-of-force policies for the first time in nearly two decades.

""It is the policy of the Department of Justice to value and preserve human life. Officers may use only the force that is objectively reasonable to effectively gain control of an incident, while protecting the safety of the officer and others,"" the memo says , citing a 1989 Supreme Court ruling that established the standards for police use-of-force.

Portland struggles to rehire police after defunding and riots,"The Portland Police Bureau is struggling to rehire recently retired police officers after slashing the police budget amid protests following the death of George Floyd.

Only 2 retired police officers out of the 81 who were asked to return to the force by Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell expressed a willingness to do so and several lashed out in response to the request, according to The Oregonian .

PORTLAND ANTIFA RIOTER CHARGED WITH ASSAULTING POLICE HAS CASE DISMISSED AFTER 30 HOURS COMMUNITY SERVICE

Lovell urged the retired officers who had left the force since August 2020 to return in a letter last month to consider returning saying that they left ""at a time of great despair for the Bureau and the City of Portland.""

One of the retired officers who retired last May, Stephanie D. Hudson, responded to the request by calling it ""laughable"" and said she was offended by a part of the letter referencing the city’s ban on bringing back officers who went against policy by ""cooperating with federal agents to attack Portland residents.""

""Your letter indicates that nothing has changed. It simply highlights why those who could leave, did leave. I suspect it will take a decade or more to repair the damage that has been done,"" Hudson said.

The Police Bureau has been struggling to hire officers as quickly as they are losing them and now has 96 vacancies in its budget of 882 sworn officers which represents the lowest authorized strength in almost 30 years.

Shortly after Portland disbanded its gun violence reduction team on July 1, 2020, shootings increased and homicide hit a 30-year high. Portland Police Association President Daryl Turner told Fox News in September 2020 that Portland Mayor and police commissioner Ted Wheeler realized defunding the police force ""was a mistake.""

PORTLAND BAR OWNER SAYS BUSINESS ROBBED THREE TIMES IN A MONTH: WE'RE 'ON OUR OWN'

In November 2021, the Portland City Council approved $448,000 to hire back 25 retired officers as part of its fall budget adjustment.

Police officers in Portland were tasked with combating over 100 straight days of violent protests and riots carried out by Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists during the summer of 2020, many of which involved rioters attacking police officers and burning police stations.

""We’re dealing with rioting at a level and sustained violence that we’ve never seen before,"" Turner said last year, adding that morale within the Portland Police Department ""is as bad as it’s ever been before.""

In a statement to Fox News in response to The Oregonian report, a spokesperson for thePortland Police Department said, ""The retire/rehire program is an ongoing program. This article refers to those who received letters who had already retired since August of 2020. Many had already moved or gone on to other jobs. This program will continued to be offered to those who are eligible to retire this year.""

A similar impasse between retired officers and the current police department arose in Austin, Texas, last year where the city council also voted to slash police funding by 30%.

Austin asked about 30 retired officers to come back to the force as the city was shattering its previous homicide record and none of the former officers accepted the officer.

""I am personally offended by your offer,"" one former officer wrote in a letter obtained by Fox News in response to the city’s offer of $5,000 plus extra benefits for returning to duty. ""I did not leave APD for money. I suspect my peers did not either. No amount of money could make me return. The offer from the chief shows just how out of touch he is with his officers. What we crave is leadership. The one thing that has been consistently withheld.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/portland-struggles-rehire-police-after-defunding-riots,N/A
Republicans demand answers from Biden officials on report China opened police arm in NYC,"FIRST ON FOX: Several Republican House lawmakers sent a letter to Biden Cabinet Secretaries Antony Blinken and Merrick Garland demanding answers on a reported Chinese police presence in New York City.

Republican Study Committee chairman Jim Banks of Indiana alongside Reps. Michael Waltz of Florida and Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin led the letter to Garland and Blinken demanding answers on why China’s Fuzhou police were reportedly able to open a U.S.-based police arm.

""The Department of Justice and State Department must explain why the Biden administration has allowed CCP police to set up an office on U.S. soil,"" Banks told Fox News Digital in a statement.

CHINA HAS OPENED OVERSEAS POLICE STATIONS IN US AND CANADA TO MONITOR CHINESE CITIZENS: REPORT

""When Republicans take back the House, we will hold the Biden administration accountable for their continued efforts to aid and abet the Chinese Communist Party,"" he added.

Waltz told Fox News Digital it is ""mind-boggling that we are allowing China’s Fuzhou police to operate on American soil.""

""The Chinese Communist Party uses these stations to go after political dissidents abroad, while also endangering the national security of the United States,"" Waltz said in a statement. ""We must protect the American people and Chinese freedom activists from the CCP’s gross abuse of the American justice system,"" he added.

Gallagher warned in a statement that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ""has used Fuzhou overseas police service stations to push propaganda and spy on Chinese citizens abroad.""

""The presence of one of these stations in New York City not only raises serious human rights concerns, but also raises concerns about whether the United States is allowing a hostile foreign adversary to conduct its own law enforcement activities within our borders,"" the Wisconsin Republican continued.

""The State Department must divulge the extent of their knowledge of this station, it’s actions against American-Chinese citizens and communities, and the threat it may pose to our national security,"" he added.

In the letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the lawmakers wrote of their ""grave concern over reports of the law enforcement presence"" from China in New York City, noting the ""Public Security (Police) Bureau of Fuzhou, China, announced in January 2022 that it has opened the ‘first batch’ of 30 overseas police service stations in 25 cities in 21 countries,"" with the U.S. branch hosted at the American ChangLe Association, a Chinese overseas hometown association founded in 1998 that ""shoulders the mission of uniting the villagers, fighting for their legitimate rights and interests, promoting the prosperity and stability of the overseas Chinese settlements, and acting as a bridge for the villagers to get rich through hard work,"" according to its website.

""According to a recent report by Safeguard Defenders , a human rights NGO based in Spain, overseas Chinese hometown associations have become overwhelmingly co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front organizations which seek increasing control over the Chinese diaspora (despite providing some genuine services to local Chinese communities),"" the lawmakers wrote.

""The report indicates that at least some of those Chinese hometown associations hosting the overseas police service stations are linked to the CCP’s United Front,"" they continued. ""It is deeply troubling that the Chinese government could use these service stations as its long arm policing abroad.""

The Republicans pointed to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2018 report detailing how the ""CCP’s United Front Work Department has worked to suppress the free speech rights of U.S. persons protesting against"" them.

They also warned about Beijing’s coercion and bullying activities to push the CCP’s narrative that sometimes verges into illegal actions.

""According to Peter Mattis, a research fellow at Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, CCP intimidation and efforts to promote Beijing’s narrative ‘sometimes crosses the line into criminal actions, such as conspiracy against rights,’"" the Republicans wrote.

""The U.S. Department of State has similarly found that the CCP’s United Front Work Department funds and supports overseas organizations to spread propaganda and coerces and bullies those who would oppose Beijing’s policies. In 2018, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and individuals active in United Front Work Department’s nefarious activities.""

Banks and his fellow Republicans warned that ""Fuzhou overseas police service stations (including their online form) are reportedly involved in fulfilling Chinese law enforcement functions at least in some countries"" and ""coerce purported Chinese fugitives abroad to return to China to face legal proceedings, which is euphemistically dubbed as ‘persuading to return’ in Chinese parlance.""

""There should be no room for the Chinese government to exercise extraterritorial law enforcement unilaterally on U.S. soil,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""In 2018 the U.S. government provided the Chinese government with specific requirements for contacting state and local law enforcement in the United States.""

""In 2020 the Chinese government’s campaign illegally targeting U.S. residents to force their return to China had become so severe that the FBI issued an internal memorandum on this issue. The Chinese overseas police service station established in New York City earlier this year appears to be a further step of China’s illicit long arm policing on U.S. soil that violates our sovereignty.""

The Republicans concluded their letter with several questions to Austin and Blinken, including whether ""the Department of State, Department of Justice, or any other agency of the federal government invite or approve China’s Fuzhou police to establish a presence in New York City.""

Joining Banks, Waltz and Gallagher on the letter are 18 of their fellow House Republicans, including Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Greg Murphy of North Carolina, and Clay Higgins of Louisiana.

China’s police presence in New York City is a symptom of the overall larger issue of the CCP’s growing influence abroad.

Soros group pours $500K into campaign to oppose reinstating Austin police units that were defunded,"The advocacy group founded by liberal billionaire financier George Soros has dumped $500,000 into a campaign to defeat a proposal in Austin, Texas, that would bulk up the city’s police department.

Proposition A, an Austin ballot proposal for the Nov. 2 election backed by the group Save Austin Now, would require at least two Austin police officers for every 1,000 residents and would provide officers with an additional 40 hours of police training each year on topics such as weapons proficiency and active shooter scenarios.

AUSTIN, TEXAS, POLICE TO STOP RESPONDING TO NONEMERGENCIES BEGINNING TODAY

According to financial records reviewed by Fox News, Soros’ Open Society Policy Center last week donated $500,000 to Equity Austin, a group that is working to defeat Proposition A.

""It sickens me that out of town billionaires are able to swoop into Austin to fight against citizen-led ballot initiatives,"" Austin City Council member Mackenzie Kelly said in a statement to Fox News. ""The purpose of our city’s charter is to allow regular, everyday people to fight for what they believe in when the city council fails them.""

The co-founders of Save Austin Now used the Soros opposition as a fundraising point with supporters.

""Massive out-of-state funding for our opponents show two things: That Austin donors won’t fund the anti-Prop A campaign and that the stakes in this effort to restore public safety to Austin could not be higher,"" Matt Mackowiak and Cleo Petricek said in a joint statement. ""We are now going to fight twice as hard and we hope all our supporters will as well.""

In the wake of the George Floyd protests last year, the Austin City Council voted to cut up to $150 million from its police department budget – a little more than a third of its total budget – and reinvest that money into other public services. The department was partially refunded earlier this year, but not all of the units that were cut came back.

'Squad' Dem Cori Bush praises St. Louis' 'historic' vote to 'defund' police,"As St. Louis moved to eliminate millions in police funding, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., applauded the ‘historic’ vote to ‘defund’ police.

""Today’s decision to defund the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department is historic. It marks a new future for our city,"" Bush said in a statement.

""For decades, our city funneled more and more money into our police department under the guise of public safety, while massively underinvesting in the resources that will truly keep our communities safe, the ‘Squad’ member continued.

""But even as more and more money has gone into policing, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department continues to be the deadliest police force in the nation, year after year — all while violence in our communities continues to skyrocket.""

Reports show that St. Louis police were responsible for more killings per capita any of the 100 largest police departments, with about 18 people killed by police per million residents, according to a report by Arch City Defenders. But St. Louis also frequently ranks as among the most dangerous cities in America and suffered 194 homicides in 2019.

CORI BUSH DEFENDS RIOT AT ST LOUIS CITY JAIL

Mayor Tishaura Jones proposed a move that would cut $4 million from the St. Louis Police Department and eliminate 98 vacant officer positions. The plan passed the Board of Estimate and Apportionment 2-1 and now goes to the Board of Alderman, the legislative body of the city, for hearings and possible amendments, before it’s set to take effect July 1.

The plan moves $4 million out of the $171 million police budget to be used for affordable housing, homeless services, a victims’ support program, and civil rights enforcement.

200 SEATTLE POLICE OFFICERS QUIT OVER LAST YEAR

Jones said that under the proposal, no police officers will lose their jobs. The budget leaves about 50 vacant positions in place, mostly to account for the nearly 40 cadets who are currently in the police academy. The positions that are being cut have been vacant for at least 12 years, according to Jones.

Acting Oakland police chief steps down after two days on the job amid sex scandal,"Another Oakland, Calif. police chief stepped down Friday, after just two days on the job amid an ongoing sex scandal that has rocked the department.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said at a news conference that Acting Police Chief Paul Figueroa would revert back to police captain and resign as acting police chief and assistant.

Figueroa is the third chief to be replaced in the last nine days amid a sex scandal that Schaaf said involved “disgusting allegations” that a number of officers had sex with a teenage prostitute.

Schaaf said at a news conference that her job is to “run a police department, not a frat house.”

She appointed Figueroa Wednesday after abruptly removing the interim police chief, Ben Fairow, after learning unspecified information that led her to lose confidence in his ability to run the beleaguered department.

Fairow, previously spent 21 years as an officer in Oakland, was appointed after Chief Sean Whent resigned last Thursday after news of the scandal broke.

An 18-year-old woman has alleged in multiple news media interviews that two dozen current and former officers in five cities had sex with her while she worked as a prostitute. Encounters with three of the officers took place when she was a minor, the woman has said.

Before his sudden resignation last week, former chief Whent revealed that an Oakland officer's September suicide had led the department's internal affairs division to open an investigation into whether any current officers committed sexual misconduct with a minor.

Officer Brendan O'Brien killed himself a little more than a year after police say his wife, Irma Huerta-Lopez, also took her life. Whent did not specify how O'Brien's suicide led to the sexual misconduct probe.

Two officers with the historically troubled Oakland department have resigned, and three others remain on paid leave in the sex misconduct case.

City Administrator Sabrina Landreth was put in charge of the department, according to KTVU. The commanding staff will now have to report to Landreth.

The mayor also revealed Friday that she plans to “root out this toxic macho culture” within, but not exclusive to the Oakland Police Department.

According to KTVU, Schaaf was referring to a separate investigation involving “African-American” police officers who sent, “inappropriate” racist text messages. She said they weren’t acceptable from anyone wearing the badge.

Schaaf insisted that the new texting investigation was separate from the sex scandal and that the investigation should be completed within a week or two.

She said the texting incident wasn’t as widespread as the sex scandal.

Atlanta police officer recounts providing CPR to cyclist who collapsed in road: 'I'm praying the whole time',"A Georgia police officer is being hailed a hero after he revived a cyclist who collapsed on the road while he was on patrol in southwest Atlanta last Saturday.

Atlanta Police Officer Jaleel Tulloch told FOX 5 Atlanta he was having a ""regular, normal"" day when he stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Sandtown Road and Central Villa Drive. While stopped, Officer Tulloch motioned for a man on a bike to cross in front of his car.

Seconds later, the man collapsed on the road. Noticing the man was struggling to breathe and not moving, Tulloch said he could immediately tell this was a ""life-or-death situation"" and he jumped out of his car.

""You could see in his face. He was like, ‘Do not let me die. Just do everything you can for me,'"" Tulloch said.

Tulloch immediately started chest compressions and started talking to the man who appeared to be fading in and out of consciousness, ""Come on. Stay. Come on. You alright?""

The officer told FOX 5 he could tell the man was scared, so he kept calling out his name, so the man knew he was still there.

""As I’m doing it, I’m praying the whole time,"" Tulloch said.

Austin City Council passes temporary ordinance to fund police after contract negotiations break down,"The Austin City Council passed a temporary ordinance guaranteeing wages and benefits for police officers on Thursday after contract negotiations for a long term deal broke down with the police union earlier this month.

The Austin Police Association had been in discussions with city leaders about a four-year contract for several months, but the city council ditched that deal after firing former city manager Spencer Cronk on Feb. 15.

Police officials warned that the absence of a long-term contract could exacerbate the department's ongoing vacancy problems and the union walked away from talks for a shorter one-year deal.

Mayor Kirk Watson said Thursday that he is ""asking the Association to come back to the negotiating table.""

""Nobody, me included, thinks this is a perfect solution, but inaction is not an option. Our community needs to be safe and feel safe,"" Watson said after the ordinance was passed on Thursday.

AUSTIN MAYOR EMRBOILED IN FIGHT WITH POLICE OFFICIALS AMID FALLOUT OVER STREET TAKEOVER, CONTRACT DISPUTE

The ordinance instructs interim City Manager Jesus Garza to implement a base pay increase for all officers below the rank of assistant chief, a signing bonus for new cadets, and a retention strategy to keep officers employed.

The ordinance also establishes the city's Office of Police Oversight as an ""investigator permitted by state law to review allegations of police officer misconduct.""

Just days before Cronk was fired, he warned city council in a memo that dropping the four-year contract would damage the department's ""recruiting and retention efforts"" and that the ""council cannot simply pass an ordinance that contradicts state law."" APD is already deeply short-staffed, both due to a shortage of officers before the city council voted to gut its budget by about one-third and canceled cadet classes in 2020, and by a large exodus that followed after the defunding.

Austin City Council Member Ryan Alter, who authored the ordinance that passed Thursday, said that the city governments retains ""certain powers under state and local law to implement oversight.""

Austin City Council just voted to cut up to $150 million from its police department,"Austin, Texas became the latest city to defund the police Thursday when the city council voted unanimously to cut up to $150 million from its police deparment budget -- about 34% of its current total -- and reinvest the funds in other services, The Texas Tribune reported.

According to the proposal, there is an immediate $21.5 million cut that will be reinvested in a wide array of programs, including mental health response, permanent supportive housing, food access, abortion access, an early childhood coordinator position and violence prevention.

Another roughly $80 million will go into a “Decouple Fund” that will transfer many civilian services, like forensic sciences and victim services, outside of the police department.

PORTLAND POLICE STILL CLEARING TEAR GAS RESIDUE, TOXINS FROM STREETS

The rest of the money, about $49 million, will go into a “Reimagine Safety Fund,” the goal of which “is to divert dollars from the fund toward alternative forms of public safety and community support, through the yearlong reimagining process.” The shift in funds related to the Decouple Fund and Reimagine Safety Fund will occur mostly over the next year.

The Austin Police Association tweeted that the proposal is “ridiculous and unsafe” and ignores “the majority who do not want the police defunded.”

Activists who have been calling for the police to be defunded weren’t happy with the final agreement either. Communities of Color United, an Austin activist group, was calling for a 50% divestment, which amounts to $220 million. They also said a majority of the funds are an accounting shift that will allow the police to still access them in the near-term.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Thursday during the meeting with City Council that this was not about disrespecting the police department.

Austin is just the latest American city to take steps towards defunding the police in the wake of George Floyd’s death while in custody of Minneapolis police in May.

The nation’s two largest cities, New York and Los Angeles, were among the first to take action. The New York City Council approved in June a $1 billion cut for the NYPD’s spending as part of its $88.19 billion citywide budget for 2021. CBS Los Angeles reported July 1 that the Los Angeles City Council approved a $150 million budget cut to the LAPD as part of its $10.5 billion citywide budget.

The Associated Press reported this week that Seattle’s first black female police chief, Carmen Best, resigned Monday hours after the Seattle City Council voted to cut her annual salary by $10,000 and let go of as many as 100 police officers. Best said her decision to quit was ""about the overarching lack of respect for the officers.”

The Washington Post reported last week that Minneapolis’s plans to defund the police were put on hold when a city commission blocked the city council from putting a measure on the ballot in November that would have eliminated the city charter requirement of a certain number of police officers. A majority of the city council voiced support for replacing its police department with a new agency with a “public health-oriented approach” to public safety.

Several other cities, including Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Portland, San Francisco, and others have taken steps towards defunding the police following a wave of protests against police brutality and systemic racism worldwide this summer.

TEXAS TRAIN DERAILS IN COLLISION WITH 18-WHEELER, LEAVING DRIVER DEAD

The Austin Police Department's emergency communications division has been dealing with a staffing crisis for several months, with the 911 call center lowering its minimum staffing requirements last August due to ""unprecedented vacancy rates.""

In October, the average hold time for 911 calls in Austin was two-and-a-half minutes. Only about two-thirds of 911 calls were answered within 15 seconds that month, far below the national standard of 90% in 15 seconds or less.

Kelly and Alter were the only two council members this week to vote against a one-year contract extension between the city and the Austin Police Association.

Nine other council members voted in favor of the one-year extension on the current contract, which will expire at the end of March.

The union, which is against the temporary extension, had been in negotiations with the city on a four-year agreement, but that deal appeared to fall through after the termination of City Manager Spencer Cronk last week.

""We can improve reasonable police oversight. Accountability is critical to maintain the bonds of trust between police and the community,"" Council member Kelly, who is in favor of the four-year contract, said Sunday.

""But the simple fact is that we need more police officers in this city, patrolling our streets, downtown, and major events. We need more police responding to calls for service. We need more police to reinstate specialized units. This must be an urgent priority for the new mayor and the city council.""

Mayor Kirk Watson, who took office last month, has not commented publicly on the street racing takeover and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday afternoon.

Austin's city council and then-Mayor Steve Adler voted to slash APD's funding by about one-third during the 2020 riots at the height of the ""defund the police"" movement. That vote was supported by an activist coalition led by groups including the Austin Justice Coalition. APD's funding was later restored in order to comply with a state law passed in 2021, but by then, officers had left APD in droves, specialized units were reduced or disbanded, and cadet classes had been canceled, so the departed officers could not be replaced.

Additionally, Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza has indicted more than a dozen APD officers for actions taken to quell the 2020 riots, which damaged the state capitol, blocked major thoroughfares downtown, and threatened police headquarters.

"Austin police seize drugs, guns in street takeover aftermath as chief says force is understaffed every night","The Austin Police Department seized meth, marijuana, and multiple guns during six arrests related to the downtown street takeover on Saturday night, APD Chief Joseph Chacon announced Tuesday.

Two people were taken into custody Saturday for evading arrest and officers arrested four others on Sunday while investigating the takeover, in which car clubs blocked off intersections, drifted in the middle of the street, and set off fireworks.

Chief Chacon said that additional tactical drills were carried out on Sunday to ensure that his officers are prepared for any future takeover events, but noted that the department is hamstrung by vacancies.

""On any given night, we are going out understaffed right now, and I'm talking about minimum staffing levels. I'm not even talking about optimal staffing levels,"" Chacon said at a press conference on Tuesday.

""Because of that, I've had to be moving people from specialized units and from investigations back to patrol temporarily on a short term basis to answer 911 calls, and then go back to the regular assignments.""

FIRED AUSTIN CITY MANAGER WARNED MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL ABOUT POLICE STAFFING DAYS AHEAD OF STREET TAKEOVER

Car clubs took over intersections in four different parts of Austin between 9:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. As officers responded, crowds threw rocks, bottles, and pointed lasers at them, injuring one officer and damaging several police vehicles.

APD's 911 call center received 390 calls between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m., leading to long waits of up to over 27 minutes, Chacon said, noting that they received just 65 911 calls the previous Saturday.

""This is obviously unacceptable,"" Chacon said. ""We've been working on the call taking issue for quite some time. We've made strides and are getting more applicants than at any time in recent history, but it takes time to hire them and to train them. And as you can see, we still have shortages.""

The takeovers were organized by several car clubs from Austin and other Texas cities, including one from San Antonio that told attendees to ""drive safe and remember #f---thepolice.""

"Baltimore police staffing crisis hits dire levels, FOP boss and judge warn: 'Undercover' defunding","The Baltimore Police Department lost hundreds of officers last year, sparking a judge and police leadership to sound the alarm that the rate of cops leaving the force is unsustainable, and the city cannot bear to lose even more in 2023.

""I can't overstate the seriousness of the staffing issue,"" Judge James K. Bredar said during a police consent decree hearing this month, according to CBS News.

Baltimore lost about 279 officers in 2022, according to the judge, and currently has 2,150 officers on the force. All in, the city is short at least 600 officers, according to Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police President Mike Mancuso.

""We just can't take a hit like that in 2023,"" Bredar said.

BALTIMORE SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, 5 INJURED, INCLUDING 2 CHILDREN: ‘FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES’

The Baltimore Police Department needs to ""make BPD the highest paid Police Department in the area,"" ""working conditions need to improve drastically,"" and city’s retention policies need to be overhauled to monetarily incentivize cops to stay on the force, Mancuso said of the staffing shortages, CBS reported.

JOHNS HOPKINS WARNS OF 'DISTURBING INCREASE IN SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES' AROUND BALTIMORE CAMPUSES

If that is not done, Mancuso said, ""we can all be assured that the mayor and commissioner are just defunding that Baltimore Police Department in an undercover manner and have no concern for the safety of the public.""

The city recorded 333 homicides last year and 688 non-fatal shootings. The figures are slightly lower than 2021, when 337 homicides and 726 non-fatal shootings were recorded, as well as in 2020 when 335 homicides and 721 nonfatal shootings were recorded.

Baltimore also landed in the second spot of a WalletHub study published this month titled ""Cities with the Biggest Homicide Rate Problems,"" which compared 45 of the largest U.S. cities based on per capita homicides in Q4 2022, as well as per capita homicides in Q4 2022 vs. Q4 2021 and Q4 2020.

There have already been at least 22 homicides so far this year.

Mancuso said the staffing shortage has already worsened this year, when four officers walked into the Southwest District and resigned earlier this month. They took positions at the Anne Arundel County Police Department ""for better working conditions and pay,"" Mancuso said.

FORMER BALTIMORE STATE'S ATTORNEY MARILYN MOSBY'S ENTIRE LEGAL TEAM SEEKS TO WITHDRAW FROM CASE

The FOP boss added that since Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison took the position more than four years ago, the police department has lost more than 300 officers than the number of officers that have been hired, CBS reported.

Harrison said he is aware of the staffing problems and is ""pounding the table"" to fix the issues.

""It's bigger than the police department can solve,"" Bredar added.

FORMER TOP BALTIMORE PROSECUTOR MARILYN MOSBY'S REQUEST FOR VENUE CHANGE IN PERJURY TRIAL DENIED

An official with the Baltimore Police Department provided Fox News Digital with the department's union contract and a recent press release on hiring and retention incentives that show a $5,000 signing bonus for new recruits, a housing allowance, a student loan assistance program, and a $5,000 referral bonus program.

""This is about making a smart investment that should significantly enhance our efforts in attracting new recruits, while also incentivizing retention for our experienced officers,"" Harrison said, according to the press release provided to Fox.

""This regime, at the BPD, is in full survival mode due to a net loss of over 300 police officers under PC Harrison’s watch."" — Mike Mancuso, Baltimore City FOP president

""We want to reward our officers for their hard work in attracting new employees to join the Department,"" the release stated.

""I am committed to improving working conditions, living conditions and the quality of life for all of our personnel and the residents of Baltimore. Together, we will show that the BPD is the Greatest Law Enforcement Agency in America.""

The BPD official said that the department's starting salary ""is the highest in the state,"" and pushed back that comments from the police union were not ""factually correct.""

Mancuso told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that ""there is no doubt that the BPD is telling you that my post was not ‘factually correct,’"" slamming the incentives as a ""pittance of what is needed.""

TYRE NICHOLS: TIM SCOTT BLAMES DEMS FOR FAILED POLICE REFORM MEANT TO ENSURE ‘ONLY THE BEST WEARING THE BADGE'

""I checked on those numbers today and they hold firm with more BPD officers in the pipeline to lateral to [Anne Arundel] County,"" Mancuso said. ""This regime, at the BPD, is in full survival mode due to a net loss of over 300 police officers under PC Harrison’s watch. Crime is still out of control, as one would expect from there being no plan to address violent crime, for the past 4 years, and an exodus of officers.

""The incentives they listed are a pittance of what is needed and not one incentive to retain officers. I believe that these are nothing more than a way for them to say we are trying but in reality its just a way to continue to defund the BPD,"" he continued.

Community members have also sounded the alarm on the police staffing crisis, with local mom and teacher Blanca Tapahuasco attending the police consent decree hearing to hear updates on the force following the shootings of 12 teenagers this year.

California man accused of throwing Molotov cocktail at police,"A California man was arrested Wednesday night after allegedly throwing a Molotov cocktail at police.

At approximately 5:40 p.m. on Wednesday, officers with the Corning Police Department began investigating a loud banging noise that was coming from outside the police department on the 700 block of Fourth Street.

The suspect, later identified as 32-year-old Cassidy Russ, began ""fumbling with an item near the front of his waistband,"" the police department said in a press release. As the officers gave the suspect verbal commands, Russ lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it toward police. The Molotov cocktail missed the officer and exploded near a parked vehicle.

Police say that Russ was observed by an officer walking away from the police department following the deployment of the bomb and onto Solano Street.

Authorities say officers pursued Russ after observing him near the department. An off duty officer tackled Russ on the 1300 block of Solano Street, but Russ continued to resist arrest by concealing his hands by his waistband and backpack.

Officers used baton strikes and pain compliance techniques to subdue Russ, who continued to resist arrest, police said. Officers eventually took Russ into custody by placing him in handcuffs under sustained resistance.

According to the Corning Police Department, this wasn't the first time Russ tossed a Molotov cocktail toward cops. Russ had an active arrest warrant for a previous incident in late July when he threw a Molotov cocktail near where the police department stages marked patrol cars.

California prostitution crisis: Police chief calls for repeal of law as teens caught up in sex trafficking,"San Diego’s police chief blasted a controversial new California law that cops blame for sparking brazen prostitution on the streets of cities across the Golden State.

The law that went into effect last month allows people to loiter with the intent of engaging in prostitution, Chief Dave Nisleit said – and that includes traffickers, sex buyers and sex workers.

""New state laws make recovering trafficking victims more difficult while emboldening their traffickers,' Nisleit told reporters at a Tuesday news conference. ""Your law enforcement officers are fighting an uphill battle when it comes to human trafficking.""

Local leaders in the San Diego area this week were celebrating a successful month-long investigation into human trafficking and prostitution that nabbed 48 arrests and identified 41 suspected victims of trafficking and sex exploitation. Among those rescued were children, including one girl who was only 13 years old.

""It needs to be repealed,"" the police chief said of the new law. ""We’re talking about a young lady who, by the age of 13, has fallen victim to this. How many more victims do we need to have in sex trafficking before we realize this is not a good law? We can address the disparities in a different manner.""

AS CALIFORNIA POLICE FIGHT RAMPANT PROSTITUTION, JOHNS LINE UP LIKE THEY'RE AT A 'FAST-FOOD DRIVE-THROUGH'

Nisleit added said he is planning to ""formally request"" the law be repealed.

Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener authored the law, which he said aimed to protect transgender women allegedly disproportionately targeted by police. The law took effect on Jan. 1 and repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution.

""[The previous law] allowed police officers to arrest a person, not based on what they did, but based solely on how a person looks,"" Wiener recently told KGO-TV. ""So, an officer could arrest someone because they were wearing tight clothing, high heels and extra lipstick.""

CALIFORNIA CITIES RATTLED BY PROSTITUTION, HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AS COPS PIN BLAME ON NEW LAW

San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan also slammed the new law during the Tuesday press conference.

""Do you know that the traffickers and the buyers were boasting on social media that because of the decriminalization new law that they just openly sell human beings for sex on our streets? Not in San Diego County,"" Stephan said.

CALIFORNIA PROSTITUTION LAW ALLOWS SEX ABUSE TO 'RUN RAMPANT' IN LOS ANGELES STREETS, VICTIM ADVOCATES WARN

Stephan said she visited areas known for prostitution and witnessed ""young women being openly trafficked in broad daylight"" while johns ""lined up like they were going through a fast-food drive-through.""

She celebrated how young girls who became victims of trafficking were rescued, and cited specifically how a 17-year-old girl and her pregnant 21-year-old sister were rescued during the operation.

""This means day and night, safeguarding people, safeguarding their dignity, demanding that people stop buying people for sex,"" Stephan said. ""Demanding that traffickers not threaten a pregnant woman and her 17-year-old sister and force them onto the street to prostitute, while pregnant. Unacceptable – will not happen in San Diego County.""

Two 16-year-old runaway girls from Arizona were also rescued during the operation, after they were allegedly forced into prostitution by physical harm and sexual abuse.

""Buyers beware: It is a crime to buy human beings for sex,"" Stephan said. ""They're not pizza and they're not a hamburger. They’re people.""

Police leaders and Republicans in California have also pinned blame on the law for the apparent spike in brazen prostitution in cities including Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Wiener, however, has stuck by the bill and pushed back against such criticisms.

""The police's hands are not tied,"" Wiener previously told local media. ""They can arrest people for soliciting, they can cite vehicles that are stopped in the middle of the street, they can arrest ‘johns,’ they can arrest pimps.""

The Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking (CAST), a long-standing group that advocates for survivors of sex and labor trafficking, supported the bill and previously told Fox News Digital that it endorsed repealing the former policy ""because we know that reducing the criminalization of survivors will help prevent human trafficking.""

""Traffickers rely on our systems to criminalize victims so that they are unable to access safety due to their records and are vulnerable to continued exploitation,"" Leigh LaChapelle, CAST's associate director of survivor advocacy, told Fox News.

CALIFORNIA PROSTITUTION LAW ALLOWS SEX ABUSE TO 'RUN RAMPANT' IN LOS ANGELES STREETS, VICTIM ADVOCATES WARN

""The impact of these encounters with law enforcement reinforce already heightened stigma when someone is arrested for this offense due to the difficulties securing employment and safe housing with an arrest record relating to the sex trade,"" LaChapelle added. ""Violation of [the previous] discriminatory law also puts immigrants in jeopardy of deportation, loss of residency or denial of reentry due to a misdemeanor conviction.""

Nisleit countered that the new law hamstrings officers from making contact with potential victims to rescue them from sex slavery.

""We're seeing victims of young age having their lives completely destroyed,"" the chief said. ""And our ability to address this is difficult.

Authorities in San Diego County arrested 48 people in a trafficking and sexual exploitation investigation across San Diego and National City from Jan. 9 to Feb. 10.

""Young women being openly trafficked in broad daylight, with individuals paying for sex lined up like they were going through a fast-food drive-through,"" San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan said at a news conference Tuesday. ""It’s an unacceptable situation.""

The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force led ""Operation Better Pathways,"" assisted by law enforcement officials at the local, state and federal level.

CALIFORNIA CITIES RATTLED BY PROSTITUTION, HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AS COPS PIN BLAME ON NEW LAW

Officials carried out a total of 17 stings in the county, focusing on areas such as Dalbergia Street in San Diego, Naval Base San Diego and Roosevelt Avenue in National City, the Los Angeles Times reported.

""What I saw was what drove me to be a prosecutor in the first place,"" Stephan added. ""What I saw was that look in the eyes of human beings like they are products, products with hardly any clothing on. Lines of cars like this is some kind of… buying a hamburger at a 24/7 place. But these are human beings.""

A total of 39 people were arrested for misdemeanors related to allegedly buying sex, while nine people were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking of a minor and assault with a deadly weapon.

Officials also identified 41 suspected victims of human trafficking or sex exploitation — eight of whom were children, including one girl who was only 13 years old.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta also attended the press conference, lauding officials for their work and highlighting that ""we're fighting to hold perpetrators accountable, and help survivors get a fresh start.""

The young girls and women suspected of being victims of human trafficking were offered support services, according to local leaders.

""The criminals who were taken down as part of this operation abused and exploited women for their own enrichment,"" San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said at the press conference. ""We will continue to disrupt these criminal operations that seek to do our people in our communities harm.""

The officials in San Diego sounding the alarm on human trafficking and prostitution concerns are far from alone. Local leaders and residents in Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco have also spoken out that brazen prostitution and human trafficking in California are spiraling in the wake of a new law that took effect last month.

""I get the call saying, 'Mr. Gallo, I can't get into my home because the pimp is blocking my driveway,'"" Oakland City Councilman Noel Gallo said earlier this month of the weekly calls he receives from residents in East Oakland. ""It's constant.""

Republicans and police in the state have pinned blame on a law that went into effect on Jan. 1, which repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. Police argue that the new law ties their hands from carrying out the rule of law.

Chicago Police staffing the lowest in recent history as department reels from 'generation resignation',"EXCLUSIVE: Chicago Police Department staffing numbers reached the lowest in recent history at the end of March, as more than 300 uniformed members had resigned or retired from the department and over a dozen others had stepped down, Fox News Digital has learned.

CPD employed 11,669 sworn officers as of March 30, down from the 11,983 reported at the beginning of the year and the 12,739 members on the force on Jan. 1, 2021, according to statistics obtained by Fox News Digital pursuant to a public records request. The department saw a staffing uptick at the start of 2020, with 13,299, and a jump the year prior, with 13,486, data show.

There were 12,709 uniformed personnel as the beginning of 2018, and 12,234 sworn officers on the force as of the beginning of 2017, the statistics show.

But police officer departures were the highest in recent history in 2021, when 965 uniformed personnel resigned or retired from CPD, and another 100 non-uniformed members also said goodbye to the department, according to the statistics.

And 2021’s departure statistics showed a staggering increase from prior years, with 678 sworn officers leaving in 2020, 611 retiring or resigning in 2019, 476 in 2018, and 627 in 2017, records show.

CHICAGO ALDERMAN SAYS CRIME HAS 'TAKEN OVER' CITY: 'WE'RE THE LAND OF THE LOST'

CPD brass have emphasized the need for recruiting in recent months, as the department embarked on a campaign to hire uniformed members amid a decision to loosen requirements.

In early March, CPD Superintendent David O. Brown announced the department was loosening its recruitment requirements by waiving the minimum 60 college credits for certain candidates and offering online testing opportunities.

At the time, he said 2020’s attrition rate was 4%, compared to the 8.5% attrition rate reported for 2021, ""which is not officers leaving in droves, but it is quite a bit of a challenge to have that level of increase,"" he said.

""But the bigger issue really is the aggregate attrition that occurred because of the pandemic’s restrictions on class size in 2020,"" he said during a press conference regarding recruitment. ""In addition to that, we did have an outbreak of COVID-19 in our police academy in the summer of 2020.""

Brown said the department went all of 2020 and half of 2021 without administering an in-person police recruitment test. At the time, the city had not offered virtual testing options.

""So, a couple things happened in 2021,"" Brown said. ""What happened is that we really thought that this would be an ongoing challenge in the impact of what many called, ‘Generation resignation’…not just policing, but in other professions.""

CHICAGO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT: CARJACKING ‘CRISIS’ IS LINKED TO REMOTE LEARNING

He added that the difficulty to hire employees over the past 24 months ""impacted us, as well. Not just us here in Chicago, but across the law enforcement profession.""

And CPD brass have made the department’s hiring push evident on social media, with frequent posts about the effort on a near-daily basis.

The Chicago branch of the Fraternal Order of Police did not respond to Fox News Digital’s requests seeking comment, but union president John Catanzara, Jr., estimated in the beginning of April that it would take ""at least five to 10 years to recoup the losses in manpower in police forces across this country, Chicago specifically.""

""I mean when we’re looking at 7, 800, 900 retirements or departures, resignations and younger officers leaving for other departments in comparison to two or three hundred recruits coming through the door in a given year in the process,"" Catanzara told Fox News at the time. ""That is not a sustainable number, and it’s gonna make these streets less safe for a long time to come, even if you flip the switch today.""

Meanwhile, CPD’s most recent crime statistics show a 36% increase in total crime year-to-date as of April 3, but a 5% decrease in murder and a 12% decrease in shootings compared to the same time period last year.

Entire North Carolina police department resigns after new town manager is hired,"An entire police department in North Carolina resigned Friday after the hiring of a new town manager.

Police officers and other officials in the small town of Kenly have submitted mass-resignation letters citing stress, a hostile work environment and an inability to continue the department's long-term betterment projects.

In a letter to Town Manager Justine Jones, Police Chief Josh Gibson expressed regret toward the negative changes he felt were occurring in the department.

""In my 21 years at the Kenly Police Department, we have seen ups and downs. But, especially in the last 3 years, we have made substantial progress that we had hoped to continue. However, due to the hostile work environment now present in the Town of Kenly, I do not believe progress is possible,"" Gibson wrote.

Neither the police department nor Jones has been willing to speak to the media on the nature of these complaints, local outlets report.

Gibson's letter was only one of several resignations that were made publicly available after the mass exodus.

""It is with a heavy heart that I take this action. I have been with the town since 2004 and fully expected to finish my law enforcement career with the Town of Kenly. Unfortunately, there are decisions being made that jeopardize my safety and make me question what the future will hold for a Kenly Police Officer,"" wrote officer G.W. Strong.

While all others addressed their resignations to Gibson, the police chief himself submitted his to Jones.

Evolution of the 'defund the police' movement: How has it changed?,"More than one year since the death of George Floyd sent shockwaves through the nation, experts say the movement to slash police budgets amid calls for law enforcement reform has struggled to maintain momentum amid concerns about public safety and costs to local governments.

Fox News spoke to a handful of law enforcement analysts for their input on how the movement to ""defund the police"" – a phrase seen emblazoned on signs at protests night after night and in city after city – has evolved over the months since it grew to become a rallying cry following Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020. Some experts contended the public’s efforts toward pursuing desired changes have gradually lost steam in parts of the country, as cities realize doing so will take time, cost money and require a thoroughly crafted strategy.

""We tend as a society to have short attention spans,"" said Dennis Kenney, Ph.D., a professor at New York City’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Kenney is a former Florida police officer and an author with more than 35 years of experience working with or examining law enforcement, including as director of research for the Police Executive Research Forum.

When asked if interest in efforts to cut police budgets remained, or if people were backing away from the idea, Kenney used Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Floyd was killed, as an example. He described how the city first planned to do away with its police department altogether, then realized ""that's probably not the best idea because we don't have anything to replace them."" He explained that their plan was then to reimagine policing, but that also required the creation of new entities to take the police department’s place.

GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY MEETS WITH BIDEN, HARRIS ON ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH

Then came the realization that ""that's going to be expensive. It's going to mean an awful lot of things.""

""I think that's what people are backing away from,"" he continued. ""I think that they can see that, OK the police aren't well-designed to do that, but we can get them on the cheap, so let's leave it with them.""

Kenney noted that the meaning of defunding police typically ""depends on who you’re talking to,"" but said that ""at the extreme end,"" was those who wanted to do away with police altogether and instead enlist civilians to take their place. ""I think that was never a viable option and never had a large amount of support,"" he added.

""Defunding tended, I think, in the majority opinion tended to be focused on kind of reformatting what we did with the police and recognizing that many of the things that we dump on police to handle, they're not well-suited to do,"" he explained. Kenney pointed to instances in which officers are dealing with people experiencing mental health crises as an example.

That situation is ""not something that police are particularly well-designed to handle – they’re not trained for it, they’re not prepared for it. But the problem the police have is, there's no one else to do it. So, 'if not us, then who?' is basically the argument.""

The lack of having anyone else to handle such areas has led to ""pushback,"" Kenney continued.

""The difficulty … comes in, not do you believe it? But, what are you prepared to do about it?"" he said. Kenney said he believed most people argued either that ""removing the police for handling problems is going to lead to exacerbation of those problems,"" or the alternative, the people’s belief that departments should instead hire unarmed crisis counselors.

""But that means we have to have a staff of unarmed crisis counselors on duty, ready to respond. And that's expensive,"" he explained. ""And we're not willing to do that.""

All in all, he said, even if the support is there, ""there's certainly no consensus on what should be done.""

At the same time, many cities nationwide have seen upticks in violent crime that have, in many cases, remained steady throughout the past several months.

Kenney and Dr. Lorenzo Boyd, the University of New Haven’s vice president for diversity and inclusion, said they do not believe the crime increase should be attributed to the police budgets cuts.

Boyd, who worked as a police officer in Massachusetts for 14 years, is an expert in police-community relations and urban policing, among several other areas of law enforcement. He is the former director of the University of New Haven’s Center for Advanced Policing and serves as the university’s chief diversity officer.

He referred to police budget cuts instead as ""resource reallocation,"" and noted that ""everybody wants safe policing, but people want better policing.""

""Crime rates are going up because people have been pent up in their houses for a year and now they're starting to come back out again,"" Boyd told Fox News. ""But there is absolutely no correlation between, or a spurious correlation between, crime rates going up and budgets being cut.""

But some police officials have said otherwise. Just this week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva railed against the Board of Supervisors as they mull whether or not to slash the department’s funding further.

LASD’s 2021 budget shrunk by $145 million last year, with Villanueva estimating the department lost 1,130 positions. He added that the Board of Supervisors plans to decrease the department’s budget by an additional $143 million and 77 police positions. Villanueva is asking for a $3.6 billion budget, he said.

""We have been defunded, degraded. Our capacity to fight crime, investigate crime and hold people accountable when they commit a crime – all that is going downhill. And not to the benefit of the residents of L.A. County,"" Villanueva said in a video shared on social media. ""As you can judge by the numbers, they are going in the wrong direction.""

Murders in the county have spiked by 95.24% so far this year compared to the same time in 2020, while the department also saw increases of 40.11% in grand theft auto, 22.40% in arson, 12.94% in aggravated assault and 7.82% in forcible rape, Villanueva said.

OVER 440 LA COUNTY DEPUTIES HAVE LEFT THIS YEAR, AS SHERIFF CALLS VIOLENCE, HOMELESSNESS 'EXISTENTIAL THREATS'

But Boyd, who said he previously worked as a police union official himself, denounced such claims by law enforcement brass and unions as being motivated by the effort to get better funding for their members.

When asked if the effort to cut funding to police is still as strong now as it was last summer, Boyd used the city of Seattle to describe how some municipalities have made themselves ""look bad"" for cutting the police budget without having a plan in place.

""The city of Seattle decided, ‘We're going to start defunding the police, we're going to cut the police budget.’ But the City Council had no real way of doing that,"" he said. ""They decided, they're just going to cut a bunch of money right off the top, as opposed to surgically deciding this is where extra money is, this is where we can reallocate things.""

Boyd added: ""But then they cut a bunch of money for no apparent reason. And then, now crime's going up [post-COVID] … And now they're saying, ‘OK, we don't know what to do. Now we look bad because we didn't have a plan. OK, let's go and give them the money back and let’s rethink this.’""

He also agreed with Kenney in that Americans, he said, ""tend to have these really short memories, and we deal with the flavor of the month.""

GEORGIA LAW SETS 'DEFUND POLICE' LIMITS, WILL 'STOP RADICAL, OUT-OF-CONTROL' TOWNS FROM SLASHING FUNDS

Charles Lehman, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute with a focus on its Policing and Public Safety Initiative, told Fox News there was not ""really any consensus around what alternatives to policing look like,"" other than a handful of ""vague ideas"" that don’t ""hold up to scrutiny.""

""As ever in politics, there's a lot of desire to do something. And for lack of either ideas, for lack of success in the space, a particularly radical slogan caught on and then people got bored and went home,"" he said.

Lehman said any person who is part of the ""activist fringe"" that is committed to the ideology ""will continue to agitate for it when the opportunity arises."" He called defunding the police ""overwhelmingly unpopular.""

""We know from study after study after study ... the police presence is just the best crime deterrent tool that we have. It works better than basically everything else,"" he continued. ""If there are fewer cops on the streets, there's going to be a greater number of offenses. We also know that the nationwide homicide spike started last June and it's been persistent since then. It's really hard to say there is a cause there other than all the protests and all the pressure, public pressure on police.""",https://www.foxnews.com/us/evolution-defund-police-movement-changed,N/A

Former Georgia cop charged in missing teen's murder filed false police report,"The former Georgia police officer charged with the kidnapping and murder of a missing 16-year-old girl filed a false police report hiding his alleged crime, according to authorities.

Gwinnett County Police released the police report then Doraville police officer Miles Bryant, 22, filed the day after Susanna Morales went missing in July.

Bryant had said he was working as a courtesy officer at the Sterling Glen Apartment complex when someone stole his handgun, his military ID and his wallet containing credit and debit cards. Bryant also lives at the apartment complex, as does Morales, a high school freshman who was walking home the night before the former cop filed the report.

Bryant claimed he left his truck door unlocked when the theft allegedly occurred. However, Gwinnett County's police chief said investigators found the handgun in the same wooded area where Morales' remains were discovered.

FIRED GEORGIA COP CHARGED WITH MURDER IN MISSING TEEN'S DEATH

""We believe that Miles was armed at that night, and we believe at some point he simply lost the weapon there,"" Gwinnett County Police Chief J.D. McClure said in a statement.

Police said they do not believe Bryant fired the gun during his encounter with Morales, but that it is unknown whether he used the firearm to force the girl to go with him.

The Georgia National Guard said in a statement it has begun to discharge Bryant from his military service in response to his kidnapping and murder charges.

Morales was first reported missing by her family in late July after she failed to return home. And earlier this month, Bryant was arrested for concealing the girl's death and then lying about it. The Gwinnett County Police Chief said Wednesday that Bryant's charges had been upgraded to felony murder and kidnapping.

The Gwinnett County Medical Examiners' office identified the human remains as Morales earlier this month.

Morales' family members notified police that they had not seen her since the evening of July 26. According to detectives, Morales texted her mother at 9:40 p.m. that night to tell her she was on her way home.

Officials said an app on Morales' cell phone confirmed she was walking in the direction of her home between 10:07 p.m. and 10:21 p.m. But detectives said they suspect she may have instead entered a vehicle.

Her phone pinged between 10:21 p.m. and 10:26 p.m. that night before it either died or was turned off, detectives said. Morales never returned home. Detectives have said she may have died between 10 p.m. that night and 2 a.m. on July 27.

Police responded on Feb. 6 to the area between Drowning Creek and Barrow County after someone reported spotting what they suspected were human remains in the forest. The area in which her body was found is located about 20 miles from where she was last seen alive.

The Gwinnett Medical Examiners' office tested the remains and concluded that the DNA matched Morales' dental records.

Indiana murder suspect says brain implant 'programmed' him to hit uncle in head with hammer: Police,"An Indiana man charged in the murder of his uncle says that a brain implant ""programmed"" him to hit his relative in the head with a hammer 10 times and said that he needed to take a shower after the alleged crime because he had ""artificial human matter"" all over him, police said in court documents.

Daniel Smith, 39, is accused of killing his uncle, 69-year-old Freddie Patterson, on the night of Feb. 16 at a Greenfield, Indiana home, according to Fox 59. In a probable cause affidavit obtained by the outlet, authorities said that Patterson's half-sister heard loud banging in the downstairs portion of the house and then found Patterson's face ""all smashed in,"" telling police that flesh or briand matter was on the ground.

She told authorities that she couldn't ""figure out what she was seeing,"" adding that she felt like it ""wasn't real"" and she was ""imagining it.""

When interviewed by police after the alleged murder, Smith said that a brain implant ""programmed"" him to use a hammer to hit Patterson in the head nearly 10 times, the affidavit states. Smith said that he had to take a shower after killing his uncle ""because he didn’t feel clean"" with ""artificial human matter"" on his body, the document states.

Smith said ""sorry"" when police told him that his uncle died. Court documents say that Smith ""then offered to donate some of his front lobes to [Patterson], and we told him it wouldn’t help him.""

Investigators also asked Smith about his relationship with Patterson, to which Smith said that he respected his uncle because of his military service, but said ""he was not really sure"" if the man who he allegedly killed was actually Patterson, police said. Smith said that the home where he allegedly killed Patterson ""was being used as a channel for trafficking and illegal products"" involving ""Singapore and the Chinese mafia.""

The suspect said that he once called the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report Patterson, but ""wasn’t sure why"" he made the call, officials said in the affidavit.

The 39-year-old said Patterson ""verbally abused him"" in the kitchen of the house, but couldn't remember specific details, telling investigators that he once checked to ""see if [Patterson] had a mask on,"" the document states.

Police wrote in the affidavit that Smith ""spoke about random things not really focusing on any one particular thing"" when talking with investigators.

Minnesota's City of Morris to disband police department,"Local leaders in one western Minnesota city have voted to disband the police department, which has dwindled to just two officers, including the chief.

The City of Morris, like other communities across the country, is dealing with changing attitudes about policing and challenges in recruiting and retaining officers.

Morris, with a population of about 5,200 residents, has budgeted for eight full-time officers and an administrative specialist.

The Morris City Council plans to sign a contract for law enforcement services with the Stevens County Sheriff's Office and shut down a police department that has been around for more than 140 years.

POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS AMERICA STRUGGLE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT OFFICERS

""It’s a sad day. Nobody wants to see that happen,"" said Blaine Hill, city manager. ""People ask, ‘How in the world could a town the size of Morris not have a police department?’ We live in a different world now.""

The profession is in the midst of a 25-year low of new officers entering the field. At the same time, officers are retiring and resigning at increased levels.

"More than 150 police officers shot so far this year, records show","More than 150 American police officers have been shot this year, at least 24 of them killed in the line of duty, statistics compiled by Fox News Digital show.

""Criminals feel free to engage in crime,"" said Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, spokesperson for the National Police Association and a retired officer with nearly three decades of experience. ""You see videos all over TikTok and Instagram, where criminals are doing things, and they appear to have no fear of the police, of a security guard, of a store manager, none of that.""

In all, at least 156 officers have been shot around the country in 2022 as of Tuesday, according to Fraternal Order of Police data combined with additional information from the Gun Violence Archive.

The numbers include two officers shot and killed in El Monte, California, Tuesday – Cpl. Michael Paredes and Officer Joseph Santana. The suspect was a known gang member, Justin William Flores, who was on probation despite being convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon.

CALIFORNIA SUSPECT WHO KILLED TWO EL MONTE POLICE OFFICERS WAS ON PROBATION FOR GUN CHARGE, SOURCES SAY

""The sentence he received in the firearm case was consistent with case resolutions for this type of offense given his criminal history and the nature of the offense,"" embattled Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon's office told Fox News Wednesday. ""At the time the court sentenced him, Mr. Flores did not have a documented history of violence.""

The Fraternal Order of Police, the world's largest organization of law enforcement officers, said that shootings of police were up 10% this year over last between Jan. 1 and June 1. Compared to 2020, the number has risen by 20%.

""We're in the third year of the war on cops, the renewed war on cops in a post-George Floyd world,"" Smith said. ""And then we have these ‘woke’ prosecutors who are not keeping people in jail.""

The two suspects blamed for the last three police slayings all should have been behind bars, she said.

""Had they been in prison, these three cops would still be alive,"" she said.

There's also a problem of ambush-style attacks, according to the FOP.

Six officers have been killed out of 42 shot in 27 such attacks as of the beginning of June, according to the organization.

Flores, the El Monte suspect, died in a shootout after he ambushed the officers at a motel in Los Angeles County, according to police. Sources within the prosecutor's office have told Fox News that If he had been prosecuted under standard procedures, rather than under blanket directives from Gascon, he would likely have been sentenced to around three years in prison.

The year kicked off with a spate of violence. Los Angeles Police Officer Fernando Arroyos was gunned down during a robbery on Jan. 10 – while he was out shopping for a new house with his girlfriend.

Days later, a man burst out of his mother's bedroom in New York City with a .45-caliber handgun, shooting NYPD Officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora. Both were posthumously promoted to detective.

Two more officers were killed before the end of the month: Cpl. Charles Galloway with the Harris County Constable's Office in Texas, and Officer Donald Sahota of the Vancouver Police Department in Washington state.

The states with the most line-of-duty shootings as of June 1, 2022, were Texas and Arizona, each with 14. New York and Georgia both saw nine. Missouri saw eight and Washington saw seven.

Police morale is low, and anti-police sentiment in ""woke"" cities and counties is high, leading to a rise in officer shootings as well as crimes in general, said Smith, the National Police Association spokesperson. Officers are also leaving their jobs at an increased rate, and departments are having trouble recruiting.

""San Francisco recalled Chesa Boudin, and now there's a big movement afoot in Los Angeles to recall George Gascon,"" she said. ""I think this may be a trend now – not every state has this mechanism…so I think we may see a trend politically that this is what's going to happen.""

Nevada to consider bill allowing noncitizens to serve on police forces amid staffing shortages,"Nevada is considering a bill that would allow noncitizens who live in the state and pass a background check to serve as police officers amid staffing shortages.

Assembly Bill 30, which is sponsored by the Assembly Committee on Government Affairs, will be considered during the next session of the Nevada Assembly.

If passed and signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, a former sheriff, the bill would make approximately 140,000 green card holders and up to 15,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in the state eligible to attend police academy and join police forces in the state.

AB 30 was filed in November on behalf of the City of North Las Vegas, which became the first city in the state to permit noncitizens to enroll in their youth explorers program for young people interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement, according to local affiliate FOX5.

LAS VEGAS COPS DISCOVER SEVERED HEAD IN COOLER DURING ARREST OF SUSPECT ON TOTALLY DIFFERENT CHARGES

FOX5 noted that the ranks of participants in the youth explorers program have swelled since it was opened to noncitizens.

""It’s not just a Nevada thing, it’s not just a North Las Vegas thing, where recruiting numbers for police officers and police departments nationally have fallen.""

Luke explained to the outlet that the bill emerged from a desire to expand the recruiting pool for law enforcement, noting that potential officers would still be subject to physical standards and rigorous background checks.

""That’s a major pool of potentially qualified candidates that want to serve in the community, where they live and who want a better community,"" said Luke. ""But they’re prohibited to do so even though legally they have the authority to work in the United States, so, that’s really the genesis of AB 30.""

""All we’re doing is saying that we would like for the state to recognize that this is an additional pool from which to draw,"" he added.

"Embattled New Orleans mayor appoints interim police chief amid crime surge, recall effort","Embattled New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell appointed a temporary police superintendent Monday to replace the police department's outgoing chief amid a surge in violent crime and a recall effort against her.

Cantrell tapped New Orleans police Capt. Michelle Woodfork to become the first female police superintendent in the history of the New Orleans Police Department beginning Thursday.

Woodfork will replace NOPD Superintendent Shaun Ferguson, who led the department for four years before announcing his retirement last month. She is also a 32-year veteran of the force and the niece of former NOPD Superintendent Warren Woodfork.

NEW ORLEANS SUPERINTENDENT POLICE CHIEF RETIRES AMID CONTROVERSY IN AMERICA'S MURDER CAPITAL

""I am laser-focused on leaving the New Orleans Police Department in the best possible state that it can be when it is my time to retire,"" Woodfork said during a Monday news conference to announce her interim appointment. ""My number one priority is to protect and serve the citizens and visitors of the great city of New Orleans.""

City leaders have called on Cantrell to conduct a national search for a new chief. She would have to get approval from the City Council to appoint a permanent chief after Jan. 1.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the mayor's office.

Ferguson's tenure as chief was marked by a number of setbacks, including the Hard Rock Hotel building collapse in the city's French Quarter, dwindling police manpower as more officers leave the department and an uptick in violent crime. The city is in the midst of experiencing a post-pandemic surge in homicides and carjackings.

""We don't have time to waste,"" Cantrell said Monday. ""Every day will continue to count as it relates to moving our department forward, strengthening our operations, our crime-fighting efforts and, of course, pivoting very heavily on retention and recruitment.""

Ferguson's departure comes as Cantrell faces a recall effort one year after easily winning re-election. Recall organizers have cited the city's crime woes as well as the mayor's questionable overseas trips and travel spending.

""The national term ' quiet quitting ,' that's what our mayor has done,"" Eileen Carter, Cantrell’s former social media manager who partnered with Belden ""Noonie Man"" Batiste, a former New Orleans mayoral candidate, to file the recall petition over the summer, previously told Fox News Digital. ""Our mayor literally won't say the word ‘crime.' She has disassociated herself from crime. She refuses to be involved it in at all.""

New Orleans Police Department hiring civilians to bolster force as murderous crime wave hits city,"The New Orleans Police Department is hiring civilians to help with the force’s staffing issues and allow for more police officers to patrol the streets as violent crimes such as murder spike.

""The goal is for our officers to feel safe, so they can make our citizens and visitors feel safe,"" New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson said Thursday at a press conference.

Ferguson said the department is focused on hiring civilian police intake specialists, who will monitor phones at the department and replace administrative police officers. The department will also hire between 50 and 75 civilians who will respond to calls that do not require the presence of a police officer. Some of the civilians will even be trained to do detective work, WDSU reported.

""As we take calls over the phone, there may be some evidence that needs to be collected with that call. We’ll have civilian investigators to go out and collect that evidence instead of an officer having to go out there and collect that evidence,"" Ferguson said.

NEW ORLEANS BECOMES MURDER CAPITAL OF AMERICA, OVERTAKING ST. LOUIS

Police will no longer be required at incidents such as loose animals, medical calls and auto accidents on private property, WDSU reported.

Homicides have increased by 78% this year compared to 2021, according to data from crime-tracking organization Metropolitan Crime Commission. Homicides are up 121% this year when compared to 2019.

Ferguson said the plan to beef up the understaffed force, which lost 150 officers last year alone, will extend to trying to recruit former applicants who were previously rejected.

NEW ORLEANS ON PACE TO HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST MURDER RATES IN THE WORLD IN 2022

""My message to you — to those of you [who] may have been disqualified in the past, I'm urging you to resubmit your application because some of our hiring criteria has changed,"" Ferguson said, noting that some changes have been made to the hiring process, such as not allowing credit scores to affect a hiring decision.

Civilians will undergo a training process and background checks before they can join the police department.

""This is also to reduce some of the workload currently placed on our patrol and district personnel but most importantly to reduce response times,"" Ferguson added.

NEW ORLEANS POLICE SOUND ALARM ON 'DESPERATE SITUATION' WITH HOMICIDE RATE FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN CHICAGO

Oakland police chief fired after alleged cover-up of officer misconduct: 'Significant cultural problems',"The city of Oakland, California, fired its police chief on Wednesday over the alleged cover-up of an officer's misconduct, marking the loss of the city's seventh head of police since 2016 as the department hits 20 years under federal oversight.

Democratic Mayor Sheng Thao announced she was firing Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong after an independent investigation concluded the chief and the department failed to properly investigate and discipline Sgt. Michael Chung, who was involved in a hit-and-run with his patrol car in 2021.

A separate incident also showed Chung fired his firearm inside an elevator at police headquarters, according to The Associated Press.

Thao, who took office last month, said in a lengthy statement the federal judge overseeing the city said he was ""profoundly disappointed"" in the evidence he'd seen, and the report demonstrated ""significant cultural problems"" within Oakland PD.

OAKLAND POLICE TO INCREASE PRESENCE AMID CRIME WAVE, CITY LEADERS SEEK TO REVERSE PLANNED CUTS

The issues were determined serious enough to render Oakland PD out of compliance with an important requirement of a negotiated settlement agreement initially decided upon in January 2003.

Thao said she personally believes the report shows continued reform is absolutely necessary in order to address issues that have been brought to light.

""As Oakland continues to improve its police department, we must be confident that our Chief will be effective in making sustainable improvements that can be recognized by the federal monitor, the federal court and the people of Oakland,"" Thao said.

She said that she admires Armstrong, made her decision difficult, but she had to put personal relationships and feelings aside in order for progress to continue.

""Chief Armstrong has my respect and appreciation for his service to the Department and to the City that he grew up in and that he loves dearly. He will continue to have my respect and appreciation,"" Thao added.

She also made clear there are many Oakland police officers who serve the public with integrity and work ""extremely hard"" to maintain and build trust within the community, but the high standards set for the officers must also be achieved in leadership.

Armstrong was placed on paid administrative leave last month while the mayor reviewed investigations by the department's federal monitor that found Armstrong responsible for ""gross dereliction of duty.""

ACTING OAKLAND POLICE CHIEF PAUL FIGUEROA STEPS DOWN AFTER TWO DAYS ON THE JOB AMID SEX SCANDAL

According to The Associated Press, probes by the law firm of Clarence Dyer and Cohen determined Armstrong failed to investigate and discipline Chung after he hit a Mercedes parked in the stall next to his patrol vehicle while leaving the parking garage of his San Francisco apartment building.

The report, first obtained by KTVU-TV and made public by local outlet Oaklandside, found Officer Kayla Brandwood was with Chung during the incident on March 25, 2021. Though Chung stopped for approximately five seconds, neither officer stepped out of the car after the collision. Surveillance footage from the parking garage reportedly showed the impact from the collision ""ripped"" the front bumper off the Mercedes.

The crash was never reported to supervisors, and the city only became aware of the incident when it received a claim from Progressive Insurance detailing what happened.

In its 56-page report, the law firm said a police captain in the department’s Internal Affairs Division downplayed the hit-and-run incident and coached the investigating officer to draft a report that allowed Chung to escape discipline.

A year later, in 2022, Chung fired his service weapon inside an elevator at OPD headquarters, got rid of the evidence, and did not inform his supervisors until a week later, according to The AP. He has reportedly been on paid administrative leave since then.

OAKLAND POLICE DEPT. WORKS WITHOUT AN ACTING CHIEF AFTER 3 STEP DOWN IN 8 DAYS

Oakland police made national news in 2000 after a rookie officer came forward to report abuse of power by a group of officers known as the Oakland ""Riders."" Four officers were charged with making false arrests, planting evidence, using excessive force, falsifying police reports and assaulting people in the predominantly Black area of west Oakland, The AP reported.

Three of the officers were acquitted after two separate juries deadlocked on most of the charges. The fourth officer is a fugitive and is believed to have left the U.S.

The case led to the decision to place the department under federal oversight in January 2003. The agreement required the enactment of 52 reform measures and mandatory reporting of progress to an outside monitor and a federal judge.

Armstrong, an Oakland native with strong community support, was appointed to police chief in 2021 after more scandals plagued the department for years. He promised his priority was to enact all the reforms within a year.

OAKLAND'S FIRST FEMALE POLICE CHIEF CANNED BY CIVILIAN COMMISSION

Armstrong said he was deeply disappointed in the decision to fire him, and it will be clear he committed no misconduct once all facts are evaluated, according to a statement released by representative Sam Singer.

""After the relevant facts are fully evaluated by weighing evidence instead of pulling soundbites from strategically leaked, inaccurate reports, it will be clear I was a loyal and effective reformer of the Oakland Police Department,"" the statement read. ""It will be equally clear that I committed no misconduct, and my termination is fundamentally wrong, unjustified, and unfair. I anticipate releasing a more detailed statement soon once I have the chance to fully digest the Mayor’s remarks.""

Armstrong was the 13th person to lead the department since the federal oversight began in 2003. He received the backing of John Burris, one of two attorneys who filed the lawsuit in 2000 against Oakland police on behalf of 119 plaintiffs.

Burris reportedly said he was disappointed that Thao based her decision on what he considers ""not very strong evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Armstrong.""

The attorney, who has been meeting with the police department and the federal monitor regularly for the past 20 years, said the police department has made ""great strides and positive changes"" in how it deals with the community.

""We don’t have the beating that we used to have. We don’t have people being stopped because of their race at the same level we had before.

The department was set to be free from federal oversight in June after Federal Judge William Orrick placed OPD on a one-year probationary period last year, stating ""substantial compliance"" had been achieved. In January, his decision to make a portion of the law firm reports public led to Armstrong's placement on paid administrative leave.

""The report … demonstrates that the significant cultural problems within the department remain unaddressed,"" Orrick said during a virtual hearing.

Oakland police researching using robots to deploy lethal shotgun rounds in emergency situations: report,"Police in Oakland, California, are reportedly exploring the option of using robots equipped with a device that could be deployed to fire live shotgun rounds against suspects in emergency circumstances.

""Yes, we are looking into that and doing more research at this time,"" Oakland Police Lt. Omar Daza-Quiroz told The Intercept in a report detailing the debate between Oakland police and a city oversight council on whether to use deadly force via robots during certain emergency circumstances.

The report described a Sept. 21 Oakland Police Commission subcommittee meeting that included a discussion on accessories that police robots use, such as a ""percussion actuated non-electric disruptor,"" known as a PAN disruptor, that sometimes deploys a blank shotgun shell or pressurized water while the device operator stands at a safe distance.

Daza-Quiroz told the committee that officers make sure a blank round is in the device when Jennifer Tu, a fellow with the American Friends Service Committee and Oakland Police Commission subcommittee member, asked if ""a live round"" can ""physically go in"" and ""what happens if a live round goes in?""

PHILADELPHIA POLICE ATTACKED BY ATV, DIRT-BIKE RIDERS WHO HURLED BRICKS AND BOTTLES AT OFFICERS

""Yeah, physically, a live round can go in,"" Daza-Quiroz said. ""Absolutely, and you’d be getting a shotgun round.""

Daza-Quiroz was then asked by Commissioner Jesse Hsieh if the police department plans to use live rounds in the device.

""No,"" Daza-Quiroz said before adding that there are potential scenarios where that could be a necessary move.

""I mean, is it possible we have an active shooter in a place we can’t get to? And he’s fortified inside a house?"" Daza-Quiroz said. ""Or we’re trying to get to a person.""

The civilian commission expressed skepticism over the idea, which police say has never been used since they introduced robots in 2011.

""It's a lot easier to pull out a rifle or a gun and shoot someone than to put a live round into this thing,"" Hsieh said. ""But I think we are all concerned about the dystopian sort of universe where a robot sneaks into our room and shoots us, which I know is not the intention but is certainly a scary thought and where our mind goes.""

Daza-Quiroz told the commission that the department did not want to include language prohibiting a robot’s use of deadly force ""because what if we need it for some situation later on?""

The plan to include language allowing police to use deadly force via robots has reportedly been put on hold, but police are exploring the idea. The Intercept reported that the two sides agreed that the robots will only be allowed to deploy pepper spray for the time being.

The Oakland Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Police chief association releases number of officers injured during violent riots,"More than 2,000 law enforcement officers were injured in the first weeks of protests over the summer following the police killing of George Floyd, according to a report released in October.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, a professional association comprised of local law enforcement heads from the 69 largest police agencies in the United States and nine in Canada, detailed the unrest and compiled data from protests between May 25 and July 31 in MCCA member cities.

During that period, there were 8,700 protests nationwide; 574 were declared riots with violence and other criminal acts. The violence was limited to 7% of protests, the report said.

More than half of demonstrations were peaceful and lawful while other periods of unrest that at times stretched law enforcement, the MCCA said.

PORTLAND HAS WORST STOLEN-CAR RATE PER CAPITA IN US, STUDY FINDS

In most cases, the criminal acts were the work of individuals or small groups that infiltrated larger demonstrations, according to the organization.

""Nonetheless, the sheer volume of protests, combined with the level of civil disobedience and existence of some ultra-violent events, created an extraordinarily challenging environment for law enforcement agencies,"" the MCCA stated.

The report is primarily based on law enforcement accounts of the protests from each jurisdiction. The largest numbers of protests occurred in New York City and Los Angeles County, with each having over 1,000 gatherings.

Houston had the largest crowd for a single event with 60,000 protesters.

There was violence in more than 62% of Portland, Ore., demonstrations. The city had weeks of nightly protests far beyond the July 31 cutoff for the MCAA report.

At some gatherings nationwide there was looting, violent clashes between protesters and authorities, arson, murder and shootings. Around 72% of law enforcement agencies reported officers harmed during protests.

In total, more than 624 arsons were reported and 97 police vehicles were burned, the report states. Video of some of the protests posted to social media showed officers pelted with bricks, water bottles, fireworks and other objects, including Molotov cocktails.

""One agency reported dumpsters, trash cans, trees, furniture and vehicles being set on fire,"" the report said. ""In many cities, city hall, as well as other iconic public buildings and federal courthouses were targets of arson.""

Looting was also common, with 2,385 incidents reported in the 10-week period. While officers were targeted in some cases, authorities in several cities also were criticized for what some saw as an aggressive response to peaceful gatherings.

Many of the non-violent, illegal acts committed during the events were often the blocking of freeways, protesters disrupting outdoor dining, harassing patrons and trespassing onto private property. More than 40% of all protests involved some civil disobedience, the report said.

Over the 10 weeks cited by the report, more than 16,200 people were arrested for protest-related crimes. More than half of the law enforcement agencies said local district attorneys declined to prosecute those cases.

"Raleigh’s cop shortage, lingering anti-police sentiment blamed for record-high violence in 2022: expert","Raleigh, North Carolina, just had its bloodiest year in recent history, and it is likely that a police staffing crisis and ongoing anti-cop sentiment led to the spike in violence, one expert told Fox News Digital.

""Raleigh, like police forces all over the country, has had staffing problems,"" said Jon Guze, senior fellow in legal studies at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based conservative think tank.

Raleigh recorded 49 homicides in 2022, a more than 48% increase from the 33 homicides reported in 2021. Last year's tally was the highest in a single year since at least 1995, according to FBI data that tracks violent crimes, WRAL reported this month.

""The evidence has just been piling up now for more than 20 years that police presence deters crime,"" Guze said. ""And if you don't have enough officers, especially in high-crime, high-disorder neighborhoods, you're going to get more crime of all kinds, and especially homicides.""

DEMOCRAT-RUN TOURIST TOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA SEES VIOLENT CRIME SPIKE AS POLICE DWINDLE: 'PERFECT STORM'

The 49 homicides happened in 43 incidents, according to WRAL. They included two officer-involved shootings, four cases in which there were no arrests, 26 cases cleared by arrests and 11 pending cases. The data show the police department has a clearance rate of 74%.

""Our clearance rate has typically been over 95%, and we are confident that we will continue that trend,"" Raleigh Police Lt. Jason Borneo told WRAL.

Various cities across the country have been rocked by violent crime increases since 2020, when protests and riots exploded across the country following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns upended day-to-day life. Nationally, murders increased by nearly 30% in 2020 compared to the prior year, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the FBI began tracking such crimes.

AFTER 2020'S RECORD BLOODY YEAR, LARGE CITIES ACROSS THE NATION STILL FACE SKY-HIGH MURDER RATES 2 YEARS LATER

Some experts have attributed the murder spike to a range of issues that collided that year, including anti-police rhetoric voiced by Black Lives Matter and defund the police proponents, the pandemic, a culture of lawlessness promoted by liberal district attorneys and the ""Ferguson effect,"" when police pull back and violent crimes spike.

Before the pandemic and riots of 2020, Raleigh had 29 homicides in 2019, 17 homicides in 2018 and 27 homicides in 2017.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

Guze said he penned a report after Floyd’s death predicting crime would skyrocket as calls to defund the police rang out from coast to coast.

""Far from solving problems like police misconduct and over-incarceration, spending reductions will make those problems worse and will, moreover, inflict additional harm on the communities that have already been harmed the most by the turmoil that followed Floyd’s death,"" Guze wrote June 11, 2020.

""If we want to improve conditions in those communities and ensure there are fewer instances of police misconduct and less incarceration, we need to hire more police officers. And we need to pay them more.""

FBI'S NATIONAL CRIME DATA FOR 2021 INCOMPLETE, LACKS DATA FROM NEARLY 40% OF POLICE NATIONWIDE

He told Fox News Digital this week that ""of course we have"" had that crime spike and it has ""affected many, many cities now.""

For Raleigh, Guze said the homicide figure is a ""little puzzling"" because the city never defunded its police, and the homicide spike is occurring years after other cities already saw increases take hold.

""It's worrying, of course, but the other thing I think is important to keep in mind is we're starting at a very low base compared to an awful lot of cities. North Carolina has been lucky. None of our cities have got homicide rates that compare with places like my own hometown St. Louis.""

Guze said North Carolina's capital, which has a population of roughly 469,000 people, is far smaller than cities often in the news for murders, such as Chicago or New York City. And since Raleigh is starting from a lower base of murders, ""that means that any increase can look more significant than it is.""

""That said, though, I wouldn't be at all surprised if we're just lagging a little bit,"" the legal fellow said, explaining neighboring Durham saw a spike in murders happen sooner after 2020. ""And it may just be that Raleigh is catching up with the rest of the country as far as the impact of changes in policing and reactions to the death of George Floyd and so on.""

Raleigh has been grappling with staffing shortages with its police department in recent months, reporting it is 100 officers short as of December, Spectrum 1 News reported.

""They've been short-staffed. And that's going to have an impact,"" Guze said. ""Even if your staffing levels are where you want them, it makes a difference how proactive the policing is.

""We've known that for a long time, too. This goes all the way back to the ‘90s, that proactive policing — what some people nowadays would call community policing — that gets the police on the street in high-crime neighborhoods and sometimes even making stops. This makes a big difference.""

Guze added that, unlike some other cities seeing crime spikes, soft-on-crime prosecutors are not playing a role in Raleigh’s murder spike and that he’s not aware of any laws at the state level that would encourage this type of lawlessness.

Guze advised that city and state leaders should not ""just wait and hope this mood changes at a national level"" regarding police feeling welcome in communities again following the anti-police sentiment that erupted in 2020.

""I think showing the police that we appreciate them, providing enough funding so that we can hire good officers and lots of them, I think will make a big difference,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/raleighs-cop-shortage-lingering-anti-police-sentiment-blamed-for-record-high-violence-in-2022-expert,N/A
San Francisco approves plan to allow police robots to use deadly force in emergency situations,"San Francisco leaders voted to allow the city’s police department to use potentially lethal robots in emergency situations.

""Under this policy, SFPD is authorized to use these robots to carry out deadly force in extremely limited situations when risk to loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available,"" City Supervisor Rafael Mandelman wrote on Twitter.

San Francisco leaders voted 8-3 on Tuesday in support of the new policy.

The San Francisco Police Department has 17 robots, but none are armed with guns, and the department has no plans to do so. The department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges ""to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect"" during emergency situations when lives are at risk, according to a police department spokesperson.

SAN FRANCISCO RIDICULED OVER 'LAUGHABLE' PUSH FOR ROBOT POLICE: 'TAKING POLICY DECISIONS' FROM 'TERMINATOR'

""Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives,"" SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.

The plan received harsh pushback from civil liberty groups and others over claims it would militarize the police force.

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE PROPOSE ALLOWING ROBOTS TO KILL IN 'RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL' CIRCUMSTANCES

""We are living a dystopian future, where we debate whether the police may use robots to execute citizens without a trial, jury, or judge,"" Tifanei Moyer, a senior staff attorney of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco Bay Area previously told Mission Local.

""No legal professional or ordinary resident should carry on as if it is normal.""

Sultan Meghji, a professor at Duke University, joined Fox News’ ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Monday and also slammed the proposal.

OAKLAND POLICE RESEARCHING USING ROBOTS TO DEPLOY LETHAL SHOTGUN ROUNDS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS: REPORT

""It’s an awful idea,"" he told host Jesse Watters. ""These guys are taking policy decisions from the ‘Terminator’ franchise.""

San Francisco Mayor London Breed's office has issued a statement in support of the policy, saying it ""strikes a good balance between protecting lives and establishing guardrails to prevent misuse.""

""The Mayor supports policies that allow police officers to quickly and safely respond to situations that involve a risk of violence to the public and this includes tools such as live video or robotics technology. These tools should be available to peace officers to employ to save lives,"" the mayor's office told Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning.

""If the police are called to serve in a situation where someone intends to do harm or is already doing harm to innocent people, and there is technology that can help to end the violence and save lives, we need to allow police to use these tools to save lives,"" the statement continued.

Supervisors amended the proposal Tuesday to specify that officers could use robots only after using alternative force or de-escalation tactics, or concluding they would not be able to subdue a suspected criminal through those alternative means.

Only a limited number of high-ranking officers could authorize use of robots as a deadly force option.

The Oakland Police Department considered equipping robots to shoot projectiles earlier this year but later dropped the plan.

San Francisco defunded the police before reversing course the next year amid calls for 'accountability',"This is the second part of a Fox News Digital series about ""defund the police"" politicians and crime in the areas they represent.

From coast to coast in 2020, liberal politicians pledged support for defunding police departments following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. San Francisco Mayor London Breed was among the politicians in major cities that joined the chorus of leaders diverting funds from police that summer, only to reverse course the following year.

""We will redirect $120 million from law enforcement to support these priorities over the next two years,"" Breed said in her announcement on July 31, 2020. ""Let me repeat that. This is $120 million.""

SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD SEES 100% INCREASE IN BURGLARIES DURING PANDEMIC

The plan redirected $120 million in funds from both the police and sheriff’s departments in the city over two years to fund initiatives for Black Americans in the Golden City. The San Francisco Chronicle reported at the time that the reallocation of funds was intended to be ""a gesture of reparations for decades of city policymaking that have created or exacerbated deep inequities for San Francisco’s African American residents.""

Breed was far from alone in making moves to defund police. Political leaders stretching from the U.S. House of Representatives, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar, to local city leaders supported calls from activists demanding that funds allocated to police departments be divested to public safety initiatives, such as mental health and youth services.

SAN FRANCISCO CRIME VICTIM CELEBRATES RECALL OF PROGRESSIVE DA: 'A FEELING OF VALIDATION'

San Francisco was among cities across the country that saw some crimes increase in 2020 compared to 2019. Homicides increased by 20% that year compared to 2019, and by 17% in 2021 compared to 2020. While crimes such as rape and robbery decreased in 2020, burglaries increased by 47% in 2020 when compared to the three previous years, data complied by SFGate shows.

The city was also rocked by smash-and-grab crimes last year, most notably during the holiday season, that carried into 2022; by a continued drug use epidemic that led to more accidental drug overdose deaths in the city in 2020 than the number of people who died from COVID-19 that same year; and by polls over the last two years showing residents becoming concerned with public safety and reporting that their quality of life has gotten worse.

San Francisco's data on homicides follows a national trend from 2020. FBI data show murders increased by nearly 30% in 2020, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

Experts who have spoken to Fox News Digital pointed to the defund movement, the pandemic and its lockdowns upsetting daily life in unprecedented ways, and the Ferguson effect for the rise in crimes in 2020.

""Certainly, the protests and riots mid-2020 after the death of George Floyd followed a pattern of spiking violence that we've seen following past viral police incidents, such as the deaths of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray. This pattern has been termed the ‘Ferguson Effect’: police pull back while violent crime spikes precipitously,"" Hannah Meyers, director of the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital earlier this year of the national murder increases in 2020.

What followed the defund movement has been widespread reports of police departments being understaffed, struggling with low morale and facing a tough recruitment process to bolster the force. Police leaders have often pointed to the defund movement and anti-police rhetoric as being to blame for gutting morale.

""Most police departments are not these ginormous agencies. And it's already tough to attract people to those small departments,"" Betsy Brantner Smith, a 29-year police veteran, told Fox News Digital earlier this year. ""Then, you introduce [the] defund the police [movement] and vilification of police, and it makes it very difficult.""

The San Francisco Police Department has reported more of the same as the national trend. As of August, the department is down about 300 officers. Just last month alone, 50 officers left the department, with only eight to 10 recruits ready to fill the gaps.

Between April 2020 and April 2021, resignations increased by 18% and retirements by 45%, Mission Local reported this year.

SAN FRANCISCO POLICE UNION: MAYOR'S CRIME CRACKDOWN IS 'ACKNOWLEDGMENT' THAT DEFUND POLICE WAS 'MISTAKE'

In December 2021, Breed reversed course on defunding and announced an emergency request to the city Board of Supervisors for more money to bolster the police department and address crime.

""I’m proud this city believes in giving people second chances,"" Breed said at the time. ""Nevertheless, we also need there to [have] accountability when someone does break the law… Our compassion cannot be mistaken for weakness or indifference… I was raised by my grandmother to believe in ‘tough love,’ in keeping your house in order, and we need that, now more than ever.""

The San Francisco police union president said Breed's announcement in December was evidence that the defund the police movement had been a ""mistake.""

""Mayor Breed’s announcement yesterday to deploy more police officers to address the unacceptable level of crime in portions of our city, namely the Tenderloin, is an acknowledgment that the push to defund the SFPD was a mistake,"" Tony Montoya, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, said in a statement at the time.

Last month, the Board of Supervisors approved the city's $14 million budget for the 2022-2023 fiscal year, which included provisions to fill about 200 vacant police officer positions and to add funding to officer retention bonuses.

San Francisco has been coping with a multi-edged sword on crime, which was compounded by a now-ousted liberal district attorney.

San Francisco voters recalled DA Chesa Boudin in June in a rejection of what critics said were ""pro-criminal policies that are masked as criminal justice reform.""

""When there are crimes you're not enforcing, it promotes a culture of lawlessness,"" Heritage Foundation legal fellow Zack Smith told Fox News Digital when speaking of crime in cities with by liberal DAs. ""And it also causes police officers to stop arresting for those crimes or investigating those crimes, because what's the point? Why are they going to waste their limited time and resources arresting or investigating crimes that they know that the district attorney has said he or she is not going to prosecute?""

Breed announced that Brooke Jenkins would replace Boudin earlier this summer. The newly-minted DA has since vowed to ""restore"" order to the city, including by cracking down on holding drug dealers accountable and addressing repeated anti-Asian attacks.

""My office is working hard to make our neighborhoods safer, advocate for victims, and work to implement strong, practical criminal justice reform.

Seattle homicides rose precipitously in 2020 as liberal leaders demanded police be defunded,"This is the fifth part of a Fox News Digital series about ""defund the police"" politicians and crime in the areas they represent.

Seattle, Washington, became a focal point of the defund the police movement in 2020, as riots and protests raged in the city that summer after the murder of George Floyd. Following widespread support from liberal leaders and activists to defund, data show homicides rose precipitously in the city.

""It's clear that law enforcement is not always the appropriate avenue to deal with these issues,"" then-Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said on July 13, 2020. ""Today, the chief and I are announcing an initial $76 million in reductions to the 2021 budget.""

Her announcement came as the city’s council members pushed for the police department to be cut by a whopping 50% - a proposal Durkan slammed. The police budget for 2021 was ultimately set to $363 million, compared to 2020’s $401.8 million budget.

As Durkan announced the partial defunding in July, protests and riots continued raging in her city, causing damage to buildings, cars seen lit on fire, the city enforcing curfews, and police making dozens of arrests. The ire of protesters was also directed at Durkan, who demanded she resign over the police department’s handling of the protests, arguing the city violated the constitutional rights of demonstrators with heavy-handed tactics.

SEATTLE STRUGGLES WITH POLICE SHORTAGE AFTER 'DEFUND' MOVEMENT AS 100 OFFICERS LEAVE FORCE

The protesters calling for Durkan’s resignation even briefly occupied Seattle’s City Hall in June, before heading to an autonomous zone in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. The area, known as ""CHOP"" or ""CHAZ,"" became a national focal point of that summer, as fatal shootings unfolded, including the killing of a 16-year-old boy.

But as rioters occupied the city’s east police precinct, Durkan declared that Seattle was seeing a ""summer of love."" The mayor soon walked that comment back as violent crimes in the area mounted.

As 2020 drew to a close, Seattle data showed a precipitous rise in homicides.

SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNER CALLS FOR ACTION AGAINST CRIME CRISIS AFTER TWO BREAK-INS: ‘YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE POLICE'

In 2019, Seattle recorded 31 homicides. That number skyrocketed by 61% the following year to 50 homicides, the highest number recorded in 26 years.

Seattle’s data on homicides follows a national trend from 2020. FBI data show murders increased by nearly 30% in 2020, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

Experts who have spoken to Fox News Digital pointed to the defund movement, the pandemic and its lockdowns upsetting daily life in unprecedented ways, and the Ferguson effect for the rise in crimes in 2020.

This pattern has been termed the ‘Ferguson Effect’: police pull back while violent crime spikes precipitously,"" Hannah Meyers, director of the policing and public safety initiative at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital earlier this year of the national murder increases in 2020.

Homicides ticked down to 42 in 2021, and the city has logged at least 27 homicides this year, according to Seattle Police data.

Shootings have meanwhile skyrocketed this year. Seattle Police data analyzed by Fox News Digital shows there have been 446 reported shootings this year, as of July 31. The shootings marked a 42% increase compared to last year during the same time period, when 315 shootings were reported.

FORMER SEATTLE MAYORAL CANDIDATE SAYS DEFUNDING POLICE CAUSED EXODUS OF OFFICERS: 'EXPERIMENT ISN'T WORKING'

As crime has increased, the police department in Seattle has faced steep staffing shortages - a problem that has affected nearly all law enforcement agencies in King County, where Seattle is located.

""Pretty clearly, the defund, disarm and disparage movement by Seattle's liberal political leaders has utterly gutted our criminal justice infrastructure. And we are seeing the results of those failed policies out on the streets in the form of a 50-year-high crime,"" King County Councilman Reagan Dunn told Fox News Digital.

Seattle PD has lost more than 400 members over the last two and half years, including the city’s police chief in August of 2020 who said she felt ""destined to fail"" after police cuts and amid continued talks to defund the department even more.

The King County Sheriff’s Office had more than 100 vacant deputy positions as of last month. And at the King County jail, the largest adult detention center in the county and located in the city, staffing shortages played out on a national stage in July when it shut down booking services for eight hours overnight due to staffing shortages.

The staffing issues have even extended to the Seattle Fire Department, which has been understaffed 69% of the time this year alone and spending more than $11 million to fund overtime costs to cover the gaps, KTTH radio host Jason Rantz reported in July.

In 2021, Durkan pulled out of the mayoral race after she had already filed her re-election paperwork in 2020, before the pandemic and calls to defund the police rocked the nation. She had met calls for her resignation not only from protesters and rioters, but also by Democratic groups in the city and a councilmember who accused her of ""abuse of power,"" arguing protesters were faced with brutality from officers.

""This was a hard year … and it was a hard year on every level, including the civil rights uprisings, and the racial reckoning and how we do policing. And I think all us have learned a number of lessons from this year,"" Durkan said when announcing she would not run.

In November of last year, voters issued a resounding defeat to liberal, pro-defund the police candidates. Candidates for mayor, city council and city attorney, who supported defunding the Seattle Police Department were defeated by more centrist candidates.

Former City Council president Bruce Harrell defeated a mayoral opponent who sought to further gut the police department, and became the city’s mayor.

He has since called for the hiring of 500 police officers for the city over the next five years, with the hopes the department will employ 1,450 trained officers by 2027.

"Severely understaffed, defunded Austin PD on verge of retirement wave after city council 'pulls rug out' again","FIRST ON FOX: Austin police officers past and present are warning Fox News Digital that the Texas capital's police force critically depleted as a result of defunding in 2020 is on the verge of losing another wave of officers in response to a breakdown between the city and the police on a new contract.

An Austin Police Department source told Fox News Digital this week that 40 officers have filed their retirement papers following a 9-2 city council vote a few weeks ago to scrap a four-year contract that the city had previously agreed to in principle and instead pursue a 1-year contract that the police union's board has rejected.

That move is believed by many to be due to intense pressure from anti-police activists in the city who look to hold off a long term deal until after voters decide on competing ballot initiatives dealing with ""police oversight"" that go before voters in May.

""It's my opinion that the radicals and activists in the city have such a grip on our elected officials that at some point in time over the last year or so their plans changed,"" the source, who is an Austin Police Department officer, said. ""They said O.K. now we’re going to get signatures for this ballot initiative in May and switch gears and put pressure on city leadership to move away from a four-year deal to a one-year deal because the four-year is detrimental to what we are trying to accomplish.""

TEXAS SALON OWNERS CONSIDER CLOSING SHOP AFTER CRIME CRISIS LEAVES THEM WAITING UP 'TO AN HOUR' FOR POLICE

Dennis Farris, president of the Austin Police Retired Officers Association, told Fox News Digital he knows of 35 officers from the department that have filed retirement papers and at least six of them are ""high ranking officers.""

""I fear we're going to see a mass exodus of the senior people with longevity to where you're going to have a department where maybe the average service time was in the high teens now and I think it's going to drop into the low teens,"" Farris said, explaining that departments without strong senior leadership often experience more problems due to ""inexperience.""

Farris said that two waves of retirements, officers who have already filed and officers who will file when the contract officially expires at the end of March, could result in as many as 100 retirements. Two police sources told Fox News Digital that 150 officers have reached out to the retirement board in the last few days to discuss options.

AUSTIN POLICE SEIZE DRUGS, GUNS IN STREET TAKEOVER AFTERMATH AS CHIEF SAYS FORCE IS UNDERSTAFFED EVERY NIGHT

Austin Police Association President Thomas Villarreal, head of the police union that has been heavily involved with the negotiations, told Fox News Digital that he has been hesitant to speculate on exactly how many of the 309 eligible Austin police officers will retire but said he wouldn’t be surprised if the number was ""30 to 50.""

""My fear, if I'm being frank, is that my membership after living through this again, after living through having the rug pulled out from underneath them, that my membership won't get there again,"" Villarreal said.

Austin Police Officer Justin Berry, who has served in the department for 16 years, told Fox News Digital that the loss of officers won’t be limited to those that are eligible to retire and will also include resignations of younger officers.

""I talked to a six-year officer the other day who is just waiting on their application from another agency to be accepted and once that officer gets their acceptance letter that officer is going to separate and leave,"" Berry said.

""So I think you also have a whole other variable in play that a lot of folks aren't thinking of and I think it would not be surprising to see an above average number of officers ten years and under separating from the department as well.""

""Unfortunately, we are at a point of no return with the Austin Police officers who have left and those who have plans to leave due to how the contract negotiations have played out over the last few weeks,"" Austin City Council Member Mackenzie Kelly, one of the two council members who voted against the move toward a one-year-deal, told Fox News Digital in a statement, adding that she still hopes to ""bargain a contract so that we can give our officers what they deserve.""

""I remain committed to ensuring our police officers have the pay and incentives necessary to stay through this challenging time,"" Kelly added.

Regardless of the total number of officers that end up retiring or resigning in the next few weeks as a result of this failed contract negotiation, the resignations and retirements will come at a time when Austin can't afford to lose any officers and is already experiencing a dire police shortage dating back to 2017 when contract negotiation turmoil sparked an officer exodus.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT LAUNCHES TASK FORCE TO CRACK DOWN ON STREET TAKEOVERS AFTER AUSTIN CHAOS, POLICE CRISIS

Budget cuts by the city council amid the George Floyd unrest in 2020 slashed police cadet classes and sent staffing on trajectory that the police officer source says will take ""well over 10 years to get back to where we were a few years ago"" and that's if the ship were to be righted ""today.""

Additionally, certain task forces within the department were eliminated due to staffing issues which left some classes of crime largely ignored, police announced they had to stop responding to non-emergencies, Austin set an all-time record for homicides in 2021, and police morale cratered with many saying city leadership was to blame.

In 2021, 210 police officers left the force which represented more than the two previous years combined.

The Austin Police Department entered this year with 259 vacancies, 230 of them patrol positions, according to KXAN-TV.

AUSTIN POLICE, 911 STAFFING LEVELS QUESTIONED AFTER STREET RACERS TAKE OVER MAJOR INTERSECTION, INJURE COP

Police Chief Joseph Chacon said in January that the 311 non-emergency phone line will continue to take the place of 911 for calls that are no longer in progress.

The four-year contract that had been negotiated over the last few months called for hiring 200 officers by the end of 2024, and another 200 officers by the end of 2025 along with 14% raise over the contract’s four years.

""On any given night, we are going out understaffed right now, and I'm talking about minimum staffing levels,"" Chacon said Thursday. ""I'm not even talking about optimal staffing levels.""

Evidence of the shortage grabbed national attention last Saturday when street racers took over a large intersection, set off fireworks, damaged police cars, injured a police officer, and resulted in City Council Member Alison Alter waiting on hold for 28 minutes with 911.

Alter was the second council member, along with Kelly, to vote against the measure to purse a one-year contract.

""Imagine for a moment that the incidents last night happened with large scale events going on,"" Kelly tweeted on Sunday , adding that she is ""increasingly concerned about our police vacancies.""

""The possibility of a catastrophic cascading failure due to lack of support from our police department puts the city, its residents, and visitors at risk of danger,"" Kelly, one of the two council members along with Alter to vote against moving toward a one-year contract earlier this month, added.

AUSTIN COUNCIL MEMBER RAISES THE ALARM ON DISTRESSED 911 CALL CENTER, LONG HOLD TIMES

Farris told Fox News Digital that Austin has become the ""poster child"" of the defund the police movement and, unlike other cities across America, hasn’t ""figured out there's a direct correlation to how you treat your police officers publicly as politicians and the crime rate.""

""You know that old saying that you can’t unring that bell? You can’t unring this bell.""

Some officials, including recently elected Democratic Mayor Kirk Watson, have argued that they weren’t aware the outgoing city manager had been working on a four-year contract with police and that it had been ""sprung on us"" at the ""last minute.""

Council members have also pushed for stop-gap measures including an ordinance unanimously passed by the council on Thursday that would attempt to mitigate police benefits that would be lost and provide a pay bump if the contract expires at the end of March at which point Austin police officers revert to a civil service agreement under state law that lacks the same benefits of a union deal including money that can be paid out at retirement.

""There’s not a lot of trust with the city that they’re going to keep their word.""

Watson, who took office in January, acknowledged to Fox News Digital that ""some officers had already decided to retire prior to the adoption of the ordinance"" but he hopes ""those still considering their options will see this ordinance as a demonstration of good faith by the City Council.

""Many people who want the City Council to just approve a four-year contract don’t appreciate or accept that doing so would effectively silence Austin voters in May. As Mayor, I need to protect their rights, too.""

Council Member Ryan Alter, the author of the ordinance, directed Fox News Digital to his press release that said the measure ""provides stable benefits and pay to our officers, while maintaining robust oversight.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, City Council Member Leslie Pool said, ""I hope the officers stay with the department and the dais clearly communicated that point yesterday.""

Council Member Vanessa Fuentes told Fox News Digital the unanimous vote on the ordinance shows that the council is working in ""good faith.""

""By unanimously deciding to protect and potentially enhance the salaries of our officers, we’re implementing forward-facing solutions while keeping the door open for continued negotiations. Oversight and benefits for our police are not mutually exclusive, we should not treat them as such.""

'DEFUND THE POLICE' AFTERMATH CREATED 'RIPPLE EFFECT' THAT ENDANGERS EVERYONE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS

Villarreal told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that while he’s ""grateful"" for any effort by the council to try and fill in the gaps for officers, the ""stability for officers lies in contracts.""

""It doesn't lie in an ordinance that can be changed by the vote of six people and so I don't want to see our people leave but I fear we'll see some chunk of them leave,"" Villarreal said, adding it would require a ""tremendous amount of trust"" to rely on a ""political body"" making ""political decisions"" to handle those non-binding contract stop-gaps indefinitely.

Questions have been raised about the legality and legitimacy of an ordinance to rectify the solution including by former Austin City Manager Spencer Cronk who was negotiating the tentative four-year deal with the APD.

""Council cannot simply pass an ordinance that contradicts state law, and we do not believe we can get Association agreement absent the stability of a long term contract,"" Cronk wrote in a memo to the council on February 6 shortly before his firing.

Watson said on Thursday after the ordinance vote that he is ""asking the Association to come back to the negotiating table.""

Villarreal rejected any notion that the APA has walked away from the negotiating table ""shaking hands on a tentative agreement"" on a four-year deal only to have that deal scrapped in favor of a one-year deal that his board does not support.

""I've said publicly, I've said privately, I've said to our council that our police department is sliding backwards, we need the stability of a long term contract,"" Villarreal said. ""I recognize that they want to have a conversation about oversight. We’re not scared of oversight.""

""[W]e spent another four and a half months working to come to a tentative agreement on a four-year deal just to have the rug pulled out from underneath us.""

""They want to have a conversation about oversight after the May election which is fine. We can have that conversation. But this idea that the APA is not willing to have conversations is nonsense. This idea that we walked away from the table is nonsense. We recognize that life is better for everybody when we're under a long term agreed to contract.""

AUSTIN, TEXAS RESIDENTS 'LIVING IN FEAR' AS CRITICS BLAME STREET RACING CHAOS ON POLICE STAFFING 'CRISIS'

Villarreal also told Fox News Digital that it wasn't until about 3 weeks ago that he heard the argument that a four-year-deal wasn't ideal because of the May ballot initiative.

""Why did we not hear about it back in September when they voted to put the first petition on the ballot?"" Villarreal asked, explaining that if the council ""believed in their core"" that the measure took precedence, it could have been discussed months ago.

""That would have given both sides time to figure out, is this what we do? Do we work towards it? But instead, we spent another four and a half months working to come to a tentative agreement on a four-year deal just to have the rug pulled out from underneath us.""

""They're happy to see as many cops as possible resign or retire. That's the ultimate goal. That's the long game.""

When it comes to the oversight that activists and politicians have been clamoring for and using as a reason to oppose a long term contract, all four individuals who spoke with Fox News Digital said that narrative is disingenuous.

""It's incredibly frustrating when anti-police activists claim that we are scared of oversight,"" Villarreal said. ""We've got the most progressive oversight in the state of Texas as it is. What we agreed to in the four-year contract would have been light years ahead of what we had in terms of oversight. It’s oversight that no other city in the state of Texas would ever agree to.""

AUSTIN DA GARZA CREATES CONFUSION WITH ANNOUNCEMENT OF IMPENDING INDICTMENTS AGAINST MULTIPLE POLICE OFFICERS

""None of this is about oversight,"" Berry, one of 19 police officers indicted by Austin's progressive district attorney for their role in quelling a Black Lives Matter riot in 2020, told Fox News Digital.

""They're keeping a focus on oversight because that forces people like Thomas and everyone else to have to go and talk about oversight to look like we're not trying to skirt away from it when there is plenty of oversight there.""

Berry pointed to rhetoric from activists at recent city hall meetings as evidence that the true goal of progressive activists in Austin has nothing to do with oversight and more to do with distracting from the goal of police abolition.

Berry added that ever since the department lost 150 officers when the city council voted to slash the police budget in 2020, the money was eventually replaced when the state got involved, but the staffing shortage was never filled.

Farris agreed and said ""it’s never been about oversight.""

""It's about who controls the department and getting rid of the department,"" Farris continued. ""That's what this is about. It has nothing to do with oversight. If it had to with oversight they would accept what's there because it's the strongest oversight in the state.""

Berry told Fox News Digital that ultimately the gap between the two sides on the contentious deal boils down to trust.

""There’s not a lot of trust with the city that they’re going to keep their word,"" Berry said. ""Case in point, the city had a tentative agreement with the city’s word and the association’s word that we have something we can work with just to go back on their word again.""

"Police warn of alarming crime trend at funerals, car washes","Brazen car thieves are targeting victims at unlikely locations, including car washes and funerals, as police warn drivers to stay alert.

""Be aware of any suspicious persons lingering by your car,"" the Nassau County Police Department posted in a warning on Facebook.

Police in the greater New York City area say thieves are hanging around car washes to target high-end vehicles. The perps allegedly hop in the car once the wash is complete and drive off – and such incidents have already repeatedly played out.

Earlier this month, a suspect wearing a mask got out of a blue BMW at Diamond Car Wash in Mamaroneck, New York, and jumped into a BMW X5 that had just been washed. The suspect then drove away before car wash employees knew what happened, according to ABC 7.

Police say the thieves are meticulous when targeting cars.

""The blue BMW could be seen across the street, and he doesn't act right away, he waits for that perfect moment to jump out,"" Village of Mamaroneck Police Department Lt. P.J. Trujillo told ABC 7 of the incident at Diamond Car Wash.

Another BMW was stolen at the Dip In Car Wash in Mamaroneck, while a Mercedes was stolen at a car wash in Manhasset and an Audi stolen from a car wash in Oceanside, according to local reports this month.

Police in New York are advising that drivers use car washes that allow them to remain in the vehicle or to ask the attendant to return the car’s key fob once the vehicle comes out of the wash.

PHILADELPHIA REACHES 1,000 CARJACKINGS FOR FIRST TIME EVER

""You should never lose sight of your vehicle,"" Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder told WCBS 880. ""As soon as it gets out, make sure that the company that’s doing it pulls that vehicle aside and then ask them to shut the car off and give them the keys as they go to dry the vehicle. Do not leave the car running in that situation.""

Drivers can also buy a ""kill switch"" for their vehicles, which can turn cars off from a distance.

In Tennessee this month, criminals took another brazen tactic to steal: targeting cars at a funeral for a veteran.

""We were probably only a hundred feet from where the cars were to the grave site. We didn’t hear anything, didn’t have any indications there were issues,"" one mourner told Fox 13.

Sixth Memphis police officer involved in Tyre Nichols investigation relieved of duty,"The Memphis Police Department has relieved of duty a sixth police officer who was involved in the investigation into Tyre Nichols' death this month.

An MPD spokesman confirmed the department relieved Officer Preston Hemphill of duty in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital. The 26-year-old officer joined the force in 2018 and allegedly used his taser on Nichols prior to the beating by five other officers.

Preston, who is white, has not yet been charged with a crime in connection to the incident. Memphis police say he is the subject of an ongoing investigation, however.

The five other officers, who are black, include Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith. They were each terminated on Jan. 18 and are facing seven counts: second-degree murder; aggravated assault, act in concert; two counts of aggravated kidnapping; two counts of official misconduct; and official oppression.

TYRE NICHOLS MEMORIAL FUNDRAISER BLOWS PAST $1 MILLION IN 2 DAYS

Nichols' beating and death has led to outrage acrossthe country, with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) requesting to meet directly with President Biden to discuss police reforms.

""No one in our nation should fear interacting with the police officers who serve our diverse communities, large and small. We all want to be safe,"" the CBC wrote to Biden.

St. Louis police department resignations stack up as leaders sound the alarm: 'reaching critical mass',"Resignations have continued piling up at the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department this year, setting off concerns from top law enforcement leaders.

""We’re reaching critical mass,"" St. Louis Police Officers Association President Jay Schroeder said this month of staffing issues on the city’s force.

About 819 officers have left the department since 2017, according to the St. Louis Police Pension Board. The department lost an average of 119 officers each year between 2017 and 2019. In 2020, 129 officers left the force, with an additional 174 leaving in 2021, according to the pension data.

St. Louis, which often ranks as one of the least safe cities in the country, joins a growing list of police departments across the country that are bleeding officers in recent years, most notably after calls to defund the police echoed across the nation in 2020.

ST. LOUIS CHECKS IN AS AMERICA'S MOST DANGEROUS CITY WHILE BALTIMORE SUBURB RANKS AS THE SAFEST: STUDY

Data provided to Fox News Digital by the St. Louis Police Department shows that, as of Tuesday, the force has 1,035 commissioned employees.

Police department data shows the number of authorized employees has fallen each year since 2020. There were a total of 1,205 commissioned employees at the start of 2020, 1,198 in January 2021, and 1,128 in January of this year.

Interim Police Chief Michael Sack sent an email to staff this month detailing the department has 811 police officers and detectives as of Oct. 3, down from the 905 police officers and detectives the force had at the beginning of October 2021.

""This puts a burden on us to perform our duties with fewer officers,"" he wrote, KSDK reported earlier this month. ""We must pay attention to staffing in the line platoons and on squads. No squad should have fewer than five officers with the optimum number being seven officers. I wish I could give you more, but this is the reality.""

VIOLENT CRIMES ON THE RISE IN 2022, FOLLOWING PREVIOUS UNPRECEDENTED SPIKE IN MURDERS

""I am working hard to find ways to put more officers on the line platoons. These officers and sergeants provide a great service to our community and they need the support of all of us to help them do their jobs effectively and safely,"" the email later stated.

At police headquarters, a pile of discarded uniforms known as ""Mount Exodus"" has also grown, KSDK reported. Outgoing cops have been putting their old uniforms on a pile that has grown higher than seven feet tall and 10 feet wide, and even blocks some surrounding doorways, the outlet reported.

There have been about 71 new hires in 2022, according to the outlet.

Despite concerns from law enforcement leadership in the area, Mayor Tishaura Jones said staffing levels at the department are sufficient, according to KSDK. She cited a 2020 study showing the city has more officers per capita compared to similar sized-cities, the outlet reported.

""We have enough officers, we need to do a better job of retaining and recruiting them,"" St. Louis Public Safety Director Dan Isom added.

MISSOURI LOOTER FACES SENTENCING IN MURDER OF RETIRED ST. LOUIS POLICE CAPTAIN DURING 2020 GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS

Jones, who was sworn in as mayor last year, campaigned on a safety policy of ""putting the public back in public safety."" Her campaign website states that ""defunding the police does not mean abolishing the police,"" instead it means ""restructuring the department and reallocating the budget to programs and resources that actually prevent crime.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the mayor’s office for comment on the staffing levels but did not immediately receive a reply.

St. Louis is far from alone in reporting staffing shortages and an increase in resignations — cities across the country have reported more of the same.

MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS

The Chicago Police Department reported the lowest number of employees in recent history at the end of March. The Seattle Police Department reached a 30-year staffing low this year. The vice president of the Philadelphia FOP Lodge sounded the alarm in August that the department is set to lose 800 officers in the next four years.

""We see law enforcement officers leave our profession at a rate we've never seen before,"" National Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes said at the Faith & Blue conference in Washington, D.C., in August. ""Our profession is dependent on the best and brightest stepping up and taking this job. And because of the actions, and because of the turmoil that has happened in the last two years, we have a crisis right now in manpower.""

In the video, the deputy explains to the couple that they were pulled over for driving an unlicensed vehicle without the tag on it.

During the stop, O’Connor asked the deputy if his body-worn camera was recording. The deputy responded, ""It is.""

""In hindsight, I realize how my handling of this matter could be viewed as inappropriate, but that was certainly not my intent. I knew my conversation was on video, and my motive was not to put the deputy in an uncomfortable position. I have personally called the Pinellas County Sheriff offering to pay for any potential citation.""

She added, ""I have expressed great remorse to the mayor, and I apologize to the residents of Tampa who have a reasonable expectation of better judgment from their chief of police.

Temple police shooting suspect shot officer 3 more times as cop lay on ground with head wound: officials,"The 18-year-old suspect accused of fatally shooting a Temple University police officer in the head over the weekend stood over the officer and shot him three more times as the cop lay on the ground near the Philadelphia campus before trying to steal the fallen officer’s gun, officials said on Tuesday.

Philadelphia police released the new details during a press conference on the death of Temple University Police Officer Christopher Fitzgerald, who had responded Saturday night to a robbery call in an area that officials say has seen a spike in carjackings and robberies.

While responding to the call, police said Fitzgerald spotted three teenagers dressed in all black and wearing masks to cover their faces. The officer approached the trio but they tried to flee.

Fitzgerald called in a foot pursuit over his radio and chased after the teens. He caught up to the 18-year-old alleged gunman, later identified as Miles Pfeffer, and ordered him to get on the ground, police said.

Pfeffer ignored the officer’s orders and pulled out a gun, according to authorities. The suspect fired at Fitzgerald, striking the officer in the head and torso.

When Fitzgerald fell to the ground, Pfeffer shot the officer three more times, officials said.

Pfeffer initially fled the scene, according to police, but returned to search through the fallen officer’s pockets. Officials said he tried to steal Fitzgerald’s gun.

After shooting the officer, police said the suspect carjacked a driver at gunpoint, threatening to shoot and kill them.

The post received more than 1,700 comments, 1,500 shares and 10,000 likes as of Sunday’s count.

After receiving an outpouring of negative comments on the post, the Thrall Police Department added a paragraph hours later, writing, ""I must have missed something, I believed that this young man was arrested, charged, indicted and then found not guilty by a jury of his peers.""

KYLE RITTENHOUSE ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT WISCONSIN RIVER TUBING STABBING SUSPECT ON SELF-DEFENSE CLAIM

""Is this not how our country works anymore?"" Thrall police added. ""The hate in these comments is terrible, if you have information that is contrary to that I would honestly love to hear it.""

Rittenhouse was 17 and living in Illinois when he answered calls online to defend businesses during rioting unfolding in nearby Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2021 in response to the police shooting of a 29-year-old Black man named Jacob Blake while officers responded to a domestic dispute.

Amid the chaotic scene, Rittenhouse opened fire, shooting three people, two of them fatally.

Rittenhouse testified that he fired in self-defense, and his legal team showed video suggesting that protesters first chased down and attacked the then-17-year-old before he fired his rifle. In November 2021, Rittenhouse was acquitted by a jury on all charges stemming from the shooting during racial justice protests despite being vilified by left-leaning media as an alleged white supremacist.

""Sick you are making him out as a hero. Shame on your officer and this department,"" one Facebook user, Kari Ashpaugh, of Sattuck, Oklahoma, commented beneath the photo shared by Thrall Police Department of Rittenhouse and the officer smiling.

""I get it, cause both can kill people without repercussions,"" another Facebook user, Joshua Davis, whose profile says he attended Lake Erie College, commented.

Several other comments criticized the post as a ""disgrace,"" questioned if Rittenhouse was stopped for a traffic violation and ripped the selfie as a waste of taxpayer dollars on police work.

""Is this a joke? You’re welcoming a known killer into our state?"" Phoenix Woods, of Plano, Texas, commented. ""This is completely disgusting.""

A few users did defend Rittenhouse in the comment section.

""Welcome to Texas Kyle and have a great year at school. Ignore these haters. They wouldn't know bravery [if] it bit them on the rear,"" Theresa Lounder, of Conroe, Texas, commented.

The now 19-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, is reportedly attending Blinn College, a public junior college in Texas, with hopes of eventually transferring to Texas A&M University.

Tyre Nichols: Arraignment date set for 5 ex-Memphis police officers charged in fatal beating,"The five Memphis, Tennessee, police officers charged in connection to the death of Tyre Nichols will be arraigned in mid-February, Fox News can confirm.

Court records show they are scheduled to appear for a ""bond arraignment"" on Feb. 17.

The hearing will take place at 10 a.m. ET in front of Shelby County criminal court Judge James Jones.

The five former officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith — were all terminated on Jan. 18. They are each facing seven counts: second-degree murder; aggravated assault, act in concert; two counts of aggravated kidnapping; two counts of official misconduct; and official oppression.

TYRE NICHOLS: AL SHARPTON CONDEMNS VIOLENT PROTESTERS FOR ‘HELPING THE POLICE’ AFTER TIMES SQUARE ARRESTS

Setting the court date nearly three weeks away is considered normal, according to a local criminal defense attorney not involved in the case who spoke to Fox News. The attorney noted how the five former officers are all already out on bond and are no longer in custody.

On Friday, officials released footage showing Nichols, a 29-year-old FedEx driver, beaten by the five Memphis police officers on Jan. 7.

Nichols died at the hospital three days after the arrest.

Police Director Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis, who became the first woman to lead the Memphis department just 20 months ago, permanently disbanded the city's so-called Scorpion unit on Saturday.

The New York Post reported that at least two of the five officers charged in Nichols' death were hired after the Memphis Police Department relaxed qualification requirements.

According to NBC News, Bean and Haley both joined the department in August 2020. That was about two months after the Minneapolis death of George Floyd sparked anti-police riots across the country. It was also two years after the Memphis Police Department changed some of the qualifications needed to become a police officer.

In 2018, Action 5 reported that new Memphis police recruits no longer needed an associate’s degree or 54 college credit hours to join. Five years of work experience would suffice.

The Post also reported that Haley, who was a correction officer at the Shelby County Corrections Department at the time, was accused of beating up an inmate who smuggled in contraband eight years ago. Haley denied in court papers allegations he assaulted Cordarlrius Sledge, who was serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, in May 2015.

The lawsuit was dismissed in 2018 before its merits were evaluated after Sledge failed to provide the court with the requested information.

Tyre Nichols death: Memphis police 'permanently deactivate' SCORPION Unit,"The Memphis Police Department announced on Saturday that it has permanently deactivated its ""Scorpion Unit"" after the death of Tyre Nichols.

Members of the Scorpion Unit were involved in the traffic stop on Jan. 7 that officials say led to Nichols dying at a local hospital days later.

""Today, Memphis Police Officers assigned to the SCORPION Unit (Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods) met with Chief Cerelyn 'C.J.' Davis to discuss the path forward for the department and the community in the aftermath of the tragic death of Tyre Nichols,"" Memphis police said in a statement.

""In the process of listening intently to the family of Tyre Nichols, community leaders, and the uninvolved officers who have done quality work in their assignments, it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the SCORPION Unit.""

""The officers currently assigned to the unit agree unreservedly with this next step. While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonor on the title SCORPION, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted,"" the police department said.

TYRE NICHOLS DEATH: LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP 'INFURIATED' BY ALLEGED ASSAULT DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Five former Memphis police officers were fired after the incident and are being charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault as well as other charges.

Nichols died days after Memphis police stopped him for alleged ""reckless driving"" on Jan. 7. During the traffic stop, officials say that a ""confrontation occurred,"" which led to Nichols attempting to run away from the officers.

When police officers caught up with Nichols, another confrontation occurred, leaving Nichols complaining about a shortness of breath.

"Video shows Utah child, 4, shoot at police outside McDonald's drive-thru","Utah police have released body-camera footage showing a Feb. 12 incident in which a 4-year-old shot at police officers at a McDonald's drive-thru in Midvale.

Officers with the Unified Police Department were responding to reports that a male suspect allegedly brandished a firearm at McDonald's employees due to an incorrect order around 1:30 p.m. local time, and, once officers arrived and began to detain 27-year-old Sadaat Johnson, a child in the backseat of his vehicle fired a gun at the responders.

In the body-camera footage from the Unified Police Department released to FOX 13 Salt Lake City, officers can be heard telling two distraught children, ages 3 and 4, in the backseat of Johnson's vehicle, ""It's okay,"" after one of the children fired a single shot.

Police initially detained Johnson after they asked him to exit his vehicle and he refused to cooperate, according to a press release from the police department. Footage shows officers forcibly removing the suspect from the driver's seat and handcuffing him on the ground.

Oklahoma City Police say they first located Berry in the parking lot of a business before he fled the area, but ""officers monitored the pursuit with the assistance of the police helicopter which was providing updates from the air.""

At one point, police say Berry drove onto a property and made an unsuccessful attempt to steal the homeowner’s vehicle, yet he found a handgun inside it and fled the scene in the red SUV that responding officers were tracking.

Wyoming police locate missing romance novelist who allegedly fled to Hawaii after arrest,"Police in Wyoming have located a missing romance novelist who allegedly fled to Hawaii after initially being arrested and charged with fleeing police officers.

Faleena Hopkins, who is known for writing several romance novels and for her attempt to trademark the word ""cocky"" for her books about the ""Cocker Brothers,"" went missing on Jan. 30, shortly after she was arrested.

Three days before Hopkins disappeared, she was taken into custody after allegedly fleeing officers approaching her vehicle parked in a remote portion of Grand Teton National Park.

Hopkins was initially given a ticket for driving a ""non-oversnow vehicle on an oversnow route"" after getting her car stuck and needing a snowplow in order to be removed.

After parting ways with police, officers attempted to stop her shortly after while she was parked ""in the highway at Jackson Lake Junction, inside Grand Teton National Park,"" according to officials, adding that Hopkins then attempted to flee.

""The officer initiated his patrol vehicle lights, and the woman fled in her vehicle. She began to drive at a high rate of speed"" over 75 mph and up to 90 mph, officials said.

Hopkins allegedly drove 24 miles before being pulled over after spike strips were released.

She was charged with fleeing or attempting to elude police officers, stopping or parking upon the roadway, operating a vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit, failing to comply with a traffic control device and operating a vehicle without due care.

She was scheduled to be in court on Feb. 28 in relation to the incident.

Days after the arrest, Hopkins went missing after being last seen in the Jackson, Wyoming area.

Jackson Police Department Lt. Russ Ruschill told Fox News Digital in an earlier statement that ""a member of her family"" reported Hopkins missing, saying ""there is some concern by her family members that she’s in danger.""

In a statement on Friday, Ruschill said that Hopkins has been located.

China has opened overseas police stations in US and Canada to monitor Chinese citizens: report,"China has opened dozens of ""overseas police service stations"" around the globe to monitor its citizens living abroad, including one location in New York City and three in Toronto.

""These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate the international rule of law, and may violate the territorial integrity in third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods,"" reads a report by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights watchdog, released earlier this month.

The report, titled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" details China's extensive efforts to combat ""fraud"" by its citizens living overseas, in part by opening several police stations on five continents that have assisted Chinese authorities in ""carrying out policing operations on foreign soil.""

VP KAMALA HARRIS EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN, TORCHES CHINA WHILE ADDRESSING NAVY SAILORS IN JAPAN

Europe is home to most of the police stations, with locations spread across the continent in places such as London, Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest, Athens, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt. North America is also home to four of the stations, with three locations in Toronto and one in New York City. In all, there are 54 such stations in 30 different countries.

The report details how China has attempted to ""combat the growing issue of fraud and telecommunication fraud by Chinese nationals living abroad,"" running operations that have resulted in 230,000 Chinese nationals being ""persuaded to return"" to China ""voluntarily"" over the last year to face criminal prosecution.

The Chinese government has claimed that the stations provide vital services to its citizens living abroad, though the report notes that many of the services are those that would be traditionally carried out by an overseas embassy. Instead, the report argues that the stations have been used to enhance China's overseas law enforcement capabilities in possible violation of international law.

The report also outlines the potential human rights abuses associated with the stations, including using harassment and intimidation methods, such as threatening the family members of the overseas citizens. The stations have also served as centers to spread Chinese government propaganda and monitor the behavior and opinions of Chinese nationals.

""As these operations continue to develop, and new mechanisms are set up, it is evident that countries governed by the standards set by universal human rights and the rule of law urgently need to investigate these practices to identify the (local) actors at work, mitigate the risks and effectively protect the growing number of those targeted,"" the report concludes.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-opened-overseas-police-stations-us-canada-monitor-chinese-citizens,N/A
China’s secret police have invaded American shores: human rights advocate,"China's reported overseas police service stations and their operations to persuade citizens to return to the homeland mark a dangerous expansion of the regime’s international reach, according to a human rights advocate.

Safeguard Defenders, a pan-Asian human rights organization, published an investigation last month detailing a Chinese campaign to combat ""fraud and telecom fraud"" crimes committed by its citizens living abroad. The report indicated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has established at least 54 police stations across 30 different countries, including the U.S.

""I think it shows how brazen the CCP is getting and how little regard they have for other governments,"" Laura Harth, Safeguard Defenders' campaign manager, told Fox News. ""It’s in violation of international law, it’s in violation of territorial sovereign.""

The police stations are mostly located in Western Europe, but four are in North America, including one in New York City, according to the report. They allow Chinese authorities to ""carry out policing operations on foreign soil,"" Hart said.

""Obviously this shows how unaware, how naive certain governments are, or choose to be at this stage,"" Harth told Fox News. ""European authorities are severely lacking in awareness and willingness to act on or even look into it.""

Since the campaign launched in April 2021, 230,000 Chinese nationals have been ""persuaded to return"" home to face criminal prosecution, according to the Ministry of Public Security in China.

""A big part of this transnational policing repression campaign is also aiming at silencing the community, silencing dissent, making sure that people are afraid enough,"" Harth told Fox News.

Some reported tactics used to compel Chinese nationals to return include threatening and intimidating family members in China. A suspect's children can be banned from attending school, and their family’s bank accounts can be frozen and their property confiscated.

US WARNS ABOUT FOREIGN EFFORTS TO SWAY AMERICAN VOTERS

""They will interrogate people, maybe detain people,"" Harth said. ""There's also guilt by association. There are accounts of people being prosecuted or arrested for the presumed charges against their family members"" abroad.

China will ""do anything really to convince them to persuade their family members to come back,"" she added. ""Nothing seems to be too impressive or too harsh"" for the CCP.

If those tactics fail, the CCP will deploy its international officers to directly approach the suspect as a means of ""persuasion,"" according to Harth.

""That's a clear message to anyone seeking to leave China, already having left China, that you're not safe anywhere,"" she said.

While that may be true in part, Harth said, the stations are largely used to enhance China’s overseas law enforcement capabilities.

Iran shuts down morality police in response to protests: report,"Iran's attorney general has announced that the country is abolishing its morality police, a potential concession after months of protests against the regime.

The morality police ""was abolished by the same authorities who installed it,"" Attorney General Mohammad Javad Montazeri said Saturday, according to a report from the The New York Times.

The decision would be a major victory for protesters in the country, who have demonstrated across the country for months in response to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing a head covering in public.

The unrest that followed the death became one of the largest challenges to the Iranian regime in decades, spreading across the country and showing few signs of slowing down despite attempts by police to crack down on the demonstrations.

IRANIAN CLIMBER REKABI PUT UNDER HOUSE ARREST AFTER COMPETING WITHOUT HIJAB: REPORT

The crackdowns have resulted in about 400 deaths, according to international rights groups, including 50 minors. Another 30 members of Iran's security forces have been killed during the demonstrations. Meanwhile, the government issues threats of harsh punishments and executions for public dissent against the regime.

The morality police in Iran have been mainly responsible for enforcing the country's strict Islamic dress code, which requires women to cover their bodies in long, loose clothing and their head with a headscarf or hijab.

Abolishing the morality police would not change the rules that the police were tasked with enforcing, with Montazeri making clear that the courts would still have the ability to restrict ""social behavior.""

Iran has also announced that it is reviewing the country’s head scarf regulations, promising to come to a decision on the matter within 15 days.

Madeleine McCann disappearance: Polish police reportedly dispute woman's claims she is missing British girl,"Police in Wroclaw, Poland, are reportedly disputing a young woman's claims that she may be missing Madeleine McCann, a British girl who disappeared from a family vacation in Portugal in 2007.

The Polish woman, Julia Faustyna, who also goes by Julia Wendlet, has been claiming on Instagram and TikTok that she may be the missing toddler due to similarities in their appearance and age. She has amassed tens of thousands of followers as a result.

But Paweł Noga from the Provincial Police Headquarters in Wrocław told the Polish news outlet Gazeta that they have ""ruled out"" Faustyna's version of events to be ""true,"" according to an English translation of the outlet's report.

Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, along with their three children — Madeleine and twins Sean and Amelie — were on vacation in Praia da Luz, Portugal, when Madeline was taken from her bed on May 3, 2007. The family was staying in a ground-floor apartment.

Faustyna's account began posting photos two weeks ago. The Polish woman says she has a spot in her right eye and a beauty mark on her cheek that resemble McCann's. She also claims that details of her childhood don't add up, leading her to believe that she was abducted as a toddler.

""I don’t remember most of my childhood but my earliest memory is very strong and It’s about holidays in hot place where was beach and White or very light [colored] buildings with [apartments],"" Faustyna said in an Instagram post from her account, ""@iammadeleinemccann.""

""Due to an active police investigation, Gerry and Kate are not issuing any statements or giving interviews unless requested by The Metropolitan Police ,"" a spokesperson for the Official Find Madeleine Campaign said in a statement.

Social media users, who were at first curious about Faustyna's claims, are now wary about the viral account. Faustyna shot back at her critics in a statement posted to Instagram Thursday.

""For us as a family it is obvious that Julia is our daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin and step niece. We have memories, we have pictures,"" a translated version of the statement reads. ""Julia also has these photos, because she took them from the family home with the birth certificate, as well as numerous hospital discharges.""

The internet won't forget, and it's obvious that Julia isn't Maddie. We are devastated at this current situation. At the same time, we would like to announce that we will not do interviews, publish any photos, comment on articles. Please direct any questions or concerns to the Spokesperson of the Provincial Police Command in Wrocław,"" the statement continues.

""We know the Communist Party of China (CCP) has been ramping up its transnational repression efforts around the world over the past years,"" Safeguard Defenders' campaign manager, Laura Harth, told Fox News. ""And that the United Front Work networks linked to these stations have long been engaged in influence and interference operations abroad.""

""The stations appear as just the latest iteration of such growing practices,"" she said.

These overseas police stations allow Chinese authorities to ""carry out policing operations on foreign soil"" and have aided a CCP campaign to combat citizens living abroad who have allegedly committed ""fraud and telecom fraud,"" Harth said. Since the campaign’s launch in April 2021, 230,000 Chinese nationals have been ""persuaded to return"" home to face prosecution for alleged crimes, according to the Ministry of Public Security in China.

Safeguard Defenders also linked the reported overseas policing network to activities of China's United Front Work Department, a Communist Party organization charged with spreading its influence and propaganda overseas.

""The best testament to the scale of clandestine policing operations run by the [People's Republic of China] authorities come from their own official statements and work reports,"" Harth said. Beijing has touted the success of Operation Fox Hunt, a campaign that has returned over 11,000 high-value fugitives to China since 2014, according to Harth.

""The numbers and scale speak for themselves,"" she said. ""Especially in combination with the framework of illegal methods used … which include threats, harassment, detention of family members back home; the deployment of covert agents, embassy personnel, individuals tied to the overseas stations or hired agents to /persuade' the target abroad directly on foreign soil; and even kidnappings.""

China’s Foreign Ministry has denied that it's running undeclared police forces and said the locations provide services to its citizens living abroad, like renewing IDs and driver's licenses.

However, the newly reported stations were set up as early as 2016, according to Safeguard Defenders' investigation, disputing China’s statements that the operations were started in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even more concerning than China’s expanding operations, Harth said, is that ""the vast majority of targeted countries appeared completely unaware"" of the CCP’s police networks operating on their spoil, ""highlighting an urgent need for a coordinated response across the democratic alliance.""

At least 13 countries, including Canada, Germany and the Netherlands, have begun investigations into these police stations following the initial reporting of their existence, according to Safeguard Defenders. The U.S. was also included on the list, but it's not clear what steps the government is taking to look into the issue.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in November that he was aware of the stations’ existence and found the issue deeply concerning but declined to detail the bureau's investigative work on the matter.

""But to me, it is outrageous to think that the Chinese police would attempt to set up shop, you know, in New York, let's say, without proper coordination,"" Wray said. ""It violates sovereignty and circumvents standard judicial and law enforcement cooperation processes.""

Harth said it has been ""extremely encouraging to see the response of some governments"" but recommended that all countries hosting one of these stations ""take action to counter this common domestic threat and attack on fundamental freedoms and territorial sovereignty.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/shut-them-down-chinese-secret-police-stations-reportedly-found-prompting-call-consulate-closures,N/A
"UK police forces spend thousands on rainbow cars, flags supporting LGBT community: 'woke nonsense'","Police forces across the United Kingdom have spent £66,000, or nearly $80,000, on merchandise such as rainbow-themed cars and flags to support the LGBTQ community, a report found.

""Police chiefs have been caught red-handed wasting money on woke nonsense,"" Tom Ryan, a researcher at the Taxpayers’ Alliance, told the Telegraph.

The Telegraph reported that 27 police departments in England and Wales spent £66,689 on rainbow-themed merchandise between 2019 and 2022, according to data released under freedom of information laws.

The data, according to the Telegraph, found the South Wales Police force was the biggest spender, forking over £24,000, or roughly $29,000, for rainbow-themed T-shirts, badges, pens, whistles, flags, water bottles and even sporks.

Other departments spent funds to deck cars out with rainbow-themed stickers, on items called ""rainbow fuzzy bugs,"" as well as for fans and stickers.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council has previously said that rainbow-themed patrol vehicles act as ""hate-crime cars"" and encourage members of the public to report hate crimes, including social media posts, according to the Telegraph.

The Taxpayers’ Alliance, a nonpartisan group that advocates for lower taxes in the UK, slammed the spending, noting that crime is on the rise and funds should instead be used to bolster public safety.

""With crime on the up, it will bring little comfort to Brits knowing that bobbies are kitted out with rainbow merchandise,"" Ryan told the Telegraph. ""Police forces should put a stop to this pointless spending and focus funds on the frontline.""

Various institutions in the UK have come under fire in recent months for reportedly embracing ""woke culture,"" including London’s transportation agency after it published new guidelines last year for staff that ban words such as ""bicycles"" and ""accident"" for more welcoming and inclusive language.

The director of The Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, Nile Gardiner, told Fox News Digital at the time that the pervasive ""wokism"" in the country is a ""nefarious destructive ideology.""

""It is just completely ridiculous the rise of wokism in the U.K. It’s a nefarious destructive ideology that is advanced by the far left but adopted by a large number of British institutions. And it has no place in British society. It is hugely divisive and fundamentally un-British,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-police-forces-spend-thousands-rainbow-cars-flags-supporting-lgbt-community,N/A
