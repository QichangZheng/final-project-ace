"Buttigieg blames Trump, Rubio amidst East Palestine derailment backlash: 'Now that it's campaign season'","Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared to blame former President Trump and Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio’s, R-Fla., for the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, Thursday after facing intense backlash for his own performance.

Buttigieg spoke with MSNBC’s Joy Reid when ""The ReidOut"" host shifted the discussion to Trump’s visit to the town the day before, claiming that his roll back of regulations was partially responsible for the accident in the first place.

""You know, the sort of theatrics of Donald Trump being in Palestine were odd, but this is a community that voted overwhelmingly for him. The county that Palestine is in voted 71/29 for Donald Trump. I want you to reflect on the irony. In 2016, it was 68/26. This is a Trump county. What do you make of the fact he went there despite the fact the regulations he rolled back were partly responsible for this tragedy?"" Reid asked.

""It was definitely an ironic thing to do. You take down regulations, you water down regulations, you weaken the power of the administration to deal with freight railroad companies, and then you show up wanting to be a great friend of the people who have been impacted by a rail disaster,"" Buttigieg responded.

He continued, ""You know, this is somebody who as far as I know never went to a derailment site when one of those happens on his watch. And there were thousands. Even ones with fatalities. Never even sent his Transportation Secretary to go. Now that it’s campaign season, I guess things are different. We were there to work. We were there to get things done.""

JOY BEHAR LASHES OUT AT EAST PALESTINE RESIDENTS AFTER TRUMP VISIT: ‘THAT’S WHO YOU VOTED FOR’

The comments were similar to ones Buttigieg made one week prior to Yahoo! Finance that appeared to downplay the derailment.

""Look, rail safety is something that has evolved a lot over the years, but there's clearly more that needs to be done because while this horrible situation has gotten a particularly high amount of attention, there are roughly 1,000 cases a year of a train derailing,"" Buttigieg said at the time.

Reid continued to harp on Republican criticism of Buttigieg, remarking on Rubio's call for him to resign.

""You mentioned political silly season. I mean, it is. It’s a campaign season. One of the people who have taken a lot of the blame and taken a lot of the bricks is you. Senator Marco Rubio said you should resign. There’s been a lot of criticism over the time it took to arrive, for you to personally go, for the president to go. And they’re even using the president’s trip to Ukraine as a wedge. What do you have to say to Senator Rubio, who is blaming you and saying you should resign as a result of what happened in East Palestine?"" Reid asked.

Buttigieg answered, ""Well, the strange thing about hearing that from Senator Rubio is that the last time I had gotten a communication from him about railroad regulation was when he had signed a letter asking us to weaken our inspection practices. So but let me say this, I mean, if anybody, regardless of what they have done in the past, is serious about the future, Republican, Democrat, independent, if anybody has found religion on the subject of making sure that we actually regulate these corporations and hold them accountable, then I am calling them in and inviting them to the table.""

On Feb. 14, Buttigieg tweeted out his support for regulations 11 days after the derailment in.

""We are making historic investments on rail safety through funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, work that accelerates this year and continue in the years to come,"" Buttigieg tweeted.

CNN reporters agonize over Trump grand jury forewoman's bizarre media blitz: 'Prosecutor's nightmare',"CNN reporters agonized over Emily Kohrs, the forewoman on Georgia's special grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump, who sat down for multiple interviews with the media about the grand jury's recommendations.

CNN's Anderson Cooper and Elie Honig discussed Kohrs' interview Tuesday night and wondered if her media blitz was ""responsible.""

""First of all, why this person is talking on TV, I do not understand. Because, she’s clearly enjoying herself, but, I mean, is this responsible? She was the foreperson of this grand jury,"" Cooper said.

Honig said it was a ""horrible idea"" and that the prosecutors were likely ""wincing.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OKS ONLY PARTIAL RELEASE OF TRUMP SPECIAL GRAND JURY REPORT, CITING ‘VERY LIMITED DUE PROCESS’

""I was wincing just watching her eagerness to, like, hint at stuff,"" Cooper added. Honig said the interviews were a ""prosecutor's nightmare.""

""Mark my words, Donald Trump’s team is going to make a motion, if there’s an indictment, to dismiss that indictment based on grand jury impropriety. She’s not supposed to be talking about anything, really. But she’s really not supposed to be talking about the deliberations. She’s talking about what specific witnesses they saw, what the grand jury thought of them. She says some of them we found credible, some we found funny. I don’t know why that’s relevant, but she’s been saying we found this guy funny or interesting. I think she’s potentially crossing a line here. It’s gonna be a real problem for prosecutors,"" Honig continued.

During ""CNN This Morning"" on Wednesday, analyst Maggie Haberman joined the hosts to discuss Kohrs' media appearances and seemed to echo Cooper and Honig's concerns as well.

""If I am the prosecutor, I am not sure that I want this media tour taking place because I'm confident that Donald Trump’s lawyers are going to use this,"" she said.

During the CNN interview on Tuesday with Erin Burnett, Kohrs was asked if the jury recommended charges against Trump.

""I really don’t want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share,"" Kohrs said. ""I will tell you that it was a process where we heard his name a lot. Um, we definitely heard a lot about former President Trump, and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room. And I’ll say that, uh, when this list comes out, you wouldn’t, there are no major plot twists waiting for you.""

Kohrs also sat down with NBC News as well on Tuesday and said during the interview that the jury recommended indicting over a dozen people and that the list of people ""might"" include Trump.

""I don’t think that there are any giant plot twists coming. I don’t think there's any giant ‘that’s not the way I expected this to go at all’ moments,"" she told NBC. ""I would not expect you to be shocked.""

""Shouldn’t she be keeping her big bazoo shut? This girl, I mean, why is she going around talking? She wants attention. Everyone is a Kardashian now. Everybody wants attention. And that’s what this is about, I think, but I think that she could destroy this case,"" Behar said Wednesday.

Fellow co-host Sunny Hostin said that while she enjoyed the interviews and was ""giggling"" while watching them, she had serious concerns.

""I was thoroughly enjoying the interviews, like everyone else I was giggling, I was cracking up and stuff. But then when I put my federal prosecutor hat on, I was, like, ‘oh, no, she’s compromising the integrity of the investigation.’ Any grand jury investigation, especially federal ones, are secret proceedings, and they're supposed to be secret proceedings. You could get fired as a prosecutor for leaving a deposition out in your office, or taking it home and not putting it back in the locked chamber. It’s so serious,"" she said.

Hostin continued by saying that Kohrs looked a little ""excitable"" and that people are going to call her ""unhinged.""

""She’s acting like a child. She’s 30 years old. Someone should have stopped her,"" Behar added.

Fellow co-host Sara Haines said it was like Kohrs was ""playing charades"" during the interviews.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said that these interviews undermined the investigation and contrasted the situation with Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide, who Griffin said ""put her life on hold to cooperate in this investigation.""

""I don’t know why they would ever vote for him, somebody who, by the way, he placed someone with deep ties to the chemical industry in charge of the EPA's chemical safety office. That's who you voted for in that district — Donald Trump, who reduces all safety,"" Behar said while pointing at the camera.

Behar also said East Palestine residents need to ""look past the photo ops,"" referring to Trump's visit to the town on Wednesday, and see ""who is doing the job here.""

Co-hosts Sara Haines and Alyssa Farah Griffin argued that ""showing up"" is a big deal for the East Palestine community.

Co-host Sunny Hostin concluded at the end of the segment that it was Trump's fault.

""It's his fault, and then he shows up,"" Behar added.

Farah Griffin also argued that this was an ""unforced error"" by President Biden because it took 10 days for Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to put out a statement on the crisis and 20 days for him to visit East Palestine. Buttigieg visited the area on Thursday.

Hostin praised Buttigieg earlier in the segment for doing the ""work"" and not just visiting East Palestine for a photo op.

""This is serious stuff. And this did happen under the Trump administration,"" she said. ""Republicans talking about small government and less regulations.

She continued: ""And these people are going to suffer because of those things that happened. I’m not saying only Trump did it.

Liberal Twitter rages at Trump for bringing water to Ohio after rail disaster: 'S----- a-- Trump water',"Liberal Twitter influencers stormed the social media platform yesterday after former President Donald Trump donated water and other supplies to the residents of East Palestine, Ohio.

The former president’s visit came just days after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed in the small Ohio town, causing anxiety in some residents about the safety of local drinking water.

As a result, Trump donated water and other supplies to East Palestine, including his namesake ""Trump Spring Water,"" which he jokingly called ""Trump water.""

But some Twitter influencers expressed anger at the news.

""Trump shredded the safety regulations that could have kept East Palestine residents safe and then rolled into town with Trump water and a campaign slogan. He's as useless now as he was as a president.""

Lincoln Project founder Rick Wilson mocked Trump for donating water to residents Wednesday.

""Oddly, ‘Trump Water’ is what his diaper valet calls it.""

MSNBC historian suggests Georgia grand juror's media tour was conspiracy to help Trump,"NBC News and MSNBC historian Michael Beschloss promoted the idea that the bizarre media interviews with Georgia special grand jury forewoman Emily Kohrs might be a conspiracy to undermine the case looking into potential illicit 2020 election meddling on the part of former President Donald Trump.

The talking head floated out his idea Thursday that Kohrs’ media tour was either a bit of over-the-top, excitement about the ongoing case, or a ""deliberate effort"" to damage a case potentially incriminating of Trump’s alleged efforts to interfere in Georgia's 2020 presidential election vote counting.

Beschloss asked on Twitter, ""Was the sudden media tour by Georgia foreperson inspired by (a) innocent exuberance or (b) someone's deliberate effort to damage a potential case against the ex-President?""

GEORGIA JUDGE OKS ONLY PARTIAL RELEASE OF TRUMP SPECIAL GRAND JURY REPORT, CITING ‘VERY LIMITED DUE PROCESS’

By promoting this conspiracy theory, the presidential historian seemed to admit he disapproved of Kohrs’ media tour, which dominated the news cycle earlier this week, for how bizarre and uncanny it was.

As Fox News Digital reported, Kohrs "" baffled onlookers with her gleeful behavior and coyness during a recent media blitz.""

Also, whether he did so unknowingly or not, Beschloss’ conspiracy theorizing appeared to implicate his employers at NBC News in facilitating this supposed effort to damage the case against Trump. Kohrs spoke with multiple cable news outlets on this media tour, including NBC News and CNN.

Fox’s coverage further described Kohrs’ antics during the CNN interview with anchor Kate Bolduan, stating, ""She appeared thrilled to be on television as she told Bolduan she didn’t want to disobey the judge by offering too much information.""

During the interview, Kohrs coyly told Bolduan, ""I really don’t want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share. I will tell you that it was a process where we heard his name a lot. Um, we definitely heard a lot about former President Trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room.""

On other programs, CNN anchors lamented Kohrs’ media blitz. CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Elie Honig suggested Kohrs’ interviews may not have been wise for the sake of the case.

Cooper told Honig, ""First of all, why this person is talking on TV, I do not understand. Because, she’s clearly enjoying herself, but, I mean, is this responsible? She was the foreperson of this grand jury.""

Honig responded, calling the press tour a ""horrible idea."" He added that it could benefit Trump’s legal defense, saying, ""Mark my words, Donald Trump’s team is going to make a motion, if there’s an indictment, to dismiss that indictment based on grand jury impropriety. She’s not supposed to be talking about anything, really.""

"'Oddball' Trump grand jury foreperson Emily Kohrs dealt a 'terrible blow' to prosecution, Andrew McCarthy says","Attorney Andrew McCarthy said Emily Kohrs, the forewoman of a special grand jury as part of the Georgia criminal probe into former President Trump, may have dealt ""a terrible blow"" to prosecutors with her unusual media tour this week.

In a pair of appearances on CNN and NBC News, Kohrs appeared to strongly hint that Trump was among those recommended for criminal charges while laughing, joking and making animated facial expressions that seemed to provide answers she knew she shouldn't be offering. McCarthy, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, believes any ""fair-mind lawyer"" would object to her behavior.

""This is a terrible thing. She basically flouted the secrecy rules of the grand jury. She flouted the judge's order, and she makes the whole enterprise down there in Georgia look like it's a, you know – Trump called it a kangaroo court,"" McCarthy said.

""Whether it really is a kangaroo court or not, in that colorful sense, we'll have to see as the proceedings go by. But it's absolutely true that it's a terrible blow for their legal system and for this particular investigation, which has already had problems, because, you know, the [Fulton County] District Attorney [Fani Willis] is an elected Democrat who had a lot to say publicly about Trump even before this investigation opened,"" he continued. ""This doesn’t help them present the impression that they’re running a tight, ethical, professional investigation.""

TRUMP GRAND JURY FOREPERSON'S BIZARRE PRESS BLITZ STUNS LIBERAL MEDIA, SURPRISES LEGAL EXPERTS: ‘NO UPSIDE’

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney previously ordered that any recommendations on who should, or should not, be prosecuted would remain secret – for now – to protect their due process rights. The special grand jury did not have the power to issue indictments, and it will ultimately be up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to decide whether to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.

Kohrs has irked liberal CNN and MSNBC pundits this week with comments made to their own colleagues that may have inadvertently helped Trump’s legal team.

But CNN and NBC News provided Kohrs with the platform, and she drew attention to both networks during the pair of viral on-camera interviews. While legal experts think Kohrs’ media blitz may ultimately benefit the former president, McCarthy feels liberal pundits from CNN and MSNBC can’t be mad at their own networks for putting Kohrs in front of the camera. He said the news side of media organizations must make decisions that will sometimes annoy their colleagues.

""I think no matter what your political predisposition is, a jury forewoman who comes out to talk publicly and a high-profile case is a newsworthy event that they would believe they had to cover,"" McCarthy told Fox News Digital.

""So, I don't fault the news side for regarding it as a news story and covering it,"" he continued. ""You can quibble with whether or not they skewed the news as they reported it. That's a different issue, but whether it's a news story, I think it is a news story.""

Shortly after her interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday, her colleagues Anderson Cooper and Elie Honig reacted in astonishment.

""First of all, why this person is talking on TV, I do not understand,"" Cooper said. ""She's clearly enjoying herself. But, I mean, is this responsible? She was the foreperson of this grand jury!""

""This is a horrible idea,"" said Honig, a CNN legal analyst. ""And I guarantee you that prosecutors are wincing, watching her go on this… It’s a prosecutor’s nightmare.""

JOY BEHAR FUMES OVER TRUMP GRAND JURY MEMBER TOUR: ‘SHOULDN’T SHE BE KEEPING HER BIG BAZOO SHUT?'

On MSNBC, ""Morning Joe"" host Joe Scarborough was heard saying ""Oh, God"" as co-host Mika Brzezinski offered a recap of all the interviews Kohrs gave, which also included the Associated Press, New York Times and Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

MSNBC columnist and former prosecutor Barbara McQuade wrote Thursday that she was ""mortified"" about Kohr's ""reckless"" media tour. MSNBC shared the column on Twitter, tweeting, ""Loose lips sink ships — and can surely do the same for investigations. Emily Kohrs' media tour is reckless.""

The special grand jury spent about seven months hearing testimony from witnesses, including high-profile Trump allies, such as attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and top Georgia officials like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp.

TRUMP GRAND JURY FOREPERSON EMILY KOHRS LAUGHS, JOKES THROUGH STRANGE MEDIA TOUR ON CNN, NBC NEWS

While Kohrs has been criticized for joking and giggling during her CNN and NBC News interviews, McCarthy thinks a more serious foreperson would have still inadvertently helped Trump’s legal team with such a media blitz.

""I was a prosecutor for 20 years. What you want as the prosecutor is to convince the public that the investigation has been done by the book, in accordance with the rule of law, and that the tribunal is reliable and also following the law,"" McCarthy said.

""So, any time you have somebody violating the law in a very blatant way, even if that person were more articulate and seemed to have, you know, both feet on the ground and be a more serious, grounded person than the jury foreman, it would still be very bad for the prosecution and really for the court, and the court’s reputation for integrity,"" he continued.

""It would be bad to have somebody in such a big case flouting the rules this way. So that's the big problem for them. The fact that she also happens to seem like an oddball is, you know, that's more of a gift for Trump, because the more you watch these clips, the more you kind of roll your eyes about the whole enterprise down there.""

Trump drops new hints on possible 2024 presidential run: 'We were so close',"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday hinted at a 2024 presidential run in a wide-ranging interview on ""Hannity,"" where he addressed his storied relationship with the media, his prior successes in office and why he believes the country will ""not survive"" under President Biden's leadership.

Trump repeatedly teased his own 2024 run throughout the exclusive interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, touting a number of foreign policy successes during his presidency and outlining future policy positions that he would support if he chose to seek office again.

""Look, I want to see great leadership in this country, more important than Republican, or Democrat, or liberal, or conservative,"" Trump said. ""Our country is going to hell. We are a nation in decline.""

TRUMP EASILY WINS TEXAS CPAC 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION STRAW POLL; DESANTIS SECOND

While he stopped short of confirming 2024 speculation citing legal ramifications, the former president refused to rule out the possibility of a White House bid.

""I love the country and we were so close,"" he told Hannity. ""Before COVID came in we had a country like never in history.""

In the event of re-election, Trump said he would ""very quickly"" restore the office of the presidency, beginning with the deportation of the ""criminal"" immigrants who've crossed the border illegally under Biden's open border policies.

""Millions of people are in the country now that shouldn’t be here. Many of them are prisoners. Criminals. The bad ones I would deport. Yes. Millions and millions of people, they’re poisoning our country,"" he said.

Trump pointed to his foreign policy record during 2016-2020 before taking shots at Biden for signaling weakness on the global stage.

""Iran was in check, North Korea was in check, I got along very well with Kim Jong-Un which…we would have ended up in a nuclear war then. Russia was totally in check and China was in check.

""They knew there was retribution,"" he added. ""They knew that we can’t sit back and let these horrible things happen. But with President Xi as an example, when you’re with President Xi and when you’re with all of these world leaders, they are at the top of the game and they are at the top of their game. They are sharp as a tack, they are smart, they’re brilliant…you have to be really on your game to deal with these people.""

""I’m the only one in 70 years, they said that kept us out of wars,"" he continued.

Dialing up the culture war rhetoric and attacks on his political opponents, Trump said it's ""inconceivable"" that Republicans would lose the upcoming midterm election considering how unpopular many of the Democratic policies are with the public.

""When it comes to the election, if you want to have high taxes if you want to have high crime, I say this – it’s so politically incorrect they tell me, but I don’t think so -- if you want to have men playing in women’s sports, if you want to have all this horrible education stuff where they are brainwashing and indoctrinating your children.

""You take a look at how bad they are. It’s inconceivable that the Republicans can lose,"" he said, adding, ""I just hope the people get out and vote.""

In an apparent shift of tone for the former president, Trump said he is rooting for Biden to succeed as a leader, even if it would make a potential race against him more competitive.

"Trump 'furious' over Oz losing in Pennsylvania, blames wife Melania for endorsement: report","According to a report, former President Donald Trump was ""furious"" Wednesday over the disappointing showing by Republicans nationally, and blames people in particular who advised him to back Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania Senate race, including the former president's wife, Melania.

Oz went down in defeat to Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman in the state's closely watched Senate contest, a bruising loss for Republicans trying to win back a Senate majority. Fetterman's win allowed Democrats to pick up the seat held by retiring Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, known for her access to Trump and his orbit, tweeted Wednesday, ""Trump is indeed furious this morning, particularly about Mehmet Oz, and is blaming everyone who advised him to back Oz – including his wife, describing it as not her best decision, according to people close to him.""

""There are people pushing Trump to reschedule his announcement next week, and several Rs have texted asking whether he will, but it’s risky and would be acknowledging he’s wounded by yesterday, something that some of his advisers insist is not the case,"" she added. ""Worth remembering that Trump is a grown man who endorsed Oz over the objection of some of the people closest to him, and instead went beyond just endorsing and attacked Dave McCormick from the stage at a rally.""

Trump-backed candidates in critical races across the country lost or lagged behind other Republicans in their states, and pundits across the spectrum have said Trump had a brutal night for his political brand.

Oz, who rose to fame as a TV doctor but had no prior political experience, earned Trump's endorsement in the Pennsylvania Senate primary over Dave McCormick. Despite trailing in polls throughout the year, Oz's contest was viewed as a possible win by Republicans against Fetterman, who was hit for his lack of transparency over his recovery from a stroke, inconsistent answers on issues like fracking and a widely panned debate performance last month.

Yet Fetterman pulled out the victory on Tuesday night, one of several contests that left Republicans shellshocked on Wednesday morning.

It was reported earlier this year that Melania Trump had expressed her support of Oz to her husband. Oz was frequently hit on the campaign trail by Fetterman as a carpetbagger and too wealthy and out of touch to connect with Pennsylvanians. Oz conceded the race Wednesday morning.

"Trump grand jury foreperson Emily Kohrs laughs, jokes through strange media tour on CNN, NBC News","Emily Kohrs, the foreperson on Georgia's special grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump, has baffled onlookers with her gleeful behavior and coyness during a recent media blitz.

The 30-year-old Kohrs, part of a special grand jury in Fulton County empaneled to investigate allegations of illicit meddling in the 2020 election, has spoken on-camera to NBC News and CNN, and granted interviews to the Associated Press, New York Times and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution this week.

Kohrs smiled, smirked and joked as she spoke to CNN’s Kate Bolduan, who asked her how many people were in trouble based on the grand jury's recommendations. She appeared thrilled to be on television as she told Bolduan she didn’t want to disobey the judge by offering too much information.

""It’s not a short list,"" she said before chuckling.

CNN REPORTERS AGONIZE OVER TRUMP GRAND JURY FOREWOMAN'S BIZARRE MEDIA BLITZ: 'PROSECUTOR'S NIGHTMARE'

Bolduan then asked if the jury recommended charges against former President Trump, the question on everyone's mind. Kohrs had already made headlines by telling print outlets that they wouldn't be surprised by the result, leading to speculation that it had indeed recommended Trump be charged with a crime. The grand jury she was on was only investigatory, however, meaning it doesn't have indictment powers.

""I really don’t want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share,"" Kohrs said while smiling. ""I will tell you that it was a process where we heard his name a lot. Um, we definitely heard a lot about former President Trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room. And I’ll say that, uh, when this list comes out… there are no major plot twists waiting for you.""

Bolduan laughed herself and told the animated Kohrs that her response only raised more questions.

""I know, I’m sorry,"" Kohrs, described by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as ""high energy,"" said while giggling.

The Fulton County grand jury released portions of their findings from the probe into whether Trump and his allies interfered in Georgia's electoral process as part of an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Kohrs declined to get into specific details but insisted it won’t be a ""shocker"" to anyone who has followed the story.

Throughout her TV appearances, Kohrs appeared to find humor in many of her answers, often giggling and making animated facial expressions.

Kohrs smiled and continued to laugh when she suggested that Trump might have read the wrong document when he recently said the grand jury report meant ""total exoneration"" for him. She then insisted she ""loved"" being a part of the seven-month process, saying it was ""amazing"" and she’s ""so glad"" she was able to participate.

Kohrs rolled her eyes and admitted she would be ""sad"" if no charges were brought against anyone.

""I would be frustrated if nothing happens, this was too much information, too much of my time, too much of everyone’s time, too much of their time… there was just too much for this to be, ‘OK we’re good, bye,’"" Kohrs said.

Kohrs also sat down with NBC News on Tuesday and said the jury recommended indicting over a dozen people and that the list of people ""might"" include Trump. Once again, Kohrs smiled, laughed and joked throughout the interview.

At one point, she admitted she wanted to subpoena Trump simply for the thrill of swearing him in.

""I wanted to hear from the former president, but honestly, I kind of wanted to subpoena the former president because I got to swear everyone in, and so I thought it would be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump,"" she said with a wide grin. ""I kind of just thought that would be an awesome moment.""

The media blitz has been roasted by onlookers from both sides of the political spectrum.

""Even CNN’s Anderson Cooper seemed shocked after Kohrs openly revealed on the network that the grand jury had discussed indicting Trump alongside a ‘list’ of other people.""

On CNN, liberal host Anderson Cooper and legal analyst Elie Honig bemoaned her media tour. Cooper said he was ""wincing"" at her ebullience and Honig called her interviews a ""prosecutor's nightmare.""

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also noted that she ""rolled her eyes and then burst out laughing"" when asked about Trump saying he would be exonerated.

""Did he really say that?"" Kohrs asked. ""Oh, that’s fantastic. That’s phenomenal. I love it.""

"Trump grand jury foreperson’s bizarre press blitz stuns liberal media, surprises legal experts: 'No upside'","The strange antics of the forewoman of a special grand jury in the media this week have surprised legal experts and annoyed liberal media pundits, who warned she could compromise a potential prosecution of President Trump and his associates.

Emily Kohrs, foreperson of the special Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury empaneled to investigate allegations of election meddling in 2020, seemed eager to share details of the lengthy probe in interviews with CNN, NBC News, The New York Times, The Associated Press and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this week.

Clips circulating online of the 30-year-old woman smirking and bursting into giggles while teasing the grand jury’s recommended indictments – which have not yet been made public – raised concerns from even liberal media figures that she could be ""destroying"" the prosecution’s case.

In all her appearances, she appeared to strongly hint that Trump was among those recommended for criminal charges – the grand jury she was on did not have indictment powers. On television, her grins and coy behavior were odd enough that even left-wing MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell, after playing clips of her NBC interview, felt compelled to say she was not a seasoned media professional.

TRUMP GRAND JURY FOREPERSON EMILY KOHRS LAUGHS, JOKES THROUGH STRANGE MEDIA TOUR ON CNN, NBC NEWS

""I thought it would be really cool to get sixty seconds with President Trump of me looking at him, and being like, ‘Do you solemnly swear—' and me getting to swear him in. I just thought that would be an awesome moment,"" she said excitedly in one widely-shared clip.

Kohrs reportedly ""rolled her eyes and burst out laughing,"" in a print interview, after reporters shared President Trump’s Truth Social post claiming ""total exoneration"" by the special grand jury.

""Did he really say that? Oh, that’s fantastic. That’s phenomenal. I love it,"" she told the AJC. Kohrs added her own coy response to the former president’s claim. ""I invoke my Fifth Amendment right. That’s what I have to say to that.""

While on CNN, Kohrs revealed multiple people would be recommended for indictments and chuckled. ""It’s not a short list,"" she quipped. In one remark that drew particular criticism, she said she would be disappointed if no charges resulted from the grand jury's investigation, saying there was ""too much of my time"" and others spent on the matter.

CNN REPORTERS AGONIZE OVER TRUMP GRAND JURY FOREWOMAN'S BIZARRE MEDIA BLITZ: ‘PROSECUTOR’S NIGHTMARE'

Declining to answer if Trump was on the list, she smirked and held back a giggle. ""Especially If they’ve been following the investigation, I can’t see it being a shocker,"" she said about the indictments.

""There may be parts of it that you did not expect, but I don’t believe that the season finale will have any major plot twists, you know what I mean?"" she added to the AJC. On NBC News and CNN, she made similar remarks, at times smiling like she knew she was giving tantalizing remarks.

Liberal media figures from MSNBC's Charlie Sykes to ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar were frantic that the media blitz was going to end up helping Trump.

""Seriously, this woman should not be on television. She should not be doing this. There is no upside,"" Sykes tweeted.

Behar said Wednesday that Kohrs should ""keep her big bazoo shut,"" and she ""could destroy this case.""

Mike Pence's former adviser Olivia Troye, a Trump critic, also worried that Kohrs would hurt the case's outcome.

JOY BEHAR FUMES OVER TRUMP GRAND JURY MEMBER TOUR: ‘SHOULDN’T SHE BE KEEPING HER BIG BAZOO SHUT?'

""Really hope someone is advising Emily Kohrs on safety & security precautions for her own well-being. Also really hoping that her decision to go public as a Georgia Grand Jury foreperson, about one of the most significant cases for our country, doesn’t hurt the outcome in the end,"" she tweeted.

""Agreed. It would be helpful if she’d stop giving interviews,"" former journalist for the Sacramento Bee Anita Creamer tweeted.



On MSNBC Wednesday, former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman said she was ""not much of a poker player"" and that while she hadn't broken any laws, she had created a ""marginal addition of trouble"" for District Attorney Fani Willis, D.

Tuesday night after her media blitz, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper also questioned if it was ""responsible"" for the juror to give interviews.

CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said it was a ""horrible idea"" and that the prosecutors were likely ""wincing.""

""She shouldn't be doing this,"" ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams told his outlet. ""It isn't helpful to the perception of the objectivity of the criminal justice system, and it starts to feel like she's putting pressure on the district attorney to actually move forward with charges.""

PARTS OF TRUMP GEORGIA GRAND JURY REPORT ARE RELEASED, SUGGESTING POSSIBLE WITNESS PERJURY

Legal experts said Kohrs' chatty media interviews were not necessarily ruinous in interviews with Fox News Digital, but they said they were certainly unusual and unhelpful in convincing the public of the seriousness of the case.

When asked about the impact of Kohrs’ media appearances, Gerard Filitti, senior counsel at the international nonprofit legal think tank The Lawfare Project, said that the conduct ""certainly raises eyebrows.""

While Georgia law requires each member of the grand jury to keep the deliberations of the grand jury a secret, Filitti said that so far, Kohrs has avoided crossing the line, mostly sharing personal observations about her experience.

He added that grand juries are generally kept under wraps for many reasons, like protecting the reputations of those not being charged, encouraging reluctant witnesses to come forward and avoiding attempts to improperly influence a grand juror.

""If anything, Kohrs’s approach - including talking about swearing in a witness while holding a popsicle - does more to trivialize the grand jury than assure the public of the seriousness with which it considered the evidence. This is the larger problem with her media tour, beyond whether she crosses the line and reveals actual deliberation,"" he said.

According to Filitti, the media blitz doesn’t put any future prosecution of Trump or anyone else in true jeopardy, but rather ""serves as fodder"" for individuals attempting to ""obfuscate the issues"" or ""delay potential prosecution.""

""Sensationalizing a special grand jury proceeding in this manner does little to further the interests of justice,"" he added.

FORMER PROSECUTOR SLAMS GEORGIA GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP: 'POLITICAL PERSECUTION'

Nicholas Creel, an assistant professor of business law at Georgia College and State University, said he was ""pretty skeptical"" about the idea Khors’ media appearances could hurt a potential case against Trump.

""For one, Trump is one of the most well-known people in the world. Almost nobody is going to learn about him or what he’s being accused of for the first time from these interviews. The coverage over his attempts to overturn the Georgia election was far too saturated for me to believe a few more new stories are going to make it any more difficult to get an impartial jury pool,"" he said.

Creel also noted that Kohrs steered clear of speaking to any of the contents of deliberations among fellow jurors, a move which is strictly forbidden under Georgia law. In fact, he added that had she wanted to, Khors could have gone further than she already had and spoken on the specifics of the report.

""For example, she could start to divulge the names of those the special grand jury recommended charges for as well as the statutes they were implicated under, who was offered immunity, and more,"" he said.

Criminal defense attorney Rachel Fiset, the co-founder and managing partner of Los Angeles-based firm Zweiback, Fiset & Zalduendo LLP, agreed that Kohrs did not break the law, but was walking a ""very fine line.""

While Fiset opined that the Fulton County prosecutors were probably ""disgusted"" by Khors’ actions, she said it appeared ""unlikely"" she would be prosecuted for them.

""The district attorney will not want to bring into focus any potential irregularities with her case moving forward – and, as this is all after the fact, it should not actually affect the recommendations of the grand jury,"" Fiset added. ""Instead, Kohrs appears to be giving valuable insight to anyone in the crosshairs of an indictment by naming witnesses and potential charges the D.A. may elect to bring.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-grand-jury-forepersons-bizarre-press-blitz-stuns-liberal-media-surprises-legal-experts-no-upside,N/A
Trump's stance on ending Ukraine aid could box in DeSantis: WSJ columnist,"Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel condemned former President Trump’s foreign policy stances and warned GOP leaders like Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., against following his lead.

Strassel slammed political leaders’ lack of willingness to fund Ukraine’s war effort, suggesting it has put future presidential nominees at a geopolitical crossroad.

""Donald Trump’s early entry into the Republican primaries is already presenting his potential rivals with some tough choices,"" she wrote. ""Among the most consequential: Do they join the former president in forging a GOP surrender caucus?""

She harkened back to Trump’s proclamations that he would ""clean house of all the warmongers and America-Last globalists"" and his warning against starting ""WORLD WAR III,"" saying this risks the decades-long Republican brand of being the ""party of strong defense.""

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP,NEGLECTING EAST PALESTIME, SOUTHERN BORDER: ‘THEY CAN KEEP HIM!’

She went on to warn, ""Mr. Trump and a small group (at least for now) of congressional Republicans risk throwing all that hard-earned credibility away, neutralizing one of the party’s greatest strengths and leaving the country without a meaningful alternative to Mr. Biden’s weak multilateralism.""

Strassel then recounted how DeSantis had slammed having a ""blank check"" aid policy to Ukraine, but speculated this is not a firm policy commitment to isolationism.

""The temptation might be to follow Mr. Trump down this rabbit hole. Some will warn Mr. DeSantis that this is where Mr. Trump will hit him, framing him as a GOP pol who’ll drag the country into endless wars,"" she wrote. ""Some will note numbers showing Republican support for Ukraine aid (slightly) waning. Mr. DeSantis’s advisers will tell him he can’t be seen to be on the same side as Democrats.""

EAST PALESTINE, OHIO MAYOR ‘FURIOUS’ WITH BIDEN'S UKRAINE VISIT: ‘THAT WAS THE BIGGEST SLAP IN THE FACE’

Strassel warned that ""it would be a mistake for Mr. DeSantis to cast his lot with Mr. Trump,"" saying he would concede an important issue to Trump and lose an ""opportunity to contrast a bold, well-thought-out foreign policy"" with the former president’s ""opaque retreatism.""

""It would muddy Mr. DeSantis’s ability to otherwise take a tough line on the world’s rogues, including China. It would give Mr. Biden—who is already gunning for Mr. DeSantis—an easy attack line. And it would put the governor crosswise with most congressional Republicans, many of whom are rooting for him,"" she continued.

She offered her prediction of the world if such policy is emulated.

""Policy-wise, any presidential candidate needs to campaign as if he plans to win, and Mr. DeSantis might consider the world he’d inherit should Vladimir Putin prevail,"" she wrote. ""A victorious Russia wouldn’t stop with Ukraine. China would delight in America’s retreat from the world stage and rush to fill the gap. Iran would double down on a bomb and on exerting greater hegemony over the Middle East. Peace through weakness never works.""

The Trump Mar-a-Lago search was justified,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Ever since news broke two weeks ago that the FBI had executed a search warrant on former President Donald Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago, the political world has been aflame with hyperbole, accusations, innuendo, and hysteria.

Every legal pundit and pundits pretending to know something about the law have emerged to try and explain what is really happening here. And the former president and his allies, as is their custom, have sought to flood the zone with political justifications and haphazard legal explanations to deflect from his conduct.

The truth needs to be set forth plainly and simply, and so let’s get down to brass tacks here. What happened on August 8, 2022, was not tyranny. It was not political persecution. It was not a minor dust up over bureaucratic processes blown out of proportion. It was the criminal justice system operating just like it does with any other private citizen on any other given day ending in a ""y.""

Trump was the president and commander-in-chief up until noon on January 20, 2021. The moment Joe Biden took the Oath of Office, Trump became just another private citizen in his 70s who vacations in Florida during the winter months to avoid the bitter cold back in his native home in the Northeast. He was no longer shielded by any privileges or protections of the Office of the Presidency at the point beyond physical security protection. He is subject to the laws of the United States just like anyone else.

REINHART FORMALLY REJECTS DOJ ARGUMENT TO KEEP TRUMP AFFIDAVIT SEALED, CALLS RAID 'UNPRECEDENTED'

What also is true is that Trump had particular legal obligation as the former president to properly turn over presidential records to the National Archives and Records Administration. That is mandated by the Presidential Records Act because those records are the property of the United States. They are not Trump’s personal property.

In a competent White House, this process would have started within days of his election loss and would have been completed well in advance of his departure for Florida on January 20, 2021. It was not.

Trump spent his final two months desperately trying in the courts, and later through state legislatures and ultimately the January 6, 2021 rally, to reverse his election loss. Document archival was not high on his priority list.

The result was apparently more than 25 boxes’ worth of presidential records were shipped to Florida and stored in a basement at Mar-a-Lago. If this were a mere issue of simply recovering unclassified presidential records, though, there likely never would have been a criminal element to this matter. But buried into those boxes were countless properly marked classified documents. Those documents lacked any markings indicating that Trump had ever declassified them. No actual substantiated evidence indicates Mr. Trump ever declassified them. No one viewing those records would have any reason to view them as anything other than properly classified documents.

CHECKS AND BALANCES ON SEARCH OF TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME AND RESORT DISPLAY LIMITED GOVERNMENT AT ITS BEST

The government tried to recover the documents peacefully and quietly. They spent one year discussing the matter with Trump’s staff, and 15 boxes were sent back to NARA in February.

After identifying more missing records, the government returned in June with a subpoena and found more boxes of records that should have been returned. Both times, properly marked classified documents – up to and including documents marked as Top Secret and requiring Sensitive Compartmented Information access eligibility – were located within the boxes.

A Trump lawyer swore out an affidavit promising there were no more documents. The government gathered evidence that the Trump lawyer was not being truthful, and on August 8, 2022, a court-authorized search warrant was executed that, sure enough, located several more classified documents.

That is not an abuse of law enforcement processes. That is how the law works.

You cannot remove properly marked classified documents and place them in a location not authorized for retention of classified documents. You cannot obstruct a federal investigation seeking to lawfully recover those documents. You cannot present false statements to federal investigators.

Our jails are filled with people who have gone to jail for less. Search warrants are executed on properties and residences every day by local, state and federal law enforcement authorities in a manner no different than what happened at Mar-a-Lago. Those individuals’ lawyers also are not permitted to impede or micromanage the execution of the warrant, just as Trump’s lawyers were not permitted to do so.

Those search warrants also tend to result in agents rummaging through areas that contain personal items but which fall within the scope of the search warrant, just as happened at Mar-a-Lago. The individuals subject to the search warrant also are not permitted access to the underlying probable cause affidavit unless and until there is an actual criminal indictment. Trump is not special in that regard.

None of this means former President Trump will ultimately be indicted. He very well might be, and other individuals who removed properly marked classified records from secure locations have been prosecuted and sent to prison for that offense.

AP Interview: Trump says he's unlikely to release tax returns before election,"Shifting swiftly to the general election, Donald Trump says he's narrowed his list of potential running mates to ""five or six"" people and doesn't want to accept public money to finance a fall campaign against likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

But in a break from recent major party nominees, Trump does not plan to invest heavily in a data-driven effort to target voters in the fall campaign. Despite pressure, the billionaire businessman also does not expect to release his tax returns before the November election.

""There's nothing to learn from them,"" Trump told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday. He's cited an ongoing audit of his finances as the main reason for withholding the information, and also has said he doesn't believe voters are interested.

Trump's comments came as he begins to ramp up for a long, expensive general election campaign. His two remaining Republican rivals suddenly dropped out of the race last week, anointing him the party's presumptive presidential nominee faster than even the confident candidate expected.

As part of his general election planning, Trump told the AP at his office in New York that he's moving aggressively to identify a running mate with deep political experience. While he would not provide a full list of names, he did not rule out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the former rival whom he's already tapped to head his transition planning.

Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is running the vice presidential vetting effort ""with a group,"" Trump said, that includes former competitor Ben Carson and himself. ""Honestly, we're all running it. It's very much a group effort,"" said Trump.

A first-time political candidate, the celebrity businessman said there's no need for another business person on the Republican ticket and he wants a running mate who can help him pass legislation as president. By joining forces with a political veteran, Trump would also signal a willingness to work with the Republican establishment that he's thoroughly bashed during his campaign.

Trump said he doesn't plan to announce his running mate until the Republican National Convention in July, a four-day event that he's planning to remake with a showman's touch.

""The concept of some entertainment from a great singer, a great group I think would be something maybe to break things up,"" Trump said. ""You'll be hearing plenty of political speeches.""

In the interview, Trump outlined a general election campaign that banks heavily on his personal appeal and trademark rallies while spurning the kind of sophisticated data operation that was a centerpiece of Barack Obama's winning White House runs.

""I've always felt it was overrated,"" Trump said. ""Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine. And I think the same is true with me.""

He also ruled out for the first time the option of taking public financing for his campaign, money that would have saved him the time-consuming task of raising vast sums but would have dramatically limited the amount he would have been able to raise.

""I don't like the idea of taking taxpayer money to run a campaign. I think it's inappropriate,"" he said.

Trump stunned the political world at every turn during the Republican primary season, prioritizing large rallies over intimate voter interactions in early voting states and operating with a slim campaign operation. Even as he brings in new staff for the general election campaign, he says his emphasis will continue to be on raucous rallies to put him in front of thousands of voters and generate free media coverage.

""My best investment is my rallies,"" Trump said. ""The people go home, they tell their friends they loved it. It's been good.""

The businessman said he'll spend ""limited"" money on data operations to identify and track potential voters and to model various turnout scenarios that could give him the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. He's moving away from the model Obama used successfully in his 2008 and 2012 wins, and which Clinton is trying to replicate, including hiring many of the staff that worked for Obama.

Still, the Republican National Committee has invested heavily in data operations, eager to avoid another defeat to a more technologically savvy Democrat. Trump could make use of that RNC data if he wished.

Trump and his aides have been meeting with RNC officials this week to discuss the mechanics of his campaign. He is also planning a trip to Washington Thursday to meet with party leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have had a mixed reaction to his primary success.

Though Trump has vowed to be tough in taking on Clinton, he also suggested he might avoid running negative ads against her, saying, ""I just don't find them to be very effective.""

""I've had over $100 million in negative ads spent on me and every time it's boosted my numbers,"" he said.

As Trump was speaking, however, his campaign posted a new ad on Instagram assailing Clinton for her response to the attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Billionaire Koch network to oppose Trump in 2024,"The influential, billionaire-backed Koch network will oppose former President Trump in the 2024 presidential election, according to a memo released Sunday.

""So the best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter,"" Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded political action group, said in the memo. ""The American people have shown that they’re ready to move on, and so AFP will help them do that.""

The memo from Americans for Prosperity — which was founded in 2004 and promoted the Tea Party movement to oppose Democrats — said it will spend more money in primary elections to ensure Republicans have higher quality candidates in the next cycle. The group, backed by billionaire Charles Koch, did not specifically name Trump, but noted the need for a new candidate in 2024.

""So, here’s what we learned from 2022 and what we plan to do about it,"" the memo stated. ""First – If we want to elect better people, we need better candidates. And if we want better candidates, we’ve got to get involved in elections earlier and in more primaries.""

BIDEN'S 2024 RE-ELECTION ANNOUNCEMENT COULD COME AFTER HIS STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH. BUT HOW SOON?

Americans for Prosperity spent $69.4 million on the 2022 midterms, according to Open Secrets.

The memo noted that the group engaged in 22 primaries in 2022 — the most ever for the group — and saw a win percentage of 80%. The midterm elections, the memo stated, were underwhelming for Republicans as Democrats capitalized on poor candidates.

""The Republican Party is nominating bad candidates who are advocating for things that go against core American principles,"" the memo stated. ""And the American people are rejecting them. The Democratic Party increasingly sees this as a political opportunity. And they’re responding with more and more extreme policies – policies that also go against our core American principles.""

Americans for Prosperity joins a list of prominent Republican donors distancing themselves for Trump as the former president prepares for a likely crowded and competitive Republican primary in 2024.

Conservatives point finger at Trump after GOP’s underwhelming election results: 'He's never been weaker',"Many conservatives put the blame on former President Donald Trump for the GOP's underwhelming midterm election results, which saw Trump candidates across the country failing to gain office.

Many conservative commentators took the election results as a sign it was time for the GOP to move on from Trump. Commentators argued that Trump had endorsed outlandish candidates who turned easy victories into close races, and close races into losses.

Others compared Trump's failure to secure wins across the country with the huge wave of support for Republicans in Gov. Ron DeSantis' Florida.

""All the chatter on my conservative and GOP channels is rage at Trump like I've never seen,"" Michael Brendan Dougherty, a senior writer at National Review, wrote on Twitter. ""'The one guy he attacked before Election Day was DeSantis — the clear winner, meanwhile, all his guys are s---ing the bed.'""

""If DeSantis in Florida wildly overperforms all the handpicked and Trump-supported Republicans in other swing states (particularly if they *lose* close races), well then gosh that is going to be a fascinating new narrative that will be commented upon by positively no one,"" wrote attorney and National Review podcast host Jeffrey Blehar.

Of the races that have been decided as of Wednesday morning, Trump's endorsed candidates have won nine and lost eight, according to an analysis from Axios.

The former president also warned DeSantis that a 2024 run could hurt him ""very badly"" on Tuesday.

""I don’t know if he is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly. I really believe he could hurt himself badly,"" Trump said. ""I think he would be making a mistake, I think the base would not like it — I don’t think it would be good for the party.""

DeSantis embarked on a pro-police tour of blue cities on Monday, traveling to the New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago areas and meeting with sheriffs, chiefs of police and other local law enforcement officials who feel unsupported by their local governments, his political team told Fox News Digital.

While DeSantis has not announced a 2024 presidential run, he is frequently floated as a top contender to face off against Trump in the Republican primary. The governor is also releasing an autobiography on Feb. 28, titled ""The Courage to Be Free: Florida's Blueprint for America's Revival,"" which is viewed by political pundits as another sign he is readying an announcement.

DESANTIS SLIGHTLY EDGES TRUMP AS PREFERRED LEADER OF REPUBLICAN PARTY: POLL

Trump recently insisted on his Truth Social site that contrary to his frequent mocking and name-calling of DeSantis, he rarely thinks about the governor. ""I don’t even think about it — A very unimportant subject to me!!!"" he declared last week.

DESANTIS KICKS OFF PRO-POLICE TOUR IN DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES AS WHITE HOUSE RUMORS SWIRL

The former president targeted DeSantis days later after Fox News exclusively reported the details of DeSantis’ pro-police tour on Sunday.

""Ron DeSanctimonious wants to cut your Social Security and Medicare,"" Trump wrote Sunday night, ""closed up Florida & its beaches, loves RINOS Paul Ryan, Jeb Bush, and Karl Rove (disasters ALL!), is backed by Globalist’s Club for NO Growth, Lincoln Pervert Project, & ‘Uninspired’ Koch — And it only gets worse from there. He is a RINO in disguise!, whose Poll numbers are dropping like a rock. Good luck Ron!""

The virtually one-sided feud between Trump and DeSantis began in November, when the former president branded him ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" just three days before the midterm elections. When Election Day came, the Wall Street Journal published comments by Trump threatening to release dirt on DeSantis if the governor decided to run for president.

""If he did run, I will tell you things about him that won't be very flattering,"" Trump told the outlet. ""I know more about him than anybody other than perhaps his wife, who is really running his campaign.""

FLORIDA GOV. DESANTIS REPEATEDLY TARGETED BY FALSE VIRAL CLAIMS AMID 2024 SPECULATION

Trump’s attacks against DeSantis so close to the election were widely condemned by conservatives, and while Republicans went on to underperform on the national level, losing the U.S. Senate and only retaking the House by a few seats, DeSantis cruised to an historic 19-point win in Florida, a onetime battleground state.

The day after the election, the former president lashed out a DeSantis again, writing, ""Now that the Election in Florida is over, and everything went quite well, shouldn’t it be said that in 2020, I got 1.1 Million more votes in Florida than Ron D got this year, 5.7 Million to 4.6 Million? Just asking?""

Trump later unleashed a more than 400-word tirade against DeSantis, slamming the governor as ""average"" and lacking ""class"" and ""loyalty."" He criticized DeSantis for ordering lockdowns in Florida, saying the governor ""didn’t have to close up his State, but did, unlike other Republican Governors,"" and he credited himself for DeSantis’ 2018 gubernatorial win against disgraced Democrat Andrew Gillum.

Trump’s critique of DeSantis for locking down the state is a peculiar one. DeSantis did not issue his first and only stay-at-home order for the state until April 1, 2020, more than two weeks after Trump, as president, announced his ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" plan, which recommended that governors shut down schools, restaurants and other public places.

While DeSantis, like most governors across the country, followed the guidance and briefly shut down the state, he was one of the first to reopen, which brought on a wave of Democratic backlash that continues today. The governor has since vowed that the state would never lock down again, and that one of his biggest regrets was not pushing back against the Trump administration’s recommendations, which he primarily blamed on Dr. Anthony Fauci, leader of the White House’s COVID-19 response.

Still, Trump, who formally announced his 2024 presidential run on Nov. 15, a week after the midterms, has repeatedly slammed DeSantis' pandemic response on Truth Social in recent weeks.

According to a new poll by Monmouth University, the governor would win a hypothetical head-to-head match against Trump by a 53% to 40% margin, and he is preferred over Trump among nearly every major voting bloc in the party, except among those earning less than $50,000 a year and people age 65 and older. Other polls, however, have shown Trump leading DeSantis.

Former South Carolina Governor and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, the only other Republican to officially announce her 2024 presidential run besides Trump, took her first shot at DeSantis last week by saying his controversial parental rights law did not go far enough.

""There was all this talk about the Florida bill — the ‘don’t say gay bill.’ Basically what it said was you shouldn’t be able to talk about gender before third grade. I’m sorry. I don’t think that goes far enough,"" Haley told supporters in New Hampshire. ""When I was in school you didn't have sex ed until 7th grade. And even then, your parents had to sign whether you could take the class.""

RON DESANTIS SENDS TWO PLANES OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD

Another potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, on Sunday blasted DeSantis’ education initiatives as ""big government"" and even ""authoritarian.""

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, another potential candidate, has also fired shots at DeSantis in recent weeks.

""I’m ranked the most fiscally conservative governor in the country,"" he told Politico this month. ""I’m No. 1 in personal freedoms. Sorry, Ron, you’re No. 2.""

DeSantis has largely refrained from taking any direct shots at Trump or others, but he said he considers the criticism ""positive feedback"" during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday morning.

""If you're an office holder, and you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs and not getting anything done, no one ever says anything,"" the governor said. ""You can kind of just fly under the radar. But when you're out there leading, when you're out there setting the agenda, not just for Florida, but really for the nation, which we've done over the last few years, people see that. And the people that don't necessarily like that are going to respond accordingly. But I can just tell you, if people are not firing at me, then I must not be doing my job.""

The governor is traveling to blue-led cities to tout his efforts to support law enforcement and reduce crime in Florida, where he recently proposed legislation to strengthen bail laws, toughen penalties for sex criminals and other anti-crime measures.

According to the governor’s office, DeSantis implemented the largest recruitment package for law enforcement officers in state history last year, awarding $5,000 signing bonuses to officers willing to relocate to Florida from blue states.

Speaking from Staten Island on Monday morning, DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" that the ""woke"" approach to law enforcement and crime has failed.

""It’s all putting ideology over public safety,"" he said. ""It has caused a lot of people to leave these formerly thriving areas.""

The governor has already signed multiple bills in his second term that are popular with Republicans, including granting more authority to the statewide prosecutor for cases related to voter fraud, as well as repealing and replacing the state’s controversial migrant relocation program, which transports illegals out of state.

Last week, DeSantis proposed his ""Digital Bill of Rights,"" which would ban TikTok from government devices and prohibit any Florida state or local government employee from coordinating with a ""Big Tech"" company to censor free speech.

Last month, the governor announced his ""Teacher’s Bill of Rights,"" which would include $1 billion in teacher pay raises but also limit the power of teachers’ unions in the state. It comes almost one year after he signed into law his Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill by Democrats, which banned teachers from giving classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation"" or ""gender identity"" in kindergarten through third grade.

DeSantis told Fox News on Monday that ""this is going to be the most productive legislative session we have had across the board.""

""I think people look at Florida, and they're like, ‘Man, the governor has gotten a lot done,’ and we have and we’re proud of it. You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-racks-up-wins-trump-potential-2024-opponents-take-swipes-florida-governor,N/A
DeSantis silent after Trump launches first attacks amid 2024 speculation,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has not publicly spoken out about former President Donald Trump's various attacks against him as the 2024 presidential election cycle heats up.

Trump slammed DeSantis as ""an average REPUBLICAN Governor with great Public Relations"" in a post on his social media site Truth Social on Thursday. The former president again used the name ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" in the post, a nickname he first used at a rally in Pennsylvania last weekend.

""And now, Ron DeSanctimonious is playing games! The Fake News asks him if he’s going to run if President Trump runs, and he says, ""I’m only focused on the Governor’s race, I’m not looking into the future."" Well, in terms of loyalty and class, that’s really not the right answer,"" Trump said in the Truth Social thread, after saying DeSantis came to him in 2017 in ""desperate shape"" ahead of his first gubernatorial election and Trump ""fixed his campaign.""

Despite the repeated jabs, DeSantis has not commented on the remarks. Fox News Digital reached out to DeSantis' press office Sunday morning but did not receive an immediate reply.

POMPEO RUNS TO DESANTIS' DEFENSE AFTER TRUMP LANDS FIRST BLOW WITH NEW NICKNAME

DeSantis is seen as a top possible contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, especially after his sweeping gubernatorial election on Tuesday.

While Trump has touted a ""very big"" announcement coming this Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago, which is speculated to be a third presidential run.

CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: DEMS 'GOT NOBODY' TO DEFEAT TRUMP, DESANTIS IN 2024

DeSantis’ former communications director for his 2018 gubernatorial campaign praised the governor for not acknowledging Trump’s recent attacks.

""I think that Ron is very clearly living rent free in the former president’s head,"" Stephen Lawson told Politico last week. ""Ron has not said a single word and they think smartly that Tuesday’s huge win allows him to just keep talking about his record without having to acknowledge Trump.""

""It’s 1,000 percent the correct move,"" Lawson added. ""Trump just keeps throwing boomerangs.""

While Trump ally Roger Stone told Politico that DeSantis challenging the former president in 2024 would be ""a treacherous act of disloyalty.""

TRUMP CONFIRMS HE VOTED FOR RON DESANTIS, SAYS ELECTION WILL BE 'EXCITING DAY' FOR REPUBLICANS

""Sadly, everything President Trump says is true. Ron DeSantis owes his governorship to Donald Trump and challenging him in 2024 would be a treacherous act of disloyalty,"" said Roger Stone, a long-time Trump adviser.

Some conservatives have slammed the attacks on DeSantis, including radio show and Fox News host Mark Levin.

""I am not going to abide attacks on Ron DeSantis, personal attacks on this guy — by anybody,"" Levin said on his Wednesday radio show, though did not name Trump specifically. ""He’s not just a rising star, he is a star. This is a man who is capable of doing great things for this country, whatever he decides to do or however he decides to do it.""

""DeSantis is an extremely effective conservative governor who has had real policy wins and real cultural wins. Trump isn’t going to be able to take this one down with a dumb nickname. He better have more than that up his sleeve,"" Matt Walsh, a commentator at The Daily Wire, wrote after Trump first used the name ""Ron DeSanctimonious.""

Hoover Institute senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson wrote in an opinion piece last week: ""Democratic opposition to a flawed and impaired Biden running again in 2024 will recede. Republican loyalty to the unpredictable Trump could fade. And both those realities will empower DeSantis.""

Despite his criticisms, Trump confirmed on Tuesday that he voted for DeSantis.

Reports circulated earlier this year about possible growing tension between DeSantis and the former president. DeSantis, however, quashed reports about such tensions at the time, calling Trump a ""friend of mine.""

DeSantis insists narrative of Trump rivalry is 'total bunk': He's 'a friend of mine',"EXCLUSIVE: According to Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republicans, including him, have the support of former President Trump, and any notion to the contrary can be attributed to media spin.

DeSantis sat down in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Monday in Tallahassee, Florida, during which he stated that he's on good terms with Trump.

""Donald Trump's a friend of mine. He is proud when people do well, and it's not just me, but obviously he's a Florida resident, and he appreciates the job that we've done. He's told me that many times, not only with helping with the election, but just how we govern the state.""

TRUMP CALLS REPORTS OF RIFT WITH DESANTIS 'FAKE NEWS,' INTENDS TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP 'FOR A LONG TIME'

""He wants to see Republicans doing well,"" DeSantis continued. ""And I think when media is trying to act like he's upset at me for doing well, I think that's total bunk. I think they're just making it up. And I think he's somebody that wants to see, you know, not just Republicans do well, but people that are actually going to stand and fight do well across the board. Obviously, Florida is an important state, the third-largest state in the country, and really us and Texas are the two biggest states that have sizable Republican footprints, and so we're proud of that, and we're going to keep it going.""

SECOND GOP GOVERNOR CALLS FOR TRUMP-LESS 2024 ELECTION

DeSantis wouldn't say whether he would potentially take on Trump in 2024 and said anonymous sources close to Trump who said he has a ""dull personality"" could be attributed to Democrats and the media, who are trying to stoke division within the Republican Party in order to re-elect President Biden.

""No. I mean, look, I think that what they're trying to do is they're Biden. They did all they could to get Biden elected. OK. They lied about Trump for four years. They did everything they could to get Biden elected, the guy who campaigned from his basement. They never asked any questions about that. Well, now he gets in. And he had a disastrous first year as president said the worst first year president of any president since the 1800s. People compare him to Jimmy Carter. Carter was much more successful his first year than Biden has been,"" DeSantis told Fox News Digital.

""So they know that, they know the Democrats are in for a shellacking in 2022. So they're trying to change the topic, and they're trying to drive dissension among Republicans. And so my message to people is, don't take that bait. Understand what they're trying to do. We need to be united and say we don't like what the Biden administration's doing. We offer a better course in Florida. I think other Republican states are offering a better vision in their states as well. And let's go into ‘22 with a full head of steam with everybody united on the same team.

ARKANSAS' GOP GOV. HUTCHINSON SAYS TRUMP NOT ‘THE ONE TO LEAD OUR PARTY AND OUR COUNTRY AGAIN’

Former Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech Friday during which he said ""President Trump is wrong... I had no right to overturn the election"" and called it ""un-American.""

However, Florida's Republican governor said that he would let Trump and Pence ""hash that out"" themselves.

""My view is we are very proud of what we did in Florida in 2020 to ensure a very efficient and effective election. That's number one. But then two, the result was a really resounding victory for President Trump and Republicans. I think he more than tripled his margin versus 2016 here in the state of Florida. And so I think we did it right.""

DeSantis pointed to the institution of strong reforms to ban ballot harvesting and so-called ""Zuckerbucks,"" funding from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He also mentioned a new election integrity unit that Republicans in the state legislature have recently introduced in order to combat voter fraud.

However, Democrats in Florida claim that the proposed election integrity unit will target Black Floridians in an unfair way, including restricting access to the ballot box. In addition, there were only four document arrests of election fraud in Florida during the 2020 election.

DeSantis told Fox News Digital that the unit was proposed in order to ""enforce election law,"" and he doesn't understand where the criticism is coming from that it would ""be targeted at one person or another if there are violations of law.""

""We want to bring people to justice. That's without regard to party with certainly without regard to race,"" he continued.

DeSantis didn't comment on the recent action of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to censure two Republicans, Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, Ill., for sitting on the Democrats' Jan. 6 select committee.

The RNC said in a statement Friday that although it rejects political violence and lawlessness, the Jan. 6 committee is attacking ordinary citizens who engaged in ""legitimate political discourse.""

DeSantis said he ""wasn't aware"" of the RNC's action but was quick to condemn Cheney, who he told Fox News Digital is not a true Republican and ""just totally off the rails with her nonsense.""

""We want people that are going to fight the left, and that's what we need to do in this country. That's what we're doing in Florida, standing up for people's freedoms. We're opposing wokeness. We're opposing all these things. To act like the main issue in this country is things that happened over a year ago. I can tell you in Florida, that's not what Floridians are concerned about. They're concerned about inflation and gas prices. They're thankful that Florida's a free state, but they look around the country and see how fragile freedom is. They're thankful we're a law and order state, but they look around and see what's happening in a lot of these cities where crimes are spiking.""

Donald Trump fires back at AG Merrick Garland over FBI's Mar-a-Lago raid: 'Release the documents now!',"After a federal judge gave the Justice Department a deadline to determine whether former President Donald Trump supports or opposes unsealing the search warrant and property receipt used by the FBI to search his Mar-a-Lago home Monday, the former president said he heartily supports the move.

""Release the documents now!"" Trump wrote on TRUTH Social at 11:40 p.m. ET Thursday, just hours after the judge’s decision was announced.

In a pair of posts, Trump called the raid on his Florida estate ""unAmerican, unwarranted, and unnecessary"" and said he approved of the ""immediate release"" of the warrant.

""Not only will I not oppose the release of documents related to the unAmerican, unwarranted, and unnecessary raid and break-in of my home in Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago, I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents,"" the former president wrote, ""even though they have been drawn up by radical left Democrats and possible future political opponents, who have a strong and powerful vested interest in attacking me, much as they have done for the last 6 years.""

TRUMP FBI RAID: GARLAND SAYS HE APPROVED MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH, DOJ MOVES TO UNSEAL WARRANT

prev Image 2 of 2

Trump also said the raid was a part of an ""unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement"" and suggested it could be an effort to keep him from re-seeking office.

""My poll numbers are the strongest they have ever been, fundraising by the Republican Party is breaking all records, and midterm elections are fast approaching. This unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement is inappropriate and highly unethical,"" he said. ""The world is watching as our Country is being brought to a new low, not only on our border, crime, economy, energy, national security, and so much more, but also with respect to our sacred elections!""

The two posts come just hours after Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart wrote an order on the DOJ's motion to unseal the warrant and property receipt.

""The United States shall immediately serve a copy of its Motion on counsel for former President Trump,"" Reinhart wrote Thursday. ""On or before 3:00 p.m. Eastern time on August 12, 2022, the United States shall file a certificate of conferral advising whether former President Trump opposes the Government's motion to unseal.""

FBI DIRECTOR WRAY PUSHES BACK ON THREATS FOLLOWING UNPRECEDENTED RAID ON TRUMP: 'DEPLORABLE AND DANGEROUS'

The judge’s decision came just after Attorney General Merrick Garland broke his dayslong silence over the decision for the FBI to execute a search warrant on the home of a former president, which had never been done in U.S. history.

During a press conference on Thursday, Garland said he ""personally approved"" the FBI to execute the warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, where agents spent hours searching on Monday.

""Just now, the Justice Department has filed a motion in the Southern District of Florida to unseal a search warrant and property receipt relating to a court-approved search that the FBI conducted earlier this week,"" Garland said. ""That search was a premises located in Florida belonging to the former president.""

next Image 1 of 2

prev Image 2 of 2

He added: ""The department filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter.""

It is not immediately clear if Trump or his legal representation currently has a copy of the warrant or the property receipt.

NATIONAL ARCHIVES OFFICIAL WHO NOTIFIED DOJ IN TRUMP PROBE DECLINED TO DO THE SAME OVER CLINTON EMAILS

While the FBI did not specifically use the word ""raid"" — which has been used by Trump and many others including major news outlets — to describe their search warrant on Trump’s estate, it has yet to clarify what property was retrieved during the search and why it was executed in the first place.

The release of the search warrant, which was signed by Reinhart, and the property receipt will reveal that information.

Everything was fine, better than that of most previous Presidents, and then, out of nowhere and with no warning, Mar-a-Lago was raided, at 6:30 in the morning, by VERY large numbers of agents, and even 'safecrackers.'""

FBI seized classified records from Mar-a-Lago during search of Trump residence,"FBI agents seized classified records from former President Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago during the agency's unprecedented raid on Monday, including some marked as top secret, according to a warrant and property receipt unsealed Friday. The documents had earlier been reviewed and reported by Fox News Digital.

Former President Trump is disputing the classification, saying the records have been declassified.

According to the warrant, reviewed by Fox News early Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart signed the warrant on Aug. 5, giving the FBI authority to conduct its search ""on or before August 19, 2022,"" and ""in the daytime 6:00 am. to 10:00 p.m.""

The warrant and property receipt were formally unsealed Friday afternoon by Reinhart.

""The locations to be searched include the ‘45 Office,' all storage rooms, and all other rooms or areas within the premises used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff and in which boxes or documents could be stored, including all structures or buildings on the estate,"" the warrant states, but did not give authority to agents to search areas being occupied by Mar-a-Lago members or not used by Trump and staff.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

The warrant gave agents the authority to seize ""all physical documents and records constituting evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"" in violation of U.S. Code, including documents with classification markings and presidential records created between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021.

According to the property receipt, reviewed before its release by Fox News, FBI agents took approximately 20 boxes of items from the premises, including one set of documents marked as ""Various classified/TS/SCI documents,"" which refers to top secret/sensitive compartmented information.

Records covered by that government classification level could include human intelligence, and information that, if disclosed, could jeopardize relations between the United States and other nations, as well as the lives of intelligence operatives abroad. However, the classification also encompasses national security information related to the daily operations of the president of the United States.

The property receipt also shows that FBI agents collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents, and three sets of confidential documents.

The property receipt does not reveal any details about any of those records.

The list also includes a ""leatherbound box of documents,"" binders of photos, handwritten notes, miscellaneous documents, miscellaneous top secret documents, miscellaneous confidential documents, and other records.

The government conducted the search in response to what it believes to be a violation of federal laws: 18 USC 793 — Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information; 18 USC 2071 — Concealment, removal or mutilation; and 18 USC 1519 — Destruction, alteration or falsification of records in Federal investigations.

The allegation of ""gathering, transmitting or losing defense information"" falls under the Espionage Act.

The former president and his team, though, are disputing the classification and believe the information and records to have been declassified.

Trump posted on his TRUTH Social account Friday that the documents were ""all declassified.""

""Number one, it was all declassified. Number two, they didn't need to ‘seize’ anything,"" Trump posted. ""They could have had it anytime they wanted without playing politics and breaking into Mar-a-Lago.""

Trump added: ""It was in secured storage, with an additional lock put on as per their request.""

""The Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid where they seized the President's picture books, a 'hand-written note,' and declassified documents,"" Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich told Fox News. ""This raid of President Trump's home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary--and they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday, in a rare public statement, said the Justice Department had filed a motion to unseal the warrant and property receipt for the search of the residence of a former president of the United States, ""in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter.""

""The public’s clear and powerful interest in understanding what occurred under these circumstances weighs heavily in favor of unsealing,"" the DOJ’s motion states, noting that Trump should have the opportunity to respond to the motion and ""lodge objections, including with regard to any ‘legitimate private interests’ or the potential for other ‘injury’ if these materials are made public.""



Trump, in a statement late Thursday night, called for the ""immediate"" release of the warrant and property receipt.

""Not only will I not oppose the release of documents related to the unAmerican, unwarranted, and unnecessary raid and break-in of my home in Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago, I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents, even though they have been drawn up by radical left Democrats and possible future political opponents, who have a strong and powerful vested interest in attacking me, much as they have done for the last 6 years,"" Trump said.

DOJ ASKS COURT TO UNSEAL MAR-A-LAGO RAID WARRANT; AG MERRICK GARLAND PERSONALLY SIGNED OFF ON TRUMP SEARCH

The former president touted his current poll numbers saying they ""are the strongest they have ever been, fundraising by the Republican Party is breaking all records, and midterm elections are fast approaching.""

""This unprecedented political weaponization of law enforcement is inappropriate and highly unethical,"" Trump said. ""The world is watching as our Country is being brought to a new low, not only on our border, crime, economy, energy, national security, and so much more, but also with respect to our sacred elections!

He added: ""Release the documents now!""

Trump's legal team formally filed a motion in support of unsealing the warrant and property receipt, saying the former president ""does not object"" to the release.

The warrant and property receipt were formally unsealed by Reinhart Friday afternoon, just after Trump's motion in support of the release.

Garland, during his public remarks Thursday, said he ""personally"" signed off on the decision to obtain a warrant to search Trump’s private residence.

""The department does not take such a decision lightly,"" Garland said. ""Where possible, it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means as an alternative to a search and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken.""

Garland also defended DOJ officials and FBI agents against the ""recent unfounded attacks"" on their professionalism.

""I will not stand by silently when their integrity is unfairly attacked,"" he said.

DONALD TRUMP FIRES BACK AT AG MERRICK GARLAND OVER FBI'S MAR-A-LAGO RAID: 'RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS NOW!'

Trump's office received a grand jury subpoena this spring for classified documents he allegedly took from the White House when he left office in 2021. A source close to Trump told Fox News that the former president cooperated with the subpoena by turning over documents to the FBI.

According to the source, a subpoena was issued to a ""custodian of the president,"" and was related to the materials that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was trying to collect after claiming Trump improperly took those classified records with him from Washington D.C. to Mar-a-Lago.

The source close to Trump told Fox News that Trump has been cooperating in the investigation into the NARA records for a year.

On June 3, the FBI visited Mar-a-Lago to retrieve the requested documents in the subpoena, which Trump complied with, the source told Fox News.

Those investigators toured the area of the Florida resort where some documents were stored, then briefly viewed and took custody of a small amount of potentially sensitive material. Separate sources told Fox News that federal investigators had spoken with at least one person who relayed the possibility of more sensitive national security material in that storage room and other areas of the property.

TRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT; FROM RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO

FBI officials, that day, asked to see a storage facility where the records were located. The FBI asked that staff put a lock on the storage room, which they later did.

This source said Trump and his staff were, and are, committed to being in compliance with the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Trump received that subpoena two months prior to the FBI’s unprecedented raid on a former president of the United States’ private residence—which took place early Monday morning.

The source questioned whether the federal magistrate judge who signed off on the warrant for the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago Monday was aware of Trump's ""past compliance with the subpoena,"" adding that, if the FBI was looking for additional documents, another subpoena could have been issued, as Trump and his team were ""cooperative"" and turned over documents and records responsive to the subpoena issued in the spring.

Former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg pleads guilty to tax violations,"Former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty Thursday to tax violations spanning over a decade, agreeing to serve 100 days behind bars and testify about the Trump Organization's business practices.

Weisselberg, 75, was charged with evading taxes by receiving perks that were not counted as income. He pleaded not guilty to 15 counts, including grand larceny last year, which, in the state of New York, is the unlawful taking of funds or property valued at $50,000 or more.

""In one of the most difficult decisions of his life, Mr. Weisselberg decided to enter a plea of guilty today to put an end to this case and the years-long legal and personal nightmares it has caused for him and his family,"" Weisselberg's attorney, Nicholas Gravante Jr., said.

TRUMP ORGANIZATION CFO ALLEN WEISSELBERG SURRENDERS TO MANHATTAN DA AHEAD OF EXPECTED TAX-RELATED CHARGES

Weisselberg was accused of receiving compensation ""unreported or misreported"" to the tax authorities, namely benefits such as a company car and a company apartment in New York City.

Weisselberg was charged as part of then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s investigation into the Trump Organization, which began in 2019. Alvin Bragg is now serving as district attorney.

""Thanks to the incredibly hard work and dedication of the team prosecuting this case, Weisselberg will spend time behind bars,"" Bragg said. ""We look forward to proving our case in court against the Trump Organization.""

"Former WH doctor for Trump, Obama blasts 'alarming' Biden health report: 'The cover-up needs to end'","EXCLUSIVE: Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, is calling for an end to the ""cover-up"" of President Biden's health after the president's physical earlier this week claimed that he is healthy and fit to serve as commander in chief.

""The majority of Americans can see that Biden's mental health is in total decline, yet there is no transparency from the White House on what’s going on, if anything, to address this issue and his inability to do his job,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital. ""Yesterday's written physical exam report released by Biden’s physician, Kevin O'Connor, further confirms that this administration is still adamant about concealing the truth.""

Jackson also took issue with the fact that the report from Biden's physical, the second one he's taken since entering office, made no mention of the president undergoing a cognitive test amid his ""deteriorating mental health.""

""Nowhere in the report was there mention of Biden’s deteriorating mental health,"" Jackson said. ""This is alarming, considering I have already sent three letters to the White House demanding that Biden receive a cognitive test and that the results be made public, all of which have been ignored. Everyone can see something is wrong — the cover-up needs to end.""

EXCLUSIVE: READ THE PRIVATE EMAIL OBAMA SENT HIS FORMER DOC AFTER HE QUESTIONED BIDEN'S COGNITIVE HEALTH

Jackson, who previously served as the White House physician to former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, faced criticism from Obama for his critique of Biden's cognitive health on the 2020 campaign trail.

In his 2022 memoir, Jackson detailed a stern and ""scathing"" email he received from Obama about comments he had made on Twitter about then-presidential candidate Biden's mental state.

""I have made a point of not commenting on your service in my successor’s administration and have always spoken highly of you both in public and in private. You always served me and my family well, and I have considered you not only a fine doctor and service member but also a friend,"" Obama wrote in the email to Jackson.

""That’s why I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter. It was unprofessional and beneath the office that you once held. It was also disrespectful to me and the many friends you had in our administration. You were the personal physician to the President of the United States as well as an admiral in the U.S. Navy. I expect better, and I hope upon reflection that you will expect more of yourself in the future,"" Obama added in his message to Jackson.

WHITE HOUSE DOCTOR SAYS BIDEN 'FIT TO SERVE' AS PRESIDENT: 'HEALTHY, VIGOROUS, 80-YEAR-OLD'

In a memo released Thursday, White House physician Kevin O'Connor, a retired Army colonel who has served in the role since January 2021, wrote: ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

One lesion was discovered on Biden's chest and removed, according to the report, and the president still experiences a stiff gait, but it hasn't worsened since last year.

Biden continues to experience symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, primarily having to clear his throat more often, mostly after meals, the report said. O'Connor said the reflux is the source of Biden's throat clearing and coughing.

O'Connor noted that the main medical event for Biden in the past year was his upper respiratory infection from COVID-19 last summer. He said that Biden's oxygen levels never fell below 97%.

The results come as the president faces questions about his age amid speculation that he will seek re-election in 2024, though he has not yet announced his official decision.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took aim at the president, as well as his predecessor, former President Trump, on Wednesday, saying that politicians over the age of 75 should have to take a mental cognitive test before assuming office.

"Fox News Poll: Trump, DeSantis top 2024 Republican preference","One year out from the 2024 primaries, here is the debut Fox News national survey on the presidential nomination races. Spoiler alert, former President Donald Trump looks formidable, while President Biden faces doubt.

Republican primary voters were read a list of 15 announced and potential candidates for the 2024 nomination. Trump tops the list with 43%, followed by Ron DeSantis at 28%, Nikki Haley and Mike Pence at 7% each, and Greg Abbott and Liz Cheney at 2% each.

All others receive 1% or less. Even at this early stage, only 3% are unsure of their pick.

Among Republican primary voters, men, women, those under and over age 45, and those without a college degree all put Trump first and DeSantis second. The Florida governor is ahead among those with a college degree and those who think Biden was legitimately elected, and the two are within a point or so among suburban voters and those with higher incomes.

DESANTIS RACKS UP WINS WHILE TRUMP, POTENTIAL 2024 OPPONENTS TAKE SWIPES AT FLORIDA GOVERNOR

""Currently, the GOP primary dynamics are simple,"" says Daron Shaw, a Republican, who conducts the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""DeSantis needs Trump to falter because most of the former president's supporters see the Florida governor as the second-best choice. At the same time, other candidates need DeSantis to falter because his supporters have no single fallback option and would be up-for-grabs should he flame out.""

Trump tops Haley by 66-24% in a matchup between the two announced GOP candidates. (Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy announced his candidacy mid-survey.)

TRUMP WELCOMES NIKKI HALEY INTO THE 2024 RACE: ‘THE MORE THE MERRIER’

While 37% of Democratic primary voters want to keep Biden as their party’s nominee, a majority of 53% says they would like someone else to run.

That support for Biden pales in comparison to what Trump received four years ago. In February 2019, at this same point in the election cycle, 72% of GOP registered voters wanted to keep Trump as their party’s nominee – nearly double Biden's current support.

Meanwhile, 84% of Democratic primary voters approve of the job Biden is doing as president.

""They like him and the job he’s doing, even if they might wish for an alternative in 2024,"" says Anderson.

Roughly equal numbers say they plan to participate in the Democratic (40%) and GOP (41%) primary or caucus in their state. Four years ago, in March 2019, it was 41% Democratic and 38% Republican.

George Soros predicts 'Democratic landslide' in 2024 if Trump and DeSantis 'slug it out',"Left-wing billionaire George Soros recently shared his hopes for the 2024 U.S. presidential election and the conditions he believes will lead to a ""Democratic landslide.""

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday, Soros said it is likely that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will challenge former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination – and win. His hope is that Trump, pride wounded, will mount a third-party campaign for president that will split the GOP vote and hand Democrats another four years in the White House.

""My hope for 2024 is that Trump and Gov. DeSantis of Florida will slug it out for the Republican nomination,"" Soros said.

TRUMP EDGES DESANTIS IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY MATCHUP, BIDEN REMAINS LARGELY UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS: POLL

""Trump has turned into a pitiful figure, continually bemoaning his loss in 2020. Big Republican donors are abandoning him in droves,"" he continued.

Calling DeSantis ""shrewd, ruthless and ambitious,"" Soros predicted the Florida governor will be the Republican candidate for president.

TRUMP WELCOMES NIKKI HALEY INTO THE 2024 RACE: ‘THE MORE THE MERRIER’

""This could induce Trump, whose narcissism has turned into a disease, to run as a third-party candidate. That would lead to a Democratic landslide and force the Republican Party to reform itself,"" Soros said longingly. ""But perhaps, I may be just a little bit biased.""

The 2024 race for the Republican nomination is on, with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley joining Trump as a declared candidate this week. DeSantis is widely expected to announce his own campaign for president in the spring or early summer, once the current session of the Florida legislature wraps up.

Polls consistently show Trump and DeSantis as the top two candidates in the Republican field. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed Trump edging out DeSantis 42%-36% in a hypothetical matchup.

"Georgia DA asks judge to keep Trump criminal probe report sealed, citing concern for 'future defendants'","Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis reportedly asked a judge on Tuesday to keep the report by a special grand jury investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies broke Georgia state law by seeking to overturn the 2020 election results sealed, citing concerns for ""future defendants.""

Willis said disclosure of the report could violate the rights of potential defendants and could negatively affect the ability to prosecute those who may be charged with crimes.

""We want to make sure that everyone is treated fairly, and we think for future defendants to be treated fairly, it is not appropriate at this time for this report to be released,"" Willis said, according to the Associated Press.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney was hearing arguments from the district attorney’s office, news outlets and potentially other parties before deciding whether to release the report, which is expected to include recommendations for Willis on possible criminal prosecution.

MARK MEADOWS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN GEORGIA DA'S ESCALATING TRUMP CRIMINAL PROBE

It's unclear just how specific those recommendations will be. The special grand jury did not have the power to issue indictments, and it will ultimately be up to Willis to decide whether to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.

David Weinberg, a former Jan. 6 committee staffer, tweeted Tuesday that Willis disclosed that the special grand jury heard from 75 witnesses.

Over a period of roughly seven months, the AP reports that the special grand jury heard from dozens of witnesses, including high-profile Trump allies, such as attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and high-ranking Georgia officials, such as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp.

Willis began investigating shortly after a recording of a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger became public. In that call, the president suggested that the state’s top elections official, a fellow Republican, could ""find"" the votes needed to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,"" Trump had said. ""Because we won the state.""

If McBurney decides to disseminate the report, he must also determine whether any parts of it should be redacted and whether the report should be made public now or later. He assured an assistant district attorney arguing against the release of the report that it would not be released Tuesday.

Banks says Trump 'fired up' after FBI raid, 'made up his mind' on 2024: 'Going to like his decision'","EXCLUSIVE: Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks met with former President Trump at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster Tuesday evening, and said the former commander in chief is ""very upbeat,"" and has ""made up his mind"" about 2024—a decision he will make public in ""a matter of time.""

Banks, R-Ind., and nearly a dozen members of the House Republican Study Committee, including Reps. Brian Babin, Mike Kelly, Claudia Tenney, Victoria Spartz, Pat Fallon, Mike Carey, Lisa McClain, Michael Cloud, Randy Weber, Troy Nehls, and Erin Houchin, a congressional candidate from Indiana, met with Trump at his New Jersey retreat.

""He didn’t seem defeated in the least bit—he was very fired up, very upbeat,"" Banks told Fox News of Trump’s attitude, just a day after the FBI raided his home at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

""It was a great three-hour-long conversation about what House Republicans are doing now to win back the majority and what we are going to do with it when we win,"" Banks said.

FBI WOULD NOT LET TRUMP ATTORNEYS IN ROOMS AS AGENTS RAIDED MAR-A-LAGO, WARRANT FOCUSED ON NARA: SOURCE

As for Trump’s plans with regard to a 2024 White House run, Banks said the former president told the group that he ""has made up his mind.""

""He said we are going to like his decision and it is only a matter of time before he will make that decision known,"" Banks told Fox News, adding that Trump ""enjoyed encouragement"" from RSC members Tuesday to ""get the decision out sooner rather than later.""

""He only helps us win back more seats in November,"" Banks said. ""The Republican Party is bigger and stronger than ever before because of Donald Trump’s leadership.""

Banks said Republicans ""need Trump voters to come out in a big way to grow a historic GOP House majority to then pave the way to win the White House in 2024.""

Trump was in New York City while his home in Palm Beach, Florida, was raided.

FBI agents would not allow Trump lawyers to watch as they raided Trump’s private residence early Monday morning, a source told Fox News.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN LEARNED OF FBI RAID ON MAR-A-LAGO THROUGH REPORTS, 'JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'

A source familiar with the raid told Fox News the warrant for the raid was related to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) effort to collect records and materials the former president took with him from Washington, D.C., to Mar-a-Lago.

""There is no need for any of this,"" the source said, adding the FBI ""wouldn’t let the attorneys come in to watch the raid. They told them to leave.""

The source told Fox News that when NARA visited Mar-a-Lago in February, Trump and his team ""gave them what they wanted.""

""It was all provided to them,"" the source said. ""This is absurd.""

Another source told Fox News negotiations and communications ""never broke down.""

Earlier this year, NARA said Trump took 15 boxes of presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. Those boxes allegedly contained ""classified national security information"" and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

NARA notified Congress in February that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and ""identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes.""

""The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a February statement, adding that Democrats ""are in search of their next scam.""

A separate source familiar with the raid told Fox News agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago but found ""nothing in it.""

Another source told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

Former President Trump’s eldest daughter personally contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars for the 1 million meals, which amounted to 158,400 pounds of food to Europe, a source familiar told Fox News.

Trump worked to connect several nonprofit organizations, including CityServe, City of Destiny and Mercy Chefs to help package shelf-stable meals of oatmeal and goulash. The choices of meals came from advised food preferences of aid workers in Ukraine.

Trump had been coordinating with the UPS Foundation, and her partners – City Serve, City of Destiny, the Pentecostal European Fellowship and several local church organizations – to deliver the food to Warsaw, Poland.

"McConnell skewers Trump for dinner with Kanye, Fuentes, says he's 'highly unlikely' to be elected president","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned former President Trump for his dinner with Kanye West and white nationalist Nick Fuentes, saying anyone meeting with individuals with views of antisemitism or white supremacy is ""highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States.""

""There is no room in the Republican Party for antisemitism or white supremacy,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday. ""And anyone meeting with people advocating that point of view, in my judgment, are highly unlikely to ever be elected president of the United States.""

McConnell was referring to Trump’s dinner last week with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago.

WHITE HOUSE SLAMS TRUMP'S DINNER WITH NICK FUENTES, SAYING BIGOTRY AND HATE HAVE 'NO PLACE IN AMERICA'

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Tuesday, also criticized the meeting.

""I don’t think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes,"" McCarthy said. ""He has no place in this Republican Party.""

McCarthy, though, seemingly defended Trump, saying he had come out ""four times and condemned"" Fuentes, adding that he ""didn’t know who he was.""

When pressed further on Fuentes, McCarthy said: ""I condemn his ideology. It has no place in society.""

Fuentes, a white nationalist, has a history of making racist remarks and engaging in Holocaust revisionism—though he has claimed that he does not deny the Holocaust.

The dinner, last Tuesday, came just a week after Trump announced a 2024 presidential bid. Ye has also announced his own 2024 bid.

Trump, in statements on TRUTH Social, said he didn’t know who Fuentes was and that the purpose of the dinner was to meet with Ye — who has also faced criticism for antisemitic remarks — about business and politics.

""This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago,"" he said in his first statement. ""Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.""

""Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, was asking me for advice concerning some of his difficulties, in particular having to do with his business,"" Trump said in his second statement. ""We also discussed, to a lesser extent, politics, where I told him he should definitely not run for President, ‘any voters you may have should vote for TRUMP.’""

""Anyway, we got along great, he expressed no anti-Semitism, & I appreciated all of the nice things he said about me on ‘Tucker Carlson.’ Why wouldn’t I agree to meet? Also, I didn’t know Nick Fuentes,"" he said.

On Saturday, a Trump adviser highlighted Trump's record on fighting antisemitism and aiding Israel when he was in the White House.

DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES 2024 RE-ELECTION RUN FOR PRESIDENT

""From the historic Abraham Accords bringing peace to the Middle East, withdrawal from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, appointing a special envoy to combat the scourge of anti-Semitism, moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, and recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights, President Trump always has been and continues to be the closest friend and ally to the Jewish people and the State of Israel,"" the advisor said.

Last week, Trump described himself as ""the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House"" and took aim at the Biden administration for allegedly squandering that work.

""Tragically, Joe Biden has betrayed Israel and the Jewish community and squandered our amazing success,"" Trump said in a speech to the Republican Jewish Conference annual conference, adding that from the ""very beginning"" of the Biden administration, Biden ""sold out Israel’s security and began begging to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal on even worse terms.""

Meanwhile, last week, Ye released a video saying that Trump had been ""really impressed"" with Fuentes, whom he described as a ""loyalist,"" and that the artist caught Trump off guard by asking him to be his vice president.

""I don't know if I'm going to say he didn't know me… I'm not sure about that, but certainly he didn't know I was me when I arrived at the dinner, and I didn't mean for my statements and my whole background to sort of become a public relations problem for the president.""

The White House condemned the dinner over the weekend, with deputy press secretary Andrew Bates telling Fox News that ""bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America — including at Mar-a-Lago.""

Melania Trump says she was 'fulfilling' official duties as first lady on Jan. 6: 'I always condemn violence',"EXCLUSIVE: Former first lady Melania Trump said Thursday that she was ""fulfilling"" her official duties as first lady of the U.S. on Jan. 6, 2021, telling Fox News Digital exclusively that had she been fully informed of the events taking place at the Capitol during the day, she ""would have immediately denounced the violence.""

Trump’s comments come after her former chief of staff Stephanie Grisham has publicly alleged that the former first lady did not immediately sign off on a statement condemning the Capitol riot.

""On January 6, 2021, I was fulfilling one of my duties as First Lady of the United States of America, and accordingly, I was unaware of what was simultaneously transpiring at the U.S. Capitol Building,"" Trump told Fox News Digital.

""As with all First Ladies who preceded me, it was my obligation to record the contents of the White House’s historic rooms, including taking archival photographs of all the renovations. Several months in advance, I organized a qualified team of photographers, archivists, and designers to work with me in the White House to ensure perfect execution,"" she continued. ""As required, we scheduled January 6, 2021, to complete the work on behalf of our Nation.""

NATIONAL ARCHIVES ASKS SECRET SERVICE TO LOOK INTO REPORTS OF DELETED JAN. 6 TEXT MESSAGES

The former first lady added that ""this is a very significant undertaking and requires great care, attention to detail, and concentration — both in the planning and execution.""

Trump went on to say that she has ""always been very supportive of my former Chief of Staff, Stephanie Grisham.""

""I stood behind Ms. Grisham after her failed stint as White House Press Secretary and welcomed her back to the East Wing,"" Trump said.

Grisham started her White House tenure in the first lady’s office, and later served as White House press secretary following Sarah Sanders’ departure during the summer of 2019. She returned to the East Wing when Kayleigh McEnany was tapped for the role in April 2020.

""Ms. Grisham was not in the White House on January 6, and her behavior in her role as Chief of Staff ultimately amounts to dereliction of duty,"" Trump said, noting that ""traditionally, the First Lady’s Chief of Staff provides detailed briefings surrounding our Nation’s important issues.""

""In fact, Ms. Grisham failed to provide insight and information into the events surrounding January 6 as she had abandoned her post in Washington, D.C.,"" she continued. ""Shamefully, this behavior has only partially become public knowledge; yet was consistent for Ms. Grisham.""

Trump added: ""It is evident that Grisham’s recent betrayals are a last-ditch attempt to resuscitate her ruined career and reputation.""

Grisham last month tweeted out a screenshot of a text message conversation she allegedly had with the former first lady on Jan. 6, 2021.

BIDEN APPROVAL IN KEY 2024 STATE HITS RECORD LOW

""Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness & violence?"" Grisham purportedly texted Trump.

""No,"" Trump purportedly replied.

Grisham’s screenshot shows the two text messages occurred with a contact saved as ""MT.""

Grisham shared the screenshot a day after former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified before the Jan. 6 committee.

""Knowing her as well as I did at that point, it was so unlike her to not have condemned it, that that was the moment it all kind of broke me,"" Grisham said in an interview last month with CNN. ""Yesterday, hearing Cassidy’s testimony, I felt compelled to show that text because it was a lot of context I thought, and again, knowing Melania like I did, I was so disappointed and discouraged and sickened that she wouldn’t stand up and just say simply, ‘There should be no violence.’""

But Trump told Fox News on Thursday: ""I always condemn violence.""

""Had I been fully informed of all the details, naturally, I would have immediately denounced the violence that occurred at the Capitol Building,"" Trump said. ""And while Ms. Grisham’s behavior is disappointing, it is not surprising or an isolated incident.""

She added: ""This is not the first time a former staffer has tried to maintain relevancy and profit by using my name to create a false narrative.""

Pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, during a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College results in favor of President Biden. Several people died in connection with the riot.

Mike Pence says Trump must apologize for dinner with white supremacist Nick Fuentes,"Former Vice President Mike Pence called on former President Donald Trump to apologize for having dinner with white supremacist Nick Fuentes on Tuesday.

Pence had previously held off from attacking Trump for the dinner this weekend, and even now clarified that he does not believe Trump is an antisemite. Pence made the statement during a Monday night appearance on NewsNation, saying Trump had displayed ""profoundly poor judgment.""

""President Trump was wrong to give a white nationalist, an antisemite and Holocaust denier, a seat at the table and I think he should apologize for it,"" Pence said. ""And he should denounce those individuals and their hateful rhetoric without qualification.""

""With that being said, as I point out in the book as well, I don’t believe Donald Trump is an antisemite. I don’t believe he’s a racist or a bigot. I would not have been his vice president if he was,"" Pence clarified, adding that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish.

PENCE ON BACKING TRUMP IN 2024: ‘THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY ELSE I PREFER MORE’

Pence has shown more willingness than ever to criticize his former running mate in recent weeks. Pence finally lambasted Trump for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, earlier this month, saying the former president ""endangered"" his family.

""The president’s words that day at the rally endangered me and my family and everyone at the Capitol building,"" Pence told ABC News. ""The president’s words were reckless, and his actions were reckless. It was clear he decided to be part of the problem.""

Trump targeted Pence during the riot with a tweet claiming he didn't have ""the courage"" to refuse to certify President Biden's 2020 election victory, something Pence lacked the legal authority to do.

""I turned to my daughter, who was standing nearby, and I said, 'It doesn't take courage to break the law. It takes courage to uphold the law,'"" he told interviewer David Muir.

"National Association of Police Organizations endorses Trump, after backing Biden as VP in '08, '12","The National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) endorsed President Trump’s reelection Wednesday, praising his “steadfast and very public support” for law enforcement.

NAPO did not endorse a candidate in the 2016 election but endorsed former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden in both the 2008 and 2012 elections.

NAPO President Michael McHale said Trump's support is needed “during this time of unfair and inaccurate opprobrium being directed at our members by so many.”

“We particularly value your directing the Attorney General to aggressively prosecute those who attack our officers,” McHale wrote in a letter.

TRUMP HOPING TO GET BACKING OF POLICE UNIONS AS LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS OVER BIDEN MOUNT

The police association, which represents more than 1,000 police associations and 241,000 officers, met with Trump on Monday.

Officers have faced routine disparaging in wake of nationwide racial injustice protests, and some have called out presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden for not condemning anti-police rhetoric.

While Biden’s campaign has staunchly opposed the idea of abolishing police departments, the candidate said that some funding should “absolutely” be redirected from the police.

In a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan, the presumptive Democratic nominee said police forces don’t need surplus military equipment, saying this is what leads them to “become the enemy” in a community.

Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said last month that the former vice president supports “the urgent need for reform,” which he said includes “funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing -- so that officers can focus on the job of policing.”

The Biden campaign has pointed to the former vice president’s criminal justice plan, which proposes an additional $300 million for community policing. Bates said that the funding would “improve relationships between officers and residents” and would “provide the training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths.”

Trump, for his part, has billed himself as the president of “law and order.” During the NAPO meeting Trump on Monday planned to make his pitch to the National Association of Police Organizations as to why the group should endorse him.

“Our officers have been under vicious assault,” Trump said Monday during a roundtable with people whose lives have been positively impacted by law enforcement. “Reckless politicians have defamed our heroes as the enemy…These radical politicians want to defund and abolish the police.”

Trump added: “My administration is pro-safety, pro-police and anti-crime.”

Despite Biden’s efforts to align with both the protestors and the police, it appears that some police unions are rethinking their backing of him amid concerns that he’s embraced “anti-police rhetoric.”

“Joe Biden was a very strong supporter of them years ago, and he's been kidnapped now by the anti-police rhetoric,” Paul Digiacomo, the president of the Detective Endowment Association, told Fox Business. “There's a big question amongst our members if Joe Biden is going to stand up and support the police.”

New York AG sues Trump over fraud allegations,"The New York Attorney General's Office has filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump and several of his family members, as well as associates and businesses, alleging ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" regarding financial statements.

Attorney General Letitia James said at a news conference Wednesday morning after the complaint was filed in New York Supreme Court that Trump ""inflated his net worth by billions of dollars"" and that his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, helped him.

""Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization repeatedly and persistently manipulated the value of assets to induce banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than would otherwise have been available to the company,"" James said, ""to pay lower taxes, to satisfy continuing loan agreements, and to induce insurance companies to provide insurance coverage for higher limits and at lower premiums.""

James said that over the course of her office's investigation, they interviewed 65 witnesses and reviewed millions of documents. She said the evidence showed that Trump submitted ""more than 200 false and misleading asset valuations.""

TRUMP INVOKES FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN DEPOSITION FOR NEW YORK AG JAMES' CIVIL INVESTIGATION

The misrepresentations included stating that Trump had cash on hand that he did not have and ignoring restrictions that would impact property values, James said.

""Claiming you have money that you do not have does not amount to the art of the deal, It's the art of the steal,"" James said, referencing the title of Trump's 1987 book.

The attorney general said she believes the allegations also support state and federal criminal laws, and her office is making a referral to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the IRS. The SDNY U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the matter.

James said the investigation only began after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen told Congress that Trump made misrepresentations in statements to financial institutions.

Trump attorney Alina Habba pushed back against the allegations against the former president.

""Today’s filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law — rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General’s political agenda,"" Habba said in a statement. ""It is abundantly clear that the Attorney General’s Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place.

"Parts of Trump Georgia grand jury report are released, suggesting possible witness perjury","A special grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, released portions of a report detailing findings from the investigation into whether former President Donald Trump and his allies interfered in the presidential election in Georgia as part of a larger attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The report indicates a majority of the grand jury believes one or more witnesses may have committed perjury in their testimony and recommends that prosecutors pursue indictments against them, if the district attorney finds the evidence compelling.

""The long awaited important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention President Trump’s name, have nothing to do with the President because President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital.

""The President participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do — in fact, as President, it was President Trump’s Constitutional duty to ensure election safety, security, and integrity. Between the two calls, there were many officials and attorneys on the line, including the Secretary of State of Georgia, and no one objected, even slightly protested, or hung up,"" Cheung continued. ""President Trump will always keep fighting for true and honest elections in America!""

Prosecutors and several media organizations had pushed to release the grand jury's full report, but Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney refused to do so, citing ""very limited due process"" given to Trump's allies who've testified.

On Monday, the judge in Georgia said he would release the report's introduction and conclusion, along with the section in which the grand jurors expressed concerns that some witnesses may have lied under oath.

GEORGIA JUDGE OKS ONLY PARTIAL RELEASE OF TRUMP SPECIAL GRAND JURY REPORT, CITING ‘VERY LIMITED DUE PROCESS’

Any recommendations on who should or should not be prosecuted will remain secret for now to protect their due process rights, McBurney wrote.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is leading an investigation into Trump, who is accused of pressuring Georgia officials to ""find"" enough votes to prevent President Biden from winning the state. Trump had made numerous claims of widespread voter fraud in Georgia and other states, though his attorneys were unable to support those allegations in various suits challenging the election results.

The special grand jury spent about seven months hearing testimony from witnesses, including high-profile Trump allies, such as attorney Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and high-ranking Georgia officials, such as Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp.

Pete Buttigieg blames Trump for Ohio train derailment amid criticism: 'We're constrained',"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg shifted part of the blame for the recent derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals in Ohio on the Trump administration reversing a little-known safety rule.

Buttigieg noted Tuesday evening that his agency had taken a series of steps to improve rail safety through ""historic investments,"" but said it was constrained by the Trump administration action. In 2018, the Department of Transportation (DOT) withdrew a rule proposed three years earlier requiring trains carrying certain dangerous chemicals to utilize electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes, saying the technology's benefits were inconclusive.

""In the wake of the East Palestine derailment and its impact on hundreds of residents, we’re seeing lots of newfound or renewed (and welcome) interest in our work on rail safety, so I wanted to share more about what we’ve been doing in this area,"" Buttigieg tweeted.

""We’re constrained by law on some areas of rail regulation (like the braking rule withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2018 because of a law passed by Congress in 2015), but we are using the powers we do have to keep people safe,"" the transportation secretary added. ""And of course, I’m always ready to work with Congress on furthering (or in some cases, restoring) our capacity to address rail safety issues.""

OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT ADDS TO BUTTIGIEG'S GROWING LIST OF SLOW RESPONSES, AFTER HE WAITED 10 DAYS TO ADDRESS

On Feb. 3, a train carrying vinyl chloride, a dangerous colorless gas, and operated by the transportation company Norfolk Southern Railroad derailed in Columbiana County, Ohio, which is located along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.

PETE BUTTIGIEG OFTEN FLIES ON TAXPAYER-FUNDED PRIVATE JETS, FLIGHT DATA SHOW

Shortly after the derailment, Norfolk Southern opted to release the gas from the derailed cars, potentially releasing deadly fumes into the air, to prevent a potentially disastrous explosion. Local residents were told to evacuate the area, but assured it was safe to return on Feb. 9.

The Environmental Protection Agency, Norfolk Southern and Ohio officials have conducted air monitoring in the eastern Ohio region and said the tests have shown the air is safe to breathe. However, locals and experts have expressed concern that it is dangerous to return to the area.

""The railroad company is responsible for this and for these people who went back to their homes,"" Sil Caggiano, a local hazardous materials specialist, told Fox News on Tuesday. ""Their homes should have been tested. Their homes should have been cleaned. From the onset, these people were being marginalized in an effort to mitigate this.""

""This really looks like a nuclear winter,"" he added. ""Pretty much, yeah, we nuked this town with chemicals.""

BUTTIGIEG BATTERED BY CRISES IN FIRST TWO YEARS AS TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: 'PRIME EXAMPLE OF FAILING UP'

Buttigieg, meanwhile, has been blasted for his slow response to the derailment. He waited 10 days to address the situation, promising to ""use all relevant authorities to ensure accountability and continue to support safety.""

The Trump administration rule change Buttigieg partially blamed came after Congress passed and former President Barack Obama signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act in December 2015.

The legislation established a new process, including independent study and testing, for the DOT to use in developing an updated regulatory impact analysis (RIA) related to the ECP brake provision, according to the Government Publishing Office. The DOT stated in 2018 that the ECP brake requirements weren't expected to be cost beneficial under any scenario assessed.

""When [the National Transportation Safety Board] completes its investigation of the cause of the derailment, which is still being investigated, [the Federal Railroad Administration] and [the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration] will look to the investigation results and use all relevant authorities to ensure accountability and improve safety,"" a DOT spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

""On the rule, in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate required a cost-benefit analysis that allowed for the Trump administration to repeal the rule in 2017 and now makes it challenging to reinstate the rule in its previous configuration — due to threats of litigation and opposition in Congress,"" the statement continued.

""After the 2015 rule was issued, the rule including the RIA was challenged in 5 different Federal Circuits, and Congress quickly moved to vitiate the rule, making it more difficult under the Administrative Procedure Act to revisit the basis for advancing a rule. However, pending the results of the investigation into the derailment, FRA and PHMSA will evaluate action to prevent this from happening again.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-blames-trump-ohio-train-derailment-were-constrained,N/A
Pompeo runs to DeSantis' defense after Trump lands first blow with new nickname,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed to defend Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after former President Donald Trump dubbed the Republican ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" at a rally Saturday evening.

""Not tired of winning. @GovRonDeSantis you’ve proven conservative policies work. Florida is better for it. Vote for @GovRonDeSantis,"" Pompeo tweeted Saturday evening.

The comment came as Trump held a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s Election Day.

""There it is, Trump at 71%, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10%,"" Trump told the crowd while reading approval numbers of various Republicans.

Trump could potentially announce another White House run as early as this month, sources tell Fox News. And pundits view DeSantis as a possible contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination and reports have circulated about possible growing tension between the two. DeSantis, however, quashed reports about such tensions earlier this year, calling Trump a ""friend of mine.""

CONSERVATIVES TURN ON TRUMP FOR ATTACKING RON DESANTIS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS: ‘WHAT AN IDIOT’

""He wants to see Republicans doing well,"" DeSantis told Fox News in February. ""And I think when media is trying to act like he's upset at me for doing well, I think that's total bunk. I think they're just making it up.""

Pompeo – who served as CIA director during the Trump administration before becoming secretary of state from 2018 until the close of the Trump White House – is also seriously mulling a White House run and has made numerous early moves towards launching a campaign.

TRUMP COULD POTENTIALLY ANNOUNCE A 2024 CAMPAIGN A WEEK AFTER THE MIDTERMS, SOURCES SAY

Pompeo has told Fox News and other news organizations that he'll make a decision on running for the White House by spring of 2023. And Pompeo, an Army officer during the Cold War who later served as a congressman from Kansas, has added that if his former boss officially runs in 2024, it would not deter him from also making a bid for the White House. But he's noted he would vote for Trump with ""no hesitation"" if the former president became the nominee for the GOP.

Pompeo, in numerous appearances this year, has walked a fine line between supporting the Trump administration while at the same time putting some daylight between himself and some of Trump’s more controversial actions. It is a balancing act that is likely required of anyone seriously mulling a GOP presidential run in a party where Trump remains the most popular and influential politician with the base.

Pompeo has called the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters amid congressional certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election ""a bad day for the United States of America… it was a tragically bad day.""

Proud Boys' defense plans to subpoena Trump to testify in Jan. 6 seditious conspiracy trial: report,"The members of the Proud Boys on trial for seditious conspiracy for their actions before and leading up to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol reportedly plan on calling former President Donald Trump to testify.

Norm Pattis, attorney for Proud Boys member Joe Biggs, is said to have told Politico, ""Donald Trump called on patriots to stop the steal. We’re calling on Donald Trump to take the stand.""

""We’re going to ask the government for assistance in serving Mr. Trump,"" Pattis added.

Biggs is among four members of the Proud Boys, including former national chairman Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio, on trial for the Civil War-era offense of seditious conspiracy.

JAN. 6 SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY TRIAL AGAINST PROUD BOYS BEGINS IN DOJ'S THIRD CASE BRINGING CIVIL WAR-ERA CHARGE

Throughout the trial, defense attorneys have suggested Trump was responsible for encouraging their clients and a crowd of others to the U.S. Capitol to disrupt the joint session of Congress certifying Joe Biden’s election victory. But Pattis’ remarks indicate the first-time defense has directly confirmed plans to subpoena Trump.

Securing the former president’s testimony in the Proud Boys case remains a long shot. But Trump did evoke the Proud Boys by name on the September 2020 debate stage, telling the groups of self-proclaimed ""Western Chauvinists"" to ""stand back and stand by."" In a Dec. 19, 2020, tweet, Trump also urged the Proud Boys to attend his rally on Jan. 6, writing, ""Be there. Will be wild."" U.S. District Court Judge Tim Kelly has not indicated whether he will permit the subpoena of Trump.

Fox News Digital reached out to Pattis’ office and Trump's team separately Wednesday but did not hear back before publication.

Jeremy Bertino, the only former Proud Boy to plead guilty to the seditious conspiracy charge stemming from the Jan. 6 riot, is testifying against Tarrio and co-defendants Biggs, Ethan Nordean, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. The trial is scheduled to resume Wednesday with more testimony by Bertino.

The trial recessed Tuesday before a prosecutor began questioning Bertino about the Jan. 6 attack.

After the election, Bertino said he viewed the Proud Boys as leaders of the conservative movement, a perspective fueled by his regular viewership of the Infowars website.

""I believed we were supposed to be the leaders of the country, of the right wing,"" Bertino said. ""The tip of the spear.""

Bertino is the second former Proud Boys member to testify at the trial.

The first, Matthew Greene, testified in January that group members were growing increasingly angry about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and were expecting a ""civil war.""

Bertino pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in October 2022 and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department’s investigation. He hasn't been sentenced yet.

Bertino wasn't in Washington when the Capitol riot began. He was stabbed in an altercation in downtown D.C. after a Proud Boys march on Dec. 12, 2021, and was still recovering on Jan. 6.

The indictment in Tarrio’s case alleges that the Proud Boys held meetings and communicated over encrypted messages to plan for an attack in the days leading up to Jan. 6. On the day of the riot, Proud Boys dismantled metal barricades set up to protect the Capitol and mobilized, directed and led members of the crowd into the building, according to prosecutors.

Tarrio wasn’t in Washington on Jan. 6, either. Police arrested him in D.C. two days before the Capitol riot and charged him with vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church during a December 2020 protest. Tarrio heeded a judge's order to leave the city after his arrest.

In the early days of the 2024 Republican presidential nomination race, Trump has already taken at former South Carolina governor and former ambassador Nikki Haley, who declared her candidacy last week. And he’s repeatedly blasted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the popular conservative governor who remains in the sidelines but is the biggest potential threat to the former president.

""I’d be surprised if he came that way with me just because we’re friends. I think we have a deep, mutual respect for one another. We’re both energetic people,"" Ramaswamy told Fox News in an interview Thursday on the campaign trail in New Hampshire.

FIRST ON FOX: CULTURE WARS CRUSADER VIVEK RAMASWAMY LAUNCHES 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Pointing to the former president’s successful 2016 march to the White House, entrepreneur and anti-ESG investor Ramaswamy said that Trump ""was an outsider, a disrupter in 2015, 2016. That’s what I’m doing now. I don’t particularly expect that he’s going to be taking aim at me that’s not respectful.""

But if he’s wrong about Trump, Ramaswamy said he’s ready for the taunts.

""If he is, sure, it’s a competition. We’re happy to do that. Competition breeds innovation and it’s not going to bother me,"" he said.

Ramaswamy, a health care and tech sector entrepreneur, conservative commentator, and crusader in the culture wars, declared his candidacy for president on Tuesday in a live interview on the Fox News Channel.

On Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" where he launched his campaign, Ramaswamy said he respected what the former president was able to accomplish during the 2016 election and said Trump’s upset victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton inspired his own presidential ambitions.

Speaking with Fox Digital, Ramaswamy emphasized that ""I’m not running against President Trump is the point. I’m running for our nation and a vision for our nation. It’s not somebody else’s vision. It’s a vision I’ve spent the last several years of my life, through the books that I’ve written, through the worked I’ve done, that I’m now running on as my platform for reviving a national identity.""

"Robert Trump, brother of President Trump, dead at 71","Robert Trump, younger brother of President Trump, died Saturday night, the White House confirmed in a statement from the president. He was 71.

""It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,"" the president wrote. ""He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.""

The president had traveled to New York on Friday to visit his ailing brother. A senior administration official had said the president “has a very good relationship with his brother and his brother is very special to him.”

Robert, who died just 11 days before what would have been his 72nd birthday, had reportedly spent more than a week in the intensive care unit at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City earlier this summer.

Robert Trump is the president’s youngest brother and the youngest of the five Trump siblings: Maryanne Trump Barry, 83, a retired federal judge; Fred Trump Jr., who died in 1981 at the age of 43; Donald, 74, who is in the middle; Elizabeth Trump Grau, 78, a retired bank executive, and then Robert.

Like his president brother, Robert Trump joined the family business and was a top executive at the Trump Organization.

TRUMP TO VISIT BROTHER AT NEW YORK HOSPITAL

Robert Trump had pulled back from the public view in recent years and described himself as “gainfully retired” living in Millbrook, N.Y. But Robert had come back into the spotlight recently, as he repeatedly tried to block publication of his niece Mary Trump’s new book, “Too Much and Never Enough.”

He requested a restraining order to stop the book from being published, saying its publication would be a violation of the will she signed of the family patriarch Fred Trump Sr.

“Her attempt to sensationalize and mischaracterize our family relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both a travesty and injustice to the memory of my late brother, Fred, and our beloved parents,” he said. “I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” Robert Trump told the New York Times in a statement.

ROBERT TRUMP SEEKS TO BLOCK PUBLICATION OF MARY TRUMP BOOK

Robert Trump didn’t court the limelight the way his brother did, but his high-profile divorce in 2008 from his wife of 25 years, socialite Blaine Trump, broke headlines. Robert Trump was said to be having an affair with his secretary, with whom he later lived, Ann Marie Pallan. Robert and Blaine remained on good terms, with Blaine even attending President Trump’s inauguration in 2017.

Swalwell’s next attack on Trump: Kicking him out of the US Capitol,"Embattled Rep. Eric Swalwell, the Democrat who was kicked off the House Select Committee on Intelligence by Republicans for having a years-long relationship with a Chinese spy, is looking to kick former President Donald Trump out of the Capitol forever.

Swalwell, D-Calif., is the sole co-sponsor of a new Democratic resolution that says Trump and several of his top aides should be permanently banished from the Capitol because of their attempt to ""undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election.""

The resolution from Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., asks the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police to take ""such actions as may be necessary"" to prohibit Trump and eight of his top former advisers and counselors from ever entering the Capitol again.

MCCARTHY CONFIRMS SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR WILL LOSE COMMITTEE SEATS

It makes that recommendation after recounting the work of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, which held several Trump allies in criminal contempt of Congress and referred some of them to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.

""The effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election damaged the functions of our democracy,"" the resolution states. Those efforts also ""damaged the integrity of Congress’s constitutional role in certifying the election results.""

In addition to Trump, the resolution bans former Trump adviser Steve Bannon; former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; former White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino; former Trump assistant Peter Navarro; former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, who urged support for an investigation into election fraud in 2020; and Trump attorneys John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani, who also supported election fraud claims.

HOUSE SPEAKER MCCARTHY REJECTS JEFFRIES' DEMAND TO REAPPOINT SCHIFF, SWALWELL TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

Swalwell was one of several Democrats who aggressively accused Trump of conspiring with Russia to win the 2016 election and accused Trump of acting on ""Russia’s behalf"" while in office.

The tables were turned in late 2020, when reports surfaced that Swalwell had a lengthy relationship with a Chinese spy, Fang Fang, who worked on Swalwell’s campaign as early as 2014. Swalwell has denied any sexual relationship with Fang, but that news drew Republican complaints that Democrats should remove him from the House Intelligence Committee.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., finally kicked Swalwell and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., from the committee soon after McCarthy won the gavel in the new Congress.

After being relieved of their duties on the committee, Swalwell argued the decision was an example of how Republicans are trying to support Russia.

ERIC SWALWELL ROASTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER ASKING WHY GOP COLLEAGUE'S 'GUN' IS 'SO SMALL'

""There is a sympathy for or a desire to, you know, do Putin’s bidding instead of America’s,"" Swalwell said.

Swalwell also blamed McCarthy for rape and death threats against his family and said his removal from the committee was an act of ""political vengeance.""

""It inspires these death threats. People parrot what Kevin McCarthy is saying when they call and make the threats,"" Swalwell said.

""He knows that. We’ve told this to him. I have told this to him. I have, you know, publicly broadcast to him that when you do this, it leads to threats to me, my wife, our kids,"" Swalwell said. ""Recently, someone said that they were going to rape and kill my children, and they were using the language that Kevin McCarthy was using.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swalwells-next-attack-trump-kicking-him-out-us-capitol,N/A
Transcript: 'Fox News Sunday' interview with President Trump,"The following is a transcript of President Trump’s July 19, 2020 interview with ""Fox News Sunday.""

CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. Today from the White House, we're on the president's patio just outside the Oval Office.

President Trump, you've agreed to answer all manner of questions, no subject off-limits. Thank you and welcome back to ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you very much.

WALLACE: Let's start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, quote, ""burning embers."" But I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases...

TRUMP: Cases.

WALLACE: ... a day.

TRUMP: Yes, cases.

WALLACE: Then -- then it went down and now since June, it has gone up more than double. One day this week 75,000 new cases. More than double...

TRUMP: Chris, that's because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.

WALLACE: But -- but this isn't burning embers, sir? This is a forest fire.

TRUMP: No, no. But I don't say -- I say flames, we'll put out the flames. And we'll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it's -- it's going to be under control.

And, you know, it's not just this country, it’s many countries. We don't talk about it in the news. They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it's a little ahead of us in that sense.

But you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico? Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.

WALLACE: But, sir, we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.

TRUMP: Yeah. I think what we'll do -- well, we have them under travel ban too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.

But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.

WALLACE: That’s not true, sir. We, we, we have a -- we had 900 deaths on a single day...

TRUMP: We will take a look...

WALLACE: ... just this week...

TRUMP: Ready?

WALLACE: You, you can check it out.

TRUMP: Can you please get me the mortality rate?

TRUMP: Kayleigh's right here. I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world.

TRUMP: Do you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate.

TRUMP: Number, number one low mortality rate.

TRUMP: I hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about. Ok, go ahead.

WALLACE: OK, OK. I don’t think I’m fake news but I will -- we’ll put --

TRUMP: Yeah, you will --

WALLACE: -- put our stats on --

TRUMP: You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world --

WALLACE: I said you had --

TRUMP: -- and we have the best.

WALLACE VOICE OVER: All right. It’s a little complicated. But bear with us. We went with numbers from Johns Hopkins University which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus. The US ranked 7th better than the United Kingdom but worse than Brazil and Russia.

WALLACE VOICE OVER: The White House went with this chart from the European CDC which shows Italy and Spain doing worse. But countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better like Russia aren’t included in the White House chart.

WALLACE: California locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity at a number of places around the country. Shortages of testing, shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors.

A lot of people say this is because we don't have a national plan. You talk about states. We don't have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?

TRUMP: Look, I take responsibility always for everything because it's ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line.

Some governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They're supposed to have supplies they didn't have. I supplied everybody.

Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas. And other areas we're doing great. But we have a surge in certain areas. But you don't hear people complaining about ventilators. We've got all the ventilators we can use. We're supplying them to other countries.

We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find -- if we did half the testing -- with all of that being said, I'm glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I'm glad we did what we're doing. But we have more tests by far than any country in the world.

WALLACE: But, sir, testing is up 37 percent.

TRUMP: Well, that's good.

WALLACE: I understand. Cases are up 194 percent. It isn't just that testing has gone up, it's that the virus has spread. The positivity rate has increased. There – the virus is…

TRUMP: Many of those cases...

WALLACE: ... worse than it was.

TRUMP: Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them -- don't forget, I guess it's like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and in many cases they're going to get better very quickly.

We go out and we look and then on the news -- look if you go back to the news, all of your -- even your wonderful competitors, you'll see cases are up. Cases are up -- many of those cases shouldn't even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.

No country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody's done is our job on testing, because we're going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests.

You look at other countries; they don't even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they're sick, they're really sick, they test them then, or they'll test them in a doctor's office. But they don't go around have massive areas of testing and we do. And I'm glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.

WALLACE: I’m, I'm going to do you a favor, because I'm sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say, ""Trump, he tries to play it down, he tries to make it not being as serious as it is.""

TRUMP: I don't play it -- I'm not playing -- no, this is very serious.

WALLACE: 75,000 cases a day.

TRUMP: Show me the death chart.

WALLACE: Well, I don't have the death chart.

TRUMP: Well, the death chart is much more important.

WALLACE: But I can tell you, the death chart is a thousand cases a day.

TRUMP: Excuse me, it's all too much, it shouldn't be one case. It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they're having cases.

WALLACE: I can tell you cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.

TRUMP: They don't test. They don't test.

WALLACE: Is it possible that they don't have the virus as badly as we do?

TRUMP: It's possible that they don't test, that's what's possible. We find cases and many of those cases heal automatically. We're finding -- in a way, we're creating trouble. Certainly, we are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, ""Oh, we have more cases.""

Look, we do something that nobody's ever done. Not only the ventilators, where we're supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program the likes of which nobody's ever done before.

WALLACE: The head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, said this on Tuesday.

TAPE: July 14, 2020

DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: ""I do think this fall and winter of 2020, 2021, are probably going to be one of the most difficult times that we’ve experienced in American public health.""

WALLACE: Do you agree with Dr. Redfield?

TRUMP: I don't know and I don't think he knows. I don't think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal. Everybody thought this summer it would go away and it would come back in the fall. Well, when the summer came, they used to say the heat -- the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out, remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong.

They -- they got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong. The World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.

WALLACE: But, this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you.

TRUMP: I agree.

WALLACE: People say that you talk about the world as you’d like to see it rather than follow the science.

TRUMP: No, I…

WALLACE: Well – let me just, let me just ask the question, sir. Why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit Dr. Fauci, who is the nation's top infectious disease expert.

TRUMP: Because we're not. If one man from my administration doesn't like him because he made a few mistakes -- look, Dr. Fauci said, ""Don't wear a mask."" Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, ""You saved tens of thousands of lives"" -- more than that. He said, ""You saved tens of thousands of lives.""

Dr. Fauci's made some mistakes. But I have a very good -- I spoke to him yesterday at length. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.

WALLACE: But -- but, sir, this week -- this weekend, your White House put out a series of statements, so-called mistakes that Dr. Fauci had made. One of your closest aids -- one of your right-hand men, Daniel Scavino, put out this -- you've seen this?

TRUMP: Well Dr., look, look…

WALLACE: Dr. – Dr. – ‘Dr. Faucet,’ which shows him as a leaker and an alarmist.

TRUMP: Well, I don't know that he’s a leaker ….

WALLACE: Why, why would you do that?

TRUMP: He's a little bit of an alarmist. That's OK. A little bit of an alarmist.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/transcript-fox-news-sunday-interview-with-president-trump,N/A
Trump acquitted in second impeachment trial on charge of inciting Jan. 6 Capitol riot,"Former President Trump was acquitted in an unprecedented second impeachment trial on the charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, making him the first and only president to be impeached and acquitted twice in history.

A majority of senators found Trump guilty on Saturday in a 57-43 vote, but the number fell 10 short of the supermajority needed to convict the president. Had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again.

The seven GOP senators who joined with all Democrats in finding Trump guilty were: Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who presided over the trial announced the vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed and therefore Trump is ""hereby acquitted of the charge.""

The acquittal means that as of now Trump can leave the door open to another White House bid in 2024, though senators have hinted they may still try to bar him from office in a separate 14th Amendment measure.

SCHUMER LEAVES DOOR OPEN TO 14TH AMENDMENT MEASURE TO BAR TRUMP FROM OFFICE

Trump praised the victory, thanked his supporters and promised he'd soon emerge with a ""vision for a bright, radiant, and limitless American future.""

The former president, who has largely stayed silent since his impeachment, also took aim at his opponents.

TRUMP CELEBRATES ACQUITTAL IN SENATE TRIAL, FORESHADOWS POLITICAL FUTURE: 'MUCH TO SHARE'

""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""No president has ever gone through anything like it, and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people, the highest number ever for a sitting president, who voted for us just a few short months ago.""

Trump's second impeachment trial arguments lasted just five days, making it the shortest in presidential history. The previous record was held by Trump in 2020 when his trial related to inviting foreign interference into the election spanned 21 days.

The trial surrounded the Jan. 6 riot when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, beat police officers, chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" and forced lawmakers to take shelter. The mayhem temporarily stopped Congress' certification of President Biden's Electoral College win.

House impeachment managers accused Trump of inciting the insurrection by spreading a ""big lie"" the election was stolen from him, summoning his supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, telling them to ""fight like hell"" and then refusing to call off the attack once the mob violently took over the Capitol.

""He named the date. He named the time. He brought them here, and now he must pay the price,"" lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in his closing remarks to the Senate.

Trump legal's team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional ""sham impeachment"" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats' ""hatred"" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent.

Trump lawyers also argued the former president's political speech is protected by the First Amendment and his words on Jan. 6 to his supporters to ""fight like hell"" were not meant literally. To drive home that point during the trial, Trump's defense played an 11-minute video of nearly every Democrat in the chamber using the words ""fight"" in their past speeches and interviews.

The vote capped a wild Saturday in Washington with numerous plot twists.

In a curveball move, the Senate Saturday morning voted 55-45 to allow witnesses at the trial after Raskin said they wanted to hear from GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler.

Raskin cited the ""breaking news"" overnight about details Beutler revealed of a heated phone call that Trump had with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy during the middle of the Capitol attack.

Beutler, who was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in House, released her account of the call late Friday, confirming a CNN report that Trump dismissed McCarthy's pleas to call off the riot and instead told McCarthy that the rioters were ""more upset about the election"" than the House leader.

MCCONNELL WILL VOTE TO ACQUIT TRUMP IN SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, AS DAY FIVE GETS UNDERWAY

""When McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol,"" Beutler said in her statement. ""McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That's when, according to McCarthy, the president said, 'Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.'""

Trump's legal team blasted the decision to call witnesses and threatened to depose 100 people if the door is open. A visibly angry and animated Michael van der Veen said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Kamala Harris would ""absolutely"" need to be deposed, too, but not by Zoom.

""These depositions should be done in person in my office in Philadelphia,"" van der Veen told the senators, which drew audible laughter from the Senate chamber.

ANOTHER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TWIST: SENATE SIDESTEPS WITNESSES DESPITE VOTE ALLOWING THEM

Van deer Veen shot back: ""I haven't laughed at any of you. And there's nothing laughable here.""

The surprise vote on witnesses shook Washington and seemed to even catch senators off guard.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the move set off ""chaos"" in the chamber. He speculated the trial could last until April with witnesses.

""At this point, it's pandemonium,"" Cruz told pool reporters.

But just as quickly as the Senate went down the path of witnesses, lawyers then reversed course on Saturday.

After a recess where lawyers huddled, Trump's legal team agreed to allow the damaging statement from Beutler to be entered into the trial as evidence. Armed with her statement, House prosecutors then abandoned their demand for witnesses altogether and moved to closing arguments.

House managers said the revelations about McCarthy's call with Trump show that Trump abdicated his oath of office by showing support for the rioters and disregard for the security of members of Congress and Pence, who was targeted by the mob for assassination.

""He chose retaining his own power over the safety of Americans,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. ""I can't imagine more damning evidence of his state of mind.""

The arguments, however, weren't enough to sway the 17 GOP senators needed for conviction.

MCCONNELL RIPS TRUMP, SAYS ACTIONS 'UNCONSCIONABLE' BUT TRIAL WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was very critical of Trump's conduct surrounding the Jan. 6 riot and his wife -- former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao -- even resigned from the administration in the aftermath of the attack that left at least five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.

""There's no question... that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said in a speech after the vote Saturday.

Still, McConnell found Trump ""not guilty,"" saying he believes convicting the former president is unconstitutional.

""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former office holder who is now a private citizen,"" McConnell said in a speech.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, one of the impeachment managers, said McConnell all but admitted the House proved its case but resorted to a procedural excuse against conviction.

""Trump was let off on a technicality and that's essentially what you heard Mitch McConnell say,"" Castro said.

PELOSI BLASTS MCCONNELL AND 'COWARDLY GROUP OF REPUBLICANS' IN SENATE AFTER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ACQUITTAL

In a news conference after the vote, Democratic managers pointed out that the presidential impeachment process was the most bipartisan in history, with 10 House Republicans and now seven GOP senators backing the effort.

""Even though we didn't get 67 votes, this has been the most bipartisan vote for impeachment and conviction ever,"" Castro said. ""And we know that we spoke the truth and the American people by and large have agreed with us.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-acquitted-in-second-impeachment-trial-for-inciting-jan-6-capitol-riot,N/A
"Trump appears to take aim at potential 2024 GOP rivals, says he doesn't have much 'competition'","Former President Donald Trump took aim at his potential rivals for the Republican presidential nomination as he kicked off a new phase of this 2024 White House campaign with a stop in the state that first launched him towards the presidency.

Pointing to his 2020 renomination as the sitting president, Trump on Saturday recollected during a speech in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire that he didn't have much competition.

Then, as he looked to a potential 2024 GOP primary field that might eventually include rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, and other well known Republicans, Trump asserted that ""I don’t think we have competition this time either to be honest.""

The former president also pushed back against recent criticism from political pundits that the first months of his third White House campaign have been anything but impressive.

TRUMP STOPS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, KICK OFF NEW PHASE FOR HIS 2024 CAMPAIGN

""They said ‘he's not doing rallies, he’s not campaigning. Maybe he lost his step,"" Trump said as he imitated his critics.

The former president then stressed ""we didn't. I'm more angry now. And I’m more committed now than I ever was.""

Trump made his comments as he gave the headline address to hundreds of party leaders, elected officials and activists attending the New Hampshire GOP’s annual meeting.

New Hampshire, which for a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House, was the scene of Trump’s first election victory in 2016, igniting him towards the GOP presidential nomination and eventually the White House.

2024 WATCH: TRUMP'S IN — HERE'S WHO ELSE MAY JOIN THE GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FIELD

Trump’s visit to New Hampshire — first reported by Fox News earlier this week — was his first stop of the day. He later headed for South Carolina, another crucial early voting state that holds the third contest in the GOP’s presidential nominating calendar, directly after New Hampshire.

The Saturday afternoon gathering South Carolina’s state capitol building — where he is expected to announce his leadership team in the Palmetto State with Sen. Lindsey Graham and Gov. Henry McMaster on hand — will be Trump’s first 2024 campaign event since announcing his candidacy in mid-November at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

As he builds his leadership teams in the early voting states, the former president announced that Steve Stepanek is ""coming on board as the senior adviser for my New Hampshire campaign""

Stepanek, a former state lawmaker and businessman who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in the Granite State, on Saturday finished up four years steering the state party committee.

The former president received a very warm welcome from the crowd in New Hampshire, as Trump supporters and allies have expanded their grip over the state party in recent years.

FIRST ON FOX: TRUMP STOPPING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AHEAD OF SOUTH CAROLINA ON SATURDAY

""We're starting right here as a candidate for president…. This is just the beginning of our agenda. I look forward to returning many times,"" Trump touted.

And he predicted that ""one year from now we will win the New Hampshire primary and the with the help of the good people of this state... we’ll take back the White House.""

While Trump’s the only major Republican to date to launch a 2024 presidential campaign, and while he remains the most popular and influential politician in the GOP and the party’s most ferocious fundraiser when it comes to energizing the grassroots.

But political pundits from both the left and the right torched his campaign launch, and he’s been criticized by Democrats and some Republicans for controversial actions and comments he’s made during the past two months. Plus, in the wake of a lackluster performance by the GOP in the midterm elections — when the party underperformed in what may expected to be a red wave election — Trump has also been blamed for elevating polarizing Republican nominees who ended up losing in November.

While he didn’t take sides in New Hampshire’s combustible GOP primaries in September, the MAGA-style candidates who won the U.S. Senate and both congressional nominations went down in flames in November’s general election.

DESANTIS TOPS TRUMP IN CRUCIAL PRIMARY STATE POLL

Two days before the former president’s arrival in the Granite State, a new public opinion poll by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center suggested that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida held a double-digit lead over Trump in a hypothetical 2024 GOP presidential nomination matchup in the first primary state.

DeSantis, whom pundits expect will declare his candidacy for president later this year but who has yet to say if he’ll launch a campaign, stood at 42% support in the survey of likely GOP presidential primary voters in New Hampshire, with Trump at 30%. The poll is energizing DeSantis supporters — including two outside political groups with no ties to governor, one national and one New Hampshire based — which are trying to convince the Florida governor to run for president. Both groups set up booths at the NHGOP meeting in Salem.

Until recently, Trump was the clear and overwhelming front-runner in the early 2024 GOP presidential nomination polls. But in a handful of national surveys released last month, Trump trailed DeSantis, whose standing with conservatives across the country has soared over the past three years. DeSantis was overwhelmingly re-elected in November for a second term leading Florida, a one-time battleground state that’s turned increasingly red the past two cycles.

WHY THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE IS OFF TO A SLOW START

Trump allies and supporters highlight that public opinion polling has long undercounted the former president's support, dating back to his first campaign for the White House in 2016.

And Trump, during his comments in New Hampshire, touted his poll position in numerous surveys, claiming that ""we are so far ahead in the polls.""

The former president took aim at his successor in the White House, criticizing President Biden on multiple fronts, including the current president's proposal to move New Hampshire down a notch in the Democratic Party's nominating calendar, which has infuriated both Democrats and Republicans in the Granite State.

Republicans are not altering their nominating calendar, keeping New Hampshire second in their schedule after the Iowa caucuses.

""I make this solemn pledge — when I’m back in the White House I will ensure that New Hampshire remains the home of the first in the nation Republican primary for many, many years to come,"" Trump highlighted.

Trump’s stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina appear to be a move to plant a flag as his campaign starts to move into a higher gear.

""It’s going to be the first of many trips,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told Fox News. ""It’s something we’ve been looking forward to do. The early bird gets the worm. It’s all about getting out, organizing, getting your people together, getting them motivated, getting them excited.""

LaCivita emphasized that ""we’re starting early and starting aggressive and putting this organization together, I think bodes well for the future.""

While Trump was the first candidate to announce, the field for the GOP presidential nomination will likely soon grow. Some of the likely or potential contenders hail from the two states Trump was stopping in on Saturday. Former two-term South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina appear to moving towards launching possible campaigns. And in New Hampshire, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is also mulling a bid.

""New Hampshire is full of tire kickers. We love to put candidates through their paces and Donald Trump is no exception to that. He’s going to have to work just like any other candidate who wants to win New Hampshire. He’s certainly shown he can do that. He did that in 2016 pretty handily. And he has without question the best infrastructure of any candidate, so he’s well positioned,"" veteran New Hampshire conservative activist Greg Moore told Fox News.

But Moore, the longtime state director for Americans for Prosperity, emphasized that Trump is ""still going to have to prove himself to New Hampshire voter just like every other candidate.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-appears-take-aim-potential-2024-gop-rivals-doesnt-have-much-competition,N/A
"Trump joins Biden, Obama in condemning 'horrible' beating of Tyre Nichols: 'Never should have happened'","Former President Donald Trump joined the chorus of those responding to graphic footage from the bodycams of five Memphis police officers who repeatedly beat 29-year-old Tyre Nichols. The footage was released to the public Friday, Jan. 27.

""I thought it was terrible. He was in such trouble. He was just being pummeled. Now that should never have happened,"" Trump said during an interview with The Associated Press Saturday.

The footage shows the officers punching, kicking, pepper spraying and tasing Nichols, a 29-year-old Black father and delivery driver, following a traffic stop on Jan. 7.

He died three days later, on Jan. 10. The officers were charged with his murder.

TYRE NICHOLS' LAST WORDS HEARD ON NEWLY RELEASED BODYCAM FOOTAGE: 'I'M JUST TRYING TO GET HOME'

Trump, who is running for the White House in 2024, said hearing Nichols repeatedly call out to his mother during the assault was particularly difficult. He said it was ""a very sad moment.""

""That was really the point that got me the most, to be honest with you,"" the former president said.

Trump said Memphis police were taking a ""strong step"" in disbanding the SCORPION police unit involved in the attack, which was created to target violent offenders in areas beset by high crime. SCORPION stands for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods.

TENNESSEE SHERIFF OPENS NEW INVESTIGATION INTO TWO DEPUTIES AFTER TYRE NICHOLS BODYCAM VIDEO RELEASE

It has been ""permanently"" deactivated as a result of the Jan. 7 incident, Memphis officials announced.

Trump also called the video ""pretty conclusive,"" as the officers face murder charges.

He also suggested the traffic violation was not the officers’ motivation for the beating.

""Look, the tape was perhaps not totally conclusive but, to me, it was pretty conclusive and it was vicious and violent and hard to believe — over a traffic violation,"" Trump said.

Warning: The contents of the below video are graphic in nature.

Trump previously discouraged violent protests that erupted across the country in the summer of 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which he also condemned.

""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Trump tweeted, sparking backlash. The tweet was also flagged by Twitter as glorifying violence.

REACTION SWIFT AFTER TYRE NICHOLS POLICE FOOTAGE RELEASED; 'THESE MEN WERE STREET FIGHTING,' FORMER COP SAYS

The former president defended his comments as attempting to discourage escalation, not a call to shoot those who are looting.

He later centered his 2020 reelection bid around ""law and order"" and supporting law enforcement.

Trump, while in office, signed an executive order encouraging better police practices.

Former President Barack Obama also responded to the Tyre Nichols bodycam footage.

In a joint tweet, Barack and Michelle Obama said that Nichols’ death is a ""painful reminder"" for America.

""The vicious, unjustified beating of Tyre Nichols and his ultimate death at the hands of five Memphis police officers is just the latest, painful reminder of how far America still has to go in fixing how we police our streets,"" the couple said.

President Joe Biden also addressed the video.

""My heart goes out to Tyre Nichols’ family and to Americans in Memphis and across the country who are grieving this tremendously painful loss. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a beloved child and young father,"" he wrote in a statement Friday night.

Trump says Biden is letting 'radical climate extremists run our country' as US sees record-high gas prices,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump told Fox News that President Biden is ""letting the radical climate extremists run our country while the world burns,"" as gas prices in the U.S. surge to record highs amid Russia’s war against Ukraine.

""Energy prices are skyrocketing — they are going to infinity, all because of Joe Biden,"" Trump told Fox News.

Americans are experiencing the highest gas prices since the 2007-09 financial crisis, with the national gas price average reaching more than $4 per gallon — the highest average to date, according to AAA.

Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy to the United States, targeting the ""main artery"" of Russia's economy amid Putin’s war on Ukraine, but warned that the ban would cost American families.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Russian oil exports account for about one-third of Europe’s oil imports, however, Russian exports are just under 10% of U.S. overall imports.

""This was a war that should have never happened,"" Trump told Fox News. ""There is no way Putin would have done it if I were president.""

Bipartisan heat

Biden has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for the high gas prices, which have risen sharply under his administration even before Russia’s invasion. Many have publicly called for him to open up oil and gas drilling in the U.S. to lessen the country’s dependence on foreign oil.

WHITE HOUSE BLAMES RUSSIA FOR RECORD-HIGH GAS PRICES, COINING '#PUTINPRICEHIKE'

""We have the oil under our feet, liquid gold,"" Trump said. ""But instead, we are thinking of buying oil from Venezuela, Iran and others who do not exactly love America.""

""We have the oil under our feet, liquid gold. But instead, we are thinking of buying oil from Venezuela, Iran and others who do not exactly love America."" — Former President Trump

Trump was reacting to reports that the Biden administration is weighing purchasing petroleum from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.

""Joe Biden is letting the radical climate extremists run our country, while the world burns,"" Trump told Fox News. ""Everyone is suffering because our leaders have no idea what they are doing.""

Trump added: ""Bring back American energy independence and American dominance.""

Blaming Putin

The former president’s comments came as the White House is blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for the record-high gas prices in the U.S., even coining the surge as the ""#PutinPriceHike,"" and vowing that Biden will do everything he can to shield Americans from ""pain at the pump.""

On Wednesday, though, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said restarting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was not one of the options on the table.

""If we’re trying to bring about more supply that does not address any problem,"" Psaki said. ""The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism – it’s not an oil field, so it does not provide more supply into the system.""

When pressed further on whether restarting the pipeline is something the White House is considering, Psaki said: ""There’s no plans for that, and it would not address any of the problems we’re having currently.""





GOP criticism

Biden has been facing criticism from Republicans, who have been urging him to lift his executive orders that canceled the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and froze new oil and gas leases on federal lands.

WHITE HOUSE: 'NO PLANS' TO ALLOW KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE, DESPITE SAYING ALL OPTIONS ON TABLE FOR OIL PRICES

Biden, this week, though, said it is ""not true"" that his administration is holding back domestic energy production, warning that gas prices will ""go up further"" from their current record levels, and reiterated his support for government spending on renewable energy sources and criticizing the oil and gas industry for not taking full advantage of drilling opportunities in the U.S.

Biden was asked Tuesday if he had a message for the American people on gas prices.

""They’re going to go up,"" he said.

TRUMP WARNS 'WORLD WAR' COULD BE NEXT AS RUSSIA CONTINUES INVASION IN UKRAINE

When asked what is he going to do about it, Biden replied: ""Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible.""

Trump's warning

Meanwhile, during a separate interview with Fox News last month just days after Russia launched its multi-front war on Ukraine, Trump said the invasion could lead to ""world war.""

""Thousands of people, I mean, this can lead to much bigger than this one area,"" Trump warned. ""This could lead to a lot of other countries and can lead to world war.""

Trump blows off January 6 committee's deposition deadline,"Former President Trump on Monday missed the deadline for delivering testimony to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol, and once more signaling his opposition to the work of a committee that Trump's team has accused of ""partisan theatrics.""

The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol demanded Trump's testimony under oath by Monday, Nov. 14, at 10 a.m., but a source closer to the former president confirmed he did not sit for a deposition either in person or remotely.

Staff for the committee declined to comment other than to say they had nothing to ""preview.""

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE SUBPOENAED TRUMP. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed Trump on Oct. 21 and asked that he produce records for the committee by Nov. 4, and then testify shortly thereafter. Trump sent no records to the committee, and committee members extended the deadline for another week.

On Friday, Nov. 11, just days before the committee wanted him to appear, Trump filed a lawsuit against all members of the committee and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in an attempt to block the subpoena, which he called ""invalid.""

TRUMP FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST JAN. 6 COMMITTEE IN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

In the lawsuit, Trump said the subpoena has a ""vague and loosely worded purpose"" and does not ""describe how the testimony of President Trump is necessary to further this purported purpose.""

""The Committee’s Subpoena is invalid because, as explained below, the Committee did not issue the Subpoena to further a valid legislative purpose; the Subpoena is unwarranted because other sources can provide the information the Subpoena seeks; the Subpoena is broader than reasonably necessary; the Subpoena infringes on executive privilege; the Subpoena infringes President Trump’s First Amendment rights; the Committee is not duly authorized; and the Committee lacks the authority to issue subpoenas,"" the lawsuit said.

Trump defends coronavirus response after Woodward interview audio published: 'I don't want to scare people',"President Trump defended comments he made earlier this year about the coronavirus pandemic in interviews with journalist Bob Woodward, telling Fox News' ""Hannity"" Wednesday that he wanted to ""show a calmness.""

""I'm the leader of the country, I can't be jumping up and down and scaring people,"" Trump told host Sean Hannity. ""I don't want to scare people. I want people not to panic, and that's exactly what I did.""

MEADOWS ADMITS 'I WOULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED' WOODWARD HAVE ACCESS TO TRUMP FOR INTERVIEWS

Excerpts from some of the interviews, which form the basis of Woodward's forthcoming book, ""Rage,"" were published by The Washington Post earlier Wednesday. In early February, Trump told Woodward that the coronavirus was ""deadly stuff"" while publicly comparing it to seasonal flu. More than a month later, on March 19, Trump admitted to Woodward that he ""wanted to always play it [the virus] down.

""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,"" Trump added at the time.

On Wednesday night, the president condemned Woodward as an author of ""hit jobs.""

WOODWARD DISMISSES CLAIMS HE COULD HAVE SAVED LIVES BY PUBLISHING TRUMP CORONAVIRUS REMARKS SOONER

""He does hit jobs with everybody, he even did it on Obama ... constant hit jobs. On [George W.] Bush, I guess, they did three books, they were all terrible,"" Trump said. ""So I figured, you know, 'Let's give it a little shot, I'll speak to him.' It wasn't a big deal, I speak to him and let's see. I don't know if the book is good or bad, I have no idea. I probably, almost definitely won't read it because I don't have time to read it. But I gave it a little bit of a shot, sounds like it's not going to be good.""

Trump also defended his early response to the pandemic, citing his late January decision to limit flights to the U.S. from China, a move Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden panned as in keeping with what he called Trump's ""record of hysteria, xenophobia and fear-mongering.""

""If you look at the representatives of Joe Biden, you see what they were saying. They were saying 'no problem', 'this won't be a problem,'"" Trump told Hannity. ""He didn't think it was going to be a problem until months later. He was way late.""

The president also recalled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., touring San Francisco's Chintown in late February in an apparent bid to ease fears about the virus.

""Nobody wanted me to do the ban on China, and as you know, shortly thereafter, I [instituted] a ban on [travel from] Europe, and that was even more controversial, and it was good, because I saw what was going on in Italy and in Spain and in France, and we did a ban there,"" Trump said. ""And if we didn't do those bans, we would have had numbers that were much, much [worse].""

Trump also criticized Democratic governors for keeping their states on lockdown, citing the swing states of North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

""If you look at some of the states like North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- you look at what they are doing -- they are shut down, they are still shut down,"" said the president, adding, ""it's a shame -- They don't know what they're doing, frankly.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-defends-coronavirus-response-woodward-interview-published,N/A
"Trump denies Pelosi aircraft for foreign trip, after call for State of the Union delay","President Trump on Thursday abruptly denied military aircraft to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a foreign trip just minutes before the congressional delegation was set to depart, in a stunning decision that followed her call to delay the State of the Union address amid the government shutdown.

In a curt letter, Trump said her trip has been “postponed.”

“Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,” Trump wrote.

“I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.”

Asked if lawmakers might still be able to find another way to travel overseas, a senior congressional official told Fox News Thursday evening only, ""I don't know.""

According to sources, the president pulled the plug on Pelosi's aircraft as she was about to leave for her overseas trip. Her congressional delegation's military aircraft was slated to depart at 3 p.m. ET.

A senior White House official also told Fox News that all congressional delegation travel by military aircraft is now postponed.

SHUTDOWN STANDOFF: PELOSI RENEWS CALL TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION, TRUMP SAYS DEMS 'HIJACKED' BY 'FRINGE'

An official said that “as soon as the president found out about the trip today, he took immediate action.” A source told Fox News that when moving to cancel Thursday's flight, the White House reasoned that the trip would keep Pelosi out of the country beyond next Tuesday night—when the next government pay period would occur.

""If she had gone on this trip she would have guaranteed that 800,000 federal workers would not receive their second paycheck because she would not have been here to negotiate any kind of deal,"" a senior White House official said Thursday.

But Pelosi's office fired back, with spokesman Drew Hammill saying the purpose was to meet with allies and ""express appreciation & thanks to our men & women in uniform for their service & dedication"" -- while noting there was no planned stop in Egypt.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called the move ""petty"" and ""small.""

""It is unbecoming of the president of the United States. But it is unfortunately a daily occurrence,"" he said.

Republicans had a split response over the president's decision.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said it was ""completely appropriate."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it ""inappropriate.""

""One sophomoric response does not deserve another. Speaker Pelosi’s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political,"" he tweeted.

The president's move to cancel Pelosi's trip came after the House speaker's request to delay his annual State of the Union address -- though one White House official claimed the aircraft decision was not a ""response"" to Pelosi's letter.

The president has been slated to deliver his message to a Joint Session of Congress on Jan. 29, yet Pelosi on Wednesday urged the president to delay his delivery until the government re-opens, or deliver the address in writing.

The speaker stood by that call earlier Thursday.

“The date of the State of the Union is not a sacred date. It’s not constitutionally required. It’s not the president’s birthday. It’s just a date we agreed to,” Pelosi told reporters during a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday. “That’s why I said to the president, if you don’t open up government, let’s discuss a mutually agreeable date.”

PELOSI TAKES HEAT FOR BID TO DELAY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS

She added: “It could be a week later—if the government is reopened.”

For more than 24 hours, Trump did not respond to Pelosi's request, even as fellow Republicans condemned her push for delay.

Congressional lawmakers, meanwhile, were left sitting on a bus waiting to see if they could depart. They included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. Fox News is told Capitol Hill security officials got an emergency call from the Pentagon canceling the overseas trip due to the shutdown.

Amid mounting confusion, Fox News is told there were furious calls going back and forth among Capitol Hill, State, Pentagon and White House offices. The bus later returned to the Capitol, where members filed back into the building.

When asked for additional context about the congressional delegation and the apparent trip delay, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders reiterated that Pelosi could fly commercial: ""The Department of Defense has to approve military air travel. As he made clear in the letter she can still go, she just has to travel commercial.""

The rhetoric continues to show both sides of the standoff refusing to step off their positions that triggered the funding lapse shortly before the holidays last month.

Trump wants nearly $6 billion for a border wall, while Pelosi and fellow Democrats have described such a project as immoral. The two sides have been unable to strike a deal that both bridges their differences and re-opens a slew of shuttered agencies.

The shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, has left more than 800,000 federal workers and contractors without pay. Some federal employees have been deemed essential to government function and are required to work without pay. Others have been furloughed, but still are left unpaid.

Jean Carroll, who claimed he raped her in the 1990s and damaged her reputation in 2019 when he denied the allegations.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected a request by Trump's legal team that his testimony be delayed. His deposition is scheduled for October 19.

""The defendant should not be permitted to run the clock out on plaintiff’s attempt to gain a remedy for what allegedly was a serious wrong,"" Kaplan wrote in a filing Wednesday.

The decision comes in a lawsuit brought by Carroll, who is known for her ""Ask E. Jean"" column that ran in Elle Magazine. Carroll alleges that Trump raped her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a department store in New York City.

Carroll claims that Trump damaged her reputation in 2019 when he denied raping her.

"Trump, Haley and potential 2024 contenders like DeSantis court big donors as GOP's White House race heats up","Former President Trump hosted some of his top financial backers at what was described as an intimate gathering at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida on Thursday night.

The event is the first major fundraiser this cycle for MAGA Inc., the top super PAC supporting Trump as he makes his third straight presidential run.

Several other potential and declared presidential candidates are ramping up the 2024 fundraising race this week.

On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will kick off a weekend retreat with roughly 150 of his top donors at the Four Seasons resort in Palm Beach, just a few miles away from Mar-a-Lago. The popular conservative governor, who remains on the 2024 sidelines but is rumored to be considering a presidential campaign launch later this year, is expected to share data from his overwhelming re-election victory last November and his spotlight his agenda ahead.

SCOTT ACCUSES DEMOCRATS OF USING ‘PROVOCATIVE RACIAL HISTORY’ TO FUEL 'PROGRESSIVE AGENDA'

Additionally, a handful of actual or likely Republican presidential candidates are gathering in Austin, Texas on Friday to headline a conference of top donors organized by Karl Rove, the longtime GOP strategist and top political adviser to then-President George W. Bush.

Former South Carolina governor and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who last week declared her candidacy for president, is among those speaking at the conference, which will help raise money for a registration initiative known as the Texas Voter Engagement Project.

DESANTIS, TRUMP, PENCE, SPOTLIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AS 2024 RACE HEATS UP

Also addressing the donors are four other well-known Republicans seriously mulling White House runs — former Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a 2016 GOP presidential contender.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, another rising star in the party, will also speak at the gathering, which is modeled on similar event Rove held in 2021.

As the race for the GOP presidential nomination heats up, so does the outreach to the donor class by actual or potential candidates.

""The competition for both grassroots activists and donors is ramping up,"" Rove, a longtime Fox News contributor, said. ""People are starting to take a look at these candidates and prospective candidates and starting to make judgments.""

Trump, who remains the most popular and influential politician in the GOP, remains a ferocious fundraiser when it comes to small dollar, grassroots contributions, but some are starting to question his appeal to top dollar donors.

Rove said many in the GOP donor class appreciated Trump’s polices during his four years in the White House but that his constant re-litigating of the 2020 election ""is not exactly what they want to see for the party or for the country.""

Pointing to Trump – who is 76 – and to the 80-year-old President Biden, Rove argued that ""we’re at one of those hinge points"" where donors and voters are looking to the next generation.

When it comes to the early polling in the burgeoning Republican nomination race, Trump and DeSantis are in a league of their own, far ahead of the rest of the actual and likely contenders. It is the same with fundraising.

Trump’s various political committees combined started the year with over $81 million cash-on-hand, with nearly $55 million of that haul in MAGA Inc.’s coffers.

DeSantis hauled in a whopping $217 million through his re-election campaign and an aligned PAC during the past cycle, with plenty of the haul unspent. While that money cannot be transferred to a presidential campaign – it could be moved to an aligned super PAC.

""If you’re a perspective donor or bundler, and it’s a two-person race, there needs to be a very compelling argument and/or roadmap"" from the other potential contenders on how they're ""going to break into that two person tier,"" longtime Republican fundraiser and lobbyist David Tamasi told Fox News.

Another successful fundraiser is Scott, who started the year with $22 million in his campaign coffers, left over from last year’s successful re-election campaign.

""People tend to overlook a little bit hard dollars,"" Tamasi noted. ""Tim Scott having $22 million…. shouldn’t be overlooked.""

Arizona businessman Don Tapia, a leading donor to Trump in 2016 and 2020 who served as ambassador to Jamaica during the former president's administration, says he would support DeSantis if he enters the race.

Pointing to Trump's jabs at DeSantis and Haley in recent weeks, Tapia said on Fox News' ""Your World with Neil Cavuto"" that ""there's no reason to attack people. He was a President of the United States. The President of the United States should act presidential. You don't have to attack.""

Trump spoke at the conference Saturday night, hinting at a 2024 run. His speech was the keynote on the second day of the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit. Trump's speech followed one Friday night by DeSantis, who's considered along with Trump one of the foremost potential GOP 2024 contenders.

Teasing his own possible 2024 run, Trump said Saturday that he won the 2016 election, falsely claimed he won the 2020 election, and said, ""now we may just have to do it again.""

""If I stayed home, if I announced that I was not going to run for office, the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop,"" Trump also said later in the speech. ""But that's what they want me to do. And you know what? There's no chance I do that.""

"Trump drops major hints on possible 2024 presidential run, in culture war-tinged TPUSA speech","Former President Donald Trump Saturday hinted at a 2024 presidential run in a speech full of culture war rhetoric and attacks on his political enemies, including President Biden, the January 6 Committee and more.

The address was the keynote on the second day of the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit. Trump's speech followed one Friday night by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who's considered along with Trump one of the foremost potential GOP 2024 contenders.

Teasing his own possible 2024 run, Trump said Saturday that he won the 2016 election, falsely claimed he won the 2020 election, and said, ""now we may just have to do it again.""

""If I stayed home, if I announced that I was not going to run for office, the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop,"" Trump also said later in the speech. ""But that's what they want me to do. And you know what? There's no chance I do that.""

DESANTIS LIGHTS INTO BIDEN DURING TPUSA SPEECH AMID RAMPANT 2024 SPECULATION

The comments came after Donald Trump Jr. earlier in the evening did not take the possibility Trump could announce a presidential bid before November off the table when asked by Fox News Digital.

Among the culture war issues Trump hit on were school controversies, including critical race theory.

""Across the United States, we need to implement strict prohibitions on teaching inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material to America's children in any form,"" he said.

""You would not trust these people to babysit your children for 20 minutes. And why should we then let them educate millions of American students six hours a day, year, after year, after year,"" he added.

Trump also attacked transgender participation in women's sports, making animated gestures and mocking voices as he recounted stories of biological males winning women's sporting events.

""It's not politically correct to do what I just did… people are not allowed to talk about it,"" Trump said.

CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS WEIGH TRUMP AND DESANTIS AS POSSIBLE 2024 GOP NOMINEES

Trump further attacked the Biden administration for its coronavirus vaccine mandates for the military. He said the U.S. should ""rehire every patriot who was shamefully fired from the military with an apology"" and ""back pay."" And he said that the right needs to engage in corporate culture wars the same way Democrats do.

""The radical left attacks those corporations by putting boycotts on them, and for some reason, Republicans and the right they don't do that,"" he said. ""The only way to stop this extremism and get radical politics out of corporate boardrooms and human resource departments is if we do to the left exactly what the left does to us.""

Trump also took potshots at some of his political enemies. He called Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., ""horrible,"" and decried moderate Republicans like Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

He called the Jan. 6 Committee an ""unselect committee of political thugs,"" attacked Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., over the allegations Trump colluded with Russia during the 2016 election and more.

"Trump edges DeSantis, Biden remains underwater: Where the 2024 race stands in polls on Presidents Day 2023","Three months into the 2024 White House race, former President Donald Trump remains the front-runner in the hunt for the GOP presidential nomination, according to an average of the latest public opinion surveys.

And as President Biden moves closer to the likely launch of a 2024 re-election campaign, his standing with Americans remains in negative territory after slipping underwater a year and a half ago, according to a key polling metric.

Biden stands at 44% approval and 52% disapproval according to an average of the latest national surveys that asked respondents about the job the president’s doing. The average, compiled by Real Clear Politics, includes both probability and non-probability based polls.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION ON PRESIDENT BIDEN

Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid 50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August 2021 in the wake of his much criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and following a surge in COVID-19 cases that summer among mainly unvaccinated people.

The plunge in the president’s approval was also fueled by soaring inflation, which started spiking in the summer of 2021, and to a lesser degree the surge of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the southern border with Mexico. The president’s numbers slightly rebounded last summer and autumn, but remain well in the red.

Biden stands far below where his three most recent two-term predecessors — former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton – stood at this point in their presidencies, as they successfully ran for re-election.

The only recent president whose approval ratings were lower than Biden’s current numbers was Trump — his most recent predecessor. Then-President Trump stood at 44%-53% in mid-February 2019, according to the Real Clear Politics average. Trump was defeated by Biden in his bid for a second term in the White House.

Trump is running a third straight time for the White House. He announced in mid-November, just days after midterms, which traditionally mark the unofficial start of a presidential election cycle.

According to an average of the latest GOP nomination horse race polls, Trump remains the front-runner in a field of actual and potential rivals. The former president registers at 46% support, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 30%.

""The early horse race comes down to just two names,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy highlighted as he pointed to Trump and DeSantis, who remains on the sidelines of the 2024 race as of now.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, who’s likely to launch a White House campaign later this year, stood at 6% support in an average of the polls, a point ahead of former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who last week joined Trump as the only major Republicans to date to have launched campaigns. Everyone else tested stood at 3% or less in the polling average.

In hypothetical 2024 general election matchups, the surveys suggest a margin of error race between Biden and Trump and the president and the Florida governor.

Trump filed the lawsuit on Friday evening, arguing that the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena is ""invalid.""

The Jan. 6 committee issued the subpoena against Trump on Oct. 21 and is requesting that he appear for a deposition on Nov. 14 at 10 a.m. to provide records in relation to actions on Jan. 6, 2021.

Specifically, the subpoena is requesting communications and documents between Trump and his aides, colleagues and staff from the encrypted messaging app Signal.

Trump files motion seeking independent review of docs seized during FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago,"Former President Trump and his legal team filed a motion Monday evening seeking an independent review of the records seized by the FBI during its ""unprecedented"" and ""unnecessary"" raid of Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, saying the decision to search his private residence just months before the 2022 midterm elections ""involved political calculations aimed at diminishing the leading voice in the Republican Party, President Trump.""

According to the motion filed Monday evening in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Trump and his legal team are seeking an order to appoint a special master to review the records obtained during the search; blocks the further review of seized materials by the government until a special master is appointed; requires the Justice Department to provide a more detailed receipt for property and requires the government to return any item seized that was not within the scope of the search warrant.

Trump said Monday evening the motion is ""strongly asserting"" his rights, ""including under the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution, regarding the unnecessary, unwarranted, and unAmerican Break-In by dozens of FBI agents, and others, of my home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida.""

""They demanded that the security cameras be turned off, a request we rightfully denied. They prevented my attorneys from observing what was being taken in the raid, saying 'absolutely not,'"" Trump said in a statement. ""They took documents covered by attorney-client and executive privilege, which is not allowed. They took my passports. They even brought a ‘safe cracker’ and successfully broke into my personal safe, which revealed…nothing!""

Trump said he is ""now demanding that the Department of 'Justice' be instructed to immediately STOP the review of documents illegally seized from my home.""

COULD THE FBI USE DOCUMENTS SEIZED AT MAR-A-LAGO RELATED TO OTHER TRUMP-LINKED PROBES?

""ALL documents have been previously declassified,"" Trump said. ""We are demanding the appointment of a SPECIAL MASTER to oversee the handling of the materials taken in the raid. We are further demanding that the DOJ be forced to turn over a REAL, without ‘plants,’ inventory of my property that was taken and disclose where that property is now located.""

Trump added that he and his legal team are ""demanding that all items wrongfully taken from my home be IMMEDIATELY returned.""

""The wrongful, overbroad warrant was signed by a Magistrate Judge who recused himself just two months ago, from a MAJOR civil suit that I filed, because of his bias and animus toward me,"" he wrote. ""This Mar-a-Lago Break-In, Search, and Seizure was illegal and unconstitutional, and we are taking all actions necessary to get the documents back, which we would have given to them without the necessity of the despicable raid of my home, so that I can give them to the National Archives until they are required for the future Donald J. Trump Presidential Library and Museum.""

He added: ""I will never stop fighting for the American people, our Country, and the Rule of Law. Make America Great Again!""

Trump and his legal team, in the motion filed Monday evening, stress that ""politics cannot be allowed to impact the administration of justice.""

""President Donald J. Trump is the clear frontrunner in the 2024 Republican Presidential Primary and in the 2024 General Election, should he decide to run,"" the motion states. ""Beyond that, his endorsement in the 2022 mid-term elections has been decisive for Republican candidates.""

Trump and his lawyers called the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago a ""shockingly aggressive move,"" saying the FBI searched the premises ""with no understanding of the distress that it would cause most Americans.""

""According to the Government, the agents seized documents, privileged and/or potentially privileged materials, and other items—including photos, handwritten notes, and even President Trump’s passports—that were outside the lawful reach of an already over broad warrant,"" the lawyers wrote, saying the raid was a ""violation of his constitutional rights,"" and they demanded the records ""be returned forthwith.""

TRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT; FROM RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO

""Law enforcement is a shield that protects Americans. It cannot be used as a weapon for political purposes,"" the motion continues. ""Therefore, we seek judicial assistance in the aftermath of an unprecedented and unnecessary raid on President Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.""

Trump's lawyers, in the motion, stated that the Justice Department ""has informed counsel for President Trump that privileged and/or potentially privileged documents were among the items taken from his home."" Fox News first reported that agents seized privileged material last week.

""But the government has refused to provide any information regarding the nature of these documents,"" the motion states, stressing that ""protecting the integrity of these documents is important not only to"" Trump ""but also to the institution of the Presidency.""

""Significantly, the Government has refused to provide President Trump with any reason for the unprecedented, general search of his home,"" the motion states. ""To date, the Government has failed to legitimize its historic decision to raid the home of a President who had been fully cooperative.""

Trump’s lawyers slammed Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying he was ""faced with public backlash"" and took the ""unheard-of step of announcing at a press conference that he was willing to release portions of a sealed search warrant application.""

Trump’s lawyers also slammed the Justice Department for ""leaks to favored media outlets,"" which have ""provided ever-changing, and inaccurate, ‘justifications’ for the politicized conduct of the FBI and the Department of Justice.""

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVES FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE FBI'S MAR-A-LAGO RAID, VOWS TO ‘HELP THE COUNTRY’

""These unsupported ‘justifications’ by anonymous sources hint at a breakdown in communications between President Trump’s representatives and the Government, or that there developed a need to obtain a search warrant,"" the motion states, adding that ""the actual chronology of events clearly establishes that there was no ‘exigency’ for a forceful raid and there is no basis for keeping information about the raid from the public.""

Trump's legal team said that in January 2022, Trump ""voluntarily"" asked the National Archives and Records Administration to come to Mar-a-Lago to receive 15 boxes of documents that had been brought by movers to Mar-a-Lago, so that they could be transferred to NARA headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Trump’s legal team said that ""sometime thereafter,"" NARA employees ""involved the White House and DOJ in the matter of the voluntarily returned 15 NARA Boxes.""

Trump was ""contacted because the 15 NARA Boxes contained documents from his Administration that were protected by executive privilege."" Trump’s lawyers say they communicated with the White House, the DOJ and NARA regarding those matters.

On May 11, Trump ""voluntarily accepted service of a grand jury subpoena addressed to the custodian of records for the Office of Donald J. Trump, seeking documents bearing classification markings.""

""President Trump determined that a search for documents bearing classification markings should be conducted—even if the marked documents had been declassified—and his staff conducted a diligent search of the boxes that had been moved from the White House to Florida.""

On June 2, Trump invited the FBI to Mar-a-Lago to ""retrieve responsive documents.""

On June 3, Jay Bratt, the chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, came to Mar-a-Lago, accompanied by three FBI agents, according to the motion.

Trump’s lawyers said the former president greeted Bratt and the agents in the dining room at Mar-a-Lago.

""Before leaving the group, President Trump's last words to Mr. Bratt and the FBI agents were as follows: ‘Whatever you need, just let us know,’"" the motion states.

""Responsive documents were provided to the FBI agents. Mr. Bratt asked to inspect a storage room. Counsel for President Trump advised the group that President Trump had authorized him to take the group to that room,"" Trump's lawyers explain. ""The group proceeded to the storage room, escorted by two Secret Service agents. The storage room contained boxes, many containing the clothing and personal items of President Trump and the First Lady.""

""When their inspection was completed, the group left the area. Once back in the dining room, one of the FBI agents said, ‘Thank you. You did not need to show us the storage room, but we appreciate it. Now it all makes sense,'"" the motion states.

The motion states that counsel for Trump closed the interaction and ""advised the Government officials that they should contact him with any further needs on the matter.""

Trump's lawyers said that on June 8, Bratt requested that the storage room be secured. In response, Trump directed his staff to ""place a second lock on the door to the storage room, and one was added.""

On June 22, according to the motion, the government sent a subpoena to the custodian of records for the Trump Organization ""seeking footage from surveillance cameras at Mar-a-Lago.""

""At President Trump's direction, service of that subpoena was voluntarily accepted, and responsive video footage was provided to the government,"" the motion states.

""Despite the voluntary assistance provided by President Trump, the Government took the unprecedented step of requesting a search warrant for his home,"" the motion states, adding that the government sought ""an expansive and intrusive search"" of Trump's private residence.

Trump’s lawyers slammed Garland for the press conference he conducted days after the search, in which he said that the Justice Department ""does not take such a decision lightly"" and stressed that ""where possible, it is standard practice to seek less intrusive means as an alternative to a search, and to narrowly scope any search that is undertaken.""

""This public statement is deeply troubling, given that President Donald J. Trump is the clear frontrunner of the 2024 Republican Presidential Primary and in the 2024 General Election, should he decide to run,"" the motion states. ""The statement clearly suggests that the decision to raid Mar-a-Lago, a mere 90 days before the 2022 midterms elections, involved political calculations aimed at diminishing the leading voice in the Republican Party, President Trump.""

Trump’s lawyers raised ""fundamental Fourth Amendment concerns,"" which provides the right of the people ""to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and on warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""

Trump’s team also slammed the warrant as ""facially over broad.""

The motion also states that the government ""has long treated President Donald J. Trump unfairly.""

""The FBI and DOJ have demonstrated a willingness to treat President Trump differently than any other citizen,"" the motion states, citing the two years of the ""noisy"" Trump-Russia investigations and more.

Trump’s lawyers demanded a special master to review the records, stressing that a DOJ ""filter team"" ""will not protect President Trump’s rights.""

""For the foregoing reasons, President Donald J. Trump respectfully requests that this Court issue an order that: appoints a Special Master; enjoins further review of seized materials by the Government until a Special Master is appointed; requires the Government to provide a more detailed Receipt for Property; and requires the Government to return any item seized that was not within the scope of the Search Warrant,"" the motion concludes.

Trump lawyers Lindsey Halligan, James Trusty and M. Evan Corcoran signed the motion.

Trump had indicated last week that he would file a major motion pertaining to the Fourth Amendment concerning the ""illegal"" break-in of his home.

BIDEN SILENT ON TRUMP MAR-A-LAGO RAID FOR 2 STRAIGHT WEEKS

""My rights, together with the rights of all Americans, have been violated at a level rarely seen before in our country,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.

The search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club earlier this month to retrieve documents from his White House years was an unprecedented law enforcement action against a former president who is widely expected to run for office once again.

Officials have not revealed exactly what was contained in the boxes, but the FBI has said it recovered 11 sets of classified records, including some marked ""sensitive compartment information,"" a special category meant to protect secrets that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to U.S. interests if revealed publicly.

Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley reacted to Trump's filing Monday in a statement: ""The Aug. 8 search warrant at Mar-a-Lago was authorized by a federal court upon the required finding of probable cause. The Department is aware of this evening’s motion. The United States will file its response in court.""

U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed the search warrant, formally ruled Monday that the Justice Department propose redactions to the original affidavit so that he can review it to determine whether it can be released to the public.

Trump to Hannity: Presidents can declassify documents 'by thinking about it',"Presidents can declassify documents on a whim, even just by ""thinking about it,"" former President Donald Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Wednesday.

Trump appeared on Hannity's show to discuss the ongoing federal investigation into classified documents found in Trump's Mar-a-Lago home during an FBI raid.

""Is there a process? What was your process to declassify?"" Hannity asked.

""There doesn't have to be a process, as I understand it,"" Trump responded. ""You know, different people say different things, but as I understand it there doesn't have to be.""

DOJ ASKS 11TH CIRCUIT FOR PARTIAL STAY, ALLOWING ATTORNEYS TO USE CLASSIFIED DOCS DURING SPECIAL MASTER REVIEW

""If you're the president of the United States you can declassify just by saying: ‘It’s declassified.' Even by thinking about it,"" he added. ""There doesn't have to be a process. There can be a process, but there doesn't have to be. You're the president, you make that decision…I declassified everything.""

NEW YORK AG SUES TRUMP OVER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

Classification is a system within the executive branch for privileging information, typically relying on three tiers: confidential, secret and top secret. Only those with proper clearance levels can handle or be told about the information in a classified document.

Declassifying documents typically follows a process in which the agency to which the information pertains is consulted. Then, an officially designated ""original classification authority"" would move to declassify the document, according to the New York Times.

While presidents do have the authority to declassify documents on their own, the relevant agencies would still have to be informed of the move for a formal declassification to take place.

The FBI found roughly 100 documents marked to varying levels of classification inside Mar-a-Lago.

The DOJ has opened a criminal investigation into Trump's handling of the files. A federal appeals court allowed investigators to continue inspecting the files in a Wednesday ruling, dealing a blow to Trump's argument that the documents were no longer classified.

Trump joins TRUTH Social: 'I'M BACK! #COVFEFE',"Former President Trump joined his own TRUTH Social on Thursday, posting on a social media platform for the first time in more than a year with a throwback to his now-infamous 2017 typo ""covfefe.""

""I’M BACK! #COVFEFE,"" Trump posted on TRUTH Social Thursday afternoon with a photo of himself in front of his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida.

The hashtag ""covfefe"" was referring to one of his deleted tweets in 2017 in which he decried the media’s coverage of his administration.

TRUMP WILL NOT RETURN TO TWITTER EVEN AS ELON MUSK PURCHASES PLATFORM, WILL BEGIN USING HIS OWN TRUTH SOCIAL

""Despite the constant negative press covfefe,"" Trump wrote in a tweet on May 30, 2017 that received more than 100,000 retweets and 100,000 likes before being deleted.

Trump, on Monday, told Fox News he would not return to Twitter, even as Elon Musk purchased the social media company and reinstates his account. Trump said he would, instead, use his own TRUTH Social as the sole platform for his voice.

Twitter, on Monday afternoon, announced it agreed to be acquired by Musk for $44 billion.

""I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH,"" Trump told Fox News. ""I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH.""

Trump told Fox News on Monday he would begin ""TRUTHing"" this week.

The Trump Media & Technology Group social media platform, TRUTH Social, formally launched last month and has been up and running under its brand-new cloud services for four days, after having beta-tested since February. Former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is the company’s CEO.

""We’re taking in millions of people, and what we’re finding is that the response on TRUTH is much better than being on Twitter,"" Trump said. ""Twitter has bots and fake accounts, and we are doing everything we can.""

He added: ""The bottom line is, no, I am not going back to Twitter.""

Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat following the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot. Twitter deemed a number of his tweets connected to the violent protests as inflammatory and warned of ""the risk of further incitement of violence.""

When asked whether a Musk-owned Twitter could be competition to TRUTH, Trump said that he feels it would be a positive development in the social media space.

""I think it is good. We want liberty and justice and fairness in our country, and the more we can have open, the better,"" Trump said. ""But no, I don’t view that as a competition for what I am doing.""

Trump lashes out at Swalwell over bill to ban former president and his associates from US Capitol,"Former President Trump lashed out at Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., on Thursday after he sponsored a bill that would ban Trump and several of his associates from the U.S. Capitol building.

That bill, introduced by Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., with Swalwell as the sole co-sponsor, would bar Trump from the halls of Congress because his ""effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election damaged the functions of our democracy.""

Trump responded on Thursday by mocking Swalwell for losing his spot on the House Intelligence Committee and accusing him of ""falling desperately in love with a Chinese spy, Fang Fang.""

""This idiot is now calling (for publicity purposes only!) for some Great American Patriots, including me, to be banned from the Capitol,"" Trump said in a statement on Thursday.

Axios originally reported in December 2020 that a Chinese intelligence operative helped raise funds for Swalwell's 2014 re-election campaign and placed at least one intern in his office.

Swalwell has denied wrongdoing, telling The View last month that he immediately cut her off after receiving a briefing from the FBI.

WHERE THE 2024 WHITE HOUSE RACE STANDS ON PRESIDENT'S DAY 2023

His office also defended the bill to ban Trump from the U.S. Capitol on Thursday.

""When the village nearly burns down, we don’t invite the arsonist back to visit,"" Jessica Gail, Swalwell's communications director, told Fox News Digital.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., cited Swalwell's association with the Chinese spy in kicking him off the House Intelligence Committee.

""It wasn't just us who were concerned about it, the FBI was concerned about putting a member of Congress on the Intel committee that has the rights to see things that others don't, because of his knowledge and relationship with a Chinese spy,"" McCarthy told reporters last month.

MCCARTHY CONFIRMS SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR WILL LOSE COMMITTEE SEATS

""In a time of silence and lies,"" a video Trump posted to the platform Tuesday night says. The video then plays news reports describing his suspension from Twitter.

""A beacon of freedom arises. A place to speak freely and safely,"" the video continues, showing the new platform. ""Straight from the desk of Donald J. Trump.""

The technology appears to be powered by Campaign Nucleus— the ""digital ecosystem made for efficiently managing political campaigns and organizations,"" created by his former campaign manager, Brad Parscale.

The space allows Trump to post, and allows followers to share the former president’s posts to Twitter and Facebook, however, the new platform does not have a feature to allow users to ""reply"" or engage with Trump’s posts.

""This is just a one-way communication,"" one source familiar with the space told Fox News. ""This system allows Trump to communicate with his followers.""

The site has a sign-up list for people to enter their phone numbers and email addresses in order to receive alerts for when Trump posts a new message.

Trump’s new platform surfaced Tuesday, after advisers had told Fox News that the former president planned to ""move forward"" to create a social media platform of his own after being banned from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat after the Capitol riot.

TRUMP, GOP CANDIDATES EMBRACE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM TO PROTECT FROM 'CANCEL CULTURE'

""President Trump’s website is a great resource to find his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office, but this is not a new social media platform,"" senior advisor Jason Miller told Fox News. ""We’ll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.""

The rollout of the platform also comes just a day before Facebook's Oversight Board is expected to announce its decision on whether to indefinitely suspend Trump from Facebook and Instagram.

The board in January accepted a case referral from Facebook to examine the ban, as well as to provide policy recommendations on suspensions when the user is a political leader.

Facebook moved to block Trump ""indefinitely"" after the Jan. 6 riot in the U.S. Capitol, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that they ""believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.""

Regardless of Facebook’s decision Wednesday a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News that Trump is permanently suspended from tweeting.

Trump leads Biden in hypothetical rematch in 2024: Poll,"Former President Trump has a three-point lead over President Biden in a hypothetical rematch in 2024, according to an Emerson College poll.

The poll was released on Tuesday and shows Trump with a 44% to 41% lead over Biden in the hypothetical matchup.

43% of people surveyed in the poll hold the economy as their top issue, followed by healthcare at 13%, immigration at 11%, threats to democracy at 10%, and crime at 7%.

In the Republican primary, the poll found that Trump leads Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis 55% to 29%, with Mike Pence getting 6% among Republican voters and Nikki Haley getting 3% of support.

PENCE CLASSIFIED DOCS DISCOVERY SHOWS NO ONE WILL BE CHARGED: EX-FEDERAL PROSECUTOR

Since Emerson's November poll, support for DeSantis has increased by 4% while Trump's support has stayed the same.

There is an age and educational divide within the Republican primary. Young Republican voters under 35 break for Trump over DeSantis, 73% to 13%, whereas college educated voters break for DeSantis over Trump 40% to 33%,"" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.

Trump 'loves the idea of testifying' before Jan. 6 committee: source close to the former president,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Donald Trump ""loves the idea of testifying"" before the House select committee investigating January 6th, a source close to Trump told Fox News Digital just after the panel unanimously voted to subpoena him.

The source said that if Trump complied with the subpoena and testified, he would ""talk about how corrupt the election was, how corrupt the committee was, and how Nancy Pelosi did not call up the National Guard that Trump strongly recommended for her to do three days earlier on January 3, 2021.""

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SUBPOENAED BY JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE

The source told Fox News Digital that it is unclear at this point if Trump actually will testify before the committee, but stressed that Trump ""loves the idea.""

The committee — which consists of seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans — voted Thursday to compel Trump to testify about his conduct leading up to and during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Thursday, Trump slammed the committee and its investigation as a ""witch hunt.""

""The committee is a hoax, a sham, a partisan witch hunt which is a continuation of the witch hunt that has gone on since the great day for our country that I came down the golden escalator with our future first lady,"" Trump said. ""They have no case, they have no ratings, so they have to try to do this to get publicity.""

REPUBLICANS PLANNING TO RELEASE OWN REPORT ON JANUARY 6 SECURITY FAILINGS

Trump did not comment on whether he would testify before the committee.

Trump told Fox News Digital that the investigation has been ""a partisan witch hunt, together with two Republicans that have been thrown out of the party — one not wanting to run because he couldn’t win; and another losing by a record number of more than 40 points.""

Trump was referring to Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who lost her primary earlier this year, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who decided not to run for re-election.

Trump told Fox News Digital that the committee ""never covered the important subject of election fraud, or why Pelosi and the mayor of D.C. did not call up the National Guard — which I strongly recommended.""

""They didn’t cover the reason for January 6 — the largest crowd — it wasn’t set up by me,"" Trump said. ""The committee didn’t cover election fraud, which was massive, and they didn't cover why Pelosi didn’t call the National Guard.""

Trump said that he had recommended that Pelosi and the mayor of Washington call up the National Guard on Jan. 6 because he ""felt the crowd was going to be far bigger than anyone understood.""



""They didn’t do their job. I believed the crowd was going to be bigger — just my instinct — and they had the chance to call up the National Guard three days before Jan. 6, and if they did, Jan. 6 would have been a very different day,"" Trump said. ""But they didn’t do it.""

JAN. 6 HEARING TO RECREATE TRUMP'S STATE OF MIND DURING RIOT WITHOUT TESTIMONY BY FORMER PRESIDENT, TOP ALLIES

He added: ""They were derelict in their duty. I gave them the authorization and the recommendation to call up the National Guard.""

Lawmakers on the House Committee on Jan. 6 have been investigating the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and allege that Trump’s insistence that the 2020 election was stolen stoked the violence as Congress convened to certify the Electoral College votes.

Hours before the riot, Trump held a rally in Washington, D.C., in which he encouraged his supporters to protest President Biden's Electoral College certification. Trump told his followers during that speech to protest ""peacefully and patriotically,"" but, in the weeks leading up to the certification, suggested the rally would be ""wild.""

Trump's spokesman Taylor Budowich tweeted after the vote Thursday that just 26 days before the midterm elections, ""instead of using their final days in power to make life for Americans any better, Democrats are doubling and tripling down on their partisan theatrics. Democrats have no solutions and they have no interest in leading our great nation.""

""They are simply bitter, power hungry & desperate,"" Budowich tweeted. ""Pres Trump will not be intimidated by their meritless rhetoric or un-American actions.""

He added: ""Trump-endorsed candidates will sweep the Midterms, and America First leadership & solutions will be restored. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

The vote to subpoena Trump came during the committee’s 10th and likely final public hearing before the November midterm elections. Originally, the televised hearing was meant to only showcase new evidence and summarize findings from the committee’s nearly 16-month-long investigation.

""This is a question about accountability to the American people,"" said committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ""He's required to answer to those millions of Americans whose votes he tried to throw out as part of his scheme to remain in power.""

""We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion,"" said Cheney. ""Every American is entitled to those answers, so we can act now to protect our republic.""

Members of the committee said they had garnered sufficient evidence showing that the former president was the lead instigator of the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

""We must seek the testimony under oath of Jan. 6th's key player,"" said Cheney.

Trump could fight the subpoena, which likely would tip off a legal fight with just over two months left in the current Congress — a very short time frame for such a major legal dispute. If Republicans take over the House in the midterms, it's not expected they will continue the work of the Jan. 6 committee.

There was an effort by Congress in the 1840s to subpoena former Presidents John Tyler and John Quincy Adams over clandestine intelligence issues. They never provided information.

There was also an effort by the Committee on Un-American Activities to subpoena former President Harry Truman after he was out of office. He ultimately did not comply.

Trump mocks DeSantis at Pennsylvania rally: 'Ron DeSanctimonious',"Former President Donald Trump took a swipe at Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis at a rally on Saturday night referring to him as ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" in what could be a sign of growing tension between the two potential presidential candidates.

""We’re winning big in the Republican Party for the nomination like nobody’s ever seen before,"" Trump told a crowd in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night before going down the list of other Republicans who could potentially challenge him in 2024.

""There it is, Trump at 71%, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10%,"" Trump told the crowd while reading approval numbers of various Republicans.

""Mike Pence at 7, oh, Mike is doing better than I thought,"" Trump continued. ""Liz Cheney there’s no way she’s at 4%. There’s no way. There’s no way. But we’re at 71 to 10 to 7 to 4.""

AS DESANTIS SAILS TOWARD RE-ELECTION, FLORIDA NEWSPAPERS ENDORSE CRIST IN HOPES OF OUSTING 'BULLY' GOVERNOR

The jab from Trump comes as the two are widely considered the two top Republican contenders to clinch the Republican presidential nomination and reports have circulated about possible growing tension between the two camps.

DeSantis dismissed rumors of a rift between him and Trump earlier this year saying that Trump is a ""friend of mine.""

""He wants to see Republicans doing well,"" DeSantis told Fox News in February. ""And I think when media is trying to act like he's upset at me for doing well, I think that's total bunk. I think they're just making it up.""

TRUMP ELEVATING LANGUAGE AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS SIGNALING A 2024 WHITE HOUSE RUN, ADVISERS SAY

Over the last few months, Trump routinely outperforms DeSantis in polls of Republican voters ahead of 2024, but the governor remains Trump's most prominent potential rival.

A presidential straw poll at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit found that 78.7% of attendees favored Trump to be the Republican nominee in 2024. Another straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in August found that Trump had 69% support from attendees to run in 2024. DeSantis came in with just 24% support.

FLORIDA POLL SHOWS DESANTIS, RUBIO WITH DOUBLE-DIGIT LEADS OVER CRIST, DEMINGS

Trump publicly voiced displeasure with DeSantis last month after the Florida Republican endorsed Colorado Republican Senate candidate Joe O'Dea despite O'Dea's vocal criticism of Trump.

""A BIG MISTAKE!"" Trump posted on Truth Social in response to the move.

Trump will be attending a rally in Florida to support Florida Republican Marco Rubio on Sunday in Miami at an event that Fox News reported did not include an invitation for DeSantis, despite his immense popularity with Republicans in the state.

Trump has not yet said whether he plans to run for president, but many political experts believe he will make the announcement shortly after Tuesday's midterm elections.

DeSantis refused to say during a debate last month whether he will run in 2024 fueling speculation that he is considering throwing his hat in the ring.

Representatives for DeSantis and Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

"Trump nominated for Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian official, citing Israel-UAE peace deal","EXCLUSIVE: Just weeks after helping to broker peace between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), President Trump has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize.

The nomination submitted by Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament, lauded Trump for his efforts toward resolving protracted conflicts worldwide.

“For his merit, I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees,” Tybring-Gjedde, a four-term member of Parliament who also serves as chairman of the Norwegian delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, told Fox News in an exclusive interview.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL, UAE

Tybring-Gjedde, in his nomination letter to the Nobel Committee, said the Trump administration has played a key role in the establishment of relations between Israel and the UAE. “As it is expected other Middle Eastern countries will follow in the footsteps of the UAE, this agreement could be a game changer that will turn the Middle East into a region of cooperation and prosperity,” he wrote.

Also cited in the letter was the president’s “key role in facilitating contact between conflicting parties and … creating new dynamics in other protracted conflicts, such as the Kashmir border dispute between India and Pakistan, and the conflict between North and South Korea, as well as dealing with the nuclear capabilities of North Korea.”

Tybring-Gjedde, further, praised Trump for withdrawing a large number of troops from the Middle East. “Indeed, Trump has broken a 39-year-old streak of American Presidents either starting a war or bringing the United States into an international armed conflict. The last president to avoid doing so was Peace Prize laureate Jimmy Carter,” he wrote.

This is not Trump’s first such nomination, as Tybring-Gjedde submitted one along with another Norwegian official in 2018 following the U.S. president’s Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un. Japan’s prime minister reportedly did the same. Trump did not win.

Tybring-Gjedde, a member of a conservative-leaning populist party in Norway, told Fox News that his latest nomination is not about trying to curry favor with the U.S. president.

KUSHNER TOUTS PEACE AGREEMENT

“I’m not a big Trump supporter,” he said. “The committee should look at the facts and judge him on the facts – not on the way he behaves sometimes. The people who have received the Peace Prize in recent years have done much less than Donald Trump. For example, Barack Obama did nothing.”

The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to then-President Barack Obama for what the Nobel Committee called his ""extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.""

That decision made just nine months into Obama’s first term was met with criticism in the U.S. – including from Donald Trump, then a private citizen. Lech Walesa, Poland’s former president and a 1983 Nobel laureate, also said at the time it was too early to bestow the award on Obama -- just 263 days after taking office: “Too fast. For the time being Obama’s just making proposals. But sometimes the Nobel Committee awards the prize to encourage responsible action.”

Even Obama was taken aback, saying at the time he was “surprised and humbled” by the Nobel Committee’s decision. “To be honest,” he said, “I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who have been honored by this prize, men and women who’ve inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.”

Besides Obama, three other U.S. presidents have won the Nobel Peace Prize: President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 for “having negotiated peace in the Russo-Japanese war”; President Woodrow Wilson in 1920 for being the “leading architect of the League of Nations”; and President Jimmy Carter in 2002 for “his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts.”

"Trump officially recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, orders embassy move for US","President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying it's time to ""acknowledge the obvious"" as he ordered the State Department to begin moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

“I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,” the president said during a speech in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.

The move fulfills a campaign promise made to religious conservatives. But it could also inflame tensions across the Middle East.

“This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality,"" Trump said. ""It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.”

'I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.' — President Trump

Trump acknowledged the opposition from other countries in the Middle East to his decision, saying Vice President Mike Pence will be “traveling to the region” in the coming days.

“There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” Trump said. “But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and place far greater in understanding and cooperation.”

WHY TRUMP’S PROMISE TO MOVE U.S. EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IS SO CONTROVERSIAL

During his remarks, Trump emphasized he is still committed to a peace deal between the two sides.

“This decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement,"" he said. ""We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”

The U.S. would be the first country to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Other countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel keep their embassies in Tel Aviv.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that Trump's decision was ""acknowledging something that’s common sense to everyone.""

""The [Knesset] is there, the prime minister is there, the Supreme Court -- that is the capital,"" Haley said. ""And by us putting the embassy there, that’s a U.S. decision.""

But the embassy move would not be immediate and could take at least three or four years.

The U.S. officials said there are currently about 1,000 personnel in the embassy in Tel Aviv. They added that there is no facility in Jerusalem ready to serve as the embassy site, and it will take time to address security, design and cost concerns.

“This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers and planners so that a new embassy when completed will be a magnificent tribute to peace,” Trump said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a televised message, thanked Trump for what he called a “courageous and just” decision.

“This decision reflects the president’s commitment to an ancient but enduring truth,” Netanyahu said. “The president’s decision is an important step toward peace, for there is no peace that doesn’t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”

He stressed there would be no change in the status quo at the holy sites and Israel will ensure “freedom of worship” for all faiths.

Ahead of the announcement, Trump spoke Tuesday with Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas, Jordanian King Abdullah and Netanyahu.

Abbas has warned of the “gravity of consequences” should the move become official for “the peace process and security and stability in the region and world.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that recognizing the capital as Jerusalem was a “red line” for Muslims, and such an action could result in Turkey severing diplomatic ties with Israel.

""Courage doesn’t come by doing what everybody else says,"" Haley told Fox News Wednesday night. ""Courage comes by doing what you know is right. This is the right thing to do and what the president’s doing is he’s showing leadership.""

The controversy surrounding the move of the embassy dates back decades. A law passed in 1995 under the Clinton administration considers Jerusalem the capital, and even mandates the move of the embassy there.

But the law allows for a loophole used by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama – an option to issue waivers every six months to delay the move from Tel Aviv.

Trump also took advantage of the loophole, which Republicans have long called to be closed. Trump’s first waiver was signed in June, which drew praise from the Palestinians and some disappointment from Israel.

The administration officials said Tuesday that Trump will still sign a waiver to keep from jeopardizing State Department funding while the relocation process begins.

"Trump praises Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, says ruling 'will work out for everybody'","EXCLUSIVE: Former President Donald Trump praised the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade Friday, telling Fox News that the ruling ""will work out for everybody.""

""This is following the Constitution, and giving rights back when they should have been given long ago,"" Trump told Fox News.

LIVE UPDATES: SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION

When asked if he had a message for any of his supporters who may be pro-choice, Trump told Fox News: ""I think, in the end, this is something that will work out for everybody.""

""This brings everything back to the states where it has always belonged,"" Trump said.

When asked whether he feels he played a role in the reversal of Roe v. Wade, after having appointed three conservative justices to the high court, the former president told Fox News: ""God made the decision.""

Trump, during his presidency, appointed conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.

With those appointments, the high court became majority conservative, with Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Clarence Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett.

SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION

Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elana Kagan, all appointed by Democrats, dissented the majority opinion Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The ruling came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which centered on a Mississippi law that banned abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Republican-led state of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court ruling that stopped the 15-week abortion ban from taking place.

""We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the court's opinion.

Alito's opinion began with an exploration and criticism of Roe v. Wade and its holding that while states have ""a legitimate interest in protecting ‘potential life,'' this interest was not strong enough to prohibit abortions before the time of fetal viability, understood to be at about 23 weeks into pregnancy.

""The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning,"" Alito wrote.

Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor dissented, writing that Roe and Casey ""understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue,"" and by overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, a woman ""has no rights to speak of.""

""The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different views about the 'moral[ity]' of 'terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage,'"" they wrote. ""And the Court recognized that 'the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting' the 'life of the fetus that may become a child.'""

MORE THAN 2 DOZEN STATES TO RESTRICT ABORTIONS AFTER ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED

""So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete,"" they wrote. ""It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life or health.""

""Today, the Court discards that balance,"" they wrote. ""It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.""

""With sorrow--for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection--we dissent,"" they wrote.

"Trump raid linked to DOJ, National Archives probe into classified docs allegedly taken to Mar-a-Lago","Former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home was raided by the FBI Monday morning in an unprecedented move by the bureau, and one connected to an investigation into records Trump allegedly took with him from the White House to his private residence when he left office in January 2021.

Earlier this year, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) said Trump took 15 boxes of presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. Those boxes allegedly contained ""classified national security information,"" and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

NARA notified Congress in February that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and ""identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes.""

The National Archives and Records Administration describes itself as ""the nation's record keeper.""

""Of all documents and materials created in the course of business conducted by the United States federal government, only 1%-3% are so important for legal or historical reasons that they are kept by us forever,"" the NARA website states.

FBI RAIDS TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO: 'UNPRECEDENTED' FOR AGENCY TO EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT

The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires presidential administrations to preserve certain documents.

Under the law, all White House staff must copy or forward any presidential records created on non-official electronic messaging accounts to their official electronic messaging account within 20 days of leaving office.

According to a 2017 memorandum issued by the White House counsel's office under the Trump administration, ""any employee who intentionally fails to take these actions may be subject to administrative or even criminal penalties.""

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives didn’t ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request.""

""The National Archives did not ‘find’ anything, they were given, upon request, Presidential Records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a statement at the time, adding that Democrats ""are in search of their next Scam.""

The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS

The FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago took place early Monday morning, when Trump was in New York City.

An FBI source confirmed that FBI agents from Washington, D.C., who are on the bureau's Evidence Response Team, conducted the raid and notified the Miami Field Office just before.

Per standard protocol, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland were aware of the raid even if shortly before and would have been fully briefed.

A White House official told Fox News it did not have any notice of the reported action and referred all additional questions to the DOJ.

A source familiar told Fox News that agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office and safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

GOP SLAMS 'WEAPONIZATION' OF DOJ AFTER TRUMP'S MAR-A-LAGO RAIDED BY FBI; DEMS CALL IT 'ACCOUNTABILITY'

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said FBI agents likely seized documents without inquiring if they were classified, declassified or personal to Trump.

""The Justice Department had no right to seize them indiscriminately because some may not be classified and others may be classified above their level,"" he said. ""There are things that have been declassified by the president, which the Justice Department doesn't know about.""

Dershowitz slammed the unprecedented raid of the former president’s home, and questioned the bureau’s decision to execute a search warrant, rather than issue a subpoena for the records in question.

""There was no reason not to issue a subpoena returnable tomorrow, so that there's no claim that Trump could've destroyed anything,"" Dershowitz told Fox News. ""This should've been a subpoena, not a search warrant.""

He added: ""If it is a search warrant, it has to have a high level of cause demonstrating that the evidence would have been destroyed.""

Legal scholars note that when individuals previously violated the law regarding classified documents, the Justice Department has opted to either not prosecute or settle for lesser charges.

""The Presidential Records Act is not commonly a subject of criminal prosecution, even in the most egregious cases,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""These incidents have generally been handled administratively.""

Trump made the raid public Monday evening, saying in a lengthy statement that ""nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.""

""After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said.

Trump roasted after 'major announcement' turns out to be digital trading cards,"Former President Donald Trump was mocked across social media Thursday after hyping up a ""major announcement"" that turned out to be digital trading cars with his face superimposed onto them.

Trump first teased the announcement Wednesday on his Truth Social account, cryptically hinting that ""America needs a superhero!"" Come Thursday, Trump unveiled official Donald Trump Digital Trading Cards, posting an image of a chiseled likeness of himself wearing an American flag-style Superman outfit.

Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former aid to Trump turned one of his top critics, took the opportunity to compare how Trump was spending his day to how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was.

DeSantis is widely considered Trump's top Republican rival as the former president seeks to run for president a third time in 2024, even though DeSantis hasn't announced his candidacy.

While Trump was announcing his card collection, DeSantis was signing legislation cutting traffic tolls for commuters.

New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman noted Trump's longtime obsession with picturing himself as superman.

""The speculation from other [Republicans] and even some Dems was rampant that the ‘major announcement’ would be about his campaign or [Kevin] McCarthy. But, instead it's a quick money-making opportunity trussed up with a meme,"" she wrote.

"Trump says Biden 'betrayed Israel and the Jewish community,' vowed to strengthen relations if elected in 2024","Former President Trump said Saturday that he is ""proud to be the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House,"" declared that President Biden has ""betrayed Israel and the Jewish community,"" and vowed that, if re-elected in 2024, the United States will ""stand with"" the Jewish state ""once again.""

Trump, addressing the Republican Jewish Coalition annual conference via satellite on Saturday, just days after announcing his 2024 presidential campaign, warned that the Biden administration is ""destroying our nation before our very eyes.""

""We have to push back hard on every overreach and call out every single failure, of which there’s so many, and then we have to take back the White House in 2024 — that’s imperative,"" Trump said, promising to ""revitalize our alliances with our close friend and ally, the State of Israel.""

DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES 2024 RE-ELECTION RUN FOR PRESIDENT

""The alliance is not strong now, not even strong by a little bit,"" Trump said. ""Under my administration, we fought for Israel and the Jewish community like no president in history.""

He added: ""Everybody in the room knows that I was proud to be the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House.""

Trump said that while ""working together with all of you, I have kept my promises, officially recognizing the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.""

In 2018, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – a relocation long debated in Washington – and one that showed the U.S. officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

FLASHBACK: US OPENS EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM, RECOGNIZING CITY AS ‘TRUE CAPITAL’ OF ISRAEL

""I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that most people didn't even ask me to do because they felt it was impossible — 52 years they were working on that — I got it done in one day,"" Trump said — met by laughter and applause.

""I withdrew the United States from the corrupt hypocritical U.N. Human Rights Council, which had allowed the world and in the most horrific human rights abusers, to attack the United States and to attack Israel,"" he continued. ""I withdrew from the one-sided Iran nuclear deal and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime.""

Trump, in a swipe at President Biden, said he ""would never allow the State of Israel to be threatened with nuclear destruction like it's happening right now.""

TRUMP OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES JERUSALEM AS ISRAEL'S CAPITAL, ORDERS EMBASSY MOVE FOR US

""Working with our Israeli allies, we destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate — 100% of it,"" he continued, adding that he ""appointed a special envoy to combat the scourge of antisemitism worldwide.""

Trump also celebrated his administration’s brokering of the Abraham Accords — a ""historic peace agreement"" between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding ""investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit.""

BIDEN YET TO CALL NETANYAHU AFTER ELECTION WIN DESPITE CALLS TO CHALLENGER, PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT

""With the historic Abraham Accords, we created peace in the Middle East, something that nobody thought would even be possible to say, let alone get it done,"" Trump said.

""Tragically, Joe Biden has betrayed Israel and the Jewish community and squandered our amazing success,"" Trump continued, adding that from the ""very beginning"" of the Biden administration, Biden ""sold out Israel’s security and began begging to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal on even worse terms.""

TRUMP ANNOUNCES 'HISTORIC PEACE AGREEMENT' BETWEEN ISRAEL, UAE

""It was a disaster before, but these would be even worse terms,"" Trump said.

The Biden administration has been in negotiations with Tehran to re-enter the Iran Nuclear Deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, for months. The deal would give Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for its agreement to roll back its nuclear program to limits set in the 2015 deal — which includes caps on enrichment and how much material it can stockpile.

""When we win in 2024, the era of backstabbing and betrayal will end and the United States will stand with Israel once more and just as it did in my administration — two years ago, we were a great nation,"" Trump said. ""And soon, with the help of the Republican Jewish Coalition and patriots all across this land, we will be a great nation again.""

Trump 'will do whatever' he can to 'help the country' after FBI raid: 'Temperature has to be brought down',"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said he ""will do whatever"" he can ""to help the country"" after the FBI’s raid of his Mar-a-Lago home last week, telling Fox News Digital that the ""temperature has to be brought down"" while stressing that the American people are ""not going to stand for another scam.""

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Monday morning, his first since the raid, Trump said he had his representatives reach out to the Justice Department to offer to help amid outrage over the FBI’s unprecedented raid on his private residence last week, in which agents seized classified records, including some marked as top secret. Trump is disputing the classification of those records, saying the records have been declassified.

""The country is in a very dangerous position. There is tremendous anger, like I've never seen before, over all of the scams, and this new one — years of scams and witch hunts, and now this,"" Trump said.

FBI SEIZES PRIVILEGED TRUMP RECORDS DURING RAID; DOJ OPPOSES REQUEST FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW: SOURCES

""If there is anything we can do to help, I, and my people, would certainly be willing to do that,"" Trump said.

""There has never been a time like this where law enforcement has been used to break into the house of a former president of the United States, and there is tremendous anger in the country — at a level that has never been seen before, other than during very perilous times,"" Trump said.

Trump told Fox News that his team ""has not heard yet"" from the Justice Department on whether they will accept his offer for help.

""I think they would want the same thing — I’ve never seen anything like this,"" Trump said. ""It is a very dangerous time for our country.""

He added: ""I will do whatever I can to help the country.""

Trump, reflecting on the ""years of fake witch hunts and phony Russia, Russia, Russia schemes and scams,"" said that ""nothing happens to those people who perpetuate that — nothing happens with them.""

""And then they break into a president’s house — a sneak attack where it was totally — no one ever thought a thing like this would happen,"" Trump said.

TRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT; FROM RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO

Trump told Fox News that FBI agents ""break in and take whatever they want to take.""

Trump said FBI agents told his team on the Mar-a-Lago premises to ""turn off the camera"" and said ""no one can go through the rooms.""

""They could take anything they want, and put anything they want in,"" Trump said of the FBI agents. ""My people were asked to stand outside.""

Trump went on to suggest that the FBI ""could have planted anything they wanted"" during the raid.

""People are so angry at what is taking place,"" Trump said. ""Whatever we can do to help — because the temperature has to be brought down in the country. If it isn’t, terrible things are going to happen.""

He added: ""The people of this country are not going to stand for another scam.""

Following the FBI’s execution of the search warrant at Trump’s home, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a bulletin to law enforcement agencies warning of increased threats.

FBI BULLETIN WARNS OF 'DIRTY BOMB' THREAT, INCREASING CALLS FOR 'CIVIL WAR' AFTER RAID OF MAR-A-LAGO

In the days since the warrant was executed, the FBI and DHS have seen an increase in ""violent threats"" against law enforcement, judiciary and government personnel, including a particular threat to ""place a so-called Dirty Bomb in front of FBI headquarters,"" according to the bulletin.

""General calls"" for ""civil war"" and ""armed rebellion"" have also increased in recent days on social media.

Several of the threats are specific, according to the bulletin, which states that ""the FBI and DHS have identified multiple articulated threats and calls for the targeted killing of judicial law enforcement and government officials associated with the Palm Beach search, including the Federal judge who approved the Palm Beach search warrant.""

The threat warning comes after U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart unsealed the FBI’s search warrant and property receipt from the FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago. Reinhart signed the warrant on Aug. 5, giving the FBI authority to conduct its search.

According to the property receipt, reviewed before its release by Fox News Digital, FBI agents took approximately 20 boxes of items from the premises, including one set of documents marked as ""Various classified/TS/SCI documents,"" which refers to top secret/sensitive compartmented information.

Records covered by that government classification level could potentially include human intelligence and information that, if disclosed, could jeopardize relations between the United States and other nations, as well as the lives of intelligence operatives abroad. However, the classification also encompasses national security information related to the daily operations of the president of the United States.

The property receipt also shows that FBI agents collected four sets of top secret documents, three sets of secret documents and three sets of confidential documents.

FBI SEIZED CLASSIFIED RECORDS FROM MAR-A-LAGO DURING SEARCH OF TRUMP RESIDENCE

The property receipt does not reveal any details about any of those records.

The list also includes a ""leatherbound box of documents,"" binders of photos, handwritten notes, miscellaneous documents, miscellaneous top secret documents, miscellaneous confidential documents and other records.

The government conducted the search in response to what it believes to be a violation of federal laws: 18 USC 793 — Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information; 18 USC 2071 — Concealment, removal or mutilation; and 18 USC 1519 — Destruction, alteration or falsification of records in Federal investigations.

The allegation of ""gathering, transmitting or losing defense information"" falls under the Espionage Act.

The former president and his team, though, are disputing the classification and say they believe the information and records to have been declassified.

Sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital that the FBI also seized boxes containing records covered by attorney-client privilege and potentially executive privilege during its raid.

Sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News Saturday that the former president’s team was informed that boxes labeled A-14, A-26, A-43, A-13, A-33, as well as a set of documents — all seen on the final page of the FBI’s property receipt — contained information covered by attorney-client privilege.

Attorney-client privilege refers to a legal privilege that keeps communications between an attorney and their client confidential.

Sources told Fox News Digital that some records could be covered by executive privilege, which gives the president of the United States and other officials within the executive branch the authority to withhold certain sensitive forms of advice and consultation between the president and senior advisers.

It is unclear, at this point, if the records include communications between the former president and his private attorneys, White House counsel during the Trump administration, or a combination.

Sources told Fox News that, due to attorney-client privilege, Trump’s team asked the Justice Department for their position on whether they would support a third party, independent special master to review those records, but sources told Fox News that the DOJ notified Trump's team that they would oppose that request.

The Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment.

Meanwhile, sources close to Trump told Fox News that the former president will soon be making an announcement about a potential presidential run in 2024.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-he-will-do-whatever-he-can-to-help-the-country-after-fbi-raid,N/A
Trump says Mar-a-Lago home in Florida 'under siege' by FBI agents,"Former President Trump on Monday said that his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida was ""under siege"" by a ""large group"" of FBI agents conducting a search warrant.

""Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate,"" Trump said. ""It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections.""

""Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before,"" Trump said, alleging that the FBI agents broke into his safe.

""What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee?"" he said. ""Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States.""

Trump made a vague reference to the events of Monday during a tele-rally for Sarah Palin, the former Alaskan governor who is now running for Congress.

""Another day in paradise,"" Trump said. ""This is a strange day - you probably all read about it, but very important,"" he added before continuing with his remarks.

DOJ REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S CONDUCT, CONVERSATIONS AS PART OF 2020 ELECTION PROBE

A source familiar told Fox News that the raid occurred early this morning. The source said agents brought a ""safe cracker"" and cracked a ""relatively new"" safe in Mar-a-Lago. The source told Fox News there was ""nothing in it.""

Multiple sources tell Fox News the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago is related to the materials Trump allegedly brought to his private residence after his presidency concluded. That matter was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

WHAT IS MAR-A-LAGO? A LOOK INSIDE TRUMP'S FLORIDA ESTATE

Federal law bars the removal of classified documents to unauthorized locations, though it is possible that Trump could try to argue that, as president, he was the ultimate declassification authority.

A source familiar told Fox News that FBI agents went to Mar-a-Lago and looked in every single office, safe, and grabbed documents and boxes without going through them on the property. They took boxes and documents to go through them later.

""They were not being judicious about what they took,"" the source told Fox News.

HUGH HEWITT ON RAID OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HOME: A 'BLOCKBUSTER' MOMENT

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, one of many criticizing the raid, called it ""an unprecedented political weaponization of the Justice Department.""

""They've been after President Trump as a candidate, as President, and now as a former President,"" Noem tweeted. ""Using the criminal justice system in this manner is un-American.""

The Republican National Committee (RNC) slammed the raid as a double standard.

""Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Countless times we have examples of Democrats flouting the law and abusing power with no recourse,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""Democrats continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans. This raid is outrageous. This abuse of power must stop and the only way to do that is to elect Republicans in November.""

Trump was in New York City when the raid was carried out and is now headed to Bedminster, Fox News has learned. An FBI source confirmed that FBI agents from Washington, D.C. who are on the bureau's Evidence Response Team conducted the raid and notified the Miami Field Office just before.

Per standard protocol, FBI Director Wray and Attorney General Garland were aware of the raid even if shortly before and would have been fully briefed.

A White House official told Fox News it did not have any notice of the reported action and referred all additional questions to the DOJ.

A separate investigation into efforts by Trump allies to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol has intensified in Washington in recent weeks, particularly with the January 6 congressional committee holding hearings to reveal its findings.

Trump says Republicans have 'good chance of big success' on Election Day,"FIRST ON FOX: Former President Trump has played a major role in the 2022 midterms, endorsing and raising nearly $350 million for more than 300 Republican candidates, while rallying support for them in more than a dozen states across the nation — and teasing his 2024 plans on the eve of Election Day in an effort to energize the GOP base.

Trump, during a rally Monday night, teased that he will announce his third White House bid on Tuesday, Nov. 15 from Mar-a-Lago — one week after Election Day.

""I think it is going to be very interesting, maybe the most interesting midterm they’ve ever had,"" Trump said Monday night after the rally. ""I think we have a good chance of big success.""

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

In the Senate, Trump-endorsed candidates were 21-0 during their primaries. Trump and his team have touted that the former president’s endorsement helped catapult those candidates to first place in their primary contests.

In Ohio, before Trump endorsed JD Vance in April, he was polling in 5th place for the Republican nomination, but Trump’s endorsement led him to primary victory in a competitive contest.

In Arizona, before Trump endorsed Blake Masters in June, he was polling in 3rd place, but Trump’s support led to Masters’ primary victory in a crowded primary field.

Additionally in Pennsylvania, before Trump’s endorsement of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former television star was trailing his opponent as well. Oz also won the nomination after Trump’s endorsement.

Other primary victories and candidates Trump is credited with include Herschel Walker in Georgia, Ted Budd in North Carolina and Adam Laxalt in Nevada.

TRUMP SAYS HE WILL MAKE A 'BIG ANNOUNCEMENT' ON NOVEMBER 15

Trump also endorsed GOP incumbent senators, including Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Jerry Moran of Kansas, John Hoeven of North Dakota, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

In the House, Trump and his team have touted the former president’s early endorsements of dozens of GOP hopefuls, which they say enabled those new Republican candidates to win their primaries and compete in the general election. Trump also endorsed dozens of incumbent congressmen and congresswomen.

As for gubernatorial races, Trump endorsed GOP candidates Kari Lake for Arizona; Tudor Dixon for Michigan; Lee Zeldin for New York; Mike DeWine for Ohio and more.

Trump and his team also are touting the power of his endorsement in those key gubernatorial races — specifically in Lake’s race, Kevin Stitt in Oklahoma and Derek Schmidt in Kansas.

TRUMP ELEVATING LANGUAGE AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS SIGNALING A 2024 WHITE HOUSE RUN, ADVISERS SAY

However, while underscoring how his support has helped nearly every GOP candidate up for election this cycle, Trump said he likely would not get any acknowledgment — specifically from the media.

""If they win, they’ll give me no credit, and if they lose, they’ll blame me and there’s not a thing I can do about it,"" Trump said, pointing to media coverage. ""There is real Trump derangement syndrome.""

This cycle, Trump’s plan for securing GOP control of Congress has centered on his rallies that energize the Republican base and also attract new attendees who traditionally have not turned out to vote during midterm election cycles— a strategy Trump allies say will fuel ""massive victories"" for Republicans on Election Day.

Trump has hosted 30 rallies across 17 states over the past 18 months.

Trump also hosted more than 50 in-person fundraisers in support of incumbent candidates up for re-election and participated in more than 60 tele rallies and automated calls in support of Republicans.

Trump’s Save America PAC raised $24.7 million in the third quarter — its highest raised quarter of the year — and has been using its massive war chest to fund rallies and purchase ads in support of GOP candidates across the nation ahead of Election Day.

Save America PAC raised during the third quarter — a 38% increase from the second quarter. A source familiar with the fundraising told Fox News that 98.8% of those donations totaled less than $200 each.

Trump’s Make America Great Again Inc., his main Super PAC, has spent $16.4 million in the last five weeks in support of candidates in state and congressional races across the country.

TRUMP MIDTERM STRATEGY: RALLIES ATTRACTING NEW GOP VOTERS, ENERGIZING BASE FOR ENDORSED CANDIDATES

Trump spent $4 million supporting Masters in Arizona and against his opponent Mark Kelly; $3.6 million opposing Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia; $3.4 million opposing Democrat Senate candidate John Fetterman in Pennsylvania; $2.4 million opposing Democrat Senate candidate Tim Ryan in Ohio; $2.1 million opposing Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto and in support of Adam Laxalt for Senate in Nevada; and $1 million opposing Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

Meanwhile, as for his ""major"" announcement next week, Trump allies have told Fox News Digital that the former president has been elevating his language, further signaling his intentions to announce a run for the White House in 2024.

Trump advisors and those around him told Fox News Digital that they believe it is not a question of ""if"" Trump is going to run for president again in 2024, but ""when"" he planned to formally announce his campaign.

Trump, in November 2021, during an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, said he would ""probably"" wait until after the 2022 midterm elections to formally announce whether he will launch another White House bid, telling Fox News Digital the timeline was ""probably appropriate.""

"Trump serves burgers, fries and pizza to college football champions Clemson","What do you feed a pack of victorious Tigers? If you're President Trump and the Tigers in question are the college football playoff champion Clemson Tigers, the answer is obvious.

""We ordered American fast food, paid for by me. Lots of hamburgers, lots of pizza,"" Trump told reporters Monday evening after returning to the White House from New Orleans. ""We have some very large people that like eating, so I think we're going to have a little fun.""

Clemson, led by head coach Dabo Swinney, won their second national championship in three seasons on Jan. 7 by blowing out the top-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide 44-16 in Santa Clara, Calif. With the win, Clemson completed the first 15-0 colege football season since the 1897 Penn Quakers.

The players were greeted by a White House smorgasbord unlike any other. Silver trays held stacks of wrapped burgers from Wendy's. Also on offer were boxed burgers from McDonald's, including Big Macs. White House cups bearing the presidential seal held French fries

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said much of the White House residence staff has been furloughed due to the ongoing partial government shutdown, """"so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone's favorite fast foods.""

Pizzas, some topped with olives and tomatoes, also were on the menu. Silver bowls held the condiments, and stacks of white plates sat nearby. Several young men were spotted eating multiple burgers at the standup tables dotting the East Room.

The president is a noted fast food fan, particularly McDonald's and Wendy's.

“I’m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you’re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food’s coming from. It’s a certain standard,” he said in a 2016 interview.

“I think the food’s good,” he added.

The Clemson team's visit is its second since Trump took office. The Tigers last visited in June 2017 after their championship run the previous season.

Swinney has nominated this season's undefeated Tigers as the best college team ever. Trump called them a ""great team, an unbelievable team.""

Trump has routinely sparred with professional athletes during his two years in office. College football has managed to avoid such political controversies, with last year's champion Alabama also visiting the White House.

"Trump slams Biden immigration policies: ‘There’s nothing, there’s no leadership’","Former President Donald Trump blasted Joe Biden's immigration policies Saturday on ""Justice with Judge Jeanine,"" saying the new President is showing ""no leadership,"" during a crisis that could ""destroy our country.""

DONALD TRUMP: Thousands and thousands of people are coming up right now as we speak. And you're going to have millions of people pouring into our country. And it's going to destroy our country. I don't know what they're doing. And they don't know what they're doing. It's a very, very dangerous situation. I'd love not to be involved. Somebody else is supposed to be doing it.

Over the next few weeks, I guess I’ll go [to the border]. And I’m not sure that I really should do it, Jeanine, other than the fact that I have such respect for the Border Patrol and for ICE. And these people they’re dying for leadership. There’s nothing. There’s no leadership. You have to see the squalor, the children and, frankly, people that have come in to the country when you look at what’s happening, the dirt and the filth of those places. That’s why they’re not letting the press in.

And, frankly, if that were me the press would be going crazy. It’s a very dangerous situation. It’s horrible for our country. They’re going to destroy our country.

Since taking office, Biden has undone a number of Trump-era immigration policies, including halting funding for the border wall and ending the Remain-in-Mexico policy.

The Trump administration set up and expanded MPP during the 2019 migrant crisis as part of a broader agreement with Mexico, and hailed it as a key plank in its efforts to end ""catch-and-release"" -- by which migrants were released into the interior of the U.S.

Instead, MPP keeps migrants in Mexico as they await their asylum hearings. Proponents say the policy ended a key pull factor that brought migrants north, while critics say it is cruel and puts migrants in danger by leaving them in Mexico.

Meanwhile, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities have been operating far beyond capacity amid a troubling surge in border crossers. The agency announced that it had encountered more than 100,000 migrants at the border in February, while numbers of child migrants in custody have also increased dramatically.

The Biden administration has refrained from calling the situation a ""crisis,"" but has admitted that border apprehension numbers could surge to a 20-year high.

"Trump slams NYAG James' 'ridiculous' case, says she should 'focus on people who kill people' as crime spikes","EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump slammed New York Attorney General Letitia James’ lawsuit against him as ""ridiculous,"" maintaining he and his family have done nothing wrong. Trump added that crime in New York is at the ""highest level it has ever been"" because the attorney general has spent her time in office ""fighting Trump"" and urged officials to ""focus on people who kill people.""

James’ office on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Trump and his children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, as well as his associates and businesses, alleging ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" regarding financial statements.

James alleged Trump ""inflated his net worth by billions of dollars"" and said his children helped him to do so.

NEW YORK AG SUES TRUMP OVER FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

During an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Trump said he ""never thought she was going to bring this case because she has no case.""

Trump, in August, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights during a deposition as part of James’ civil investigation into the Trump Organization. The lawsuit, stemming from James’ probe, was to find out whether Trump and his company improperly inflated the value of assets on financial statements to obtain loans and tax benefits.

""They wanted to settle the case. … It is a ridiculous case,"" Trump said. ""But I never thought she was going to bring the case until I looked at her poll numbers.

NEW YORK CITY OVERALL CRIME INCREASES 31% WHILE INCARCERATION CONSERVATION RATE STOOPS TO 18%

""Also, don’t forget, you know, there is an unwritten rule — almost, it is an unwritten law, you never bring a lawsuit within 90 days of an election,"" Trump said. ""And she brought this right before the midterm elections, which shows you just how degenerate she is.

""She was going to do this from the day she started campaigning,"" the former president said, pointing to James’ campaign promise to take on Trump.

""We’re definitely gonna sue him, we’re gonna be a real pain in the a--,"" James once told a supporter.

James also once said Trump was an ""existential threat,"" and said ""the No. 1 issue in this country is defeating Donald Trump.""

""Nothing else matters,"" James said.

Trump, though, told Fox News Digital it's a ""disgrace"" that James has focused on him and his family.

""This is why murderers are all over the city, and crime is at the highest level it has ever been,"" Trump said, adding that James has done"" nothing to stop people from murdering, but let’s take care of Trump.

TRUMP INVOKES FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN DEPOSITION FOR NEW YORK AG JAMES' CIVIL INVESTIGATION

""She spent most of her time in office — she spent three years — fighting Trump,"" he added. ""Focus on people that kill people.""

While citywide shootings and murders have decreased 24% and 32% year-over-year, respectively, six of seven major crime incident categories have reached a 21-year high, New York Police Department (NYPD) executives announced Thursday.

But James, when bringing the suit against Trump Wednesday, said that over the course of her office's investigation, it interviewed 65 witnesses and reviewed millions of documents. She said the evidence showed Trump submitted ""more than 200 false and misleading asset valuations.""

The misrepresentations included stating that Trump had cash on hand that he did not have and ignoring restrictions that would impact property values, James said.

The attorney general said she believes the allegations also violate state and federal criminal laws and that her office is making a referral to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the IRS. The SDNY U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the matter.

James said the investigation only began after former Trump attorney Michael Cohen told Congress Trump made misrepresentations in statements to financial institutions.

MICHAEL COHEN DECLARES ‘THE END IS NEAR’ FOR TRUMP AFTER FBI RAID

As for his financial statements, Trump told Fox News Digital his statement of financial condition ""has a disclaimer right at the front.""

""It is extremely long and extremely strong, and it disclaims, and it says, ‘Go out and check for yourself. Do your own work, don’t rely on this,’"" Trump explained.

There are three levels of accounting review, sources told Fox News, with the statement of financial condition being the lowest. A source explained that the statement is a preparation of what an individual thinks things are valued at.

Accountants said in the disclaimer that the statement of financial condition was not an authorized document or the result of any kind of audit, but rather prepared by an accounting firm in coordination with the Trump Organization. The disclaimer asks that banks do their own due diligence before approving a loan.

James said that, through the lawsuit, her office is requesting that the New York Supreme Court permanently bar Trump and his children from serving as officers for any New York corporation and bar Trump and the Trump Organization from participating in New York commercial real estate acquisitions or applying for loans in the state for five years.

Asked about a possible settlement of the case, James said her office's doors are open.

Trump told Fox News Digital James ""wanted to settle the case.""

Trump returning to social media with 'his own platform' in 2-3 months: adviser,"Former President Donald Trump will be back on social media in the near future with his own service, according to one of his senior advisers.

Trump was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. He had been a prolific poster on that platform before and during his presidency.

TRUMP BOOSTS JULIA LETLOW IN LOUISIANA HOUSE RACE TO SUCCEED HER LATE HUSBAND

""I do think that we’re going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months here, with his own platform,"" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller told Fox News' ""#MediaBuzz"" on Sunday. ""And this is something that I think will be the hottest ticket in social media, it’s going to completely redefine the game, and everybody is going to be waiting and watching to see what exactly President Trump does.""

Miller said he was unable to provide much more in terms of details at this point, but he did reveal that Trump has been having ""high-powered meetings"" at Mar-a-Lago with various teams regarding the venture, and that ""numerous companies"" have approached Trump.

""This new platform is going to be big,"" Miller said, predicting that Trump will draw ""tens of millions of people.""

"Trump hands out 'Trump Water,' speaks to the 'forgotten' American in East Palestine: 'We stand with you'","Former President Donald Trump visited East Palestine, Ohio, on Wednesday, a community still grappling with the aftermath of a train derailment earlier this month that led to a large release of toxic chemicals.

During the visit, Trump highlighted Americans he said had been ""forgotten"" by the Biden administration following the disaster, and pledged to help the community hold those responsible for the damage accountable.

TRUMP TO VISIT EAST PALESTINE AFTER TOXIC TRAIN DERAILMENT

""You are not forgotten. We stand with you. We pray for you. And we will stand with you and your fight to help ensure the accountability that you deserve,"" Trump told the crowd of local leaders, first responders and media gathered at a fire station in the town.

""The community has shown the tough and resilient heart of America. And that's what it is. This is really America right here. We're standing in America,"" he later added.

TRUMP TO VISIT EAST PALESTINE AFTER TOXIC TRAIN DERAILMENT

Trump donated thousands of gallons of cleaning supplies and more than a dozen pallets of his namesake ""Trump Spring Water"" to the community. He also met with members of the community and local officials.

Joining the former president throughout his visit were East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway; Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio; Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio; State Rep. Monica Robb-Blasdel; and Ohio State Sen. Michael Rulli in addition to other statewide and local officials.

"Trump special counsel seeks access to Scott Perry's phone records, other GOP reps comms tied to Jan. 6","Justice Department prosecutors argued Thursday in federal court that Special Counsel Jack Smith should have access to a broad swath of congressional communications, specifically certain phone records from GOP Rep. Scott Perry and other members of Congress, as part of his ongoing investigation into former President Trump and the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

Federal prosecutors from the special counsel's team argued before the three-judge panel at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday.

TRUMP CALLS PENCE A 'VERY HONORABLE MAN' AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH SUBPOENA

The panel heard arguments over whether the Constitution shields the Justice Department from looking into ""informal"" legislative efforts of U.S. lawmakers--including communications with private individuals and officials within the Executive Branch.

The arguments come amid allegations that Perry, R-Pa., was in contact with then-President Trump and then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the days leading up to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee to the appeals court, spent a great deal of time quizzing government prosecutor John Pelletieri about where the line is for protected communications concerning legislation. Katsas seemed skeptical of the government’s ability to access large quantities of a congressman’s communications.

TEAM INVESTIGATING TRUMP CLASSIFIED DOCS INCLUDES SEASONED DOJ OFFICIALS WHO PROSECUTED HIS TOP ALLIES

""Your position is that no informal outreach is protected?"" Judge Katsas asked, referring to the non-disclosure protection associated with the ""Speech or Debate Clause"" of the Constitution.

""A member dealing with a vote on the floor has no fact-finding ability as to their vote?"" Judge Katsas asked Pelletieri.

Pelletieri argued before the panel that in order for a congressman’s communications to be protected they have to be ""connected to Congress’ exercise of fact finding authority,"" connected to legislation.

ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND NAMES SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP ON MAR-A-LAGO DOCUMENTS, JAN. 6

Judge Neomi Rao, also a Trump appointee, described the government’s position as ""a tricky line.""

""Why is an individual’s fact-finding not covered by the non-disclosure privilege, when a committee’s is?"" asked Rao.

Pelletieri argued that there ""has to be some kind of standard that requires fact-finding to be directly connected to something that is pending in Congress.""

The three-judge panel also questioned Perry’s attorney, John Rowley, on where the boundaries should be drawn, shielding lawmakers’ communications from scrutiny.

Rowley, arguing on behalf of Perry, said that the communications the government is seeking from his client were directly related to two pending legislative matters before Congress at the time, and therefore should not be available to the government.

TRUMP ALLY REP. SCOTT PERRY SAYS THE FBI SEIZED HIS CELLPHONE ONE DAY AFTER MAR-A-LAGO RAID

Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith as special counsel in November to investigate the entirety of the criminal investigation into the retention of presidential records, including classified records, held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida.

The FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago in August.

Smith is also tasked with overseeing the investigation into whether Trump or other officials and entities interfered with the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election, including the certification of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6, 2021.

Just a day after the FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago, the FBI confiscated Perry's cellphone. Perry told Fox News at the time that he was approached by three FBI agents who handed him a warrant and requested that he turn over his cellphone. The incident came while Perry was traveling with his family.

Perry said his phone contained information about his ""legislative and political activities, and personal/private discussions with my wife, family, constituents, and friends.""

""None of this is the government’s business,"" Perry told Fox News Digital at the time.

Perry had been a target of interest of the Democratic dominated January 6 House select committee last Congress. Perry was allegedly in communication numerous times with the Trump White House in the days and weeks ahead of the storming of the Capitol.

"Trump stands by statements on Mexican illegal immigrants, surprised by backlash","Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump on Saturday stood by statements he made recently that too many illegal immigrants from Mexico are criminals but said he was surprised by the backlash and that his comments are causing financial concerns.

“The crime is raging and it’s violent. And if you talk about it, it’s racist,” Trump told Fox News, three days after a purported illegal Mexican immigrant deported five previous times allegedly killed a woman in San Francisco.

Trump first made his inflammatory remarks during his non-scripted, June 16 presidential announcement speech.

“When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best,” he said during the announcement. “They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.""

Since then, a list of businesses have announced plans to cut ties with Trump’s vast business empire, while fellow Republican candidates and others have questioned Trump’s remarks.

NBC and Univision, for example, have decided not to air the Trump-owned Miss Universe Pageant, Macy’s is dropping his signature clothing line, New York Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered a review of Trump's city contracts and NASCAR is moving an annual banquet from the Trump National Doral resort in Miami.

“I didn’t know it was going to be this severe,” Trump said Saturday, adding that he was surprised by the NASCAR decision, considering he has a good relationship with the group. “I am a whipping post.”

Still, Trump has drawn support from Americans who say he is openly confronting the severity of the immigration problem that others won’t publicly knowledge.

Trump also said Saturday that the problem isn’t limited to Mexico, that everybody entering the United States is not criminal or problematic and that his concerns are rooted in national security.

“It’s about safety,” he said. “Some of the people coming here are very violent people, not all.”

Trump and fellow GOP White House candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have publicly exchanged remarks since Trump’s presidential announcement, with Rubio saying Trump’s comments about Mexicans were “offensive, inaccurate and divisive.”

After Mexican illegal immigrant Francisco Sanchez apparently killed 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco in a random attack Wednesday, Trump, who has proposed build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, sent a direct tweet to Rubio, the son of Cuban parents who has made immigration reform a part of his presidential campaign.

“What do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can’t secure our border? Stand up for US,” Trump tweeted.

Federal officials said local authorities repeatedly released Sanchez, who was in their custody as recently as this spring.

On Saturday, Trump said Rubio was “weak on immigration” and that fellow GOP White House candidate and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry “could have done a lot more.”

He praised what he considers fellow candidate and Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s tough immigration stance, calling him “very brave.”",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-stands-by-statements-on-mexican-illegal-immigrants-surprised-by-backlash,N/A
Trump targeted: A look at the investigations involving the former president; from Russia to Mar-a-Lago,"Former President Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in a deposition as part of New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into his family’s business practices—just days after the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago home in connection with an investigation into classified records he allegedly took with him when he left the White House—but investigations are nothing new for Donald Trump.

Trump's presidency was clouded by investigations—several into whether he colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, some focused on his finances and others that led to impeachment, making him the first president in United States history to have been impeached twice.

Trump’s post-presidential life is reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by probes, which the former president and his allies say are all just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running for re-election in 2024.

This week alone, Trump, again, found himself in the line of fire.

TRUMP INVOKES FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN DEPOSITION FOR NEW YORK AG JAMES' CIVIL INVESTIGATION

FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago

Early Monday morning, the FBI, in an unprecedented move, raided Trump’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in connection with an investigation into classified records the former president allegedly took with him from the White House.

Sources told Fox News that FBI agents would not allow Trump’s attorneys to watch as they raided the former president's private residence. One source said FBI agents took boxes and documents without reviewing them on the property—only to investigate them later.

The raid was related to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which said earlier this year that Trump took 15 boxes of presidential records to his personal residence in Florida. Those boxes allegedly contained ""classified national security information,"" and official correspondence between Trump and foreign heads of state.

The NARA notified Congress in February that the agency recovered the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago and ""identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes."" The matter was referred to the Justice Department by NARA.

FBI WOULD NOT LET TRUMP ATTORNEYS IN ROOMS AS AGENTS RAIDED MAR-A-LAGO, WARRANT FOCUSED ON NARA: SOURCE

Trump, earlier this year, said the National Archives did not ""find"" the documents, but that they were ""given, upon request."" Sources close to the former president said he had been cooperating and there was ""no need"" for the raid.

Classified material that was reportedly confiscated by the FBI during the raid Monday included a letter to Trump from former President Obama, a letter from Kim Jong Un, a birthday dinner menu and a cocktail napkin.

Trump's tax returns probe

Then, on Tuesday, a federal appeals court paved the way for the House Ways and Means Committee to finally obtain Trump’s tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service—something the panel has been trying to obtain since 2019, under a law that permits the disclosure of an individual's tax returns to the congressional committee.

Trump may seek emergency intervention measures from the Supreme Court in an attempt to temporarily block any release of these tax records.

Civil investigation into Trump Organization

On Wednesday, Trump appeared in downtown New York City for his deposition before New York Attorney General Letitia James. James’ office has been conducting a civil investigation into the Trump Organization to find out whether Trump and his company improperly inflated the value of assets on financial statements in order to obtain loans and tax benefits.

""I did nothing wrong, which is why, after five years of looking, the Federal, State and local governments, together with the Fake News Media, have found nothing,"" Trump said in a statement Wednesday morning.

""The United States Constitution exists for this very purpose, and I will utilize it to the fullest extent to defend myself against this malicious attack by this administration, this Attorney General’s Office, and all other attacks on my family, my business, and our Country.""

TRUMP RAID LINKED TO DOJ, NATIONAL ARCHIVES PROBE INTO CLASSIFIED DOCS ALLEGEDLY TAKEN TO MAR-A-LAGO

""I once asked, ‘If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?’ Now I know the answer to that question,"" he continued. ""When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice.""

""If there was any question in my mind, the raid of my home, Mar-a-Lago, on Monday by the FBI, just two days prior to this deposition, wiped out any uncertainty,"" Trump said. ""I have absolutely no choice because the current Administration and many prosecutors in this Country have lost all moral and ethical bounds of decency.""

Trump added: ""Accordingly, under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution.""

A spokesperson for the New York State Attorney General’s Office confirmed that the office conducted Trump’s deposition.

""Attorney General Letitia James took part in the deposition during which Mr. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,"" the spokesperson said. ""Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead.""

The spokesperson added: ""Our investigation continues.""

TRUMP TO BE DEPOSED IN JAMES' INVESTIGATION WEDNESDAY

However, Trump’s Republican allies are seeing a pattern, and encouraging him to continue to fight back.

""Before he's in the White House, they go after him. While he's in the White House, they go after him, and they're continuing to do so now that he's left,"" the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News. ""It actually started before he was even president.""

FBI's Crossfire Hurricane probe

When Trump took office in January 2017, the FBI was in the middle of conducting a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Donald Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 election. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" and began on July 31, 2016.

That investigation was opened, despite then-CIA Director John Brennan briefing then-President Obama on July 28, 2016 about a purported proposal from one of Hillary Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers ""to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.""

In September 2016, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to then-FBI Director James Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: ""Crossfire Hurricane.""

Fox News first obtained and reported on the CIOL, which stated: ""The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate.""

DESPITE ACQUITTAL, DURHAM TRIAL OF SUSSMANN ADDED TO EVIDENCE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PLOTTED TO TIE TRUMP TO RUSSIA

""An exchange [REDACTED] discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server,"" the referral states.

It is unclear how the FBI handled that memo.

Special Counsel John Durham is currently investigating the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe.

After Trump’s victory and during the presidential transition period, Comey briefed Trump on the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier, containing salacious allegations of purported coordination between Trump and the Russian government. It was authored by Christopher Steele, an ex-British intelligence officer.

The DOJ inspector general later revealed that the unverified dossier helped serve as the basis for controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants obtained against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

It is now widely known that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded the dossier through the law firm Perkins Coie.

HILLARY CLINTON APPROVED DISSEMINATION OF TRUMP-RUSSIAN BANK ALLEGATIONS TO MEDIA, CAMPAIGN MANAGER TESTIFIES

During the early months of Trump’s administration, Jeff Sessions, who served as attorney general at the time, recused himself from oversight of the FBI’s Russia investigation, due to his involvement with the Trump campaign, per Justice Department regulations. Then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was then tasked with oversight of the investigation.

Trump, in May 2017, fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Comey, during his June 2017 testimony to Congress, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

""I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,"" Comey testified.

Mueller's investigation and report

Days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to take over the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe.

The Mueller investigation clouded the Trump administration for nearly two years.

DECLASSIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE DOCS TO DATE: WHAT TO KNOW

Simultaneously, investigations into Trump-Russia allegations were launched on Capitol Hill—in both chambers of Congress.

The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Intelligence Committee opened investigations into whether Trump and members of his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential race.

Neither the House nor Senate investigation found evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.

After nearly two years, Mueller’s investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller, though, did not draw a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice. At the time, then-Attorney General Bill Barr and Rosenstein concluded the evidence from the Mueller case was ""not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""

Once Mueller’s findings were made public, congressional Democrats seized on the issue of obstruction of justice, and began ramping up investigations on matters that spanned from Trump’s personal finances to security clearances for Trump administration officials, all whilst the drumbeat of impeachment built within the House Democratic caucus.

Investigations led by House Democrats

In March 2019, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., announced a wide-ranging probe into almost every aspect of Trump’s administration, business ventures, and family dealings, subpoenaing more than 81 individuals and entities to investigate ""alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump.""

FLASHBACK: IMPEACHMENT DRUMBEAT BUILDS ON LEFT, AS HOUSE SHIFTS PROBES INTO HIGH GEAR

But Nadler wasn’t alone— a number of other House panels also stepped up inquiries.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee, which was chaired, at the time, by Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., dissolved the panel’s subcommittee on terrorism and re-directed those resources to a subcommittee dedicated, instead, to investigations related to Trump—specifically his relationships and communications with foreign officials, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Congressional committees, at the time, were also seeking access to State Department employees and contractors with knowledge of Trump's communications with Putin, including the ""linguists, translators, or interpreters"" who participated in or listened to Trump-Putin meetings.

FLASHBACK: SCHIFF SAYS THERE IS 'DIRECT EVIDENCE' OF COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who pushed the Trump-Russia collusion narrative for years, in 2019, continued his investigation into the matter, claiming he had evidence of collusion, despite Mueller’s findings.

Declassified transcripts from House Intelligence Committee interviews, which Fox News first reported on in 2020, revealed, among other things, that top Obama officials acknowledged they had no ""empirical evidence"" of collusion or a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election.

Also in the spring of 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee sued the Trump administration, accusing officials of violating federal law by refusing to comply with the panel’s requests and subpoenas for documents related to Trump’s tax returns.

TRUMP SUES HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, NEW YORK STATE OFFICIALS TO PROTECT HIS TAX RETURNS

The House Oversight Committee, at the time, also subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA LLC for his financial information, including annual statements, periodic financial reports and independent auditor reports from Mazars, as well as all communications with Trump.

Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee also subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Capital One over Trump’s financial statements.

In the middle of the congressional investigations into his finances, Trump’s business dealings were also being probed in two separate investigations in New York— one by then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and the other by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Trump’s administration was even being investigated by the House Oversight Committee over security clearances given to officials, probing the process that gave clearances to White House staff.

FLASHBACK: DEM-LED HOUSE PANEL LAUNCHES NEW PROBE INTO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SECURITY CLEARANCES

Ukraine call and first impeachment

But everything came to a head in July 2019—Trump had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

During that call, Trump pressed Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine—specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden, at the time, was, and still is, under federal criminal investigation for his tax affairs, prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and some witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Democrats also claimed Trump was meddling in the next presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democratic political opponent.

Trump’s conversation with Zelenskyy prompted a whistleblower complaint, which led to the House impeachment inquiry, and ultimately, impeachment proceedings in the Senate.

FLASHBACK: IMPEACHMENT NUMBER ONE: SENATE ACQUITS TRUMP ON ABUSE OF POWER, OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS CHARGES

The House voted to impeach Trump in December 2019 on two counts— abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate voted for acquittal in February 2020.

""At some point, you got to ask, you know, the motive,"" Jordan said of the investigations. ""And the motive is this guy came to town and shook up the place—he changed the clique that exists there in D.C., he took on the clique and the bureaucracy and everything else, and the folks there said, no, we just can't have this, and that's why they go after him so hard.""

COVID-19 accusations

Weeks after Trump’s first acquittal, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic rocked the world, shutting down the U.S. economy and global markets, with millions of people around the world contracting the novel coronavirus.

Trump was accused, throughout, of not taking the virus seriously. Democratic senators, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris, called for an investigation into the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats also said they would create a 9/11-style commission to probe Trump’s response.

The Trump administration, though, launched Operation Warp Speed—a public-private partnership to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic raged in 2020. Under his administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.

FLASHBACK: WARREN, SENATE DEMOCRATS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS

Trump in December 2020 signed an executive order that would ensure all Americans had access to coronavirus vaccines before the U.S. government could begin aiding nations around the world.

Russian bounties to kill U.S. troops

In another congressional probe, during the pandemic, Trump was hammered by Democrats over when he was briefed, and his response to Moscow, related to intelligence that Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops.

A year later, during the Biden administration, officials admitted that intelligence was unverified.

2020 presidential election

Throughout 2020, Trump was also criticized for questioning the security of the upcoming presidential election, and for repeatedly saying it would be ""rigged"" due to the pandemic-era process of mail-in ballots.

Biden won the 2020 election, but Trump claimed it was stolen, and his legal team filed a slew of lawsuits in battleground states across the nation.

FLASHBACK: IMPEACHMENT NUMBER TWO: TRUMP ACQUITTED IN SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL ON CHARGE OF INCITING JAN. 6 CAPITOL RIOT

January 6 riot and second impeachment

On Jan. 6, 2021, pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol during a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College results in favor of President Biden. Trump was permanently banned from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube after the riot.

The House of Representatives then drafted articles of impeachment against him again, and ultimately voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting an insurrection for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot—making him the first and only president to be impeached, and ultimately acquitted, twice in history.

Trump's legal team denounced the proceedings as an unconstitutional ""sham impeachment"" against a private citizen, driven by Democrats' ""hatred"" for Trump and desire to silence a political opponent.

The Senate voted to acquit, but had Trump been convicted, the Senate would have moved to bar the 45th president from holding federal office ever again, preventing a 2024 White House run.

In Georgia, in early 2021, prosecutors in Fulton County opened a criminal investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state, including his phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump suggested the Republicans ""find"" enough votes to change the results.

And when Trump left office, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol began its probe into the Capitol riot.

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE AIMS TO SHOW 'TRUMP WAS AT THE CENTER' OF PLOT TO OVERTURN ELECTION WITH PRIMETIME HEARING

That committee has spent more than a year investigating, and launched a series of hearings this summer, some during primetime, in an attempt to capture Americans’ attention before the November midterm elections—as they compete with record-high inflation, record-high gas prices, shortages in baby formula, a looming recession, and more for political attention.

Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks, R-Ind., who met with Trump at Bedminster Tuesday evening, reflected on the series of investigations, and said ""America has never had a fighter like Donald Trump, and that’s why the American people love him.""

""Now, more than ever, we need Donald Trump back in the White House to fight for America,"" Banks said. ""He has taken a beating from the left, from the left-wing media, from the swamp—and each and every time, he gets back up and keeps fighting back and that’s why he enjoys so much support from House Republicans.""

Potential Trump 2024 presidential run

Jordan told Fox News that Democrats are ""afraid he is going to run again, which I want him to do.""

""And he’s going to win,"" Jordan said. ""He’s going to come and continue to shake up the town and stand up for ‘We the People,’ and not the bureaucratic swamp.""

GOP REP. BANKS SAYS TRUMP 'FIRED UP' AFTER FBI RAID, 'MADE UP HIS MIND' ON 2024: 'GOING TO LIKE HIS DECISION'

And Banks told Fox News that what happened at Mar-a-Lago ""unifies Republicans in our outrage.""

""It will only backfire on the left as they see that the American people stand with President Trump,"" Banks said. ""And all of the investigations that have added up over the years--this should not happen in America.""

Banks told Fox News that should the Republicans take back the majority in the House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections, Jordan will be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

""If there has ever been the right guy, in the right place in American politics—it is going to be Jim Jordan chairing the House Judiciary Committee,"" he said. ""Those committee hearings should be on primetime—on live television—for the American people to tune in.""

He added: ""Jordan is going to lead the effort to hold the Justice Department accountable in a way that, right now, they deserve more than ever.""

As for Trump, Banks told Fox News that the former president ""has made up his mind"" about whether he will run for re-election in 2024—a decision he will make public in ""a matter of time.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-targeted-look-investigations-involving-former-president-from-russia-mar-a-lago,N/A
Trump team launches new app allowing supporters to ‘engage with the campaign from their couch’,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

The Trump campaign on Thursday launched a new mobile app for supporters that functions like a hybrid between a political news hub and an airline frequent flier program – as candidates scramble to find ways to connect with voters amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“The app is perfect for this unusual time because it lets people engage with the campaign from their couch, or wherever they are,” said Brad Parscale, Trump’s presidential campaign manager.

While the Trump campaign may not be able to host events where thousands of supporters gather in public because of the coronavirus pandemic, this new app gives the campaign a chance to gather the most valuable commodity to a campaign: voter e-mails and cell phone numbers.

AS GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN BEGINS, TRUMP HAS MASSIVE FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE OVER BIDEN

According to the campaign, “rewards points” are given to users who convince contacts to download the app. Users accumulating the most points are eligible for a photograph with President Trump.

“Get a front row seat to our virtual events,” a Trump campaign digital advertisement promises.

Another reward for the most engaged users is expedited entry into events – although it’s unclear when public health concerns tied to COVID-19 will permit another one.

The last in-person Trump campaign rally was March 2 in North Carolina.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s last large campaign event was March 9 in Detroit, Michigan, and his last in-person press conference was March 12 in Wilmington, Del. The Biden campaign is relying heavily on “virtual fundraisers,” and other events staged from the former vice president’s rec room, via Zoom.

Large events in arenas are a hallmark of Trump’s campaign, but his closest advisers aren’t rushing him back onto the campaign trail.

“If he has a rally where people are physically distanced, and there aren't as many people sitting next to each other it’ll look a little bit like a Biden rally,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway quipped Wednesday.

The app has been in development for at least seven months and was originally primarily designed for use at rallies.

The original thinking was for Trump rally-goers to check-in to a rally using their phone, the same way you can check-in for a flight. But now, in the COVID-19 era, the app is centered on connecting supporters to the campaign’s many virtual events and the “gamification” of voter outreach.

Trump says he will make a 'big announcement' on Nov. 15,"Former President Donald Trump on the eve of the midterm elections Monday teased a major announcement, which could be his decision on a 2024 presidential run.

""Two years ago we were a great nation, and we will be a great nation again. Not to detract from tomorrow's very important even critical election… I'm going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday Nov. 15 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach,"" Trump said of what will likely be a third presidential campaign.

Trump has hinted for over a year that he is interested in a third White House run and has begun to elevate his language recently as a likely announcement nears. Many Republicans wanted Trump to wait until at least after the midterms, and the former president now appears poised to do just that.

TRUMP ELEVATING LANGUAGE AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS SIGNALING A 2024 WHITE HOUSE RUN, ADVISERS SAY

He followed up his comments on a Nov. 15 announcement by reading off a list of GOP candidates for voters to elect in the midterms.

Trump also refrained from swinging at other Republicans. As he went through various poll numbers on the big screen at the rally, Trump did not refer to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" as he did at a recent rally. Instead, he endorsed DeSantis for re-election as Florida governor.

As the screen flipped through various polls in states including Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina and Kansas showing Trump as the leader, Trump also said there are ""a lot of good people"" in the possible GOP field.

Trump also spent significant time attacking Ohio Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan and boosting his GOP opponent, JD Vance.

SEN. TOM COTTON: ‘FAMILY WAS REALLY THE ONLY CONSIDERATION’ IN HIS DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024

Trump hammered many of the same talking points that Republicans running in 2022 have emphasized, including inflation, immigration and crime.

""Inflation should have never happened,"" Trump told a raucous crowd. ""Forget about buying a turkey for Thanksgiving. Has anybody bought a turkey yet for Thanksgiving? Because if you haven't, don't even waste your time.""

Trump added: ""Number one, you probably won't get it. And if you do, you're going to pay approximately three times more than you did.""

""Under the radical left Democrats, the streets of our cities are ruled by bloodthirsty gangs and violent criminals,"" the former president said, as he riffed on foreign countries' ""quick trials"" for drug dealers.

PENNSYLVANIA MIDTERM ELECTIONS: HOUSE AND SENATE SEATS, CANDIDATES, ISSUES AND MORE

""Instead of doubling the number of IRS agents, we should double the number of ICE and Border Patrol agents,"" the former president said.

The former president was heavily involved in the midterms, throwing his support behind Republican candidates across the nation. During the primaries, the majority of Trump-endorsed candidates were victorious, becoming the GOP nominee in their races.

Trump also broke from the midterm script and revisited many of the themes that are standard for his rallies. Trump slammed former Attorney General Bill Barr for not backing up his false claims the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and criticized former Vice President Mike Pence for not rejecting electoral votes.

He also railed against ""impeachment hoax number one"" and ""impeachment hoax number two,"" and groused about the various criminal and civil investigations into him.

But the speech could nevertheless set the stage for Trump to take credit for a successful Election Day for Republicans, just ahead of his ""big announcement"" next week.

""This is the year we're going to take back the House. We're going to take back the Senate. And we're going to take back America.

"Trump to visit East Palestine, donate water, supplies amid Biden's 'failed' response: adviser","EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump will travel to East Palestine, Ohio Wednesday and is set to donate thousands of gallons of cleaning supplies and more than a dozen pallets of water to the community as it grapples with the aftermath of the train derailment that led to a large release of toxic chemicals, Fox News Digital has learned.

A source familiar with the former president’s plans told Fox News Digital that Trump will travel to East Palestine on Wednesday to meet with members of the community and community officials.

Joining the former president throughout his visit will be East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway; Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio; Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio; State Rep. Monica Robb-Blasdel; and Ohio State Sen. Michael Rulli in addition to other statewide and local officials.

TRUMP TO VISIT EAST PALESTINE AFTER TOXIC TRAIN DERAILMENT

Trump is expected to donate thousands of gallons of cleaning supplies, along with 13 pallets of water to East Palestine. A single pallet typically holds a couple of thousand bottles of water. The former president is teaming up with nonprofit organizations Blue Line Moving and KORTX.

""President Trump is meeting with the citizens of East Palestine and will never forget them and what they are going through,"" a Trump advisor told Fox News Digital. ""Contrast that with Biden and the federal government who has failed them from the beginning.""

Trump's planned visit comes after a train derailment on Feb. 3, when about 50 cars on a Norfolk Southern Railroad train carrying vinyl chloride derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, a small community that is located along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.

EAST PALESTINE: HHS, CDC SENDING MEDICAL PERSONNEL AFTER TRAIN DERAILMENT, OFFICIALS SAY

The company opted to release the gas from the derailed cars, releasing potentially deadly fumes and other dangerous chemicals into the air, to prevent a disastrous explosion. Local residents were told to evacuate the area during the release, but were assured it was safe to return on Feb. 9.

Residents of the East Palestine community have reported severe symptoms from toxins and chemicals that have seeped into the air and waterways since the derailment on Feb. 7.

After more than two weeks, the Biden administration on Friday announced it would deploy medical personnel and toxicologists to East Palestine from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine requested HHS and CDC assistance on Feb. 16, after being denied aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA told DeWine Ohio isn't eligible for disaster assistance, even amid the derailment.

A White House official told Fox News Digital on Friday that FEMA, the agency that usually provides relief to communities hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters, isn't best equipped to support the state's current needs.

OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT: FEMA TO DEPLOY TEAM TO EAST PALESTINE 2 WEEKS AFTER DISASTER

Fox News Digital first reported Trump’s planned visit Friday evening.

Hours later, FEMA reversed its decision, and announced Friday night it would deploy federal assistance to East Palestine.

The Biden administration had taken heavy criticism from residents for not approving a FEMA disaster declaration. The derailment does not meet the legal requirements for such a declaration, officials say.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan has visited East Palestine. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has said he plans to visit East Palestine, but has yet to do so.

But President Biden has yet to visit the East Palestine community. Instead, Biden on Monday made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip overseas—nearly a year after Russia’s unprecedented invasion of Ukraine.

EAST PALESTINE, OHIO MAYOR 'FURIOUS' WITH BIDEN'S UKRAINE VISIT: 'THAT WAS THE BIGGEST SLAP IN THE FACE'

Biden’s visit left East Palestine residents and officials ""furious.""

""That was the biggest slap in the face,"" Mayor Conaway said on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Monday. ""That tells you right now he doesn't care about us. He can send every agency he wants to, but I found out this morning that he was in Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us…on President’s Day in our country.""

He added: ""So, I’m furious.""

Conaway and local residents have pleaded for more federal assistance, saying that resources on the ground have been insufficient.

Water from the city of East Palestine has been tested and is considered safe, but residents using well water have been encouraged to use bottled water. Hundreds of air samples from homes in the area indicated no present toxins. Residents, however, remain uneasy as noxious odors and reports of mysterious rashes leave them concerned about the area's safety.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-visit-east-palestine-donate-water-supplies-amid-bidens-failed-response-adviser,N/A
"Trump, top national security officials refute claim that Chinese spy balloons transited US under his admin","EXCLUSIVE: Former President Donald Trump and a number of his top national security and defense officials refuted Biden administration officials' claims that Chinese surveillance balloons briefly transited the continental United States during the Trump administration, saying it ""never happened.""

A defense official on Saturday said Chinese spy balloons briefly traveled over the United States at least three times during the last administration.

But Trump and his officials said that did not occur and criticized the Biden administration for spreading disinformation.

MILITARY EXPERTS PROVIDE FRANK ASSESSMENT OF US SHORTCOMINGS IN POTENTIAL CHINA CONFLICT

""This never happened. It would have never happened,"" Trump told Fox News Digital on Sunday morning, adding that Beijing ""respected us greatly"" under his leadership.

""It never happened with us under the Trump administration, and if it did, we would have shot it down immediately,"" Trump said. ""It's disinformation.""

Trump said the Biden administration is spreading this because ""they look so bad, as usual.""

""They are incompetent,"" he said.

John Bolton, former Trump White House national security adviser, told Fox News Digital that he never heard of anything like this under his tenure.

US MISSILE BURSTS CHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA

""I don’t know of any balloon flights by any power over the United States during my tenure, and I’d never heard of any of that occurring before I joined in 2018,"" Bolton said. ""I haven’t heard of anything that occurred after I left either.""

Bolton said that if the Biden administration has ""specific examples, they need to tell Congress.""

He added, ""I can say with 100% certainty, not during my tenure.""

Robert O’Brien, who served as White House national security adviser from 2019 to 2021, told Fox News Digital that he had no knowledge of anything like this occurring.

""Unequivocally, I have never been briefed on the issue,"" O’Brien said, telling Fox News Digital that his team, which included Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser, and Allison Hooker, who served as senior adviser to Asia, also were not briefed on these activities.

CHINESE SPY BALLOON MAY HAVE GATHERED ‘UNSEEN’ INFORMATION, EXPERTS SAY

Former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, who led the intelligence community at the onset of the COVID pandemic, told Fox News Digital that he did ""one of the biggest intelligence deep dives on China, their spying and the origins of COVID"" during his tenure.

""It never came up,"" he said. ""If a balloon had come up, we would have known. Someone in the intelligence community would have known, and it would have bubbled up to me to brief the president.""

And former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who led the National Intelligence office after Grenell and through the end of the Trump administration, also refuted the claim.

""It's not true. I can refute it,"" Ratcliffe said on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""The American people can refute it for themselves. Do you remember during the Trump administration when photographers on the ground and commercial airline pilots were talking about a spy balloon over the United States that people could look up and see, even with the naked eye, and that a media that hated Donald Trump wasn't reporting?""

He added, ""I don't remember that either because it didn't happen.""

Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia Heino Klinck told Fox News Digital that he also was unaware.

""I can’t rule out that things occurred that I was unaware of, but I do think something like this, I would have been aware of,"" Klinck said.

THESE 5 CHINA INTELLIGENCE FAILURES ARE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CHINESE SPY BALLOON

Former Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper also said he was never told about Chinese surveillance balloons above the United States during his time at the Pentagon.

""I don't ever recall somebody coming into my office or reading anything that the Chinese had a surveillance balloon above the United States,"" Esper said during an appearance on CNN. ""I would remember that for sure.""

And former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, who had previously served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also told Fox News that he had never heard of a Chinese spy balloon while he was in government.""

""Never heard a whisper, and I have to think if anything like that happened that would have been a huge issue,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. ""No. Absolutely never heard of anything like that while I was in government or at the Pentagon.""

It is unclear, at this point, if these activities did take place and if it was military leadership that chose not to brief civilian leadership on the matter.

But a senior administration official told Fox News Digital on Sunday that ""U.S. intelligence, not the Biden administration, but U.S. intel assesses PRC government surveillance balloons transited the continental U.S. briefly at least three times during the prior administration and once that we know of at the beginning of this administration, but never for this duration of time.""

""They went undetected. And this is part of a larger pattern. These balloons are all part of a PRC fleet of balloons developed to conduct surveillance operations, which have also violated the sovereignty of other countries,"" the official said. ""These kinds of activities are often undertaken at the direction of the People’s Liberation Army.""

""Over the past several years, Chinese balloons have previously been spotted over countries across five continents, including in East Asia, South Asia and Europe,"" the official said.

The official added, ""Two things can be true at once: this happened, and it wasn’t detected.""

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

The balloon was shot down on Saturday off the coast of South Carolina after traveling for days over the continental United States.

Senior defense officials said that Saturday was the first time the U.S. had the chance to shoot down the balloon over water. Officials could have shot the balloon down over Montana and northern U.S. states, but out of an abundance of caution, they chose to wait until it was transiting over water to prevent any risk to civilians or civilian property.

Trump unloads on 13 Republicans who backed Biden's infrastructure bill,"Former President Trump in remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner Monday openly blasted the 13 congressional Republicans who supported President Biden’s infrastructure bill in a vote Friday.

Fox News Digital has confirmed from sources at the dinner that the former president criticized the 13 Republican defectors in a lengthy speech Monday night in a room where at least one of them, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, was present.

MEET THE 13 REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

The House of Representatives voted 228-206 on Friday to pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill , which could not have passed without the support of the 13 Republicans who pushed it through despite opposition from six progressive Democratic members of the House.

The Republicans who supported the bill, arguing that it provided funding for important infrastructure projects in their districts, were Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Don Young of Alaska, John Katko of New York, Tom Reed of New York, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Malliotakis of New York, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Chris Smith of New Jersey, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Fred Upton of Michigan, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, and David McKinley of West Virginia.

The New York Post’s Juliegrace Brufke reported on Tuesday that Malliotakis was ""visibly shaken"" by Trump’s remarks.

Malliotakis explained her vote in a video posted on social media, saying that the bill is ""incredibly good"" for her district and is different from the ""socialist spending spree.""

GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST 'RINOS' AFTER HOUSE PASSES $1.2T INFRASTRUCTURE BILL: 'TIME TO NAME NAMES'

Several of the other Republicans released similar statements, including Bacon, who said the bill will make the nation ""stronger.""

""Most of the hard infrastructure bill is paid for by unspent COVID money that was already appropriated by Congress. This bill makes our nation stronger and more competitive for years to come,"" Bacon said in a statement. ""Make no mistake. This is not the Bernie Sanders’ Socialist Budget Busting Bill, which would’ve cost American taxpayers their hard-earned money. When that bill does come to the floor for a vote, I will be a hard ‘NO.’""

Several House Republicans have sided with Trump and expressed outrage toward the 13 Republicans, and sources confirmed to Fox News Digital that GOP leadership is concerned that disgruntled GOP lawmakers will attempt to strip committee assignments from the lawmakers who supported the bill.

""RINOS just passed this wasteful $1.2 trillion dollar ‘infrastructure’ bill,"" Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert tweeted. ""Pelosi did not have the votes in her party to pass this garbage. Time to name names and hold these fake republicans accountable.""

Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn called for any Republican who supported the bill to be primaried during their next election.

Kinzinger, Reed and Gonzalez have announced they plan to retire at the end of their terms.

Punch Bowl News reported that the Twitter account for the House GOP Conference tweeted and then deleted a post on Friday saying, ""A vote for the Democrats ‘infrastructure’ bill is a vote for their socialist wish list. Americans won’t forget.""

That tweet reportedly angered some of the Republicans who supported the bill, including Fitzpatrick.

"Trump meets Kim in DMZ, becomes first sitting US president to step into Hermit Kingdom","With wide grins and a historic handshake, President Trump became the first sitting U.S. leader to set foot in North Korea when he took 20 steps into the Hermit Kingdom on Sunday.

Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as he crossed the low stone curb separating the North and the South at around 3:45 p.m. local time. The event in the Demilitarized Zone — which also included a roughly 50-minute meeting behind closed doors — marked a return to face-to-face contact between the two leaders after talks broke down during a summit in Vietnam in February.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Trump said that the two leaders had agreed to revive talks on the pariah nation’s nuclear program.

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY STEPHANIE GRISHAM ROUGHED UP BY NORTH KOREAN SECURITY GUARDS

The president said, ""speed is not the object"" in trying to reach a deal but noted he believes both sides want to get the job done.

""We're looking to get it right,"" Trump said.

The meeting between Trump and Kim was the first face-to-face meeting between the two since their failed summit in Hanoi in February. Prior to that, they met in Singapore last June.

Talks between the U.S. and North Korea had mostly broken down since the Hanoi summit, which ended without a deal. North Korea has hesitated at Trump's insistence that it give up its nuclear ambitions before it sees relief from crushing international sanctions.

The U.S. has said the North must submit to ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization"" before sanctions are lifted.

Despite their nearly hour-long chat, Trump said that sanctions on North Korea are still in place, although seemingly left open the possibility of scaling them back as part of renewed negotiations.

AUSTRALIAN STUDENT MAY HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN NORTH KOREA

“At some point during the negotiation, things can happen,"" the president told reporters, adding that he suggested Kim could visit Washington, D.C., during their discussions.

Trump says he told Kim that, “at the right time, you’re going to come over” and that that could be “any time he wants to do it.” He added that he “would certainly extend the invite” and that, “at some point” it will happen.

Hours earlier, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot inside North Korea. He described it as ""a great day for the world.""

Inside the ""Freedom House"" on the South Korean side of the zone, Trump and Kim were joined by the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Pope Francis praised the meeting on Sunday. According to Reuters, he said he prays ""such a significant gesture will be a further step on the road to peace, not only on that peninsula, but for the good of the entire world.""

It was Trump's first visit to the DMZ, which every president since Ronald Reagan — except for President George H.W. Bush — has toured during their time in office, according to the Associated Press. But the elder Bush, who died last year, visited the DMZ while serving as vice president under Reagan.

Later Sunday, the president addressed U.S. troops at Osan Air Force Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.

Trump welcomes Nikki Haley into the 2024 race: ‘The more the merrier’,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said he is ""glad"" Nikki Haley is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination and said she should ""not be bound"" by her past promise not to run against him.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Trump acknowledged that many Republicans who once served in his administration or had been considered his allies could challenge him for the 2024 GOP nomination.

But the former president, who announced his 2024 campaign in November, is encouraging that competition and told Fox News Digital: ""The more the merrier.""

""I’m glad she’s running,"" Trump said. ""I want her to follow her heart — even though she made a commitment that she would never run against who she called the greatest president of her lifetime.""

""She should do what she wants to do and not be bound by the fact that she said she would never do it,"" he said.

Trump's comment came hours after Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former UN ambassador, launched her 2024 presidential campaign.

NIKKI HALEY LEAPS INTO 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AT PACKED CAMPAIGN RALLY

The former president was referring to comments Haley made in April 2021. Haley told reporters then that she would support Trump in 2024 if he chose to run again.

When asked if she would run against Trump, Haley said: ""I would not run if President Trump ran. And I would talk to him about it. That is something that we’ll have a conversation about at some point if that decision is something that has to be made.""

At the time, Haley said she had a ""great working relationship"" with Trump and stressed the importance of ""building on what we accomplished.""

Trump said his own campaign is ""going really well.""

""I’m leading in every poll by a lot — both Republican and Democrat alike,"" Trump said. ""We’re going to make America great again.""

""And we’ll do it again, and I’ll be able to do it very quickly,"" Trump said.

He said he's not worried about potential Republican candidates who could challenge him in 2024, some of whom served in his administration like former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, or supported him in his past campaigns like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.

""The more the merrier,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""I know them all. I put them all there.""

""Politics is a strange bedfellow,"" he said. ""Most of them would be nothing without me, but I want them to do what they want to do. They will tell you we had the most successful presidency, perhaps, ever.""

""But these are very ambitious people and I understand exactly where they’re coming from,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""The more the merrier.""

TRUMP RESPONDS: BIDEN LEADING US TO 'BRINK OF WORLD WAR III,' VOWS TO REVERSE 'DISASTERS' IF ELECTED IN 2024

Trump remains the most popular and influential politician in the GOP. Nearly every poll indicates Trump and DeSantis as the favorites, while Haley and other figures mulling Republican presidential runs are in the single digits.

Haley, however, has been telling crowds that she’s ""never lost an election"" and that ""when people underestimate me, it’s always fun.""

"Trump will have to make loyalty pledge to join RNC debate stage, Ronna McDaniel says","Republican Presidential candidates will have to pledge support for the eventual nominee in order to be included on the Republican National Committee's debate stage, RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said Sunday.

McDaniel says candidates will have to sign the pledge prior to the first primary debate, which will be held in Milwaukee. Former President Trump has expressed opposition to the pledge, however, echoing his hesitancy to make the same pledge in 2016.

""We’re saying you’re not going to get on the debate stage unless you make this pledge,"" McDaniel said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""Anyone getting on the Republican national committee debate stage should be able to say, 'I will support the will of the voters and the eventual nominee of our party.""

Trump himself has some staunch opponents within the Republican Party, including former Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan pledged this weekend that he would not attend the Republican National Convention if Trump was the nominee.

""If we nominate Trump again, we're going to lose. It's just that clear,"" Ryan told Fox 6 last week. ""We lost with him in ‘18, ’20 and '22. We know this. He will cost us another election, so I'm just excited about somebody not named Trump.""

Trump easily wins Texas CPAC 2024 GOP presidential nomination straw poll; DeSantis second,"DALLAS – Former President Donald Trump convincingly won the 2024 GOP presidential nomination straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) three-day gathering in Texas

Trump, who’s repeatedly teased making another presidential run in 2024 to try and return to the White House, captured 69% of ballots cast in the anonymous online straw poll, according to results announced by CPAC on Saturday.

The support for the former president, who remains the most popular and influential politician in the Republican Party and continues to play a kingmaker's role in GOP primaries, is up from his 59% showing in the anonymous online straw poll at the CPAC gathering in Orlando, Florida in February.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second on the 2024 presidential nomination question, at 24%, down from his 28% showing at CPAC in Orlando five months ago.

2024 WATCH: CPAC ATTENDEES CHOOSE FAVORITE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AS TRUMP, DESANTIS REMAIN POPULAR

DeSantis has seen his popularity surge among Republican voters in his state and around the nation over the past two and a half years, thanks in large part to his relentless pushback against COVID-19 restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic as well as his aggressive actions in the culture wars.

WHAT TED CRUZ, AT CPAC, TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT 2024

While DeSantis has repeatedly deflected talk of a potential run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, political pundits view him as a potential White House contender.

The CPAC Texas straw poll results were released just ahead of the confab's keynote speech by Trump. DeSantis, who appeared at the Orlando conference earlier this year, did not attend the Texas gathering.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who spoke Friday at the conference, grabbed 2% support on the straw poll ballot. No one else among the 21 names listed on the ballot topped one percent.

""President Trump remains the most dominant force in American politics, and as yet another poll shows, it’s a reality that will propel the growth and success of the Republican Party through the Midterms and beyond,"" Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich told Fox News after the results were released.

The 2024 straw poll also included a second list without Trump. His name was replaced by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.

DeSantis topped the second 2024 ballot, at 65%. Donald Trump Jr. grabbed 8% support, with Cruz at 6% and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 5%. No one else topped two percent on the second ballot question.

The former president’s strong performance on the unscientific survey comes as no surprise. CPAC, long the largest and most influential gathering of conservative leaders and activists, has become a Trumpfest since his 2016 presidential election victory.

In a separate question on whom CPAC attendees would like to see as Trump's running mate in 2024 if he launches a campaign, DeSantis grabbed 43% support, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem at 9%, and Pompeo at 7%.

No one else topped four percent on the running mate ballot question.

Voting on the CPAC Texas straw poll ballot was only open to attendees of the confab, with voting once again conducted through the CPAC app.

Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which runs CPAC, said ""there's an unbreakable bond between President Tump and the conservative movement. He simply did the things he promised to do and for that they are grateful.""

Veteran Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin told Fox News the CPAC straw poll ballot is ""the ultimate barometer of what’s going on in the conservative movement.""

McLaughlin and Associates, which conducted polling for Trump's successful 2016 election and unsuccessful 2020 re-election bid, once again oversaw the CPAC straw poll.

McLaughlin, who’s been attending CPAC for decades, said that ""just like back in the old days when Ronald Reagan defined and was setting the tone for the conservative movement, it’s the same thing right now with Donald Trump.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-wins-cpac-2024-gop-presidential-nomination-straw-poll-desantis-second,N/A
Trump withdraws Mo Brooks endorsement in Alabama Senate Republican primary,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama in the state's open seat GOP Senate primary.

The former president slammed Brooks as ""woke"" and criticized the six-term conservative congressman as disloyal for doubting Trump’s repeated unfounded claims that his 2020 presidential election loss was due to massive voter fraud.

UNDER ATTACK BY TRUMP, GOP GOV. KEMP OF GEORGIA GETS REINFORCEMENTS

""Mo Brooks of Alabama made a horrible mistake recently when he went ‘woke’ and stated, referring to the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, ‘Put that behind you, put that behind you,’"" Trump said in a statement released by his Save America political action committee.

Brooks, at a rally with the former president last August in Cullman, Alabama, was booed by the crowed after he urged them to move past the 2020 election results, to ""put that behind you"" and ""look forward.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2022 MIDTERMS

Trump, in his statement dropping his endorsement of Brooks, wrote that after he heard Brooks’ comments from last summer's rally, ""I said, ‘Mo, you just blew the Election, and there’s nothing you can do about it.’ Very sad but, since he decided to go in another direction, so have I, and I am hereby withdrawing my Endorsement of Mo Brooks for the Senate.""

Trump pledged ""I will be making a new Endorsement in the near future!""

A source close to Brooks told Fox News soon after Trump's announcement that the congressman intends to stay in the Senate race.

And a couple of hours later Brooks said in a statement that ""there’s only one conservative option in this race, and I am confident that the people of Alabama will see that on Election Day.""

""I repeat what has prompted President Trump’s ire. The only legal way America can prevent 2020’s election debacle is for patriotic Americans to focus on and win the 2022 and 2024 elections so that we have the power to enact laws that give us honest and accurate elections,"" Brooks emphasized.

Even with Trump’s endorsement, Brooks struggled with fundraising. And Brooks, the former front-runner in the primary race, now trails by double digits in the polls to his top two rival GOP Senate candidates.

They are Mike Durant, a business executive and former U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter pilot who saw combat in ""Desert Storm"" in Iraq and who survived a crash during fighting in Somalia that was spotlighted in the movie ""Black Hawk Down,"" and Katie Britt, the former president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama and a former chief of staff to longtime Sen. Richard Shelby.

The plunge in the polls by Brooks comes after weeks of television and radio ads slamming him on multiple issues, including anti-Trump comments he made during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, when the congressman was backing Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid.

The winner of May 24 GOP Senate primary in the solidly red state of Alabama will be considered the clear front-runner in November’s general election in the race to succeed Shelby, who’s retiring after serving three and a half decades in the Senate.

Trump’s withdrawal of his endorsement of Brooks was no surprise. Last week the former president for the first time publicly criticized Brooks, calling his Senate campaign ""disappointing"" in an interview with the Washington Examiner where he hinted that he might drop his support of the congressman.

Brooks was a strong Trump ally in the House during Trump’s four years in the White House, and he spoke at the then-president's rally on Jan. 6, 2021, just before the attack on the U.S. Capitol by right wing extremists bent on disrupting congressional certification of now-President Biden's 2020 election victory.

Brooks has long showcased his support and loyalty to the former president since landing Trump’s Senate endorsement last April. This week Brooks is continuing his ""Meet MAGA Mo Townhall Tour"" across the state.

And this week Brooks stepped up his criticism Britt - and of longtime Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, a top intra-Republican Party Trump rival. Brooks’ campaign launched a new ad on Monday that charged McConnell was a ""weak-kneed, debt junkie, open-border RINO Republican.""

Sources close to the former president confirm to Fox News that that Britt met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida last month. And Durant huddled with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday.

Brooks, in his statement continued to target McConnell, arguing that ""it’s disappointing that….President Trump lets Mitch McConnell manipulate him again. Every single negative TV ad against our campaign has come from McConnell and his allies. I wish President Trump wouldn’t fall for McConnell’s ploys, but, once again, he has.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-withdraws-mo-brooks-endorsement-alabama-senate-republican-primary,N/A
Trump's ambassador to Mexico 'hit the roof' after Mexican gov't changed migrant policies: book,"The U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, in the final days of the Trump administration, ""hit the roof"" after Mexico pushed through new legislation in late 2020 that blocked Mexican detention centers from taking back migrants with children, according to a new book on the migrant crisis.

Todd Bensman, a national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, reports in his new book ""Overrun: How Joe Biden Unleashed the Greatest Border Crisis in U.S. History"" on the diplomatic fallout of a law passed in November 2020, just days after President Biden was elected.

The law, ""Various Articles of the Migration Law and the Law on Refugees are Reformed, Complementary Protection and Political Asylum in the Matter of Migrant Children"" went into effect on Jan. 11 2021, and meant that Mexican states had the authority to refuse U.S. expulsions of migrant families under the Title 42 public health order. The most significant of those states was Tamaulipas, one of the main traffic routes for migrants.

""The collective effect of the ‘reforms in favor of migrant children and adolescents, asylum seekers and refugees’ was that thousands of migrant families found that they were not only freed from Mexican detention centers, but that, when they crossed the U.S. border, the Americans would have to keep them,"" Bensman summarizes. ""A massive breach was thus opened into America through which an unremitting onslaught of migrant families would pour for years.""

BIDEN ADMIN TAKES FIRE FROM DEMS, ACTIVISTS FOR ‘SHOCKINGLY INHUMANE’ BORDER POLICY LIMITING ASYLUM CLAIMS

In FY 2021 there were more than 1.7 million migrant encounters -- a new record, which was then exceeded by more than 2.3 million in FY 2022. FY 2023 has so far been on track to exceed that. In recent months the Biden administration has secured more cooperation from Mexico on Title 42 expulsions, which are due to end on May 11.

But the move, which was not loudly trumpeted in the Mexican media, and was lost in the furor over the transition and Jan. 6 riot in the U.S., caused a diplomatic controversy. President Trump’s ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, told Bensman in an interview that he heard of the move in a routine morning meeting shortly before Trump left office.

Bensman reports that Landau felt angered and betrayed that he had never been informed by Mexico about the brewing move.

""I really hit the roof on this,"" Landau said, adding that migration was the most important issue on the bilateral agenda. ""And no one told me it was on the agenda. I remember thinking this is really going to screw us on some of these issues, especially if it’s implemented with any teeth.""

AT ARIZONA BORDER, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARS FROM OFFICIALS ON MASSIVE MIGRANT SURGE

Had he known it was coming, he added, ""I would have been on this like a fly on honey.""

The crisis at the border continues to be an ongoing issue for U.S.-Mexican relations, and for the Biden administration -- which has faced continued political pressure from Republicans and some Democrats on the issue.

This week the administration announced a new rule that would make migrants ineligible for asylum if they had crossed through another country without seeking asylum there and if they enter the U.S. illegally between the ports of entry.

That program, accompanied by an expansion of Title 42 removals to those nationalities, allows for 30,000 migrants to enter the U.S. each month if they meet certain conditions. Republican states are suing, saying the program is unlawful.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-ambassador-mexico-hit-roof-mexican-govt-changed-migrant-policies-book,N/A
White House responds to Trump demanding to terminate parts of the Constitution after ‘Twitter files’ release,"President Biden's White House says former President Donald Trump deserves to be ""universally condemned"" for arguing that parts of the U.S. Constitution should be terminated last week.

Trump made the statement in response to the release of the ""Twitter Files"" on Friday, a trove of documents detailing Twitter's communications on censorship. Trump argued the files showed evidence of ""fraud and deception"" in the 2020 election and went on to argue parts of the Constitution should be terminated to address it.

""So, with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION in working closely with Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party, do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION?"" Trump posted on social media.

""A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,"" he continued. ""Our great 'Founder' did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!""

PENCE ON BACKING TRUMP IN 2024: ‘THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY ELSE I PREFER MORE’

Trump has failed for years to provide evidence to support his claims of fraud in the 2020 election.

TRUMP BLASTED ACROSS MEDIA SPECTRUM OVER REPUBLICANS' MIDTERM PERFORMANCE: ‘BIGGEST LOSER TONIGHT'

The White House struck back at Trump soon after he made the statement, pointing to the Constitution's history as the pillar of American politics.

""The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document that for over 200 years has guaranteed that freedom and the rule of law prevail in our great country. The Constitution brings the American people together – regardless of party – and elected leaders swear to uphold it,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement.

""It’s the ultimate monument to all of the Americans who have given their lives to defeat self-serving despots that abused their power and trampled on fundamental rights. Attacking the Constitution and all it stands for is anathema to the soul of our nation, and should be universally condemned. You cannot only love America when you win.""

Trump's criticism of the Constitution is only the latest move to land him in hot water with not only Democrats but also members of his own party. The former president faced heavy criticism for having dinner with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, last week.

"Trump sues New York attorney general, claims her 'war of intimidation' and 'obsessive pursuit' is illegal","Donald Trump filed a lawsuit in Florida Wednesday against New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he called ""crooked and highly partisan"" and claims is abusing her position to ""recklessly injure"" him, his family, and his business. He also claimed she was attributing to a ""war of intimidation and harassment.""

""Today, I filed a lawsuit in Florida State Circuit Court against the corrupt Attorney General of New York State, Letitia ‘Peekaboo’ James,"" Trump wrote in an email to his supporters.

In the statement, Trump added: ""Crooked and highly partisan James now thinks it is the business of the state of New York to go after my revocable trust and pry into my private estate plan, only to look for ways to recklessly injure me, my family, my businesses, and my tens of millions of supporters.""

The former president used similar language in the lawsuit, in which he alleged James was pursuing ""a relentless, pernicious, public, and unapologetic crusade"" against him ""with the stated goal of destroying him personally, financially, and politically.""

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MANHATTAN DA TRIAL AGAINST TRUMP ORGANIZATION

Trump also contended James’ ""vitriolic and obsessive pursuit"" of him resulted in her taking actions that are not proper ""for a state attorney general.""

In his statement, Trump called New York ""one of the most crime-ridden places on earth with murders, robberies, drug deals, and every other form of crime setting records on a weekly basis,"" and contended James was not doing enough to alleviate this problem.

Trump also claimed the legal pursuit would not be happening if he did not win the presidency in 2016.

""We have to stand up for our country, fight against illegal persecution, and Make America Great Again!"" he concluded.

The president also echoed the statement on Truth Social, his preferred social media platform after his lifetime ban from Twitter.

The lawsuit is the latest in Trump’s legal feud with New York and James, who filed a lawsuit against Trump last month when she accused him and his family of financial fraud. James also referred her findings to the Internal Revenue Service and federal prosecutors.
