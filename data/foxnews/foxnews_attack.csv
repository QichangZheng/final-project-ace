Priscilla Presley watched camel 'attack' her son just days before Lisa Marie’s death: ‘She was traumatized’,"Navarone Garcia, son of Priscilla Presley and half-brother to the late Lisa Marie Presley, almost died in front of his mother after being ""attacked"" by a camel at a California animal sanctuary mere days before his big sister's untimely death, according to the musician.

Garcia, 35, was feeding the camel and when he ran out of food, the animal, which had been previously abused in a circus, became agitated and ""pounced"" on him, all while Priscilla watched on in horror, he said.

In an interview with People magazine, he recalled the camel, who he estimated weighed around 2,000 pounds, ""bit me by the hand and lifted me up almost off my feet. It then dropped me on the ground and pounced. While it was pouncing on me, it literally got my whole head in its mouth and bit me.""

While the attack was happening, he stated that his mother was ""freaking out,"" and that ""she was traumatized.""

PRISCILLA PRESLEY SPEAKS OUT ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LISA MARIE'S 55TH BIRTHDAY

To make matters worse, due to the camel's weight, sanctuary workers were not able to free Garcia – in the end, it was a dog roaming nearby that saved the day.

As he explained it, ""The dog knew something was wrong and was freaking out and going at its face. That's what got the camel off.""

PRISCILLA PRESLEY THANKS FANS FOR SUPPORT AFTER DEATH OF DAUGHTER LISA MARIE: ‘A DARK, PAINSTAKING JOURNEY’

After the attack, Garcia elected to return home to Los Angeles to visit an emergency room there, where he received 34 staples in his head.

While that day very easily could have ended up much worse, tragedy did strike the family days later on Jan. 12 when Lisa Marie passed away at the age of 54.

PRISCILLA PRESLEY DISPUTES LISA MARIE PRESLEY'S TRUST

""I mean, I was happy I survived before,"" Garcia said, ""but now it's like, thank God I survived. My mom would've lost two kids in two weeks.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital earlier this week, Priscilla stressed how important it is to her now to ""keep our family together.""

""From the first moment I held Lisa in my arms, I’ve protected, loved and guided her, as I have my son,"" she stated. ""Our hearts are broken, and I am having to learn to live without my only daughter. We truly love all of you, and we feel your prayers. Thank you so much for caring so deeply for our family.""

Despite some squabbles over the legitimacy of Lisa Marie's will, it appears that the family is putting on a united front.

"Dave Chappelle ‘fully cooperating’ with police in ‘unfortunate and unsettling’ incident, comedian’s rep says","Dave Chappelle refuses to let Tuesday night's physical attack ""overshadow the magic"" of his four performances, a representative for the comedian told Fox News Digital Wednesday.

""Dave Chappelle celebrated four nights of comedy and music, setting record-breaking sales for a comedian at the Hollywood Bowl,"" his representative said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""This run ties Chappelle with Monty Python for the most headlined shows by any comedian at the Hollywood Bowl, reaching 70k fans of diverse backgrounds during the first ‘Netflix Is A Joke: The Festival,’ and he refuses to allow last night’s incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment.

""As unfortunate and unsettling as the incident was, Chappelle went on with the show. Jamie Foxx and Chris Rock helped calm the crowd with humor before Chappelle introduced the last and featured musical guests for the evening, hip-hop artists Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli, a.k.a. ‘Black Star,’ who performed music from their new album – the first in nearly 24 years – which was released on Luminary. Other special comedic guests last night included Earthquake, Leslie Jones, Jeff Ross, Sebastian, Jon Stewart and Michelle Wolf.""

The rep confirmed that Chappelle is fully cooperating with police as the investigation continues.

The suspect in Chappelle's onstage attack was arrested Tuesday around 10:50 p.m. after he allegedly stormed the stage and tackled the comedian. He was subsequently charged with assault with a deadly weapon, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Fox News Digital Wednesday.

Isaiah Lee, 23, was carrying a replica gun with a knife blade inside when he attacked Chappelle during the Hollywood Bowl show, police say. Authorities describe him as a Black male with black hair and brown eyes, who stands 5 feet, 11 inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds. The suspect, who lives in the Los Angeles area, is being held on $30,000 bail.

Chappelle was performing as part of his ""Netflix is a Joke"" tour when he was attacked.

Videos of the incident showed Lee jumping on stage and tackling Chappelle. The suspect was injured and taken from the venue in an ambulance.

He was swiftly taken away by security and other individuals, who repeatedly hit the man just off stage, videos appear to show.

A spokesperson for Netflix told Fox News Digital: ""We care deeply about the safety of creators, and we strongly defend the right of stand-up comedians to perform on stage without fear of violence.""

Immediately following the attack, Chappelle remained on stage and thanked security, before joking about the incident and describing the person who attacked him as a ""trans man.""

Chappelle makes several jokes about the trans community in his standup routine and even boasted during Tuesday night’s performance that he has been recently forced to increase his security amid new threats.

The attack took place toward the end of Chappelle's stand-up routine. The comedian thanked both Busta Rhymes and Jamie Foxx for helping out following the attack.

""Whenever you're in trouble, Jamie Foxx will show up in a sheriff's hat,"" he told the audience.

Heart attack risk can be found through non-invasive calcium score screening scan,"A screen for heart disease is available that may determine your risk of heart disease even before you show signs or symptoms, health experts told Fox News. According to the American heart association, (AHA), this test, also known as a coronary artery calcium (CAC) test, takes CAT scan images of the blood vessels that support the heart muscle. The test looks for buildup of calcified plaque that can affect the flow of blood to the heart. The calcium is composed of cholesterol, fats, calcium and other substances in the blood and is different from the calcium in bones, according to the AHA.

The test involves a CT-scan of the chest that takes about ten minutes to perform and then a score representing the amount of plaque present is assigned to the patient. A higher CAC test score suggests you may be at a higher risk for future heart attack and have a higher chance of significant narrowing in the coronary arteries, according to health experts at the Cleveland Clinic. Depending on your score, your physician will determine the appropriate treatment for you that may include medication or a procedure.

DOES A DAILY ASPIRIN HELP OVER 60S AVOID HEART DISEASE AND STROKE? EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS JUST CHANGED

Health experts said a CAC score of zero means you have no plaque in your arteries and are at low risk for a heart attack. A score from one to 100 is associated with a low to medium risk of a heart attack, and your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes and some other treatment. Scores ranging from 101 to 300 suggest that you may have plaque that is blocking an artery and your chance of having a heart attack is moderate to high, typically warranting further evaluation and treatment. Scores over 300 suggest a large amount of plaque and your chance of heart attack is high. Your healthcare practitioner will likely want immediate follow-up testing and to start treatment at that level, according to health experts.

""A high calcium score correlates quite well with coronary heart disease. It’s not invasive and is a good screening test and sensitive,"" Dr. Ismail El-Hamamsy, MD, PhD, a Randall B. Griepp Professor of cardiovascular surgery and system director of aortic surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told Fox News during an interview. The physician did caution that CAC testing may create anxiety with the potential for over diagnosis and added, ""There will be false positives but you push the investigation further to rule it out."" Dr. El-Hamamsy said tests like a stress test, angiogram, among others, are often used to rule out coronary artery disease following certain CAC scores that indicate a patient may be at risk for disease.

The cardiovascular surgeon also said individuals should be aware of symptoms of coronary artery disease. These include chest pain, pain that radiates to neck, jaw, and left arm as well as shortness of breath, palpitations and fatigue.

DIABETES DRUG LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS IN PEOPLE WITH OBESITY: STUDY

Mike Esse is 69 years old and told Fox News that discussions about available screening tests like CAC testing can save a life. He should know - one discussion he attributed to saving his own life.

Esse explained to Fox News that during a round of golf he told his golf friends that he was taking medication for heart disease and would eventually need one stent due to a ""clogged artery."" That was when Esse’s golf partner told him about how he just had a calcium score test performed and that the test picked up a blockage. ""That led to him getting a stent in his heart and he felt better in just a matter of days,"" Esse told Fox News.

Discussing the calcium test sparked Esse to re-evaluate his own treatment course. He decided to ask a physician about the test and it led to further evaluation, which ""turned the entire conversation around."" The tests revealed Esse needed not one stent, but a triple bypass surgery due to three blocked arteries. ""That conversation about that calcium score test saved my life,"" Esse told Fox News.

According to the Cleveland clinic, your doctor may suggest a CAC test if you:

Have a family history of heart conditions

Have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes

Are overweight and lead a sedentary lifestyle

Are middle-aged

History of smoking

Health experts told Fox News it is important to speak to your doctor to see if a CAC test is appropriate for you. Experts say you do not need to have symptoms to get this procedure.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/heart-attack-risk-calcium-score-screening-scan,N/A
Hunter in Georgia recovering after three dogs attacked him 'in a complete frenzy',"A man in Georgia is recovering after three dogs attacked him in January while he was attempting to take down his hunting equipment.

The man, a 61-year-old businessman from Atlanta who wished to be identified only as ""Scott B.,"" was moving his ladder stand when he noticed three dogs approaching him, he told Field & Stream magazine.

The attack took place north of Jefferson, Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state.

Scott B. said he'd been hunting at that location for seven years.

FACEBOOK COMMUNITY RUSHES TO AID GEORGIA BOY WHO WAS MAULED BY THREE PIT BULLS

""One of them came in and attacked me. When it did, the other two joined in,"" he said about the dogs.

Two of the dogs were pit bull mixes, while the other was a German shepherd mix, he told Field & Stream.

The dogs were attacking in ""kind of like a wolf mentality"" and ""were in a complete frenzy,"" he said.

""I was doing anything I could to fight them off,"" he told the publication.

The dogs attacked him for about 15 minutes, Scott B. said, before he was able to fight them off with a large stick.

Scott B. explained that he was unarmed and had left his cell phone on his all-terrain vehicle, which was 150 yards away from his ladder stand.

Doctors at the emergency room told Scott B. he had 298 puncture wounds and needed stitches in seven different places.

While fighting off the dogs, he was able to move toward another ladder stand — where he apparently then climbed to safety.

DOGS THAT FATALLY MAULED TENNESSEE TODDLERS, INJURED MOM WERE NEVER VIOLENT, FRIEND SAYS

""They were still biting me, but spinning with that stick kept them from teaming up and keeping me stuck in one place,"" he told Field & Stream.

""As I was going up the ladder stand, I told myself that I really needed to hold on tight to the rungs because the dogs are going to be jumping on my backside and trying to pull me down — and if they did, I’d probably never get away,"" he said.

Scott B. stayed in the ladder stand for about half an hour before attempting to leave.

The dogs, however, were still in the area, and they chased him back up the stand — where he stayed for another half hour.

Eventually, Scott B. was able to run safely to the highway and was able to get the attention of a passing car.

""I just yelled out, ‘I’ve been attacked by a pack of dogs, and I need medical help,'"" he told Field & Stream.

Doctors at the emergency room told Scott B. that he had 298 puncture wounds and needed stitches in seven different places. He also had a severed ligament in his hand.

After he released from the emergency room, Scott B. filed a report with the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.

The three dogs were identified and put into a 10-day rabies quarantine.

The three dogs were euthanized on Feb. 3, the Athens-Banner Herald reported.

Their owner was given citations for owning a dangerous animal, the same outlet reported.

While his physical wounds will heal, Scott B. said that he is hopeful he will once again be able to enjoy the sport he loved.

""I love being in the woods and this attack has certainly had an impact on me psychologically and mentally. I just hope I can go out in the woods again and enjoy myself,"" Scott B. told the Athens-Banner Herald.

He also said that during any future hunting trips, he will make sure he's accompanied by other hunters — and will be carrying additional weapons to prevent any future animal attacks.

Shark attack survivor is on a mission to protect these animals: 'Fear can be a powerful motivator',"Paul de Gelder of California lost two limbs in a sudden and awful shark attack in February 2009 while taking part in a routine underwater exercise as an elite Australian Navy clearance diver.

Others in such a position — after suffering this devastating loss — may have wanted little or nothing to do with sharks.

Yet de Gelder developed a completely different view. He wanted to get closer to the animal — and learn all he could about it.

CLOSE CALL! HAWAII DIVER NEARLY LANDS IN TIGER SHARK'S OPEN MOUTH IN THIS VIDEO

Today, he's passionately devoted to saving sharks all over the world partly because of ""the ripple effect"" their existence has on humans.

He is someone, he said, who ""had my life changed in a very violent, painful and dramatic way,"" he told Fox News Digital in a phone interview a few days ago from his home in California.

""And if I can come from a place where I knew nothing about sharks, I didn't care about them — I figured, if we wiped them all out, then we wouldn't have to worry about being eaten — to going through what I went through and then understanding how actually important they are to the oceans, to the ecosystems and to us as well — if I can work that out, then surely my passion about this subject will relay down onto other people so that they'll want to understand and learn more and protect these animals as well.""

""Fear can be a very powerful motivator … My fear was that I was going to lose my career.""

He added, ""As Steve Irwin said — and this is something that has always stuck with me — ‘If you can make someone fall in love with something, they’ll want to protect it.'""

SHARK CIRCLES NEAR UNSUSPECTING SWIMMERS

And so, ""really my goal here is just to show people the other side of sharks and my really amazing stories about them,"" he said, ""so that they'll potentially fall in love with them and want to protect them, just like I do and all of my friends do on ‘Shark Week.’""

He's doing so every day, through his motivational speaking, his new book, ""Shark: Why We Need to Save the World’s Most Misunderstood Predator"" (HarperCollins), his work for the Discovery Channel on ""Shark Week"" — and countless other endeavors in which he shares his passion for the animal.

Tried to fight back

While de Gelder was on a training exercise as a Navy diver in Sydney Harbor more than 10 years ago, a 9-foot bull shark grabbed him by his arm and leg.

He tried to fight back but was pulled underwater and violently shaken.

Then the shark ripped off most of de Gelder's right arm as well as his right leg.

He spent time during his long, hard recovery learning all about sharks.

""Fear can be a very powerful motivator sometimes,"" he said. ""And my fear was that I was going to lose my career.""

He added, ""I had fought so hard to drag myself up and out of a life where I felt I had no purpose or value, to joining the [Australian] Army and becoming a paratrooper, passing selection for the elite clearance divers and then having this amazing life and purpose — and then, in eight seconds, having all of that stolen away [during the shark attack].""

So it was fear, he said, ""of going back to that life of not having any purpose to training my absolute butt off to prove to the Navy that I could still do my job.""

He said, ""I pulled that off after six months, when a lot of people said it was impossible.""

He left full-time military service in 2012 and was a reserve Navy diver for a few years.

He said he'd have his best buddy taken him to the gym so he ""could work out and learn to use my body again.""

He also said, ""Technology is incredible these days. And the military gave me all the best prosthetics I needed to be able to walk and get exercise and all that. So I used all the tools at my disposal.""

He said he left full-time military service in 2012 and was a reserve Navy diver for a few years.

""Now I live in LA and travel around America speaking and working on ‘Shark Week'"" for the Discovery Channel.

He is also engaged to be married to ""an amazing American girl,"" he said.

How to help

In his view, what can the average person do in regard to sharks and conservation efforts?

""There's a bunch of things that people can do,"" he said.

""Down at the very basic level, for those who don't travel that much or may be landlocked but also love sharks — they can follow all the pages that support shark conservation. They can share the information that they provide and they can sign petitions.""

While ""this may seem small,"" he said, ""the way that things change is when a lot of people do small things consecutively.""

So ""signing these petitions actually really does make a difference in studies for when we want to get more sharks put under the protection act or when we want to change legislation to protect sharks.""

He added, ""The petitions were part of the reason, he said, that America has just come out and said there will be no exports or imports of shark fins, ever — and so, those things really do make a difference.""

""The way that things change is when a lot of people do small things consecutively.""

He also said, ""If you're a little more adventurous — you can go into the shark tourism industry. You can provide your time and have an amazing experience — and that supports them and their conservation efforts.""

He also said that ""moments"" spent near and around sharks — safely, of course — ""are priceless.""

As part of his travels as shark advocate and passionate environmentalist, he has given talks to the United Nations, the U.S. Navy and large corporations and charities.

Now, read these two exclusive excerpts from de Gelder's new book.

‘The perfect predator’ from ‘Sharks’

Paul de Gelder: As a kid I used to dream about a shark eating me alive. But when that nearly happened in 2009, as I encountered that bull shark in Sydney Harbor, it was not a fun experience whatsoever.

That day I found myself on a different tier in the food chain to the one which I’m accustomed to.

You see, we may have cars and phones and even space stations, but when it comes to being a lonely predator, we humans are pretty useless.

""Though some sharks have good eyesight, their sensory organs enable them to detect even the smallest movement or scent before they even see what caused it.""

We’re slow. We’re not as agile as our food.

We’re not even very strong. Our brain and our ability to work together have helped us survive and thrive as a species, but without tools we are a very lame predator.

TEXAS FAMILY'S RING DOORBELL CAMERA CAPTURES BOBCAT PERCHED ON THEIR BACKYARD FENCE: ‘I WAS TERRIFIED’

Not the shark. Millions of years of glorious evolution have crafted the shark into the perfect predator.

Their streamlined body allows them to cruise through the water like a torpedo when it’s time to strike their prey. Their rough skin is so incredibly adapted to swimming that human swimmers have been banned from using imitations of it in competitions.

Though some sharks have good eyesight, their sensory organs enable them to detect even the smallest movement or scent before they even see what caused it. Sharks’ sense of smell is so powerful that they can home in on mates and dinner from miles away.

Their teeth are like rows of the most expensive knives, perfectly adapted for killing their prey — bent back and needle-like for fish, thick and jagged for marine mammals — with powerful snapping jaws or wide gaping mouths depending on the diet of the particular species of shark.

‘Held them hostage' from ‘Sharks’

Paul de Gelder: Of all the creatures on our wonderful planet, I would argue that none has captured the human imagination quite like the shark.

In fact, sharks have kidnapped our imaginations, held them hostage and led to more nightmares than probably any other animal that’s ever existed (a close second would probably be spiders).

Why are we so terrified about being in the water with them?

""What’s out there? Is it hungry? Will it get me? A new environment can always be a little scary.""

You are thousands and thousands of times more likely to die from falling down the stairs than being eaten by a shark, but do you break into a cold sweat every time you go upstairs? When you’re on the stairs, are you in a constant state of fear, worrying what could happen at any second?

For almost all of us the answer is no, but I’m sure most of us have felt that feeling of fear and dread as we step into the ocean. What’s out there? Is it hungry? Will it get me?

A new environment can always be a little scary, and so you can understand why someone who grew up in a landlocked city would be wary of the ocean, but I grew up in and around the sea, and I was bloody terrified of sharks.

"On this day in history, Dec. 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor attack kills 2,403 Americans, launches US into WWII","Imperial Japan launched a devastating Sunday morning surprise attack on the U.S. Navy and other military assets at Pearl Harbor, rousing a ""sleeping giant"" and thrusting an enraged America into World War II, on this day in history, Dec. 7, 1941.

""For nearly two hours, Japanese firepower rained down upon American ships and servicemen,"" reports the National World War II Museum.

The savage raid by aircraft carrier-borne warplanes sunk or damaged 21 U.S. warships — including the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma — destroyed or damaged 347 aircraft, and killed 2,403 Americans.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 6, 1884, WASHINGTON MONUMENT COMPLETED 39 YEARS AFTER CONSTRUCTION BEGAN

""Yesterday, Dec. 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan,"" President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced with determined indignation the following day, while asking Congress for a declaration of war.

""No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.""

That ""righteous might"" of the American people manifested itself in the most remarkable military, industrial, logistical and spiritual mobilization in human history — leading to the liberation of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

""For nearly two hours, Japanese firepower rained down upon American ships and servicemen.""

The Empire of Japan, and fellow Axis Power Nazi Germany, had by the end of 1941 conquered much of Asia, Europe and North Africa — often with frightening ease.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK

The attack on Pearl Harbor was only the spearhead of a much wider and ambitious Japanese offensive across the Pacific Ocean that began on Dec. 7.

Roosevelt ticked off the devastating news in his emergency address on Dec. 8.

""Yesterday the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong: Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.""

""Within days,"" the National World War II Museum notes, ""the Japanese were masters of the Pacific.""

MAN ATTEMPTS FREEDIVING WORLD RECORD, BECOMES LIFELESS UNDERWATER AS OTHERS RUSH TO HIS AID

Japan had already occupied much of China for several years.

German chancellor Adolf Hitler, flush with two years of his own victories, rashly declared war on the United States on Dec. 11. His declaration gave the U.S. justification to enter the European war, too.

The attack on Pearl Harbor proved the greatest miscalculation in military history.

But both Japan and Germany appeared invincible. The United States appeared woefully ill-prepared to enter a global conflict across vast expanses of oceans.

The future of civilization appeared hopeless.

Yet within four years, thanks to America's ""righteous might,"" both Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany lay in smoldering ruins, their ability to wage war destroyed, their conquered lands reclaimed and the hundreds of millions of people freed from domination.

The United States then led the effort to rebuild both nations into major world economies with stable democratic leaderships.

The shape of the future world began to turn in the midst of the attack on Pearl Harbor. American sailors, soldiers and airmen overcame the shock of sudden attack and quickly began to fight back.

Fifteen sailors and one Marine earned the Medal of Honor for heroic actions that day alone.

THE AMAZING STORY OF A WWII VETERAN WHO JOINED IN 1940 AT AGE 14 BECAUSE HE WAS HUNGRY

Among them were Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd, who died commanding the defense from the bridge of the USS Arizona, the first U.S. flag officer killed in any war; Captain Mervyn Bennion, who remained in command of USS West Virginia, saving the ship despite mortal wounds; and Chief Boatswain Edwin Hill, whose remarkable heroics freed the USS Nevada while under attack.

""During the height of the strafing and bombing, Chief Boatswain Hill led his men of the line-handling details of the U.S.S. Nevada to the quays,"" reads his Medal of Honor citation.

The Nevada was now able to set sail. But Hill wasn't done.

He leaped into the water and swam back to his ship to continue the fight.

""Later, while on the forecastle, attempting to let go the anchors, he was blown overboard and killed by the explosion of several bombs,"" the MOH citations notes.

The Nevada was the only battleship to set sail that morning. She went on to distinguished service in the war.

The USS Nevada helped lead the D-Day invasion of Europe in 1944 and the final attacks on the Japanese home islands in the summer of 1945.

Japan had hoped to stun the American people into docility on Dec. 7, 1941.

The USS West Virginia also survived the Pearl Harbor attack, but at the loss of 106 sailors.

"On this day in history, Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade Center bombed in horrific attack","The World Trade Center, located in the heart of Manhattan in New York City, was built in 1966 and instantly became an iconic landmark for the city.

The Twin Towers, as they were known, stood over 1,360 feet above ground — each holding 110 floors.

On this day in history, Feb. 26, 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed — injuring more than 1,000 people.

A LOOK INSIDE ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER, ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SYMBOLIC LANDMARK

The morning of Monday, Feb. 26, 1993, was a winter day just like any other in New York, cold and windy, as thousands of people went to work, according to many reports.

Approximately 50,000 people were inside the World Trade Center complex — more than 40,000 of them in the Twin Towers — according to the 9/11 Memorial website.

At around 12:00 p.m., a group of terrorists, including a man named Ramzi Yousef, drove a van into the public parking garage below the Towers.

SURVIVOR OR 9/11 WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACKS, 1993 BOMBING SEEKS KIDNEY DONOR MATCH

The van exploded roughly 17 minutes after noon — creating a 100-foot crater within the north tower, according to the FBI's website.

Six people near the bomb site were almost immediately killed: John DiGiovanni, Robert Kirkpatrick, Stephen A. Knapp, William Macko, Wilfredo Mercado and Monica Rodriguez Smith.

Stock trader Timothy Lang was parking his car in the garage when the bomb exploded.

9/11 FIREFIGHTER MOURNS HIS TWO FDNY BROTHERS WHO RUSHED INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TO SAVE LIVES

""I was physically lifted off my feet and thrown through the air … My entire body was compressed as though being squeezed completely,"" he recalled to the 9/11 Memorial Museum.

Hundreds of people were injured from smoke inhalation and broken bones.

The mastermind behind the bombing was Ramzi Yousef, who arrived in New York nearly five and a half months prior after learning how to make a bomb in Afghanistan, according to the 9/11 Memorial.

He was working with six other terrorists.

He visited the World Trade Center multiple times leading up to the attack, reports the 9/11 Memorial.

Yousef was later captured in Feb. 1995 and convicted two years later.

In July 1993, the Department of State offered a $2 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Yousef, according to the U.S. Department of State's website.

By this time, Yousef had disappeared underground.

""U.S. law enforcement officials believed that Yousef had escaped to Pakistan, but they had little reliable information about his location,"" the State Department website notes.

Yousef was later captured in Feb. 1995 and convicted two years later, says the FBI's website.

This would not be the only attack on the Twin Towers, however.

Almost 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, in terrorist attacks that shocked the world and triggered major U.S. initiatives to combat terrorism, notes History.com.

The 1993 attack on the World Trade Center was a deadly precursor to the larger attacks of 2001.

""We later learned from Yousef that his Trade Center plot was far more sinister,"" notes the FBI.

DeSantis team slams HuffPost for touting cop-killer's attack on governor: 'Monster killed a police officer',"Twitter users ripped apart a HuffPost article that appeared to take the side of a convicted murderer and death row inmate whose last words to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before execution were, ""s--- our d---s.""

The HuffPost piece framed Donald Dillbeck — a man convicted of two murders, one of which earned him a spot on death row in 1991 — as a victim of DeSantis. The headline stated, ""Florida Executes Man Used As ‘Political Pawn’ By Ron DeSantis.""

The piece’s author Jessica Schulberg wrote, ""Florida on Thursday executed 59-year-old Donald Dillbeck, who was sentenced to death 32 years ago by a non-unanimous jury under a death penalty statute that has since been found unconstitutional.""

FLORIDA COP KILLER ON DEATH ROW EATS LAST MEAL BEFORE EXECUTION

Seeming to criticize the state’s Republican governor in the report, Schulberg added, ""The timing of his execution appears to be part of a push by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to bring back death sentences by non-unanimous juries.""

She added, ""DeSantis, who is expected to run for president, signed Dillbeck’s death warrant last month on the same day that he floated changing state law to allow non-unanimous juries to impose death sentences.""

The author quoted the inmate’s profane last words directed at the governor. Dillbeck reportedly said, ""I know I hurt people when I was young. I really messed up. But I know Ron DeSantis has done a lot worse. He’s taken a lot from a lot of people. I speak for all men, women and children. He’s put his foot on our necks. Ron DeSantis and other people like him can s—k our d—s.""

HuffPost’s framing of the piece on social media drew sharp criticism. The Twitter caption for the article gave no context to the story except for Dillbeck’s condemnation of DeSantis. It said, ""’I know I hurt people when I was young. I really messed up,’ said Donald Dillbeck, who was sentenced to death by a non-unanimous jury. ‘But I know Ron DeSantis has done a lot worse.’""

Combined with Schulberg’s anti-DeSantis headline, the piece prompted Twitter users to accuse the outlet of siding with the convicted murderer over the Republican governor.

In response to the story, DeSantis rapid response director Christina Pushaw listed out the offenses committed by Dillbeck and shamed the outlet for appearing to call him the victim. She tweeted, ""Perspective... this monster killed a police officer, went to jail, escaped, stabbed this mom to death in a parking lot at the Tallahassee Mall at random, and HuffPost thinks HE is the victim.""

FLORIDA TO EXECUTE FIRST INMATE IN 4 YEARS AS STATE LOOKS TO ENACT COUNTRY'S LOWEST DEATH PENALTY THRESHOLD

DeSantis deputy press secretary Jeremy Redfern commented on the outlet’s post, asking, ""What is wrong with you?""

Conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell claimed, ""’This guy killed two people but thinks Ron DeSantis is worse’ stories starting to appear are how you know the left fears DeSantis way more than any other Republican.""

Ryan Petty, the father of one of the Parkland, Florida, shooting victims, slammed HuffPost’s staff, tweeting, ""You people are sick.""

Conservative commentator John Cardillo similarly blasted the article: "".@jessicaschulb is the disgusting piece of trash @HuffPost shill who wrote this dumpster fire but failed to tell you that the savage killer stabbed a young woman to death while on the run as a convicted cop killer."" He added, ""She also omitted the victim’s family’s letter."" Though the article did include a few lines from the letter. They said, ""We were robbed of years of memories with her, and it has been very painful ever since. However, the execution has given us some closure.""

Popular conservative user PoliMath advised both the left and right to not promote the problematic people who side with them politically. He tweeted, ""The left and the right need to be at Grifter Alert Level 5. Do not valorize someone just b/c they say a sentence that you can use to attack your opponents. The grifters know what to say. They can see your eyes light up when they attack your enemies.""

MRC Latino director Jorge Bonilla remarked, ""This is not the own you seem to think it is.""

RedState writer Bonchie incredulously tweeted, ""An actual headline.""

Fox News Digital reached out to HuffPost for a comment on the controversy following their article. The outlet stated, ""We stand firmly behind HuffPost's award-winning reporting on the criminal justice system.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/desantis-team-slams-huffpost-touting-cop-killers-attack-governor-monster-killed-police-officer,N/A
"Paul Pelosi attack was ‘result’ of Republican rhetoric, ‘MAGA terrorism,’ left-wing media figures insist","Left-wing figures attacked the GOP, Trump supporters and other conservatives following the assault on Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, on Friday.

According to San Francisco police, Paul Pelosi was attacked with a hammer by 42-year-old David DePape in the couple’s California home. DePape was arrested, and Paul Pelosi is expected to make a full recovery.

Prior to full details being released regarding the attack and the suspect, some notable public figures immediately blamed Republicans and suggested that this was the result of their political rhetoric.

Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was one of many to respond.

WASHINGTON POST REPORT BLASTED AS ‘PROPAGANDA OPERATION’ FOR TYING PELOSI ATTACK TO ‘YEARS OF GOP DEMONIZING’

""The Republican Party and its mouthpieces now regularly spread hate and deranged conspiracy theories. It is shocking, but not surprising, that violence is the result. As citizens, we must hold them accountable for their words and the actions that follow,"" she tweeted.

Other left-leaning media figures also attacked Republicans in their response to the attack.

""Some GOP like McConnell & Romney, condemned attack on Paul Pelosi. Most remained silent. Others made jokes. Others suggested attacker be released. Others tried to score points by comparing to Rand Paul getting decked by his neighbor. This from the Party of ‘Christian values,’ ""The View"" host Ana Navarro-Cárdenas tweeted.

CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod wrote, ""There are those who will dismiss the meaning of the assault on Pelosi as the act of a lone, unsettled man. But he was echoing far-right conspiracy theories, legitimated by cynical people for their own purposes. There were many hands on that hammer.""

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough criticized the New York Times for not placing the story higher on the front page, claiming that it was proof of how ""numb"" the public has become of ""fascist violence.""

""The New York Times put the attempted assassination of the United States Speaker of the House below the fold. If you want to know just how numb America has become to Trump’s inspiring of fascist violence, here it is,"" Scarborough tweeted.

In June, the New York Times ran the story of the thwarted assassination attempt of Justice Brett Kavanaugh on page 20.

BILL MAHER: THE PAUL PELOSI ATTACK IS LATEST IN THE ‘COLD CIVIL WAR’

""It was an assassination attempt, an extension of January 6th, the full expression of the new mantra of a political party gone insane. Call it that! I WANT Biden to state this MAGA terrorism was inspired by Trump,"" far-left podcast host Keith Olbermann quoted himself from his podcast ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann.""

HuffPost White House correspondent S.V. Dáte wrote, ""People bringing up the left-wing nut who tried to kill Steve Scalise and other Rs are missing the point. The former Republican president and current GOP leader has been stoking political violence since 2015, energetically so since Dec. 19, 2020. There is no analog among Dems.""

Actor Rob Reiner tweeted, ""Donald Trump has been spreading The Big Lie for 2 years. The violent assault on Paul Pelosi and the attempt to murder Speaker Pelosi is directly related to that Lie. Donald Trump is 100% responsible for this and Jan.6. He must be indicted and never be allowed to hold office.""

Former CBS anchor Dan Rather co-authored a piece on ""Political Violence"" with Elliot Kirschner that linked the attack to Jan. 6 and primarily attacked the GOP for fomenting violence.

""We should not be shocked that this happened. We have seen the storm clouds of political violence assemble. There is a direct line from January 6 to today. And it stretches even farther backward. We should be very careful about using the term 'fascism,' but a political system plunging toward normalized violence and instability is one that is taking on very dark undertones,"" Rather and Kirschner wrote.

They added, ""There is a swelling mass hysteria on the political right. It is lubricated by lies, bigotry, misplaced grievances, and apocalyptic rhetoric. It can be found in the memes on social media, the chants of 'lock her up,' the armed patrols of voting drop boxes, and certainly the violent attempted coup at the Capitol.""

Several Republican figures condemned the attack against Paul Pelosi, but some Democratic figures continued to suggest the attack was politically motivated. Though some left-leaning media outlets pointed out that the suspect DePape allegedly took wrote pro-Trump and anti-Democrat blog posts, reports from purported friends of the suspect claimed that he was ""mentally ill.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/paul-pelosi-attack-result-republican-rhetoric-maga-terrorism-left-wing-media-figures-insist,N/A
Diversity professor verbally attacks student after being triggered by term 'terrorist attack': complaint,"A clinical psychologist and professor who teaches a mandatory diversity class at George Washington University allegedly created a hostile environment that promoted violence against civilians, according to a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.

Dr. Lara Sheehi sits on the board of the USA-Palestine Mental Health Network and practices clinically from ""a trans-inclusive feminist and liberation theory model."" She ""works on race and white supremacy,[and] decolonial struggles.""

In one instance raised in the civil rights complaint – Dr. Lara Sheehi – while teaching a course about ""diversity awareness"" and to ""sensitize future therapists to biases"" – allegedly verbally attacked a student as they spoke about terrorist attacks in Israel which have killed civilians, including American citizens.

Sheehi ""took offense at the student’s use of the term ‘terrorist attack,’"" the complaint, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, said. ""The professor then claimed that the student’s comment invoked Islamophobia even though the student never mentioned Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims in her comment.""

Dr. Sheehi also brought in a speaker who ""advocated violence against Israelis—and by extension Jews,"" the complaint said.

One Jewish student said they were ""crying,"" and feeling ""deeply unsettled and unsafe"" after the speaker was brought in.

According to the complaint, when a student told Sheehi they felt ""unsafe in a program that would invite a speaker who endorsed violence against Israeli civilians and who, therefore, may celebrate the murder of her Israeli relatives. In response, Professor Sheehi called the student’s comment a 'damaging Islamophobic anti-Palestinian' comment and added that ‘a stone is nothing compared to an army.’""

""[T]he fact of the matter is that a speaker was brought in [by Sheehi] that advocated violence against Israelis—and by extension Jews—and that is antisemitic, yet is being explained away,"" the student said.

The complaint said the professor retaliated against them when they made complaints to the university.

WOKE’ DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EQUITY CHIEF WRITES ANTI-WHITE POSTS: ‘EXHAUSTED WITH THESE WHITE FOLX’

Sheehi did not immediately respond to a request for comment and George Washington did not immediately answer whether the diversity professor was stripped of academic duties as its own internal investigation begins. However, they referred Fox News to a statement which claimed they were ""committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment where all feel safe and free of harassment, hostility or marginalization.""

Americans as well as civilians in Israel have been targeted with terror attacks funded by Palestinian groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In one of the most infamous terror attacks – the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing – was planned by mastermind Ahlam al-Tamimi.

Tamimi carefully planned how to kill as many victims and children and escorted a suicide bomber to the scene.

The family of an American teenager killed in the attack – Malki Roth – continues to fight for Tamimi to be extradited from Jordan to face justice in the United States.

In other cases, Hamas terrorists would include shrapnel in the bombs that were dipped with rat poison – an anticoagulant – to ensure that victims' struck by the metal expunged in the blast would continue to bleed out, increasing the likelihood of death.

""Hamas has long sought to increase the lethality of its attacks by lacing shrapnel attached to its suicide bombs with chemicals,"" said a report from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Sheehi is being represented by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.

In a statement, they said Sheehi was ""being wrongfully accused of discrimination and antisemitism"" due to ""a larger campaign that is politically and ethnically motivated against Dr. Sheehi because of her scholarship and political activism outside the classroom.""

""We understand that these claims would otherwise not have resulted in such an exaggerated and prejudicial response by [George Washington], nor would they have found traction in public opinion if Dr. Sheehi were not Arab and her scholarship and activism were not focused on Palestine. These slander campaigns, intended to silence dissenting voices, are rooted in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism, a form of racism that silences, excludes, erases, stereotypes, defames, and dehumanizes Arabs and their narratives.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/professor-verbally-attacks-student-triggered-by-term-terrorist-attack-complaint,N/A
TUCKER CARLSON: Democrats will use horrific Paul Pelosi attack to hold onto censorship,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

We've been watching this story all weekend with growing bewilderment. Last Friday morning, as you know, around 2 a.m., police arrived at the home of the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. It's in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. Inside the home, they found Pelosi's 82-year-old husband, Paul, and another man, 40 years younger, called David DePape. Nancy Pelosi was out of town at the time.

In full view of the police, DePape hit Paul Pelosi in the head two times with a hammer. Both Pelosi and DePape were then taken immediately to a local hospital— Pelosi for his head injuries and DePape for reasons that are still not clear. DePape was later charged in federal court with assault and attempted kidnapping. At this point, that's what we can say for certain. David DePape assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer. Apparently, DePape has admitted that in police custody, but beyond those facts, there was much in the story that remains muddy.

How, for example, did DePape get inside the Pelosi home? That's the first question. Last year, ABC News reported what you already guessed, which is that Pelosi has round the clock protection at her houses. ""She has her own security. She has the Capitol Police. They fly all the way out here from Washington, D.C. with her."" And yet in this case, San Francisco D.A. Brooke Jenkins says that there was no security present at the Pelosi home on Friday night. And that's pretty strange because according to multiple accounts, even when Pelosi isn't at home, her houses are well-guarded. Again, as you would expect.

Our friend Harmeet Dhillon told us that when her firm recently tried to serve a lawsuit against Paul Pelosi at various properties he owns, all of them were guarded by ""multiple law enforcement officers on the perimeter."" So how did DePape, get past security that apparently wasn't there? And why wasn't it there if, in fact, it wasn't? We know he got inside and once he was inside, what exactly happened next? Well, accounts of that are changing.

'AMERICAN DREAM' AT STAKE IN HARVARD RACE-BASED ADMISSIONS CASE AT SUPREME COURT, SAY ASIAN AMERICAN LAWMAKERS

At the first press conference on Friday, San Francisco police suggested there was a third person in the home when police arrived and Politico dutifully reported that, ""officers arrived at the house, knocked on the front door and were led inside by an unknown person."" In other words, by a person who was not David DePape or Paul Pelosi. Now, Politico never formally corrected this claim. Instead, just two days later, Politico, the same publication, attacked anyone who repeated its own reporting as a crazed conspiracy monger: ""Pro-Trump commentators weighed in online to raise questions about the investigation based on unfounded and false claims. Among those baseless claims that a third person answered the door when police arrived at the Pelosi home.""

Three separate adjectives, knocking down that idea, but the question remains, was there a third person at the home? We don't know, but it's not crazy to assume there was. Here's how today's charging documents describe the scene inside the house: ""When the door was opened, Pelosi and DePape were both holding a hammer with one hand and DePape had his other hand holding on to Pelosi's forearm. Pelosi greeted the officers. The officers asked them what was going on. DePape responded, everything was good.""

It's an awful scene in some ways, but here's the critical clause: ""when the door was opened."" Well, opened by whom? Common sense suggests it probably couldn't have been Pelosi or Pappy who opened it. They were locked in a life-or-death drama, a struggle, over a hammer. The documents filed today assert that Paul Pelosi had never seen David DePape before yet in Pelosi's 911 call he knew DePape's first name and apparently referred to him as a friend. Here's the audio. This is from a dispatcher relaying Paul Pelosi's call.

OHIO REPUBLICANS PROMOTE MEASURE TO PROHIBIT NONCITIZENS FROM VOTING IN LOCAL ELECTIONS

DISPATCH AUDIO: RP stated that there was a male in the home and that he is going to wait for his wife. He said that he doesn’t know who the male is, but he advised that his name is David and that he is a friend.

What does that mean exactly? Well, again, we don't know, and we can't know. We do know that anyone who has ever met Paul Pelosi can tell you he is an awfully nice man. He's warm, and he's friendly, and he certainly didn't deserve to be hit in the head with a hammer. It's horrifying that he was. But as long as this is a news story with public policy implications, and unfortunately, that's what it's become, it is fair to ask the obvious questions, as you would, about any other violent crime that occurs in America, and especially this one, since so many facts, basic facts seem to be in dispute.

Local KTVU investigative reporter Evan Sernoffsky, for example, initially reported that DePape was ""found in underwear"" when police arrived. Today, Sernoffsky made a specific point of retracting that claim. ""I'm now told by other sources that DePape was not dressed only in his underwear."" Well, okay, fair enough. We'd be satisfied with either explanation. Not really our business. But you can't blame (and this is the point), you can't blame people watching all of this at home for thinking that maybe there's something weird going on here. Parts of the official account don't seem to make any sense.

PAUL PELOSI JR. UPDATES ON FATHER'S CONDITION OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITAL AFTER HAMMER ATTACK

The solution, obviously, is to release the police bodycam footage from last Friday. That's often done immediately in cases like this, cases that attract heavy public scrutiny. Transparency restores the public's faith in the system. It is the only thing that does. In fact, that's the whole point of body cams, to reassure people that they can really know what happened. Transparency is the antidote to ""misinformation."" On the other hand, if you want people to fall headfirst into crazed conspiracy theories, then you would keep lying and hiding things and yet for some reason, the San Francisco Police Department is refusing to release Friday's body cam video.

We learned that today when we filed a records request. No chance, they said. So, until we see that tape, there is a lot that we cannot know, but the main question tonight, (one that's going to affect your life going forward because this story will affect your life), the question is, who exactly is David DePape?

Many in the media seem studiously uninterested. They don't really want to know. At a police press conference last week, a reporter was caught on a hot mic being instructed by someone not to discuss DePape in any great detail. It was left in the end to a journalist who doesn't work for a big media outlet, independent reporter Michael Shellenberger, to fill in some of the blanks. Shellenberger first did the obvious. He went to where DePape was living, across the bay in Berkeley. You're seeing an image of it on your screen right now.

Apparently, DePape was camping full-time in a dilapidated Ken-Kesey-style school bus, complete with a gay pride flag out front and a sign that reads ""Berkeley Stands Against Hate."" Behind the bus hangs a BLM banner. Politically, this picture could not be clearer. You know where this guy stands.

But Shellenberger and others kept digging. They found that DePape was, in fact, well known in the area, in the entire Bay Area, as a hallucinogenic drug enthusiast and a semiprofessional nudist. He often appeared at nudist theme events. Does David DePape have a prior criminal history? That's an obvious question and perhaps a relevant one. But we can't answer it because, once again, authorities in San Francisco have refused to tell us or anyone else.

NANCY PELOSI HUSBAND ATTACK: SAN FRANCISCO DA ANNOUNCES CHARGES AGAINST SUSPECT DAVID DEPAPE

We do know that the people around David DePape believe that he was completely deranged. The ones who knew him best thought that. The San Francisco Chronicle interviewed his ex-girlfriend, who reported that DePape is mentally ill and struggles with drugs. For example, he once thought he was ""Jesus for a year. He's never been able to hold a job,"" said the former girlfriend. ""He has been homeless. This person really does suffer from mental illness and that is probably why he was there at 2 a.m.."" She described him as a ""broken child in an adult body with serious mental problems."" DePape's neighbors, who would know, said more or less the same thing.

REPORTER: Anything strange about him or anything that stood out?

TRISH, DAVID DEPAPE’S NEIGHBOR: There's something strange about the whole household. The entire household is very, very strange.

REPORTER: How about him?

TRISH, DAVID DEPAPE’S NEIGHBOR: He is birds of a feather with akin to them. So, they are just, you know, nudist drug abusers and that's who gravitates toward them.

FLORIDA GIRL, 13, ARRESTED AFTER POSTING THREAT TO BLOW UP SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS 'BORED,' COPS SAY

So, just another homeless, mentally ill drug addict with a fondness for BLM. That's not quite so unusual in San Francisco. Oh, and there's one other highly unsurprising thing about David DePape. He's also an illegal alien. Today, Fox's Bill Melugin learned that DePape, who was originally from Canada, has long overstayed his visa, so he is currently in this country illegally.

So, to restate, the perpetrator in this violent crime against Paul Pelosi is a mentally ill, drug addicted illegal alien nudist who takes hallucinogens and lives in a hippie school bus in Berkeley with a BLM banner and a pride flag out front. Take those uncontested facts and let them rattle around your brain for a moment until a recognizable pattern emerges. What does this sound like to you? If you guessed, this is obviously a textbook case of homegrown right-wing extremism, well, then, obviously, you've been watching a lot of cable news today. Here's a selection:

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN: Is this political violence, in your opinion?

JOHN MILLER: It seems to be clear that the content of his social media and the statements he allegedly made about ""Where's Nancy? We're going to wait for Nancy"" certainly points in that direction.

TIFFANY CROSS, MSNBC: It seems like there's this effort to normalize this kind of behavior and to make Trumpers feel at home and prioritize their feelings.

JEFF ZELENY, MSNBC: This is about election denialism. What has happened over the last two years has seeped into the minds and the thoughts of some unstable people.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: Deranged right-wing fanatics, Trump Media allies and some of the most powerful people in the world were feverishly trying to stir up conspiracy theories that distracted from the central political headline of this story that years of Republican propaganda and Trump fueled fascism led 42-year-old David DePape to break into Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home.

WHITE HOUSE ENCOURAGES VACCINE BOOSTERS: 'AVOID A SPOOKY THANKSGIVING'

Well, to be fair, the fact that Mika Brzezinski has a high paying job does give rise to conspiracy theories. I mean, in a fair society, how could that happen? But it has.

The bottom line is, ladies and gentlemen, the mentally ill, homeless, illegal alien, drug addict who lives in a painted school bus in Berkeley with the BLM flag is actually, despite all appearances, another member of Donald Trump's QAnon army. As CNN commentator David Axelrod put it, ""far-right conspiracy theories"" are to blame here. And of course, Jen Rubin at The Washington Post accused right wing Republicans of ""inciting violence"" against the Pelosi family using this illegal alien, homeless guy on drugs. ""The far-right demonized Pelosi and that led to the attack,"" read a banner on MSNBC.

On what grounds, other than political desperation, are they saying things like this? Well, according to some reports, the homeless, mentally ill, drug addicted illegal alien David DePape somehow maintained websites with right wing content on them. One of these sites was apparently called ""friendy-frens-dot-com"" and the strange thing about that website is that the web address for it was registered back in September, but there's content on the site that is backdated to August and internet archiving services didn't register any content from that blog, apparently David DePape's blog, until October 28. That was the day of DePape's attack on Paul Pelosi.

On October 28, ""friendy-frens-dot-com"" suddenly included a bunch of incoherent posts about UFOs and Peter Navarro. I'm not making that up. Those are the facts. What do they mean? Well, it's a right-wing conspiracy, obviously. Better indict Marjorie Taylor Greene for the crime.

Keep in mind, as you shake your head in bewilderment at all of this, that the midterm elections are next Tuesday and Democrats are in trouble, and they believe the attack on Paul Pelosi might help them. As Margaret Brennan explained over on CBS, because a mentally ill illegal alien attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband is now immoral to criticize the leader of the Democrats a week before an election. Savor this.

MORE LIKELY’ PAUL PELOSI CALLED COPS ON ATTACK SUSPECT DAVID DEPAPE FROM THE BATHROOM: REPORT

MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS: Republican candidates assume more than 116 million on ads that mentioned Speaker Pelosi by name in this cycle. If this is about the issues, why shouldn't make it about the issues? We are 8 days out. Don't you think this needs to change? Why not pull some of these ads.

""Why do you make it about the issues?"" said the lady who spent four years screaming about Donald Trump, the man. It's hilarious and brazen and shameless and the second the midterms are over, they'll stop, but the point is, as always, all the journalists got the same memo and they're all running with the same memo, of course using exactly the same words. Ashley Parker at The Washington Post wrote this, ""In 2022, the GOP spent $40 million vilifying Pelosi in ads and on Friday, her husband was attacked by a hammer."" Do you see the direct correlation?

If you criticize Nancy Pelosi, obviously you're endangering her family. Of course, she does run the political party that's facing re-election right now, that controls the United States Congress. She's third in line for the presidency. But you can't criticize her because if you do, you're just like your acolyte...DePape.

So the Republican Party clearly needs to stop running advertisements that hurt Democrats ahead of the midterms. Please.

That's the problem here, not the mentally ill, BLM nudist in Berkeley. That they're really arguing is in the wake of this attack, which is awful against someone who did not deserve it and we want to be clear about that. Paul Pelosi really is a nice guy. Hard to believe, but he is. But in the wake of that, they're telling you unfortunately, you can no longer have free speech. We can't. They're telling you this is an example of ""stochastic terrorism,"" which is a completely meaningless phrase that emerged like a virus out of the university to infect our public discourse or more precisely, to suppress our public discourse.

SPEAKER PELOSI SEEN VISITING HUSBAND AT SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITAL FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER VIOLENT ATTACK

Reuters has reported that ""terrorism and extremism experts believe it could be an example of the growing threat of so-called stochastic terrorism in which sometimes unstable individuals are inspired to violence by hate speech.""

What is hate speech, by the way? All of a sudden, everyone in the media has sort of, without explaining why, agreed that there's this thing called hate speech that's real and probably actionable. They can find a billion-dollar judgment against you if you commit hate speech, but just to remind everyone watching, there's no such thing as hate speech. Hate speech is speech people hate, usually the people in power. The truth is all speech, except speech that encourages people to imminent illegal action, like ""go shoot that guy"", short of that, there's no hate speech. All of it is allowed under the United States' Constitution, which is our final hope.

But what they're telling you is that dissenting in any way from the editorial positions of, say, The Washington Post or The Daily Beast or The Atlantic Magazine, disagreeing with those publications and the consensus they represent isn't simply immoral. No, it's worse than that. It's violence. It gets people killed. That's the stochastic terrorism. When you question, say, COVID protocols or drag queen story hour or the war against Russia, you are effectively smashing an 82-year-old man in the head with a hammer. They're making that argument.

And of course, they have no choice but to make that argument. Democrats are very worried about the coming elections, but they're absolutely terrified that Elon Musk may allow people to criticize them on Twitter and they know Republicans don't seem to know, which is without censorship, the Democratic Party cannot continue to hold power.

Democrats understand that. They have nothing to offer. They have to stop you from asking questions, so they have to crush Elon Musk, not because he's a right-winger, but because he will allow their opponents to speak. And of course, they are using the attack on poor Paul Pelosi to do just that.

The New York Times has just come out with a piece that says ""Elon Musk in a Tweet, shares a link from a site known to publish fake news."" Really? What did Elon Musk do? Well, he linked to an article about how Paul Pelosi called the guy in his home a friend. Well, that's what the name on one tape says. You can draw your own conclusions or not, or maybe you don't care, which is also fine. How is that fake? Seems to be real. NBC News is Ben Collins explaining that Musk's tweets are ""how you lose a democracy in the age of the internet.""

MONTHS LATER, JEAN-PIERRE STILL PLAYING DODGEBALL AT WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING

Oh, by asking questions. Jimmy Kimmel attacked Musk personally, used to be a comic, sad to watch that decline. ""It's been interesting,"" Kimmel wrote to Musk, ""to watch you blossom from the electric car guy into a fully formed piece of …"" human excrement. Then CNN told its viewers today that in the wake of the attack on Paul Pelosi, Elon Musk no longer let people speak freely on Twitter. That was his plan, but no more. In the wake of the attack on Pelosi, Musk must retain ""what the far-right calls censorship"" The far-right?

We don't need to be far-right to identify the censorship, because censorship is exactly what it is and to restate, Democrats could no longer exist or hold power without it. They need censorship, and they're going to try to use this horrifying crime to hold on to it.

But something else is going on here too, something beneath even all of that. Obviously, by immediately politicizing the attacks, Democrats get a lot potentially, but the main thing they do is effectively obscure the deepest truth of all, which is that what happened to Paul Pelosi is not so unusual anymore. Crime in this country is out of control by every measure. Attacks by the mentally ill, homeless, even non nudist who don't live in buses, but the mentally ill homeless are now their own category. They're a feature of life in our cities, in fact, of every part of this country controlled by the Democratic Party. If you live in one of those places, no matter who you vote for, you know that that's true. You're pushed in front of a subway train by one of them. That's entirely real. Here's one recent and especially awful example from California.

A 54-year-old man and his 22-year-old daughter were just stabbed to death in the parking lot of a Kohl’s in Palmdale by a mentally ill homeless man. Not an unusual story, but a particularly awful one. Here's a local news account:

REPORTER: Residents say there are multiple homeless encampments in the area and that people are known to live out of their cars in the back of this particular parking lot. Everyone said they're shocked by the violence.

CASEY COLLIER, PALMDALE RESIDENT: For me, I was like dumbfounded. This thing like, wait, somebody just got stabbed in broad daylight? I mean, like again, it doesn't matter if it's daylight or nighttime, but the fact that people have the audacity, which means, hey, people don't care, you know, especially when you're dealing with the type of mentality that these homeless people have, they don't care. So, to find out, like, wait a minute, somewhere where I go shopping, to get gas, my bank is right here, but then some dead person is right there. That's infuriating and sad.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS IN LANDMARK CASES THAT COULD END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS

To restate with heartfelt sincerity, we couldn't feel worse about what happened to Paul Pelosi. He didn't deserve it. On the other hand, if you're going to be injured in a violent crime in 2022, not so surprising that that crime was committed by a mentally ill homeless man because so many crimes are committed by mentally ill homeless people. A fact that everyone who lives in the city understands perfectly well and the people who are making it possible, the leaders of the Democratic Party, assiduously ignore.

This summer, a nonprofit director in San Francisco, for example, a man called James Spingola asked two homeless men to move away from the steps of a community center. In response, the homeless man violently beat him with a wooden plank and sent him to the hospital. This happened at 11 a.m. in broad daylight. This happens all the time and here's the point. The psycho drug addled zombies who do it are usually released the same day to do it again. Everyone knows that. It's not an accident. It's the result of policy, policies that Nancy Pelosi supports in her own city.

But in this case, the guy did not walk because it happened in Nancy Pelosi's House. So, the guy is still in jail. He's not benefiting from cashless bail. The police got there in 2 minutes in San Francisco. That's four times faster than the average response time in San Francisco. Four times!

The lesson here couldn't be more obvious and they're screaming is designed to keep you from reaching this conclusion, but here it is, Nancy Pelosi and her party, the Democratic Party – it's not an overstatement to say this – have deliberately created a breakdown in law and order and safety and quality of life in your neighborhood. Yet, they are given special treatment themselves when it happens to them.

So, you can grieve the attack on Paul Pelosi and see it as horrifying because it is and still understand that the response to it would not be extended to you. It's a double standard. It's a two-tiered system of justice. That's completely unacceptable and it's not justice. In fact, it's the opposite.

TRUMP WEIGHS IN ON PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: ‘A TERRIBLE THING’ RAND PAUL'S WIFE SCOLDS CNN REPORTER OVER 2017 COMMENT ABOUT HIS ASSAULT

The media ought to be saying something about this. This is happening. This crime specifically happened, but so many others have happened because of policies designed to allow them to happen and someone in the press should point that out. ""Hey, Paul Pelosi is not the only guy who got attacked by a nut case homeless guy this month,"" but they're not saying that and because they're not saying that Democratic politicians get to skate and not just skate, but to grandstand on Republican violence in ways that any person with a sense of shame would be totally incapable of doing because you'd hate yourself for doing it. But they don't hate themselves. They'll say whatever it takes.

On the very same day that Barack Obama blamed Republicans for assaulting Paul Pelosi, Obama was campaigning in Wisconsin for Tony Evers. Does that name sound familiar? That's the governor who let homicidal mobs take over the city of Kenosha two years ago for political reasons. Watch this.

BARACK OBAMA: We've got politicians who work to stir up division, to try to make us angry and afraid of one another for their own advantage and all of it gets amped up, hyped up 24/7 by social media, because a lot of times those are their for-profit platforms and they find it more profitable to feed you controversy and conflict instead of facts and truth and sometimes it can turn dangerous.

Oh, your speech turns dangerous. Other people are stirring up resentment. Really? No president in American history ever caused, intentionally caused, more racial division, more race hate than Barack Obama did. Of course, it was the key to a second term, obviously. But the solution to something that he did is prohibiting you from saying what you think. Shutting down your constitutionally protected right, your God-given right to say what you think is true is always the solution because they conflate words with violence when it suits them.

In Georgia last week, Barack Obama said Democrats, the party that defunded the police, the Democratic Party, somehow, he said, bears no responsibility for the rise in violent crime all over the country. In fact, Obama pretended Democrats had not voted to defund the police at all. ""Who actually voted against more resources for the police departments?"" he asked.

It's like if you say anything maybe it works. Who oversees Baltimore; Gary, Indiana; Minneapolis; New York; Seattle and Portland, Oregon? How are those cities doing? Speaking of shamelessness, Kathy Hochul just went to on Al Sharpton's show to claim that the crime wave, the one that you're watching, the one that may have hurt you or killed one of your neighbors, it's all fake, in the statement that is crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever thought.

GOV. HOCHUL: They have a conspiracy going all across America to try and convince people that in Democratic states, they are not is safe. Well, guess what? They're also not only election deniers, they're data deniers. The data shows that shootings and murders are down in our state by 15%, even in New York City, down 20% on Long Island, where Lee Zeldin comes from.

That's just a lie, actually. New York is so dangerous that people are leaving. Rents haven't gone down because foreign investors are buying up a lot of the buildings, but people are leaving New York in droves. Of course, but according to Kathy Hochul in a claim that is truly crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever even thought in the shower to himself, Kathy Hochul is telling you that the data are fake. So here you have a city in which, New York City, subway ridership has dropped by 40% over the last two years.

Now, according to Kathy Hochul it's not because subway riders are being pushed in front of trains. People are being attacked by mentally a whole homeless. No, it's because apparently millions of New Yorkers are watching Fox News. They've been fooled by right-wing propaganda into thinking the subway is dangerous. That's what she's suggesting.

This is too stupid. This is a lie. Voters know it's a lie and when Democrats get crushed in next week's midterms, it'll be in part because people who live in cities and states run by liberals understand that what happened to Paul Pelosi could very well happen to them, and no one would care. ""Morning Joe"" would pretend it never happened.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-horrific-paul-pelosi-attack-hold-onto-censorship,N/A
Democrats organize bid to extradite Bolsonaro from Florida after Brazilian Capitol attack,"Many Democrats are calling for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to be removed from his Florida getaway after thousands of his supporters attacked the Brazilian Capitol, Presidential Palace and Supreme Court on Sunday.

Bolsonaro offered meager criticism of the riots Sunday evening and denied any involvement in inciting them. Democrats have compared the attack to the pro-Trump storming of the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. Like former President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro refused to concede to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and did not attend his inauguration.

""Two years ago out Capitol was attacked by fanatics, now we are watching it happen in Brazil,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted Sunday ""Solidarity with [President] Lula and the Brazilian people. Democracies around the world must stand united to condemn this attack on democracy.""

""Bolsonaro should not be given refuge in Florida,"" she added.

BRAZIL’S LULA INAUGURATED AS NEW PRESIDENT AFTER BOLSONARO REPORTEDLY FLED TO FLORIDA HOME OF MMA FIGHTER

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, echoed the call.

""The U.S. must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

Castro also called for Bolsonaro to be extradited to Brazil during an appearance on CNN. Omar's office did not immediately respond when asked whether she supported such a move.

GEORGE SANTOS FACES REVIVED FRAUD CASE IN BRAZIL AMID TURMOIL IN WASHINGTON

The rioters, dressed widely in green and yellow, ransacked the insides of the three government buildings, breaking windows and overturning the massive table where the country's Supreme Court convenes.

Images from Sunday's attack show throngs of people storming into the buildings and milling about on the grass outside.

Brazilian authorities were able to retake control of the government buildings by Sunday evening. Brazilian media reported that as many as 1,200 pro-Bolsonaro protesters had been arrested and were being detained at the Brazilian Army headquarters near the capital.

President Biden offered his own condemnation of the attack Sunday evening.

""I condemn the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""Brazil’s democratic institutions have our full support and the will of the Brazilian people must not be undermined. I look forward to continuing to work with President Lula.""

President Lula has vowed consequences for the rioters. He stated that there was ""no precedent in the history of our country"" for the attack on the capital, deriding the riots as ""acts of vandals and fascists.""

Lula also accused the local security forces of acting in ""bad faith or malice"" for mishandling the riots.

""You will see in the images that [police officers] are guiding people on the walk to Praca dos Tres Powers,"" Lula said in a conference. ""We are going to find out who the financiers of these vandals who went to Brasilia are, and they will all pay with the force of law.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-organize-bid-extradite-bolsonaro-florida-brazilian-capitol-attack,N/A
Dems blame attack on GOP rhetoric that turned Pelosi into a target,"Congressional Democrats say the attack on Paul Pelosi is the direct result of a nearly two-decades long campaign to vilify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the living embodiment of what Republicans dislike about the Democratic Party.

""The attack on Speaker Pelosi's family was not a ‘random act,’"" said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ""It was the logical result of a Republican Party that has targeted the speaker and other prominent women in public life for over a decade now, and then gaslights us when we call out its danger.""

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who has been subject to death threats himself, claimed that former President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers had created a political environment in which violence is seen as acceptable.

""We must draw the straight lines that connect violent political rhetoric and violent acts,"" said Swalwell. ""The Pelosi assailant’s Facebook page looks identical to the Facebook pages of Trump, [Georgia Rep. Marjorie] Taylor Greene, and [Colorado Rep. Lauren] Boebert. All three of them have glorified violence and [David] Depape acted on it.""

CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS AGHAST AFTER PELOSI'S HUSBAND ATTACKED DURING BREAK-IN

In the days following the attack, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told the New York Times that the attacks on Pelosi have been ""especially personal,"" and said those attacks have been ""unrelenting.""

Congressional party leaders have long received outsized and at times unfair attention from political opponents.

In the 1980s, Republicans criticized Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas as a tyrant and accused him of corruption over a lucrative book deal. A few years later, after the GOP landslide of 1994, Democrats painted GOP Speaker Newt Gingrich as a bully and conservative radical who didn't care about hurting working people by shutting down the government.

Pelosi, who has served in the Democratic leadership since 2001, has gotten attention because of her long tenure and her liberal policy positions. Republicans have long painted the multimillionaire, San Francisco liberal as an out-of-touch elitist.

PAUL PELOSI ATTACK SUSPECT DAVID DEPAPE HAD LIST OF OTHER PEOPLE TO TARGET: POLICE

Republicans have condemned the violence perpetrated against Paul Pelosi, but say it's a stretch to blame that violence on political discourse.

""You can’t say people saying, ‘Let’s fire Pelosi’ or ‘Let’s take back the House’ is saying, ‘Go do violence.’ It’s just unfair and I think we all need to recognize violence is up across the board,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday.""

GOP lawmakers note that Pelosi is not the only political leader to be vilified for political gain.

SPEAKER PELOSI SEEN VISITING HUSBAND AT SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITAL FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER VIOLENT ATTACK

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been accused by Democrats of stealing a Supreme Court seat and attempting to subvert democracy by opposing a federal takeover of elections law. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has been smeared by Democrats as Donald Trump's whipping boy for his close alliance to the former president.

These attacks on Republicans have been cited as a reason why a crazed gunman shot GOP Whip Steve Scalise in 2017.

""There is a double standard here that drives Republicans crazy,"" one centrist GOP lawmaker told Fox News Digital. ""The media is trying to decipher the political affiliation of the Pelosi attacker, but it totally glossed over the fact that a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Steve Scalise.""

Republicans say the double standard was evident over the weekend after Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin was criticized for his response to the attack on Paul Pelosi. Youngkin told an audience at a campaign rally for a Virginia House candidate that while Republicans condemned violence, the party was still working to ensure Pelosi's party loses the upcoming midterm election.

""Speaker Pelosi’s husband had a break-in last night in their house, and he was assaulted,"" said the governor. ""There’s no room for violence anywhere, but we’re going to send her back to be with him in California. That’s what we’re going to go do.""

Democrats were quick to seize on the comments as proof that Republicans were using rhetoric that led to political violence.

"EXCLUSIVE: CIA operators were denied request for help during Benghazi attack, sources say","Fox News has learned from sources who were on the ground in Benghazi that an urgent request from the CIA annex for military back-up during the attack on the U.S. consulate and subsequent attack several hours later on the annex itself was denied by the CIA chain of command -- who also told the CIA operators twice to ""stand down"" rather than help the ambassador's team when shots were heard at approximately 9:40 p.m. in Benghazi on Sept. 11.

Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team who was at the CIA annex about a mile from the U.S. consulate where Ambassador Chris Stevens and his team came under attack. When he and others heard the shots fired, they informed their higher-ups at the annex to tell them what they were hearing and requested permission to go to the consulate and help out. They were told to ""stand down,"" according to sources familiar with the exchange. Soon after, they were again told to ""stand down.""

Woods and at least two others ignored those orders and made their way to the consulate which at that point was on fire. Shots were exchanged. The rescue team from the CIA annex evacuated those who remained at the consulate and Sean Smith, who had been killed in the initial attack. They could not find the ambassador and returned to the CIA annex at about midnight.

At that point, they called again for military support and help because they were taking fire at the CIA safe house, or annex. The request was denied. There were no communications problems at the annex, according those present at the compound. The team was in constant radio contact with their headquarters. In fact, at least one member of the team was on the roof of the annex manning a heavy machine gun when mortars were fired at the CIA compound. The security officer had a laser on the target that was firing and repeatedly requested back-up support from a Spectre gunship, which is commonly used by U.S. Special Operations forces to provide support to Special Operations teams on the ground involved in intense firefights.

CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood, though, denied the claims that requests for support were turned down.

""We can say with confidence that the Agency reacted quickly to aid our colleagues during that terrible evening in Benghazi,"" she said. ""Moreover, no one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need; claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate. In fact, it is important to remember how many lives were saved by courageous Americans who put their own safety at risk that night-and that some of those selfless Americans gave their lives in the effort to rescue their comrades.""

The fighting at the CIA annex went on for more than four hours -- enough time for any planes based in Sigonella Air base, just 480 miles away, to arrive. Fox News has also learned that two separate Tier One Special operations forces were told to wait, among them Delta Force operators.

Watch ""Special Report Investigates: Benghazi -- New Revelations"" on Fox News at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday, 3 p.m. on Sunday and 10 p.m. on Sunday.

A Special Operations team, or CIF which stands for Commanders in Extremis Force, operating in Central Europe had been moved to Sigonella, Italy, but they were never told to deploy. In fact, a Pentagon official says there were never any requests to deploy assets from outside the country. A second force that specializes in counterterrorism rescues was on hand at Sigonella, according to senior military and intelligence sources. According to those sources, they could have flown to Benghazi in less than two hours. They were the same distance to Benghazi as those that were sent from Tripoli. Spectre gunships are commonly used by the Special Operations community to provide close air support.

According to sources on the ground during the attack, the special operator on the roof of the CIA annex had visual contact and a laser pointing at the Libyan mortar team that was targeting the CIA annex. The operators were calling in coordinates of where the Libyan forces were firing from.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday that there was not a clear enough picture of what was occurring on the ground in Benghazi to send help.

""There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on here,"" Panetta said Thursday. ""But the basic principle here ... is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on.""

U.S. officials argue that there was a period of several hours when the fighting stopped before the mortars were fired at the annex, leading officials to believe the attack was over.

Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones redirected to Benghazi shortly after the attack on the consulate began. They were already in the vicinity. The second surveillance craft was sent to relieve the first drone, perhaps due to fuel issues. Both were capable of sending real time visuals back to U.S. officials in Washington, D.C. Any U.S. official or agency with the proper clearance, including the White House Situation Room, State Department, CIA, Pentagon and others, could call up that video in real time on their computers.

Tyrone Woods was later joined at the scene by fellow former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, who was sent in from Tripoli as part of a Global Response Staff or GRS that provides security to CIA case officers and provides countersurveillance and surveillance protection. They were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, nearly seven hours after the attack on the consulate began -- a window that represented more than enough time for the U.S. military to send back-up from nearby bases in Europe, according to sources familiar with Special Operations. Four mortars were fired at the annex. The first one struck outside the annex. Three more hit the annex.

A motorcade of dozens of Libyan vehicles, some mounted with 50 caliber machine guns, belonging to the February 17th Brigades, a Libyan militia which is friendly to the U.S., finally showed up at the CIA annex at approximately 3 a.m. An American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrived at the Benghazi airport at 2 a.m. (four hours after the initial attack on the consulate) and was delayed for 45 minutes at the airport because they could not at first get transportation, allegedly due to confusion among Libyan militias who were supposed to escort them to the annex, according to Benghazi sources.

The American special operators, Woods, Doherty and at least two others were part of the Global Response Staff, a CIA element, based at the CIA annex and were protecting CIA operators who were part of a mission to track and repurchase arms in Benghazi that had proliferated in the wake of Muammar Qaddafi's fall. Part of their mission was to find the more than 20,000 missing MANPADS, or shoulder-held missiles capable of bringing down a commercial aircraft. According to a source on the ground at the time of the attack, the team inside the CIA annex had captured three Libyan attackers and was forced to hand them over to the Libyans. U.S. officials do not know what happened to those three attackers and whether they were released by the Libyan forces.

Fox News has also learned that Stevens was in Benghazi that day to be present at the opening of an English-language school being started by the Libyan farmer who helped save an American pilot who had been shot down by pro-Qaddafi forces during the initial war to overthrow the regime. That farmer saved the life of the American pilot and the ambassador wanted to be present to launch the Libyan rescuer's new school.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-cia-operators-were-denied-request-for-help-during-benghazi-attack-sources-say,N/A
"FAA outage: White House says 'no evidence of cyber attack,' Biden briefed on grounded flights","The White House announced Wednesday that President Biden has been briefed on the massive FAA outage, though asserting that there’s no evidence it was caused by any cyberattack.

""The President has been briefed by the Secretary of Transportation this morning on the FAA system outage,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted before 7:40 a.m. ET. ""There is no evidence of a cyberattack at this point, but the President directed DOT [Department of Transportation] to conduct a full investigation into the causes. The FAA will provide regular updates.""

An FAA system failure prompted massive flight delays Wednesday morning. All domestic departures were grounded until 9 a.m. ET, though the Federal Aviation Administration said some departures were resuming at Newark Liberty and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airports ""due to air traffic congestion in those areas.""

The FAA said it was working to fully restore the Notice to Air Missions system following an outage.

BIDEN WANTS YOU TO WALK, BIKE MORE TO ELIMINATE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS BY 2050

There is a growing chorus of pilots who call today's FAA ground stop of all U.S. flights an ""overreaction.""

Multiple pilots who spoke to Fox News under the condition of anonymity say there are plenty of backup systems in place, such as the radio to be able to send non-emergency advisories, similar to what is found in the NOTAMS (Notice to Air Missions, formerly known as Notice to Airmen).

An important part of all pre-flight planning, this is a non-emergency advisory system to notify pilots about issues that will impact their flight, including closed runway, weather hazards, military operations, forest fires and reducing visibility among others. It was designed to ensure safe operations in flight.

""They didn't have to ground all the flights. We would have been fine,"" one pilot said.

The FAA had ordered airlines to pause all domestic departures until 9 a.m. ET ""to allow the agency to validate the integrity of flight and safety information.""

At 8 a.m. ET, there were more than 2,500 delayed flights within, into or out of the United States, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware, exceeding the number of all delayed flights on the previous day. More than 150 have been canceled. Those numbers are likely to grow.

More than 21,000 flights were scheduled to take off in the U.S. today, mostly domestic trips, and about 1,840 international flights expected to fly to the U.S., according to aviation data firm Cirium.

Biden addressed the FAA issue Wednesday before leaving the White House. He said he had just been briefed by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who told him they still had not identified what went wrong.

""I just spoke to Buttigieg. They don’t know what the cause is. But I was on the phone with him about 10 minutes,"" Biden said. ""I told him to report directly to me when they find out. Air traffic can still land safely, just not take off right now. We don’t know what the cause of it is.""

Buttigieg said in a tweet that he is in touch with the FAA and monitoring the situation.

Most delays were concentrated along the East Coast, but were beginning to spread west. Inbound international flights into Miami International Airport continued to land, but all departures have been delayed since 6:30 a.m., said airport spokesman Greg Chin.

He Gets Us responds to AOC's attack on Christian Super Bowl ads,"The group behind two commercials promoting the Christian faith that aired during the Super Bowl responded Monday to a series of attacks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and others who took issue with advertisements promoting Jesus as a role model.

""Our research shows that many people's only exposure to Jesus is through Christians who reflect him imperfectly, and too often in ways that create a distorted or incomplete picture of his radical compassion and love for others,"" He Gets Us spokesperson Jason Vanderground told Fox News Digital when asked to respond to ongoing attacks. ""We believe it's more important now than ever for the real, authentic Jesus to be represented in the public marketplace as he is in the Bible.""

He Gets Us, a campaign touting itself as a ""movement to reintroduce people to the Jesus of the Bible and his confounding love and forgiveness,"" aired two advertisement spots during Sunday night's Super Bowl.

The first one is 30 seconds and urges viewers to ""be childlike"" while showing children being helpful and kind to each other and animals. ""Jesus didn't want us to act like adults,"" appears on the screen. ""He gets us. All of us. Jesus.""

AOC CRITICIZES CHRISTIAN SUPER BOWL ADS, SAYS JESUS WOULD NOT FUND COMMERCIALS TO 'MAKE FASCISM LOOK BENIGN'

""On multiple occasions, Jesus used the term 'childlike' to refer to a humble and trusting attitude,"" said Vanderground, referring to the ad. ""Christians often refer to their faith as childlike, being humble enough to place one's trust in a power greater than self.""

The second ad is 60 seconds and is meant to promote inclusion amid perceived division. It shows people arguing and confronting each other angrily until ""Jesus loved the people we hate"" appears onscreen.

""What could possibly be louder and more powerful than hate? Love can. But not just any love. Confounding love. Unconditional love. Sacrificial love. The love we see in Jesus,"" Vanderground said of the longer ad. ""What if we tried to love our enemies the way Jesus loved his? How would it change the tenor of our conflicts and our conversations?""

Despite the messages of love and inclusion, Ocasio-Cortez took issue with the commercials, appearing to liken them to fascism.

""Something tells me Jesus would *not* spend millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads to make fascism look benign,"" the New York Democrat wrote in a tweet.

According to He Gets Us, however, the goal of the ads is anything but fascist.

""He [Jesus] cares about our problems because he has experienced them. He gets us,"" said Vanderground. ""We believe that investing in efforts to ensure more people consider his life and movement as inspiration for their own, will in turn, help improve the lives of those listening — and begin to create the kind of cascade of love Jesus himself sought to generate.""

DEM OPERATIVE MERCILESSLY MOCKED AFTER BLASTING CHRISTIAN SUPER BOWL ADS: 'WOKE CORPORATIONS SPENT MILLIONS'

Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the only Democrat to take issue with the religiously-themed commercials.

A Democratic operative who promoted the false narrative that Border Patrol agents were whipping Haitian migrants similarly attacked He Gets Us on Twitter.

""With the money the 'He Gets Us' people spent on their right-wing Jesus ads, they could permanently house 1,563 people experiencing homelessness,"" wrote Sawyer Hackett, who according to his Twitter profile is a senior adviser to both the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.

It reportedly costs $7 million for 30 seconds of ad time during the Super Bowl broadcast. The He Gets Us spots are part of a multimillion-dollar campaign from the nonprofit Servant Foundation, which also does business as an organization called the Signatry.

Twitter users were quick to note that Hackett didn't take issue with any of the other ads promoting things such as beer or gambling — just the ones promoting Jesus.

""Instead of responding to divisiveness in anger or avoiding conflict altogether, Jesus demonstrated how we can and should show confounding love and respect to one another,"" said Vanderground. ""The goal is that the two commercials will not only inspire those who may be skeptical of Christianity to ask questions and learn more about Jesus, but also encourage Christians to live out their faith even better and exhibit the same confounding love and forgiveness Jesus modeled.""

Vanderground added that the Super Bowl commercials can open a better way to respond to the inevitable adversity that comes with life.

""Many people today have experienced acts of kindness, love and support from others, but they’ve also experienced disagreements, anger, and resentment,"" he said. ""Together, these spots connect the dots on how we can respond better in all circumstances with love and understanding.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/he-gets-us-responds-aocs-attack-christian-super-bowl-ads,N/A
"Illegal migrants wave Venezuelan flag after crossing US southern border, attack Border Patrol agents","A massive group of illegal migrants Monday crossed into the U.S. waving a large Venezuelan flag and, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), attacked Border Patrol agents before being pushed back into the river as agents used crowd-control measures.

The incident, partially caught on video, saw a group of Venezuelan migrants crossing illegally into El Paso, Texas, as they waved the enormous flag. Agents can be seen pushing migrants back into the river while firing pepper balls near them to control the crowd.

In a statement, CBP said a group of Venezuelans had attempted to illegally enter the U.S. while protesting along the Rio Grande’s international boundary.

The agency said one of the protesters assaulted an agent with a flagpole while another threw a rock at agents, injuring one in the process. That in turn led Border Patrol to initiate crowd-control measures.

ICE LAUNCHES ‘TAKEDOWN’ OPERATION IN GUATEMALA TO NAB HUMAN SMUGGLERS AND CORRUPT COPS, RESCUE MIGRANTS

""These measures included the use of the authorized less-lethal force pepperball launching system,"" the statement said. ""The crowd then dispersed and returned to Mexico.""

The agency said that its Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) will review the incident.

The chaotic incident comes as the migrant crisis, which has roiled the southern border since early 2021, continues to see streams of large groups of migrants cross into the U.S. illegally. On Tuesday morning, a group of 300 mostly single adults crossed illegally into Normandy, Texas.

In just the Del Rio Sector alone, Border Patrol reports more than 50 large groups of more than 100 migrants since the beginning of October.

Republicans have laid the blame for the crisis at the feet of the Biden administration, saying that its policies of rolling back Trump-era border security and enforcement have only served to draw more migrants to the southern border – with many of them being released into the U.S.

HOUSE HOMELAND REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM CBP, ICE ON ALLEGED MIGRANT PROCESSING FAILURES

Republican governors have caused outrage from Democratic states by bussing and even flying them to liberal ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions like New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The governors say it has been done to relieve overwhelmed border communities and to bring the crisis home to those areas that describe themselves as welcoming to illegal immigrants.

The Biden administration has taken an approach that has sought to target ""root causes"" of the crisis, like poverty and violence in Central America. It has also emphasized the importance of cooperation with Western Hemisphere countries and recently announced a new cooperative operation with Mexico that sees more resources and checkpoints set up.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS HAVE CASES THROWN OUT OF IMMIGRATION COURT AS DOCS NOT FILED

Controversially, it has also expanded Title 42 expulsions to include Venezuelan nationals, who were previously predominantly being released into the U.S. Now, they are being sent back to Mexico, which is bussing them deeper into the Mexican interior and giving migrants 15 days to get a visa or leave the country.

There were more than 227,000 migrant encounters in September, taking the total number for fiscal year 2022 to more than 2.3 million – a new record high. The administration says it has seen a decrease in the number of Venezuelan crossings in the immediate weeks after the new enforcement operation was put into place.

Meanwhile, Texas authorities have been involved in a number of car chases involving smugglers and illegal immigrants. In Kinney County, the local sheriff’s department pulled over a speeding vehicle with paper plates, finding eight illegal migrants being smuggled inside.

Jan. 6 Committee holds first public hearing investigating attack on the US Capitol,"Lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee, during their Thursday night primetime hearing, said former President Trump ""spurred a mob of domestic enemies"" to attack the Capitol in an effort to ""subvert American democracy"" and overturn the 2020 presidential election.

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., in his opening statement, said Trump ""was at the center of this conspiracy.""

""Ultimately, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, spurred a mob of domestic enemies..to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy,"" Thompson said.

Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., during her opening statement, said Americans Thursday evening would see ""never-before-seen footage of the brutal attack on our Capitol.""

""An attack that unfolded while a few blocks away, President Trump sat watching television in the dining room next to the Oval Office,"" Cheney said. ""You will hear audio from the brave police officers battling for their lives and fighting to defend our democracy against a violent mob Donald Trump refused to call off.""

""There is no room for debate. Those who invaded our capital and battled law enforcement for hours were motivated by what President Trump had told them--that the election was stolen and that he was the rightful president,"" Cheney said.

JAN. 6 COMMITTEE AIMS TO SHOW 'TRUMP WAS AT THE CENTER' OF PLOT TO OVERTURN ELECTION WITH PRIMETIME HEARING

Cheney added: ""President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.""

The Select Committee is played a never-before-seen video of graphic events that transpired during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Thompson, before playing the tape, warned that it ""is hard to watch.""

Lawmakers on the Jan. 6 committee also presented videos of interviews and depositions with former top Trump officials before the select committee.

During his opening statement, Thompson referred to former Attorney General Bill Barr's deposition before the committee.

Barr said he had three discussions with Trump between Election Day 2020 and his early resignation from the Trump administration in December 2020.

""I made it clear I did not agree with the idea that the election was stolen, which, I told the president, was bulls--t,"" Barr said during his deposition. ""And you know, I didn't want to be a part of it, and that's one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when I did.""

Barr added that: ""You can't live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election--that there was fraud in the election.""

Cheney, one of only two Republican members on the committee, also played a clip from Barr's deposition during her opening statement, again undercutting Trump's claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen.

""I repeatedly told the president, in no uncertain terms, that I did not see evidence of fraud and that would have affected the outcome of the election,"" Barr said. ""And frankly, a year and a half later, I haven't seen anything to change my mind on that.""

Cheney presented video testimony from Ivanka Trump on Barr's statement that the Justice Department found ""no fraud sufficient to overturn the election.""

During the video, Ivanka Trump was asked how Barr's statement affected her perspective of the election.

""It affected my perspective,"" she testified. ""I respect Attorney General Barr, so, I accepted what he was saying.""

The committee also played video of the testimony of Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner. Both were members of the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, Cheney said that there is ""no doubt that President Trump was well aware of the violence as it developed.""

""White House staff urged President Trump to intervene and call off the mob,"" Cheney said, presenting a document written by a member of the White House staff ""advising what the president needed to say"" while the attack was underway at the Capitol.

""Anyone who entered the Capitol without proper authority should leave immediately,"" the note Cheney presented read. ""This is exactly what his supporters on Capitol Hill and nationwide were urging the president to do. He would not.""

Cheney also pointed to congressional leaders who ""begged"" Trump for help, including Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who was ""'scared' and called multiple members of President Trump's family after he could not persuade the president himself.""

""Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,"" Cheney said. ""Trump did not call his Secretary of Defense on January 6th. He did not talk to his attorney general. He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security.""

""President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and display and deploy law enforcement assets,"" Cheney said.

Cheney, though, said then-Vice President Mike Pence did contact the Pentagon for assets to protect the Capitol.

Cheney played audio of testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who said Pence ""was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders--there was no question about that.""

Milley said Pence urged then-Defense Secretary Christopher Miller to ""get military down here, get the guard down here, put down this situation.""

In contrast, Milley shared details of his conversation with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

""He said, we have, we have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,"" Milley testified Meadows said. ""We need to establish the narrative that, you know, that the president is still in charge and that things are steady or stable.""

Milley added: ""That's something-- I immediately interpret that as politics, politics, politics. Red flag for me personally.""

The hearing will also feature testimony from two live witnesses — Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards and filmmaker Nick Quested.

But a select committee aide said Wednesday the hearing in general will emphasize ""ongoing threats to our democracy"" related to Trump and Jan. 6.

""The vast majority of the material you will see … is previously unseen,"" a select committee aide said Wednesday. ""Whether it is recording video or audio of witnesses we've interviewed, whether it is records that we've obtained over the course of our investigation.

REP. BANKS SAYS JAN. 6 COMMITTEE IGNORING PHYSICAL SECURITY OF CAPITOL, PLANS REPORT FOCUSING ON THAT ISSUE

""We will be revealing new details showing that the mob on Jan. 6 was the result of a coordinated, multistep effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and stop the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Trump was at the center of that effort.""

Republicans are largely not involved in the committee hearings, as just two sit on the panel: Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger.

Republicans have argued that the committee is not legitimate because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did not seat Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's chosen Republicans on the committee.

Republicans have also argued that the committee is ignoring the physical security of the Capitol to focus on the Trump-related storyline.

""We should study the events that led up to it. Why the Capitol was left unsecured on Jan. 6 when there was intelligence dating back before Jan. 6 something was going to happen,"" GOP Rep. Jim Banks said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR DEMOCRATS IN PRIMETIME CAPITOL RIOT COMMITTEE HEARING

But those supportive of the committee say it is taking Capitol security into account. It has a separate investigative team dedicated to security failures. Republicans are just using that point to deflect from Trump's false claims the election was stolen and alleged culpability in the attack, committee supporters say.

""The Capitol did not attack itself,"" a spokesman for Jan. 6 Committee Ranking Member Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital.

Thursday's hearing is expected to be just one of several televised hearings from the Jan. 6 committee, with the next already announced for Monday and Wednesday next week.

The committee is expected to use their series of hearings to attempt to capture Americans’ attention before the November midterm elections—as they compete with inflation, rising gas prices, shortages in baby formula and more for political attention.

A select committee aide said the Thursday event will serve as an ""opening statement"" to grab Americans' attention and to preview subsequent hearings.

Thursday’s hearing comes after months of interviews, depositions and the committee subpoenaing more than 1,000 people and gathering more than 140,000 documents.

Nancy Pelosi, her daughter said, felt ""guilty"" that her husband was injured by a man who was looking for her.

""I think that weighed really heavy on her soul. I think she felt really guilty. I think that really broke her. Over Thanksgiving, she had priests coming, trying to have an exorcism of the house and having prayer services,"" Alexandra Pelosi told the New York Times.

"Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul Pelosi attacked by suspect David DePape, who shouted, 'Where is Nancy?': source","The husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Paul, was assaulted with a hammer early Friday inside his San Francisco home by an attacker identified by police as David DePape, who a law enforcement source tells Fox News was shouting ""Where is Nancy, where is Nancy?""

San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said DePape, 42, is now facing charges of attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and several other additional felonies stemming from the incident after 2 a.m.

Scott said police responded to a well-being check and found DePape and Paul Pelosi, 82, struggling over a hammer. He said officers then witnessed DePape as he pulled the hammer away from Pelosi and ""violently assaulted"" him.

Officers then immediately tackled DePape, disarmed him and took him into custody, while requesting emergency backup and rendering medical aid at the scene. The motive for the attack remains under investigation.

PAUL PELOSI SAN FRANCISCO ATTACK: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT VIOLENT HOME INVASION

""Early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi,"" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said. ""Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital, where he is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery.""

The spokesman also said, ""The Speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, and request privacy at this time.""

The White House said President Biden ""is praying for Paul Pelosi and for Speaker Pelosi’s whole family"" following the ""horrible attack.""

A source who spoke to Fox News said the intruder confronted the Speaker’s husband shouting, ""Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?""

Two sources with knowledge of the investigation into the attack also told The Associated Press that Paul Pelosi had been specifically targeted and severely beaten with a hammer and had suffered blunt force injuries to his head and body. The sources said Pelosi is being treated for injuries, including bruising and severe swelling.

Authorities found a list of politicians whom DePape wanted to target, sources told KTVU. They also said that authorities found a manifesto belonging to DePape, which contains anti-government beliefs regarding COVID-19 and other conspiracy theories.

Scott said during a Friday night press conference that both Paul Pelosi and DePape both had their hands on the hammer. When officers gave an order for the men to drop the hammer, DePape began attacking Paul Pelosi, who was hit at least one time.

DePape broke into a ""rear entry"" of the home, according Scott.

""This was not a random act. This was intentional. And it's wrong,"" Scott said. ""Everybody should be disgusted about what happened this morning.""

As of Friday night, DePape is in a San Francisco hospital.

Scott said that Paul Pelosi called 911 himself, adding that the 911 operator had an ""intuition"" and identified the call as higher priority than a wellness check, which triggered a bigger response by police.

Drew Hammill, spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement on Friday afternoon that Paul Pelosi is expected to make a full recovery after undergoing surgery to repair a skull fracture as well as other injuries.

""Earlier this morning, Paul Pelosi was attacked at home by an assailant who acted with force, and threatened his life while demanding to see the Speaker,"" Hammill said. ""Mr. Pelosi was admitted to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital where he underwent successful surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. His doctors expect a full recovery.""

""The Speaker and her family are thankful for the outpouring of support and prayers from friends, constituents and people around the country. The Pelosi family is immensely grateful to Mr. Pelosi’s entire medical team and the law enforcement officers who responded to the assault. The family appreciates respect for their privacy during this time,"" Hammill added.

The U.S. Capitol Police said in its own statement that it is ""assisting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the San Francisco Police with a joint investigation into a break-in at the California home of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.""

CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS AGHAST AFTER PELOSI'S HUSBAND ATTACKED DURING BREAK IN

The statement also said that Nancy Pelosi ""was in Washington, D.C. with her protective detail at the time of the overnight, break-in.""

U.S. Capitol Police is conducting a review on security for lawmakers following the attack, according to Punchbowl News.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is also returning to San Francisco on Friday, according to the outlet.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ""What happened to Paul Pelosi was a dastardly act.""

""I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery,"" he said in a statement.

Friday's reported attack is not the first time the Pelosi's Pacific Heights property has been targeted recently.

In 2021, photos surfaced on social media and TMZ showing graffiti on a San Francisco garage door purportedly at the home of the Democratic congressional leader. The apparently spray-painted message read, ""$2K"" with a line through it.

Also scrawled were ""Cancel Rent!"" and ""We want everything!"" Another line appeared to read, ""UBI!"" referring to the concept of universal basic income.

A spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department told Fox News at the time that officers responded to the reported vandalism around 2 a.m. ""Unidentified suspect(s) had painted graffiti on the garage door and left a pig's head on the sidewalk,"" they said.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed reacted to the attack in a statement to Fox News Digital on Friday.

""This was a horrific and scary incident. I have reached out to Speaker Pelosi to offer my support to her and her family. I want to thank the 911 dispatcher, San Francisco Police Department and the San Francisco Fire Department for their quick response to this incident. The Police have the suspect in custody, and as we have more information to share, we will do so,"" Breed said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also reacted to the attack in a statement on Friday.

""This heinous assault is yet another example of the dangerous consequences of the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is putting lives at risk and undermining our very democracy and Democratic institutions. Those who are using their platforms to incite violence must be held to account,"" Newsom said. ""Our leaders should never fear for their safety and the safety of their families in serving the people they were elected to represent – not in their homes, not at the U.S. Capitol, not anywhere.

DePape, 42, used a hammer to attack Paul Pelosi, 82, last October in his San Francisco home. Paul Pelosi underwent emergency surgery on a fractured skull following the attack.

""Did you feel like the Pelosis have done something to you?"" the San Francisco Police Department interviewer asked DePape after the attack.

""Well not me, specifically, to the entire American public, honestly,"" he answered, later adding that Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats are ""f---ing liars.""

When questioned on his intentions, DePape said he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and talk to her, and if she had lied, he intended to break her kneecaps.

""Well, I was basically going to hold her hostage and talk to her,"" DePape said. ""If she told the truth, I'd let her scot-free; if she f---ing lied, I was going to break her kneecaps.""

""I knew beyond a doubt she would f---ing lie,"" he said.

DePape later added that he had ""other targets"" and that he had left his house to ""fight tyranny.""

PAUL PELOSI 911 CALL REVEALED: DAVID DEPAPE HEARD ON PHONE

San Francisco police arrived at Paul Pelosi's home shortly before the attack at around 2:30 a.m. The encounter lasted just 15 seconds from when Paul Pelosi had opened the door for officers to when DePape attacked him with a hammer. The two responding officers captured the recording on their body cameras.

Fox News Digital obtained DePape's police interview on Friday following California Judge Stephen Murphy's ruling that the district attorney's office must make materials regarding the attack public. The materials include police bodycam video, U.S. Capitol Police surveillance video and 911 audio calls.

The San Francisco District Attorney's office initially refused the release by claiming that publicizing the footage would lead to misinformation about the attack. Fox News and other media organizations moved to seek the release of the footage, arguing that it would be in the public interest and would enable them to discredit false narratives about the attack.

DePape was arrested Oct. 28 for allegedly attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer inside the Pelosis' San Francisco home. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., at the time.

Local prosecutors charged DePape with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. DePape has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges that include allegations he sought to kidnap Nancy Pelosi.

In the clip of the 911 call played in court, Paul Pelosi tells the dispatcher, ""There's a gentleman here waiting for my wife to come back, Nancy Pelosi."" He also says he does not know the man.

""I don’t know who he is. He’s telling me not to do anything. He’s telling me to put the phone down and do what he says,"" Paul Pelosi is heard saying. Another voice chimes in, ""My name’s David.""

""He wants me to get off the phone,"" Pelosi adds, according to local reporter Natalie Hanson.

Body-worn camera footage played in court Wednesday reportedly showed DePape striking Paul Pelosi.

San Francisco police officer Kyle Cagney took the stand, describing how he and his partner took about four minutes to respond to the Pelosi residence, which they knew from a prior incident, and rang the doorbell.

The door opened quickly, and he said they saw two men holding onto the same hammer.

About five feet from the threshold, the two men struggled as the officers asked what was going on. DePape said, ""Nothing,"" until taking control of the hammer and striking Pelosi in the head.

Officers are also heard yelling, ""Drop the hammer!,"" and DePape responded, ""Uh, nope.""

The officers quickly tackled DePape, and Pelosi fell to the ground, where he laid facedown and motionless, appearing to be unconscious in a pool of blood, Cagney said.

Cagney also removed from an evidence bag what’s believed to be the hammer used in the attack.

Interviewed while groggy at the hospital afterward, Pelosi told a sergeant that DePape called out, ""Where's Nancy?""

Before the preliminary hearing Wednesday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins already outlined what allegedly happened in a court filing. ""Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?"" DePape allegedly said upon waking 82-year-old Paul Pelosi from his bed that night, according to Jenkins.

Pelosi later told a dispatcher he didn’t know the man, but DePape answered, ""I’m a friend of theirs.""

The filing says DePape later allegedly told officers and medics at the scene, ""I’m sick of the insane f---ing level of lies coming out of Washington, D.C. I came here to have a little chat with his wife.""

Jenkins also cited body-worn camera footage from officers as part of the investigation.

Meanwhile, an FBI affidavit submitted in the federal case cites a recorded interview with San Francisco police detectives afterward. That’s when DePape allegedly told investigators that he viewed Nancy Pelosi as the ""leader of the pack"" of lies told by the Democratic Party and later explained that by breaking the House speaker’s kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress.

The federal indictment also alleges that once DePape was restrained, officers secured a roll of tape, white rope, a second hammer, a pair of rubber and cloth gloves and zip ties from the crime scene, where officers also observed a broken glass door to the back porch.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since issued a detainer for DePape. He is an illegal immigrant from Canada who first entered the U.S. through Mexico in 2008.

Paul Pelosi video shows hammer attack after police arrive,"A California court on Friday released surveillance and bodycam video of the October 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at their San Francisco home.

The San Francisco County Superior Court made the footage public after Judge Stephen Murphy denied a request two days earlier by prosecutors to keep it secret.

The Oct. 28 attack sent Paul Pelosi, 82, to the hospital for emergency surgery on a skull fracture.

One portion of the footage shows police knocking on the door of Pelosi's home, before the door opens to reveal Paul Pelosi and suspect David DePape.

DAVID DEPAPE BREAKING INTO PELOSI HOME CAPTURED ON US CAPITOL POLICE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

""What's going on, man?"" an officer asks.

""Everything is good,"" DePape responds as he and Pelosi each have one hand on a hammer, with DePape also placing a hand on Pelosi's wrist. Pelosi appears to be holding an object in his other hand.

""Drop the hammer!"" the officer then says as he shines his flashlight at the two men.

""Umm, nope,"" DePape responds, before starting to pull the hammer away from Pelosi, who says, ""Hey! Hey, hey, hey!""

The hammer then breaks free and DePape is seen swinging it at Pelosi, who appears to attempt to retreat before being struck.

""Oh, s---!"" one of the officers says as police burst into the home and apprehend DePape.

Another clip, taken in black and white, shows DePape approaching the Pelosis' San Francisco house and dropping multiple bags onto the ground. He then rummaged through the bags before he apparently pulled a hammer out of his clothing and started swinging at a glass door, eventually entering the home.

DePape, 42, has pleaded not guilty to all state charges in the case, including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse. He also has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of assaulting an immediate family member of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal officer for the alleged home invasion.

FEDERAL INDICTMENT REVEALS WHAT PAUL PELOSI ATTACK SUSPECT WAS WEARING WHEN POLICE ARRIVED

Rep. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the incident.

When asked by reporters Friday for her reaction to the footage, she replied, ""I'm not going to say anything right now, but I may shortly.""

Fox News was among the news organizations pushing for the release of the videos.

Audio clips of a 911 call and a San Francisco Police interview with DePape also were released Friday alongside the videos.

""He was asleep. Like all that noise, he could not hear,"" DePape told a detective with the San Francisco Police Department when discussing the initial break-in.

""Until he basically wakes up,"" DePape continued, noting during the interview that Pelosi was in a bed.

""I kind of told him that I'm like looking for Nancy Pelosi and he was like, 'She's not here,' DePape also said. ""He was like, ‘How can we resolve this?'""

When San Francisco police arrived at the home around 2:30 a.m., they found Pelosi in his pajamas and the intruder wearing shorts, sneakers and a sweatshirt, according to court filings.

The encounter lasted just 15 seconds from when Pelosi opened the door for officers to when the hammer attack took place, according to a filing.

""The two officers opened the door to see the foyer of the Pelosi Residence, Mr. Pelosi, wearing a long-sleeved shirt, DEPAPE in shorts, running shoes and a sweatshirt, and DEPAPE and Mr. Pelosi jointly gripping a hammer,"" an indictment read.

The attack caused Pelosi to suffer a skull fracture and other injuries, according to authorities.

Police called an ambulance to treat Pelosi, who was bleeding from a head wound.

Investigators also said that DePape researched homes of Pelosi and two other targets on an alleged hit list two days before breaking into the House speaker’s $8 million hilltop Pacific Heights mansion.

Officers from the U.S. Capitol Police also had live video surveillance outside the Pelosis' San Francisco residence, but weren't watching it when DePape allegedly attacked Paul Pelosi, sources told Fox News shortly after the incident.

The officers were monitoring a live-feed of many cameras, which include surveillance of the Capitol complex, but also monitor some points away from the Capitol, which include the Pelosi residence.

According to sources, an officer was monitoring the feeds and saw police lights on a dark street outside the Pelosi residence. If the officers were watching the feed monitoring in real-time, the break-in would have been seen.

Pelosi argues 'disgraceful' Republican reaction to attack on husband Paul drove voter turnout for Democrats,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued on Sunday that Republicans’ ""disgraceful"" reaction to the attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, inside their San Francisco home drove voter turnout in favor of Democrats.

""Madam Speaker, you alluded to this when I asked about your husband,"" anchor Dana Bash said to Nancy Pelosi on CNN’s ""State of the Union. ""But I just want to ask specifically in kind of point blank about the fact that there has been such extremism, such political violence. And what happened to your husband was horrific. Do you think that that had an impact on voters as they cast their ballots?""

""I know what people tell me -- that's anecdotal -- and we always say the plural of anecdote is not data necessarily, but it is a trend and what I'm hearing,"" Pelosi said. ""But it wasn't just the attack. It was the Republican reaction to it, which was disgraceful. And that I think really the attack is horrible.""

""I mean, imagine what I feel was the one who was the target and my husband paying the price and the traumatic effect on our family. But that trauma is intensified by the ridiculous, disrespectful attitude that the Republicans and there is no nobody disassociating themselves from the horrible response that they gave to it.""

PELOSI REJECTS THE IDEA THAT A TRUMP 2024 RUN WOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS, SUPPORTS BIDEN RE-ELECTION BID

""That turned voters off?"" Bash asked. To which Pelosi responded, ""They tell me so.""

Also asked about the attack on her husband during a separate appearance on ABC’s ""This Week"" on Sunday, the Speaker said Paul Pelosi was slowly recovering before alluding to the attack's impact on voter turnout as well.

""We've been so comforted by the outpouring of prayers and good wishes and even people saying, 'I wasn't going to vote but now I'm going to vote because this has gone too far,'"" she said.

A federal grand jury indicted David DePape, 42, on Wednesday after he allegedly broke into the Pelosis' San Francisco residence on Oct. 28 and violently attacked the Speaker’s husband with a hammer.

Court documents allege DePape intended to take Nancy Pelosi hostage because he was ""sick of the insane f---ing level of lies coming out of Washington, D.C.""

Republicans, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, faced backlash for their remarks regarding the attack while campaigning before the midterms.

Youngkin, whose remarks came at a rally for GOP candidate Yesli Vega, afterward sent a handwritten apology note to the House Speaker. A spokesperson for Pelosi told Fox News that she accepted the apology.

Also on CNN on Sunday, Pelosi resisted Bash’s urging for clarity on whether she will run for Speaker again if Democrats retain control of the House while agreeing again that family and her husband’s recovery would have an impact on any political decision. Pelosi, stressing that it remains too close to call if the Republicans will take over control, admitted that she does not believe Minor Leader Kevin McCarthy is Speaker material.

""You've talked about the need for a vibrant Republican Party. If House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. He's working the phones probably as we speak, trying to firm up the votes he needs to become speaker if Republicans do, in fact, take the House. As somebody who has been speaker for a combined eight years, do you think Kevin McCarthy has what it takes to be speaker of the House?"" Bash asked.

""Let's just get through the election. Okay. They haven't won yet,"" Pelosi said, trying to dodge.

""You are uniquely qualified to understand what it takes to be Speaker of the House,"" Bash insisted. ""Does he have it?""

""But why would I make a judgment about something that may or may not ever happen? No, I don't think he has it,"" Pelosi admitted. ""But that's up to his own people to make a decision as to how they want to be led or otherwise.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-argues-disgraceful-republican-reaction-attack-husband-paul-drove-voter-turnout-democrats,N/A
"Pro-life org, congressman's campaign office vandalized in Jane's Revenge-linked attack","FIRST ON FOX: An office building shared by a pro-life organization and a Michigan Republican's campaign office was vandalized in an attack that appears to be linked to the pro-choice extremist group Jane’s Revenge , Fox News Digital has learned.

Fox News Digital received exclusive photos from the campaign of Rep. Tim Walberg , R-Mich., showing the damage done to the office building they share with the pro-life organization Jackson Right to Life.

""I never shy away from my record as a strong conservative and defender of life,"" Walberg said in a press release exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital. ""This strong record puts me in the crosshairs from those on the radical left but I will never stand down or compromise my convictions and knowing the people at Jackson Right to Life, this will only strengthen their determination to protect the unborn.""

MINNESOTA PREGNANCY CENTER VANDALIZED BY ‘JANE’S REVENGE’: ‘WE SHOULD’VE DONE MORE’

""Proudly, I've been consistently rated as Michigan’s most conservative congressman by the American Conservative Union and despite this intimidation, I will continue to fight for our principles and will stand strongly against the culture of violence and death,"" he continued.

""It is shameful that President Biden and Speaker Pelosi have both refused to condemn these intimidation tactics from radical pro-abortion activists,"" Walberg added. ""This wave of violence across the country against pro-life organizations and individuals has got to stop.""

Jackson Right to Life spokesperson Kathy Potts told Fox News Digital in a phone call that the violence from the ""domestic terrorist group"" will ""never"" deter their work or the work of other pro-life Americans.

""We just feel that it's such a sad state of affairs that let groups like Jane's Revenge are resorting to, like I said, domestic terrorism and hate crimes,"" Potts said. ""And that's what these are.""

""They basically disagree with our beliefs. So, you know, this is how they are responding,"" she continued. ""And they just cannot be tolerated.""

Potts said that the group did not receive a warning ahead of the vandalism and that a lot of people view the vandalism as a response to the leaked Supreme Court abortion decision.

She also said that they ""don't hate"" the vandals and are ""praying for them,"" but also called on federal law enforcement to take action against the vandalism.

""But we will indeed prosecute to the fullest extent of the law when they are held accountable,"" Potts added.

The photos show glass from a broken first-story window inside the congressman’s office as well as the outside of the broken window with glass littering the ground.

Additionally, Jackson Right to Life’s sign was spray-painted with ""Jane’s Revenge"" and the glass of the front door with both the pro-life organization’s name and congressman’s campaign sticker were hit, shattering the glass.

The vandals' attack against both Walberg’s campaign and Jackson Right to Life is the latest instance of political violence against pro-life groups and causes.

Potts also revealed that Jane's Revenge had initially targeted the wrong address, vandalizing a random person's home before actually making it to the office space.

Jane's Revenge grew out of the radical side of the pro-choice crowd that was upset by the leaked draft Supreme Court decision that would gut Roe v. Wade.

Jane’s Revenge was linked to vandalism and destruction against several pro-life groups' buildings across the country already.

The group claimed responsibility for vandalizing Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life last week with the same modus operandi of tagging the outside of the building with graffiti and breaking windows.

San Francisco ‘sanctuary’ policies prevent ICE from interviewing Pelosi attack suspect,"San Francisco’s ""sanctuary"" policies, which forbid cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), prevent federal immigration authorities from interviewing the man suspected of attacking the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

ICE sources told Fox News the San Francisco Sheriff’s Office has denied ICE officials the ability to interview David DePape, a Canadian illegal immigrant who is accused of attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer at his California home.

An ICE spokesperson directed Fox to local officials for more details on the city's policies. San Francisco's Sheriff's Office (SFSO) confirmed to Fox News Digital that a person presenting as an immigration official arrived at the jail Oct. 31 with a business card and no government credentials and was denied access to the jail.

After this article was published, a spokesperson clarified that the person was turned away due to his lack of government credentials – although they likely would have been denied access to the jail if they had provided any such credential if they were engaged in civil immigration enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed last week that DePape entered the U.S. legally across the U.S.-Mexican border on a visitors visa in 2008. He had come across on a B-2 visa, which typically allows Canadian visitors to stay for six months. He then allegedly overstayed that visa.

PELOSI ATTACK SUSPECT DAVID DEPAPE THE LATEST HIGH-PROFILE CRIME INVOLVING AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

DePape is pleading not guilty to charges of attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon , elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder and threats to a public official and her family.

A SFSO spokesperson said employees are not authorized to provide access or information to DHS and ICE employees conducting civil immigration enforcement, including access to inmates, computers, logs, arrest documents, release dates and home or work contact information.

""The policy of the San Francisco Sheriff’s Office is that we refuse ICE employees entry into the jail unless they present a criminal warrant,"" SFSO Director of Communications Tara Moriarty told Fox News Digital. ""Our deputies do not grant ICE access to jail, and employees are not authorized to provide access to those who are conducting civil immigration enforcement.""

PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: GRAND JURY INDICTS DAVID DEPAPE AFTER ALLEGED HAMMER ASSAULT

Jon Feere, a former ICE chief of staff during the Trump administration, said it was ""standard practice"" for ICE to interview jailed illegal immigrants to determine the next steps in the immigration case, and that this can provide ICE with important information.

""ICE is limited by what it can see in its files, and the person's circumstances may have changed since their last interaction with the federal government,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""When you're dealing with our electronic systems, ICE is seeing the fingerprints of an alien arrested by local law enforcement. But a face-to-face interview can confirm a lot of things. And the truth is, with any law enforcement situation, you never know what you're going to uncover during an interview"" he said.

He also said it can uncover ties to other criminal activity.

""Officers learn a lot from the interviews of jailed aliens about how they entered the country or if they have left and reentered who they've been potentially working with, depending on the case,"" Feere said.

But San Francisco is one of a number of jurisdictions that has ""sanctuary"" policies that forbid or limit cooperation with ICE. The state of California has also had sanctuary policies in place for years.

Proponents of sanctuary policies claim they reduce crime by encouraging otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants to cooperate with police. Opponents say it merely protects criminal illegal immigrants from being deported.

YOUNGKIN SENDS HANDWRITTEN APOLOGY TO NANCY PELOSI FOR DIG OVER PAUL PELOSI ATTACK, HOUSE SPEAKER ACCEPTS

Specifically, San Francisco's sanctuary policies will prevent state and local law enforcement from honoring an ICE detainer, a request for law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants so ICE can transfer them into custody and put them into deportation proceedings.

DHS confirmed last week it had issued a detainer on DePape.

""[ICE] lodged an immigration detainer on Canadian national David DePape with San Francisco County Jail Nov. 1, following his Oct. 28 arrest,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

The San Francisco Sheriff’s Office noted to Fox that the detainer would only be an issue if DePape is released from jail and said that whether that detainer would be honored is decided on a case-by-case basis.

""The sheriff reviews ICE requests on a case-by-case basis to determine whether informing ICE of Mr. DePape’s release date, if any, is consistent with our local sanctuary city ordinances,"" Moriarty said. ""The sheriff will evaluate all information, up to the time of any release date, before making that decision.""

However, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins has taken a more direct approach.

""San Francisco is a sanctuary city, and our policy is sacred,"" she told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""We will not be collaborating or coordinating with ICE.""

To Feere and others who oppose sanctuary cities, the DePape case shows the problems with such policies and the risks to public safety involved.

""In the ideal world, this person would have been located, arrested and deported years ago,"" he said. ""That's very difficult to do when you have localities that have no interest in working with ICE and do everything in their power to frustrate ICE's mission.""

Threat to the grid? Details emerge of sniper attack on power station,"Newly reported details about a 52-minute sniper attack on a central California electrical substation last year are raising concerns from Capitol Hill and beyond, amid questions over whether it was the work of terrorists.

The April 16, 2013, attack had not been widely publicized until The Wall Street Journal reported new details in a story on Wednesday. The attack reportedly started when at least one person entered an underground vault to cut telephone cables, and attackers fired more than 100 shots into Pacific Gas & Electric’s Metcalf transmission substation, knocking out 17 transformers. Electric officials were able to avert a blackout, but it took 27 days to repair the damage.

The FBI doesn’t think the incident was a terror attack, an agency spokesman told the Journal. However, Jon Wellinghoff, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the time, disagrees.

Wellinghoff, a now-retired George W. Bush appointee, called it “the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the U.S. power grid that has ever occurred.”

No arrests have been made in the case. But the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee said Wednesday that lawmakers continue to follow the probe and that protecting the grid remains a top priority.

""We are aware of the attack and continue to monitor the investigation closely,” a committee spokeswoman told FoxNews.com. “Committee staff has been briefed by agency officials and industry representatives. The security and reliability of the grid is a pressing concern, and we will continue our work to mitigate all emerging threats.""

Wellinghoff, who spoke to the Journal, based his conclusion that this was terrorism on the analysis of experts he brought to the crime scene. The analysis pointed to the shell casings having no fingerprints and evidence that the shooting positions had been pre-arranged.

Wellinghoff went public with the story after briefing federal agencies, Congress and the White House, citing national security concerns and fear that electric-grid sites don’t have adequate protection.

In addition, retired PG&E executive Mark Johnson said at an industry gathering a few months ago that he feared the attack was a dress rehearsal for a larger event, according to the Journal.

The utility company responded to a call seeking comment by referring FoxNews.com to a statement from the Edison Electric Institute.

""The industry takes its role as critical infrastructure providers very seriously,"" said Scott Aaronson, the institute's senior director of national security policy. ""Publicizing clearly sensitive information about critical infrastructure protection endangers the safety of the American people and the integrity of the grid.”

Joy Ditto, a vice president with the American Public Power Association, told FoxNews.com about a recent meeting on Capitol Hill that dealt specifically with the attack and included a bipartisan group of senators, industry executives and federal agencies.

She said utility companies have been able to prevent such attacks in large part because they share information with related parties.

However, she also said the meeting, which covered a broad range of topics, concluded with a commitment from executives to keep the senators better informed and a desire for additional legislation to legally protect those who share information about issues like attacks and disaster preparation.

“But we’d prefer not to see more regulations,” she said.

Though the attack on the San Jose substation didn’t cause a blackout, isolated incidents have in fact caused major problems on the U.S. electric grid.

In 2003, for example, downed trees toppled transmission lines, creating a series of blackouts across Canada and the eastern U.S. that lasted for days.

Security for the grid has long been a concern for government and the utility industry, but most recently the focus has been on the risk of cyber attacks.

Mike Hyland, an APPA senior vice president, argued Wednesday the industry indeed took notice of the attack but has been on high alert for decades -- responding to such issues as the Y2K computer issue, the 9/11 terror attacks, Hurricane Katrina and most recently Superstorm Sandy.

“The industry has done a good job of keeping security at the forefront,” he said.

After vowing at the ""Save America"" rally in Washington Wednesday he would ""never concede,"" Trump promised on Thursday to offer an orderly transition, despite his grievances, after Congress certified the Electoral College results in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

Between the president’s rally speech and Congress’ certification, chaos broke out at the Capitol when pro-Trump rioters breached security to wreak havoc inside the building -- in some instances defacing the space and stealing property -- prompting lawmakers in the joint session to go into hiding.

Republicans, even staunch Trump allies, spoke out against the president’s response to the riots and continued election challenges.

He added: ""Remember this day forever!""

Before that, he posted a video message to Twitter, addressing supporters, saying: ""I know your pain, I know your hurt.""

Cyber attack on major hospital system could affect 20 million Americans,"A recent ransomware attack on a major health system that operates over 1,000 hospitals and care facilities across 21 states could impact millions of Americans.

CommonSpirit Health was hit with a cyber attack on Oct. 3, which forced the health company to take certain computer systems offline ""as a precautionary step,"" the company said shortly after it learned of the incident.

While it remains unclear whether patient health information was compromised, patients have reported the impacts of the cyber attack on their health care and treatments.

Here’s what to know about the cyber attack.

PRO-RUSSIAN HACKERS CLAIM CYBER ATTACK ON FBI WEBSITE: REPORT

What is CommonSpirit Health?

CommonSpirit, a nonprofit health system based in Chicago, operates 140 hospitals and more than 1,000 care sites across 21 states, the health system says on its website.

In 2019, CommonSpirit treated 20 million patients, according to the website for Dignity Health International, which is part of the CommonSpirit Health family.

What happened?

CommonSpirit’s computer systems were targeted in a ransomware attack in October, interrupting access to electronic health records and delaying patient care in multiple regions.

It’s unclear whether sensitive information about patients was stolen in the cyber attack.

Cybersecurity experts are continuing to investigate.

Who has been affected?

The ransomware attack has had significant consequences on patients after electronic medical records were no longer accessible due to the systems going offline.

Kelley Parsi told WHO-TV that she took her son, Jay, to MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center to be treated for dehydration the same day the facility’s technical issues began. She said a doctor told her that her son was mistakenly given five times what was prescribed for pain medicine after their systems went offline.

Some patients across the country had to delay important surgeries.

Kathy Kellogg was scheduled to have a cancerous tumor on her tongue removed at Virginia Mason Franciscan Health in Seattle but was forced to reschedule due to the CommonSpirit’s system going offline, KING-TV reported.

What is being done?

CommonSpirit released an update on Nov. 9, over a month after the ransomware attack, and said it is still working to bring its systems online and restore full functionality as quickly and safely as possible.

Electronic health records are now available across its system, including at hospitals and clinics, and most patients can again review their medical histories through the patient portal, the health system said, adding that it is working to restore appointment scheduling capabilities to the portal.

PayPal halted the intrusion within two days, reset the passwords for affected users and said no unauthorized transactions were attempted.

How did the hackers breach these accounts?

PayPal's internal investigation revealed that the hackers used a method known as credit stuffing to breach the accounts of these victims. Credential stuffing is when hackers use existing credentials already floating around the dark web to hack into private accounts. They use bots with lists of usernames and passwords acquired in previous data breaches and try the credentials at multiple online services with the hope that customers have not recently changed their passwords. This is where those who use the same passwords across multiple different accounts could run into a big problem.

"California police identify gunman in attack that killed 10 people, injured 10 others in mass shooting","California authorities have identified the suspect in Saturday's mass shooting that killed 10 people and injured 10 others at a ballroom during Lunar New Year celebrations.

Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna identified the suspect as 72-year-old Huu Can Tran.

The identification came hours after the suspect shot and killed himself in a white van in Torrance, about 30 minutes from the shooting location in Monterey Park. Authorities said it was the same van the suspect had used to flee Saturday night's shooting.

Law enforcement officials surrounded the van with tactical vehicles and bomb squad trucks earlier Sunday before entering the vehicle. Luna said several pieces of evidence – including a handgun – were found inside the van linking the suspect to the shooting scene.

Luna said no other suspects are at large and there was ""no longer a threat"" to the community. Authorities have not provided a motive saying the investigation is ongoing.

Seven people remain hospitalized, Luna said. He did not have the exact ages of the victims but said they all appeared to be over 50.

""I still have questions in my mind, which is: What was the motive for the shooter? Did he have a mental illness? Was he a domestic violence abuser? How did he get these guns and was it through legal means or not?"" said Congresswoman Judy Chu, who spoke alongside Luna at Sunday evening's press conference outside Monterey Park City Hall.

Luna said the shooting at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park left five women and five men dead and wounded another 10 people. Then 20 to 30 minutes later, a man with a gun entered the Lai Lai Ballroom in nearby Alhambra.

The suspect entered the Alhambra club with a gun, and people wrested the weapon away from him before he fled, Luna said.

Monterey Park is a city of about 60,000 people on the eastern edge of Los Angeles and is composed mostly of Asian immigrants from China or first-generation Asian Americans. The shooting happened in the heart of its downtown area, where red lanterns decorated the streets for the Lunar New Year festivities. A police car was parked near a large banner that proclaimed ""Happy Year of the Rabbit!""

The celebration in Monterey Park is one of California's largest. Two days of festivities, which have been attended by as many as 100,000 people in past years, were planned, but officials canceled Sunday's events following the shooting.

The shooting occurred at Star Ballroom Dance Studio, a few blocks from city hall on Monterey Park's main thoroughfare of Garvey Avenue, which is dotted with strip malls of small businesses whose signs are in both English and Chinese. Cantonese and Mandarin are both widely spoken, Chinese holidays are celebrated, and Chinese films are screened regularly in the city.

Dramatic new video shows moments before NYC truck attack driver Sayfullo Saipov is shot by police,"Federal prosecutors have released dramatic new footage showing the moments before New York City truck attack driver Sayfullo Saipov was shot by responding officers after allegedly killing eight people along a bike path in 2017.

The release comes as a federal trial is underway for Saipov, an Uzbekistan native who prosecutors say was inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group.

Saipov, who was 29 at the time of the attack, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of murder, but he could face the death penalty if convicted.

In one of the new video clips, Saipov is seen holding what appeared to be two pistols before multiple shots rang out and he tumbled to the ground.

TRIAL BEGINS FOR ACCUSED NYC TRUCK ATTACK DRIVER SAYFULLO SAIPOV

In another, police officers are seen standing over his body after he was struck.

Saipov's attack is being treated as an act of terrorism, and prosecutors say they found multiple notes, written in Arabic, in and near the Home Depot rental vehicle used in the attack, indicating that Saipov had pledged his loyalty to ISIS. Saipov is the first person to face federal charges that could result in the death penalty under President Biden's administration.

WHO IS SAYFULLO SAIPOV?

Eight people were left dead and 12 others injured following the 2017 attack, which took place near the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Of the eight killed, six were tourists from foreign countries, including five from Argentina and one from Belgium.

The Justice Department said that year that a grand jury indictment charged Saipov with ""eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, twelve counts of attempted murder in aid of racketeering, one count of providing and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and one count of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle resulting in death.""

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Li said in his opening statement last week at Saipov’s trial that Saipov ""brought two fake firearms, which looked real"" to the scene of the attack, according to the New York Post.

""He grabbed them, and he burst out of the truck screaming ‘Allahu Akbar,’ a celebratory phrase that other ISIS members have also used when conducting terrorist attacks,"" Li reportedly said. ""A responding NYPD officer ran towards the defendant. The defendant aimed his apparent guns at the officer. The officer fired, hitting the defendant, who went down to the ground.""

"FBI arrests man, woman with 'extremist' views in alleged power grid attack plot targeting 5 substations","The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office officials in Baltimore announced they had arrested two individuals, a man and a woman, with extremist views who were allegedly attempting to attack the power grid in Maryland.

FBI officials told reporters they believe this was a ""real threat"" that had been thwarted.

Sarah Beth Clendaniel, 34, of Catonsville, Maryland, and Brandon Clint Russell, 27, of Orlando, Florida, are charged through a federal criminal complaint with conspiracy to destroy an energy facility, Erek L. Barron, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, and Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski, of the FBI Baltimore Field Office, announced Monday.

NC SUBSTATION SABOTAGE: FBI INVESTIGATING WHETHER RANDOLPH, MOORE COUNTY POWER GRID ATTACKS ARE RELATED

Clendaniel spoke to an FBI informant about her plan just last week, according to authorities. Russell is an alleged neo-Nazi figure who authorities say posted locations of substations.

Clendaniel allegedly told an FBI confidential source that she planned to target five substations including in Norrisville, Reisterstown and Perry Hall, according to an affidavit by Special Agent Patrick W. Straub, of the Joint Terrorism Task Force (""JTTF"") in the FBI Baltimore Division.

If they hit a number of them all in the same day, they ""would completely destroy this whole city,"" and that a ""good four or five shots through the center of them … should make that happen,"" Clendaniel allegedly said. She further added, ""[i]t would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste if we could do that successfully.""

The affidavit reveals the two defendants were in separate prisons for past crimes and communicated online. In messages, Clendaniel allegedly referenced Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Hitler. She was in a Maryland prison for robbing convenience stores with a machete. Russell was in prison for holding bomb making materials.

""This planned attack threatened lives and would have left thousands of Marylanders in the cold and dark,"" Barron said in a statement. ""We are united and committed to using every legal means necessary to disrupt violence, including hate-fueled attacks.""

""The threat posed by domestic violent extremists is evolving and persistent,"" Sobocinski said. ""The FBI will continue to work closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to the safety of our citizens.""

""The accused were not just talking but taking steps to fulfill their threats and further their extremist goals. Russell provided instructions and location information,"" Sobocinski added at a press briefing on Monday. ""He described attacking the power transformers as the greatest thing somebody can do.""

This plot is not related to but comes on the heels of several power grid attacks in North Carolina, Washington, and Oregon late last year.

As alleged in the affidavit, Russell conspired to carry out attacks against critical infrastructure, specifically electrical substations, in furtherance of Russell’s ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist beliefs"" from at least June 2022 to the present.

Russell allegedly posted links to open-source maps of infrastructure, which included the locations of electrical substations, and he described how a small number of attacks on substations could cause a ""cascading failure,"" according to court documents. Russell also allegedly discussed maximizing the impact of the planned attack by hitting multiple substations at one time.

Clendaniel, in collaborating on a plan to carry out the attacks, conspired to secure a weapon and identified five substations she planned to target, according to court documents.

If convicted, Russell and Clendaniel each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to damage an energy facility, prosecutors said.

Clendaniel is scheduled to make an initial court appearance at 2:00 p.m. ET Monday in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore before U.S. Magistrate Judge Brendan Hurson. Russell will have his initial appearance at 1:30 p.m. ET in U.S. District Court in Orlando, Florida.

Exelon released a statement and announced power grid was not disrupted.

""We are thankful for their vigilance and the precautions taken to protect the electric grid for our customers and employees,"" Exelon said in a statement. ""Law enforcement acted before the perpetrators were able to carry out their plan, and there was no damage to any of the substations, nor was any service disrupted.""

""The utility sector has a real problem on its hands. Power stations are an attractive target and domestic terror groups know that destroying this infrastructure can have a crippling effect on industry, citizens, and local governments,"" former Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Brian Harrell, who was appointed in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, told Fox News Digital Monday. ""Attacker(s) undoubtedly understand what to shoot at and what assets are the most critical in a substation. It's difficult to protect all energy assets.

Georgia high school teacher hospitalized after brutal attack by student: 'We need zero tolerance',"Authorities in Rockdale County, Georgia, are reviewing a now-viral video after a student's attack on a teacher left the longtime educator hospitalized.

The video shows an altercation between a student and a teacher, who was identified as English Language Arts teacher Tiwana Turner in a GoFundMe, inside a classroom at Heritage High School on Jan. 26. An argument escalated into a physical attack when the student slammed the classroom door on Turner and then started punching her.

The attack continued into the hallway, where the teacher of 27 years was pulled to the ground and punched repeatedly, resulting in her being hospitalized. The GoFundMe account said she is unable to walk after suffering knee and leg injuries including a broken leg.

Turner's recovery will include ""extensive rehabilitation and therapy,"" and she will not be able to work ""any time soon,"" the account stated.

According to the GoFundMe, Turner was covering another class for a co-worker who was absent that day. When she attempted to ""redirect the off-task behavior"" of a student, she was physically assaulted by the student.

The student is a ninth grader and has been charged with aggravated battery, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Verdaillia Turner, president of the Georgia Federation of Teachers, told Fox 5 Atlanta she was angered by the video and that incidents like that directly contribute to the nationwide teaching shortage.

""Students are out of control…there is no excuse for the violence…there is no excuse for children who are coming into our school daily and wreaking havoc so other students cannot learn,"" she told the outlet.

She added that the environment is the number one problem in the struggle to attract and retain teachers – discipline problems within the classroom.

""When we search the web and just Google ‘student assaults on teachers,’ we’ll see numerous assaults across the country and this is driving teachers out of the classroom,"" Verdaillia said.

"Jacob Blake protests put Kenosha County 'under attack,' officials tell Wisconsin governor","Violent protests sparked by the shooting of a Black man by a White police officer has put Kenosha County, Wis., “under attack,” the county board told Democratic Gov. Tony Evers Wednesday in a letter, which requested that an additional 1,500 National Guard members be dispatched to the area to quell the unrest seen for three consecutive nights.

Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot several times Sunday by Kenosha police officers responding to a domestic dispute in a moment caught on cellphone video. Blake’s family says he was trying to peacefully intervene in the incident when he was shot in the back and is now partially paralyzed, according to reports. The incident has sparked a wave of protests in the county that have turned violent.

Video of the incident – which unfolded as Blake reached into his SUV apparently with his three young sons inside – prompted protests and nighttime looting and unrest in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 people sitting on the shore of Lake Michigan about halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago.

JACOB BLAKE PROTESTS: KENOSHA POLICE HUNT FOR SUSPECT WITH LONG GUN AFTER 2 KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN UNREST

In a letter sent on behalf of the entire county board, Kenosha County Board Chairman John O'Day and Vice Chairwoman Monica Yuhas called on Evers to send additional support for local law enforcement agencies as their county, businesses, and homes remained under attack.

""We, the undersigned, are urgently asking for your swift action to activate more National Guard troops with police powers to be sent to Kenosha County. Our county is under attack. Our businesses are under attack. Our homes are under attack. Our local law enforcement agencies need additional support to help bring civility back to our community,"" O'Day and Yuhas wrote.

""We are formally asking for 1,500 National Guard members with police powers to be sent to Kenosha County immediately. Our county is in a state of emergency and we need additional law enforcement to help preserve and save Kenosha County,” the letter read. ""We encourage you to visit Kenosha County and see firsthand the destruction that has been inflicted on our community.""

The request for 1,500 National Guard troops was the second such letter from the Kenosha County Board. Before a shooting left two dead and a third hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries Tuesday night, the board had requested Evers send at least 2,000 National Guard Troops. Evers initially dispatched 150 troops on Monday and increased that to 250 on Tuesday.

Evers' office has not responded to a Fox News request for comment.

The governor early Tuesday urged protesters to demonstrate peacefully and safely -- adding that he planned to send in additional National Guard troops to ""ensure individuals can exercise their right safely, protect state buildings and critical infrastructure, and support first responders and firefighters.""

""We cannot forget the reason why these protests began, and what we have seen play out over the last two nights and many nights this year is the pain, anguish, and exhaustion of being Black in our state and country,"" he said. ""As I said yesterday, and as I'll reiterate today, everyone should be able to exercise their fundamental right — whether a protester or member of the press — peacefully and safely. We cannot allow the cycle of systemic racism and injustice to continue. We also cannot continue going down this path of damage and destruction.""

Video of the Tuesday-night shooting circulated on social media showing a man with a long-gun being chased down the street by demonstrators before being knocked to the ground and firing into the crowd.

"Wisconsin police investigating after group takes credit for Molotov cocktail attack, warns of more violence","Police in Madison, Wisconsin, are investigating claims reportedly made by a group called ""Jane's Revenge"" that it is behind the arson attack at a pro-life organization office Sunday.

Vandals threw a Molotov cocktail inside the Wisconsin Family Action building and then started a separate fire when it didn't ignite, police told Fox News Digital. Photos showed the exterior of the building was also tagged in cursive: ""if abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either.""

WISCONSIN ANTI-ABORTION GROUP TARGETED IN MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ARSON ATTACK: POLICE

On Tuesday, a group called ""Jane's Revenge,"" a reference to the 1970s-era Jane Collective, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Bellingcat journalist Robert Evans.

A statement attributed to the group predicted there would be more violence against pro-life groups.

""This was only a warning. We demand the disbanding of all anti-choice establishments, fake clinics, and violent anti-choice groups within the next thirty days. This is not a mere ‘difference of opinion,' as some have framed it. We are literally fighting for our lives. We will not sit still while we are killed and forced into servitude,"" the statement said.

""We have run thin on patience and mercy for those who seek to strip us of what little autonomy we have left. As you continue to bomb clinics and assassinate doctors with impunity, so too shall we adopt increasingly extreme tactics to maintain freedom over our own bodies,"" the statement continued.

""We are forced to adopt the minimum military requirement for a political struggle. Again, this was only a warning. Next time the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive. Medical imperialism will not face a passive enemy. Wisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings.""

The statement claimed that ""Jane's Revenge"" is ""in every city.""

"Mexican prison attack death toll up to 17, gang leader one of 25 escapees officials say","Mexican authorities on Monday raised the death toll in a prison attack intended to free a local gang leader across the southern border from El Paso, Texas to 17.

Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said 10 of the dead were prison guards who were attacked by gunmen who arrived early Sunday in armored vehicles and fired on the entrance and inside dormitories.

In total, 25 inmates escaped during the violence. They were members of the Mexicles gang, which Rodríguez associated with the Caborca Cartel. The leader of the Mexicles gang was among those who escaped, she said.

TITLE 42'S END COULD MEAN BIG PAYDAY FOR MEXICAN CARTELS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

The Caborca Cartel had been led by drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was recaptured by authorities in July.

When authorities went inside the prison, they found 10 ""VIP"" cells outfitted with televisions and other comforts. One even had a safe filled with cash. Also found in the prison was cocaine methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and marijuana.

Two other gunmen killed after attacking local police a short time before the attack on the prison were likely a diversion, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said. They were not included in the 17 dead, which were made up of 10 guards and seven inmates.

The state prison was the scene of a riot in August that spread to the streets of Juarez, resulting in nearly a dozen people dead.

Gloria Serge was by a retention pond behind her house in Fort Pierce, Florida, on Monday when the 10-foot-long alligator crawled up from the water and first tried to attack her dog.

The surveillance footage shows the reptile swimming in a direct path toward Serge’s dog before it rises out of the water and scampers up the embankment in pursuit of the animal.

The elderly woman was taken to the ground with the alligator then biting her feet, and then she was dragged into the water. While the woman's body was recovered from the retention pond, the dog survived.

Nancy Pelosi husband attack: San Francisco DA announces charges against suspect David DePape,"San Francisco’s top prosecutor announced a slew of felony charges against Paul Pelosi attack suspect David DePape, a 42-year-old illegal immigrant from Canada accused of breaking into the House Speaker’s home and cracking her husband’s skull with a hammer.

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said DePape broke through a rear glass door and snuck into a sleeping Paul Pelosi's bedroom in the middle of the night during a Monday news briefing. There was no security present at the time, she said.

""The charges that we are filing today include attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder as well as threats to a public official and their family,"" she said.

Earlier in the day, federal prosecutors revealed assault and attempted murder charges against DePape, which carry a combined total of 50 years in prison if convicted. Jenkins cited some of DePape's statements in the federal affidavit as a basis for the state charges, which carry 13 years to life in prison.

Pelosi was wearing a ""loose-fitting pajama shirt and boxer shorts,"" Jenkins said. Pelosi attempted to use a phone in his home elevator but was blocked by DePape, she added, but he went to the bathroom and called 911 from there.

The federal affidavit alleges that DePape told investigators his plan was to ""kneecap"" Speaker Pelosi if he caught her lying.

Jenkins revealed during her news briefing that DePape arrived with at least two hammers and other kidnappings supplies, including zip ties. She said the attack appeared to have been politically motivated and that the Pelosi home was targeted. But she stopped short of characterizing the incident as ""domestic terrorism.""

WATCH DA JENKINS' FULL REMARKS:

She was in Washington, D.C., during the ordeal.

San Francisco police arrived at her home around 2:30 a.m. Friday and found DePape and her 82-year-old husband struggling over a hammer near the front door.

Officers ordered them to drop the item, and DePape allegedly seized control of it and fractured Pelosi’s skull.

Police recovered zip ties in Pelosi’s bedroom, found glass broken at the rear of the house, tape, rope, gloves and a journal, according to the FBI affidavit.

Before Pelosi was taken to a hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery on a fractured skull, he told police from the ambulance that he had never seen DePape before and that the intruder showed up in his bedroom around 2:30 a.m. demanding to talk to ""Nancy"" – the House Speaker.

The lawmaker’s husband told DePape that his wife was out, and DePape allegedly decided to wait for her to return.

""Pelosi stated that his wife would not be home for several days, and then DePape reiterated that he would wait,"" according to the affidavit. Pelosi ""was able to go into the bathroom"" and call 911.

DePape also allegedly admitted to breaking into the home, using the hammer to shatter a glass door and surprising Paul Pelosi in his bedroom. He also allegedly confessed to cracking the 82-year-old's skull.

An Immigrations and Customs Enforcement source told Fox News Monday that DePape is in the U.S. illegally after a ""longtime"" visa overstay.

However, DePape told San Francisco police that ""much like the American founding fathers with the British, he was fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender,"" according to the affidavit.

Jenkins said Monday she will seek to have DePape held without bail. He is due in court tomorrow for an arraignment.

He looked older and larger Monday than he did in prior photos. The judge did not allow journalists to take photos, videos or audio recordings of the arraignment.

After the arraignment, Lipson, the defense attorney, wished Paul Pelosi a speedy recovery.

""Our office has just started representing Mr. DePape, and so what I can say at this point is limited,"" he said. ""What I can say is that our office will carefully examine all the evidence that is presented to us, and will conduct further investigation. From experience, I can say that there’s always more to the story than what is initially reported.""

He asked the public ""not ot pass judgment"" until more information is available.

""There has also been a lot of discussion in the media about Mr. DePape’s vulnerability to propaganda and extreme political views,"" he said. ""Our office will certainly be looking into those issues, but I’m unable to comment further on that because it’s so early in the process.""

The charges carry 30- and 20-year prison terms, respectively, if he is convicted.

The suspect spoke with his attorney, a federal public defender, in hushed tones and only spoke up to tell the court his name during the 10-minute hearing in which he appeared shackled in an orange jail jumpsuit.

"NC substation sabotage: FBI investigating whether Randolph, Moore county power grid attacks are related","The FBI said Wednesday that it is ""too early"" to determine whether gunfire at a substation in Randolph County, North Carolina, this week was connected to December’s attack on the nearby Moore County’s power grid that still hasn’t resulted in any arrests despite causing outages for tens of thousands.

""The FBI is working with the Randolph County Sheriff's Office to investigate after gunfire damaged an EnergyUnited substation on January 17, 2023,"" a spokesperson for the FBI Charlotte Division said in a statement to Fox News Digital Wednesday. ""At this time, it is too early in the investigation to determine whether this case is connected to the ongoing investigation in Moore County.""

On Tuesday morning, EnergyUnited officials responded to an alarm that notified personnel of an equipment issue at its Pleasant Hill Substation in Thomasville, N.C.

Crews found the substation transformer was damaged by gunshots and alerted law enforcement. The Randolph County Sheriff’s Office responded to the scene and suspect the attack occurred around 3 a.m. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force responded to conduct a parallel investigation.

FBI RESPONDS TO GUNFIRE AT ANOTHER NORTH CAROLINA SUBSTATION MONTH AFTER MOORE COUNTY POWER GRID ATTACKS

The incident came nearly two months after Dec. 3 gunfire at several substations operated by Duke Energy in Moore County, N.C., left some 45,000 customers without power for several days. Tuesday’s damage didn’t cause outages.

In an interview with Fox News Digital on Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Brian Harrell, who was appointed in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, speculated that investigators will find ""either a link to domestic terrorism or it is a disgruntled former substation contractor"" behind the attacks.

""If they had somebody, they would have already arrested them,"" Harrell said.

""This has the governor's attention. This has local legislators, Lynn Good at Duke Energy -- It's got everyone's attention. And so if they had some leads, if they knew something, something would have already transpired, I believe,"" he added. ""I think this is why, again, I revert back to either a very sophisticated threat actor who knows something about substations or, in fact, an insider.""

Harrell suspects a ""concerted insider attack,"" involving a person or group with ""intimate, professional knowledge as to what to shoot at, what to destroy, what to disable and how to go undetected.""

""A big part of the DV, domestic violent extremists, playbook right now is to go after critical infrastructure sites and energy is squarely in the crosshairs,"" Harrell noted.

""Right now, there's a lot of chatter on some of these Facebook private portals. You go into some of these dark web areas of the Internet and a lot of it is focused on destroying critical infrastructure, specifically energy and grid components. And so, this is very popular,"" Harrell told Fox News Digital. ""I think for most I call it domestic terrorists or people who want to destroy infrastructure, you know, an easy way to get people's attention is to have them lose their power.""

Harrell explained how all the substations attacked in North Carolina so far are relatively low voltage – not sites holding the most critical assets ensuring the reliability of the electric grid. They’ve happened at substations generally with fewer physical security protections like cameras or intrusion detection. Lower voltage substations are generally remote and unmanned with just a perimeter fence under lock and key and maybe a substation engineer or a security person who comes by on patrol now and again, he said.

""We can't protect all things like castles and fortresses,"" Harrell told Fox News Digital. ""Through a risk-based approach, we have to understand what are the crown jewels, what are the things that we absolutely must protect? And we protect those in some of the smaller voltage distribution level, substations don't necessarily have those same level of protections. To suggest that the grid is vulnerable and we're just sitting ducks here, I think is disingenuous. I don't think that's accurate.""

With a lack of video, Harrell said a part of FBI investigations likely involve combing cell records to see if any phones pinged in the area of the substations around the time of the attacks.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/nc-substation-sabotage-fbi-investigating-randolph-moore-county-power-grid-attacks-related,N/A

Another rider, a 29-year-old man, tried to intervene and was attacked as well, police said.

The suspect pulled out a sharp object and slashed the woman multiple times, authorities said. She sustained lacerations to the left side of her face and palm.

The suspect fled the scene.

New York's subway system has been plagued with crime and random attacks on straphangers.

Last month, a good Samaritan was stabbed on the No. 6 train in Brooklyn while trying to break up a fight.

Since 2020, there have been 21 killings in the subway system, the New York Post reported earlier this month. The figure is more than the 20 murders recorded between 2008 and 2019 combined, according to the data.

New York shark attack off Long Island marks fifth in 2 weeks,"A second shark attack was reported off the coast of New York on Wednesday — the fifth such attack off of Long Island in two weeks.

According to the county, Suffolk County Police Marine Bureau officers responded to Seaview Beach on Fire Island after a man was bitten by a shark at approximately 6:05 p.m. ET.

The 49-year-old Arizona man was standing in waist-deep water when the shark approached from behind, biting him on the left wrist and buttocks.

SHARK ATTACKS SURFER NEAR NEW YORK BEACH, AUTHORITIES CLOSE SWIMMING

The man walked out of the water before being transported on a Suffolk County Police helicopter to Stony Brook University Hospital.

His injuries were not life-threatening.

Earlier in the day, Suffolk County officials closed Smith Point Beach for swimming following a morning attack on a 41-year-old man on a paddle board.

The victim suffered a 4-inch gash on his leg that was apparently from a sand tiger shark, which was identified by the man.

SHARK ACTIVITY NEAR EAST COAST BEACHES ON THE RISE

The injury was not serious, and Smith Point Beach reopened in the afternoon.

""Our lifeguards are continuing to patrol the ocean to ensure the safety of all beachgoers,"" Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone tweeted.

During a news conference, the official stressed the importance of swimming near lifeguards and called these attacks the new normal.

Smith Point and Cupsogue beaches recently reopened after being forced to close earlier this month following previous incidents.

While shark attacks are usually rare, more sharks are being spotted off Long Island.

Scientists cite warming ocean temperatures and a resurgence of bunker fish for the shift in sightings. Experts say the increase in the number of sharks is a sign that conservation efforts have been successful.

NYC bike path terror attack: Jury to start deliberating in trial for Sayfullo Saipov,"Closing arguments wrapped Tuesday in the trial for New York City bike path terror attack suspect Sayfullo Saipov, accused of murdering eight people and injuring many more.

The jury was set to begin deliberating on Wednesday, CBS News reported.

In the three-hour closing argument Tuesday, prosecution said Saipov turned the ""bike path into his battlefield"" on behalf of ISIS, according to the outlet.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Richman said Saipov was smiling when he asked to hang the flag of the Islamic State group in his Manhattan hospital room after the Oct. 31, 2017, attack he carried out with a speeding rental truck. Prosecutors say it was the worst terrorist attack to strike New York since 9/11.

DRAMATIC NEW VIDEO SHOWS MOMENTS BEFORE NYC TRUCK ATTACK DRIVER SAYFULLO SAIPOV IS SHOT BY POLICE

Saipov, 34, steered the truck onto a bike path along the Hudson River and the West Side Highway that is popular with tourists and Manhattan residents, mowing down bike riders.

Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Earlier in the trial, the jury was played shocking video that showed the rental truck barreling toward the bike path at high speed, striking a yellow school bus filled with children.

Richman urged jurors to convict Saipov of all charges in a case that could result in the death penalty. If the jury returns a guilty verdict on all charges after starting deliberations, a penalty phase of the trial will begin a week later. Unless jurors unanimously choose death, the sentence would be life in prison.

Individuals who were injured or lost loved ones at the hands of the Uzbek man were among those who testified during the trial.

""He targeted his victims without mercy,"" Richman said. That night, the prosecutor added, ""he smiled. He was proud. He was happy with what he had done that day. He was happy about the terrorist attack. ... He had done what he came to do.""

Richman said Saipov only stopped his motorized rampage when he struck a small school bus, injuring children. Otherwise, he said, Saipov planned to head to the Brooklyn Bridge and kill as many people as he could there. He was arrested after he pointed black pellet and paintball guns at a police officer, who shot him.

During the trial, defense lawyers haven't contested that Saipov carried out the attack.

But they say he should be acquitted of a racketeering charge because prosecutors were wrong to claim that he carried out the attack so that the Islamic State group would let him become a member.

Defense lawyer David Patton said Saipov was expecting to die in the attack.

""He did not expect to be here before all of you and did not expect to be joining any organization,"" Patton said. And that, he added, means Saipov is not guilty of racketeering.

Patton said that to do something ""as awful"" as what his client did, he had to already consider himself a member of the Islamic State group.

He said Saipov had an ""expectation that he would die by police shooting.""

Saipov, who has been imprisoned without bail since the attack, legally moved to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010. He lived in Ohio and Florida before joining his family in Paterson, New Jersey.

NYC machete attack suspect Trevor Bickford hit with federal charges after allegedly attempting to kill cops,"The man accused of attempting to kill two New York City police officers on New Year's Eve has been hit with federal charges, according to the Department of Justice.

Trevor Bickford, 19, allegedly used a machete to attack two New York City Police officers in Manhattan on New Year's Eve and is reported to have traveled from Maine. He was charged with two counts of attempted murder of an officer and two counts of attempted assault, and is now being charged with four counts of attempted murder of officers and employees of the U.S. Government and persons assisting them.

Bickford allegedly committed the attack nearly two hours before midnight outside the secure area at Times Square where individuals are searched for weapons.

Before Bickford was shot by a police officer, authorities said he hit two officers with the machete. One of the officers received a fractured skull because of the incident while the other had a bad cut, but are expected to recover.

NYC MACHETE ATTACK SUSPECT TREVOR BICKFORD’S MOM ALERTED FBI TO ALLEGED EXTREMISM: REPORT

The individual was on the FBI's radar for weeks prior to the attack, according to reports. A high-level police source previously told Fox News Digital that he had recently converted to Islam and said that authorities received a tip saying that Bickford expressed interest in traveling to Afghanistan.

The Department of Justice says that Bickford attempted to ""wage Jihad by killing U.S. Government officials,"" and says that in 2022 he began consuming materials ""espousing radical Islamic ideology"" such as ""promoting the Taliban and reflecting the teachings of Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, a prominent radical Islamic cleric who was a spiritual mentor of al Qaeda.""

According to the Justice Department, this led to Bickford's radicalization and ""devoting himself to violent Islamic extremism and waging jihad.""

Bickford's radicalization led to a desire to travel to the Middle East to ""support the Taliban,"" and began taking steps to ""ally himself with the Taliban and work with the Taliban to fight against governments that, in [his] view, oppress Muslims,"" the DOJ said.

The 19-year-old also told a family member that he ""wanted to travel to the Middle East so that he could be a suicide bomber for his religion,"" the Justice Department alleges.

Bickford decided that he wanted to stay in the United States and not travel to the Middle East in order to ""wage jihad against the U.S. Government within the United States,"" authorities said in a press release.

NYPD STABBING SUSPECT WITH ALLEGED EXTREMIST TIES WROTE MANIFESTO ASKING FAMILY TO REPENT TO ALLAH: REPORT

Just before Bickford allegedly carried out the attacks, he said ""Allahu Akbar,"" which is an Arabic phrase meaning ""God is great,"" the DOJ said.

Among the items recovered by law enforcement was a journal belonging to Bickford which had an entry from Dec. 31, 2022 stating that ""this will likely be my last entry,"" and said that his brother has ""joined the ranks of my enemy"" after enlisting in the U.S. military, officials said.

The DOJ also said that a book inside a bag belonging to Bickford was found by authorities and contained a highlighted quote reading ""Fight in the Name of Allah and in the Cause of Allah. Fight against those who do not believe in Allah. Wage a holy war.""

NYE SLASHING SUSPECT TREVOR BICKFORD CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER OF POLICE OFFICERS



After he was arrested, Bickford told authorities that he walked around the area of Times Square on New Year's Eve ""trying to figure out the right time to kill"" and also recited Quran verses in his head to ""hype himself up"" before the alleged attack.

When authorities asked Bickford why he committed the attack, he said that ""all men of military age were his targets; no one can work for the U.S. Government and be a true Muslim because the U.S. Government supports Israel; and he wanted to kill as many of these targets as he could.""

Bickford also intended to die in the attack, authorities said, adding that he claimed that the attack was ""unsuccessful"" because he ""did not kill any officers, and he did not die himself.""

If convicted, Bickford faces a potential sentence of 80 years in prison.

U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland said ""We are deeply grateful for the bravery of the officers who were injured in this horrible attack and who put their lives on the line every day to serve their communities. Together with our law enforcement partners at every level of government, the Justice Department will continue to work to disrupt, investigate, and prosecute those who target and attack law enforcement and endanger the American people.""

NYC sees series of unrelated slashings in 3-hour span in wake of New Year's machete attack on cops,"Police say four people were wounded in a series of unrelated slashings that unfolded within a three-hour timespan on Tuesday just days after a New Year’s Eve machete attack on cops in Times Square.

Tuesday’s slashings all occurred in Manhattan – and left two of the victims slashed or stabbed in the face – yet the New York City Police Department doesn’t believe any of the incidents are linked. No arrests have been made in any of the Tuesday morning attacks.

The first occurred at about 12:20 a.m. on West 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, where police say a 41-year-old man was stabbed in the face and hand during a fight with three people outside Bryant Park. The three men allegedly responsible for the attack hopped into a yellow cab and fled the scene, police said.

The victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital, where he’s expected to recover.

NYE SLASHING SUSPECT TREVOR BICKFORD CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER OF POLICE OFFICERS

Just 10 minutes later and six blocks away, two men were slashed multiple times in a fight with two other men on West 46th Street near Eighth Avenue. The first victim, a 32-year-old, was slashed on his stomach and arm, while the second, a 36-year-old, was cut in the right arm, N.Y. Daily News reported.

They were both transported to Bellevue Hospital to be treated for the minor injuries.

The third slashing happened just after 3 a.m. when police say a man dressed in a yellow Superman shirt attacked a 50-year-old man at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on West 40th Street and Eighth Avenue. The suspect, who wore a blue surgical mask, is believed to be in his 20s and allegedly slashed the victim in the face before running from the scene, police said.

The victim in that attack was also sent to Bellevue Hospital.

The stabbings Tuesday come on the heels of the arrest of a 19-year-old man reportedly on the FBI watch list who is accused of attacking three police officers with a machete in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve. The attacks took place around 10:11 p.m. Saturday just outside the security screening area for visitors gathering for the Times Square Ball Drop.

The suspect, identified as Trevor Bickford, is accused of approaching a cop and attempting to strike him in the head with a machete.

Bickford allegedly struck an additional two officers in the head with the machete before one of the officers fired their service weapon, striking the suspect in the shoulder. One officer, an eight-year veteran, suffered a laceration to the head, while another, who graduated the police academy just a day before, was also struck in the head, resulting in a skull fracture and a large laceration. All three officers were taken to Bellevue Hospital, where the suspect was also treated for his injuries, police said.

Afterward, the FBI said there was no ongoing threat, and the suspect is believed to have acted alone.

Bickford, who is believed to have traveled from Maine, was charged with two counts of attempted murder of an officer and two counts of attempted assault. The NYPD and FBI are handling the investigation together, and FBI agents reportedly entered Bickford's Maine home on Monday.

Authorities are investigating Bickford for potential ties to Islamic extremism.

A high-level police source told Fox News Digital that Bickford was being watched by the FBI's counterterrorism task force in the weeks leading up to Saturday's attack. The source also said Bickford recently converted to Islam and a tipster claimed he had expressed interest in going to Afghanistan.

"Paul Pelosi attack bodycam, 911 call remain undisclosed as suspect David DePape due back in court","David DePape, the 42-year-old Canadian accused of breaking into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s house last week and attacking her husband with a hammer, was not present for a brief hearing Friday as authorities remain tight-lipped about additional evidence against him.

At a Friday proceeding DePape was not present for, the court scheduled a discovery hearing for Nov. 28 and set a Dec. 14 preliminary hearing where witnesses could testify.

At a news briefing Thursday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she is confident investigators already have the evidence to prove their case but declined to release details beyond what is already in court filings.

""Mr. Pelosi opened the door, they were both holding a hammer and the police observed Mr. DePape pull that hammer away and then strike Mr. Pelosi,"" she told reporters after the hearing. ""That is the most that we’re going to say at this point. Our job is not to try this case in the public or in the press. It’s to try it in a courtroom.""

PAUL PELOSI RETURNS HOME FROM HOSPITAL DAYS AFTER HAMMER ATTACK

WATCH DA BROOKE JENKINS' REMARKS:

DePape faces a slew of state charges as well as federal charges of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal official. They carry sentences of up to 30 and 20 years in prison with a conviction. DePape could face up to life in prison on the state charges, which he already pleaded not guilty to, and federal immigration officials have requested a detainer and could deport him if he is ever released from custody.

The judge was expected to rule on prosecutors' motion to hold him without bail as he awaits trial.

The House speaker's 82-year-old husband spent six days in the hospital following the attack, where he underwent emergency surgery on a skull fracture and treatments for injuries to his arms and hands.

San Francisco investigators have declined to release bodycam footage, the 911 call and other evidence in the case, including images from numerous surveillance cameras around the Pelosi home.

They have also withheld details about DePape's criminal history, although court filings indicate he does have one.

Jenkins' office wrote that he was ""convicted of other crimes for which consecutive sentences could have been imposed but for which concurrent sentences are being imposed.""

PAUL PELOSI INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT DAVID DEPAPE IN ATTACK ON NANCY PELOSI'S HUSBAND

That could indicate he previously took a plea deal, according to experts.

Details could come out at trial if prosecutors want to use his criminal history as an aggravating factor in seeking a harsher sentence, according to Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles-based attorney and former federal prosecutor.

""That aggravating factor generally must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt under the United States Supreme Court’s Blakey decision,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""DePape may wave this Blakey factor so jurors do not hear about his criminal history, but if he does not, the prosecution will present evidence of DePape’s prior convictions and sentences at trial, specifically whether DePape previously received concurrent sentences when he could have received consecutive ones.""

Jenkins said earlier this week that 911 audio and bodycam footage might be revealed in court as she doubled down on not releasing it to the media despite concerns over murky details about the incident.

In court documents, prosecutors allege DePape broke into the Pelosi home around 2 a.m. Oct. 28. Inside, he awoke a sleeping Paul Pelosi in his bedroom and allegedly asked for his wife, whom police say he wanted to ""kneecap."" Speaker Pelosi, the highest-ranking official in Congress, was in Washington, D.C., at the time.

DePape noticed ""Ring security cameras everywhere,"" according to Jenkins’ office, and ""was surprised when he found Mr. Pelosi still asleep after making … so much noise to gain entry.""

""Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?"" DePape allegedly asked the ""groggy"" Pelosi around 2:30 a.m.

""She’s not here,"" he replied, according to the San Francisco district attorney’s motion to detain DePape without bail. ""She’s in Washington. She’s not going to be back for a couple of days.""

""OK, well, I’m going to tie you up,"" the intruder stated, according to the filing.

PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: 'MENTALLY ILL' SUSPECT PREVIOUSLY LIVED WITH JAILED 'NUDIST' LOVER, 'CONSTANTLY PARANOID'

Pelosi asked to use the bathroom and made a 911 call on speakerphone around 2:23 a.m., according to court documents. After Pelosi gave his name and address, DePape allegedly spoke to the dispatcher over the open line.

""My name is David,"" he said, according to court documents. Although Pelosi said he didn’t know the intruder, DePape allegedly said, ""I’m a friend of theirs.""

San Francisco police arrived a few minutes later and rang the doorbell.

""Defendant directed Mr. Pelosi not to open the door. But Mr. Pelosi opened the door with his left hand,"" according to a motion to detain DePape without bail. ""As the door opened, the two men stood in the dimly lit foyer facing the officers. Mr. Pelosi nervously but calmly greeted them.

""When the officer asked what was going on, Defendant smiled and said, 'everything's good' and pulled his hands toward his body. When an officer turned on his flashlight, Defendant could be seen holding the bottom handle of the hammer with one hand and Mr. Pelosi's right arm with the other. Mr. Pelosi had his hand on the top of the handle near the hammer itself. One officer ordered, ‘Drop the hammer!’ At the same time, Defendant raised the hammer and said, 'um, nope.'""

Paul Pelosi attack: Capitol Police begin 'internal security review' after officers missed break-in,"The U.S. Capitol Police have begun an ""internal security review"" after officers in its Command Center missed live video surveillance outside the Pelosi's San Francisco residence when David DePape allegedly broke into the house and attacked Paul Pelosi.

Sources told Fox News that the officers were watching a live-feed of many cameras which include surveillance of the Capitol complex, as well as several points away from the Capitol such as the Pelosi's San Francisco residence.

An officer was watching the feeds when police lights illuminated a dark street outside the Pelosi's residence. When rewinding the surveillance cameras outside the Pelosi's residence, the officer saw the alleged break-in on Oct. 28 just after 2 a.m., sources said.

Police say that David DePape violently attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer, leaving him unconscious for three minutes. Paul Pelosi was taken to a local hospital where he had to undergo surgery repair a skull fracture in addition to other injuries.

DAVID DEPAPE ALLEGEDLY SAID IT WAS THE 'END OF THE ROAD' FOR PAUL PELOSI: 'TAKE THEM ALL OUT'

The security detail traveling with Nancy Pelosi wasn't at the San Francisco residence when the incident happened, as the House Speaker was away.

Sources tell Fox News that Capitol Police pay less attention to security cameras when one of its protectees is away, and the House Speaker wasn't with her husband in San Francisco .

If the officers were watching the feed monitoring in real-time, the break-in would have been seen.

The U.S. Capitol Police released a statement on Wednesday, announcing that it has begun an ""internal security review"" following the incident.

US CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS WEREN'T WATCHING LIVE HOME SECURITY CAMERAS WHEN PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED

""The Department has begun an internal security review and will be gathering input and questions from our Congressional stakeholders. We have been immensely grateful for the critical support the Congress already provided to secure the U.S. Capitol Complex after January 6, 2021,"" the statement reads. ""The funding was vital for us to implement dozens of immediate improvements. Now we will fast-track the work we have already been doing to enhance the protection of Members outside of Washington, D.C., while also providing new protective options that will address concerns following Friday’s targeted attack.""

According to the statement, the U.S. Capitol Police command center has access to ""roughly 1,800 cameras,"" which include several at the Pelosi's residence.

""While the Speaker was with her security detail in Washington, D.C., the San Francisco cameras were not actively monitored as they are when the Speaker is at the residence. The Command Center personnel noticed the police activity on the screen and used the feeds to monitor the response and assist investigators,"" the statement reads.

DePape faces several state and federal-level charges, including attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse, among others. DePape plead not guilty to the state-level charges during an arraignment on Monday.

A criminal complaint filed by the San Francisco District Attorney's Office states that DePape has been ""convicted of other crimes.""

According to a federal affidavit filed on Monday, DePape told police that he intended to hold Speaker Pelosi hostage and interrogate her.

""If Nancy were to tell DePape the ‘truth,’ he would let her go, and if she ‘lied,’ he was going to break ‘her kneecaps,’"" the affidavit states.

""DePape also later explained that by breaking Nancy’s kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other members of Congress that there were consequences to actions,"" according to the court document.

DePape pleaded not guilty to state-level charges, which include attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse, among others.

Waukesha Christmas parade attack: Prosecutors show new images of Darrell Brooks' mangled SUV in murder trial,"Waukesha prosecutors introduced images of the red Ford Escape SUV Christmas parade attack suspect Darrell Brooks Jr. is accused of driving through a throng of revelers last year at trial Wednesday. They show bullet holes from where police tried to stop the attack, victims' clothing jammed between the crushed hood and windshield, and devastating dents from where the vehicle allegedly slammed into parade goers.

Brooks is on trial for dozens of charges, including six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, after prosecutors say he took the vehicle on a Main Street rampage, driving through the heart of a Christmas parade in the city, just west of Milwaukee, last year.

The photos show extensive damage to the car, including items of victims' clothing wedged against the windshield, a front bumper that was barely hanging on and bullet holes from where responding officers tried to stop the carnage.

Jurors were shown the vehicle in person Wednesday afternoon at a secure garage within the court complex, according to FOX6 Milwaukee, a move Brooks told Judge Jennifer Dorow he did not ""consent"" to.

WAUKESHA PARADE SUSPECT DARRELL BROOKS RAGES IN COURT, ATTACKS WITNESSES IN CROSS-EXAMINATION

""Your lack of consent is not going to stop this jury view,"" she replied.

The proceedings also saw several witnesses take the stand.

Ryan Schultz, a mechanical inspector with Wisconsin State Patrol, testified that despite the vehicle's extensive damage, there was nothing wrong with the brakes or tires that would have prevented a driver from stopping the SUV, according to a transcript provided by FOX6.

The throttle pedal and steering system were also fine, he said.

""The brakes still functioned after the crash, fully,"" he testified.

Brooks is representing himself at trial and has been reprimanded repeatedly by the judge for interrupting court. In hours of rambling cross-examinations, he has attacked witnesses on the stand and on more than one occasion been sent out of the room.

In a jailhouse interview last year, he told Fox News Digital that the charges against him made him feel ""dehumanized"" and ""demonized.""

Chris Johnson, a state crime lab official who responded to the scene, testified that he collected several items from where the SUV had been recovered after the attack. They included a headband hanging from the driver-side mirror and other articles of clothing both insides and outside the vehicle.

Inside, he said, he also found paperworks bearing the name ""Darrell E. Brooks.""

Prior to the Waukesha attack, Brooks had a 50-page rap sheet that included charges stemming from multiple attacks on women and other family members. He was released on $1,000 bail just days before the parade after allegedly beating up an ex-girlfriend, breaking her phone and running her over with the same SUV used in the attack.

His first conviction came after a 1999 aggravated battery with intent to cause great bodily harm.

"Waukesha Christmas parade attack victims: Jackson Sparks, 8, succumbs to his injuries","A 8-year-old child, Jackson Sparks, has become the sixth person to have died after an SUV plowed through a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, over the weekend.

The other victims were identified Monday as Wilhelm Hospel, 81, Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52 and Jane Kulich, 52.

Darrell Brooks Jr., 39, was charged Tuesday with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence if convicted. His bail was set at $5 million, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14. Additional charges related to the Sparks' death and the more than 60 people injured will be coming later this week or next, said Waukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper.

Here are those who lost their lives at the Waukesha Christmas parade attack:

Jackson Sparks

Sparks, 8, was the first of many injured children to have died. He was walking in the parade with his 12-year-old brother Tucker.

""This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,"" read a post Tuesday on his GoFundMe page.

The boys – among three sets of siblings hospitalized after being struck by the SUV -- were marching with their baseball team when they were hit.

Tucker has head injuries but is recovering and will be sent home, according to Alyssa Albro, the niece of the boys’ parents, Aaron and Sheri Sparks.

Jackson had suffered a more serious brain injury.

Virginia Sorenson

Sorenson, 79, was the longtime choreographer of the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies group – several members of which are among the deaths.

David Sorenson, her husband of nearly 60 years, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about how she loved working with the Grannies.

""What did she like about it? Everything,"" David Sorenson said. ""She liked the instructing. She liked the dancing and the camaraderie of the women. She liked to perform.""

The newspaper also reports that the Sorensons had three children and six grandchildren.

Virginia – a registered nurse – also cared for two horses, chickens, dogs and cats at her home in Muskego, it added.

Tamara Durand

Durand, 52, was a mother of three with one grandchild. She babysat her grandson so her daughter could finish nursing school and volunteered at hospitals and hospices.

She was doing her first show with the Grannies on Sunday, her husband, Dave Durand, told the Associated Press.

""She basically danced her way through life,"" he said of his wife of eight years, a hospice chaplain and former high school and college cheerleader who was ""super excited"" for her first performance. ""She was totally energetic and was her happiest when she was dancing.""

Durand spent more than 17 years working as an elementary school teacher at the Beaver Dam Unified School District, northwest of Waukesha, according to the Journal Sentinel.

Jane Kulich

Kulich, 52, worked at Citizens Bank as a teller since last November, according to a LinkedIn profile purportedly belonging to her.

Following the parade attack, Citizens Bank issued a statement to Fox News Digital saying it is ""one of many groups directly impacted by the tragedy that unfolded in Waukesha.""

""One of our team members who was walking with our parade float was struck and passed away as a result of her injuries,"" the statement said. ""Our condolences go out to her family and friends for this inconceivable loss. Please lift up our team and the entire community as we all grieve.""

Her LinkedIn page also states she worked as a caregiver and at a dry cleaning business and restaurant.

Wilhelm Hospel

Hospel, 81, helped the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies with their performances, according to the Associated Press.

His wife, Lola, was another member of the group, the Journal Sentinel reports.

LeAnna Owen

Owen, a 71-year-old resident of Cudahy, was also a member of the Dancing Grannies.

Outside of her participation in the group, the grandmother managed an apartment complex and leaves behind two sons, the Journal Sentinel reports.

""She didn’t have a mean bone in her body. She was the nicest lady,"" Dave Schmidt, who owns a pair of 32-unit buildings Owen took care of, told the newspaper.

Wisconsin anti-abortion group targeted in Molotov cocktail arson attack: police,"A Wisconsin anti-abortion group said Sunday someone tossed a Molotov cocktail into its Madison office and spray-painted a message outside reading, ""if abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either.""

Local reporters from outlets including WISC-TV, the Wisconsin State Journal and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said they visited the office for Wisconsin Family Action on Sunday and shared photos and videos of the apparent arson attack. A shattered window had since been boarded up, and images showed fire damaged furniture and burned books littering the floor of the office.

The exterior of the building was tagged in cursive: ""if abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either.""

NJ TRANSGENDER WOMAN WHO FORCED DAUGHTER INTO CHILD PORN OPERATION SENTENCED WITH THREE OTHERS

Wisconsin Family Action President Julaine K. Appling told News 3 Now that someone tossed a Molotov cocktail into her office around 6 a.m. and she was unaware of who is behind the attack.

In recent days, Wisconsin Family Action has condemned the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that, if published, would overturn Roe v. Wade.

The pro-life non-profit has published press releases in the past week criticizing Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, President Biden and other Democrats, arguing in one May 6 statement, ""While refusing to properly define a woman, they fail to recognize that murder is objectively evil and that the right to life is the only right that exists in this case.""

The Madison Police Department confirmed it is investigating the Sunday morning fire at an office building in the 2800 block of International Lane as arson.

Flames were seen coming from the facility shortly after 6 a.m., and the blaze was quickly put out by the Madison Fire Department, a police incident report said. A Molotov cocktail, which did not ignite, was thrown inside the building and a separate fire was started in response, police spokeswoman Stephanie Fryer said, acknowledging graffiti was also found at the scene. No injuries were reported.

""The Madison Police Department understands members of our community are feeling deep emotions due to the recent news involving the United States Supreme Court,"" Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said in a statement. ""Early Sunday morning, our team began investigating a suspicious fire inside an office building on the city’s north side. It appears a specific non-profit that supports anti-abortion measures was targeted.""

""Our department has and continues to support people being able to speak freely and openly about their beliefs,"" the chief continued. ""But we feel that any acts of violence, including the destruction of property, do not aid in any cause. We have made our federal partners aware of this incident and are working with them and the Madison Fire Department as we investigate this arson.""

A press conference to provide more information is scheduled for Monday at 2 p.m. local time.

Wisconsin attack on pro-life group: no arrests or suspects; Molotov cocktails used,"Authorities in Madison, Wisconsin said no arrests have been made in the connection with a weekend arson attack at the offices of a prominent anti-abortion group.

Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said investigators have collected ""multiple"" pieces of evidence from the scene of the attack at Wisconsin Family Action and turned the items over to federal authorities. Two Molotov cocktails were also found in connection to the attack, he said.

""As much as we wish we could be able to solve this case today the forensic process must take time,"" he said during a Monday update on the investigation. ""While we wait, we're combing the area and searching for digital evidence.""

WISCONSIN ANTI-ABORTION GROUP TARGETED IN MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ARSON ATTACK

prev Image 2 of 2

Authorities said the attack happened around 6 a.m. Sunday. A passerby on their way to the airport noticed flames coming from the office building, Barnes said. The blaze was extinguished within five minutes.

Wisconsin Family Action President Julaine Appling previously told Fox News that two windows were smashed and Molotov cocktails were tossed inside the group's office, one of which exploded, igniting a fire inside the office that burned furniture and books and sent shards of glass around the room.

No one was working at the time of the blaze.

On one outside wall, a message left in spray paint read: ""If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either."" Appling said what was not seen in initial photos and videos from the scene was another wall tagged with the anarchy symbol and the number 1312, which is meant to stand for the phrase, ""All Cops are B-------.""

Madison police said a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the Wisconsin Family Action office but failed to ignite. A fire was set afterward, they said.

The attacks came days after a draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion was leaked that suggested the court may soon overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.

""We're looking at this from the lens, this is a First Amendment protected right,"" said Robert Payne, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, FBI, Milwaukee. ""People have their opinions. And when we violate that, and we use criminal activity or violence in that nature, the FBI and our federal authorities will look at that for all federal statutes in which to investigate.""

Video shows woman accused in dismemberment slaying attack her attorney in court,"A Wisconsin woman accused in a grisly killing and dismemberment case attacked her attorney Tuesday during a court hearing, moments after a judge agreed to delay her trial.

Taylor Schabusiness, 25, was seated in a Brown County circuit courtroom when her attorney, Quinn Jolly, asked the judge for an additional two weeks for a defense expert to review his client’s competency to stand trial.

She is charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse and third-degree sexual assault for allegedly attacking Shad Thyrion in February 2022.

Schabusiness has pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, according to WLUK.

WISCONSIN WOMAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN DISMEMBERMENT MURDER

Authorities say she strangled Thyrion at a home in Green Bay, sexually abused him and dismembered his body, leaving parts of him throughout the house and in a vehicle.

Courtroom video shows Schabusiness attack Jolly moments after Judge Thomas Walsh reluctantly agreed to postpone her March 6 trial. Schabusiness was wrestled to the courtroom floor by a sheriff's deputy. The courtroom was then cleared before the hearing resumed.

Following her courtroom outburst, the judge moved her competency hearing from Tuesday to March 6. The judge also proposed a May 15 trial date.

At the end of the hearing, Jolly told the court that he would file a motion to withdraw from the case as Schabusiness’ attorney, but the judge did not immediately rule on that matter.

"Wyoming college wrestlers injured during bear attack, left 'blood-soaked,' coach says","Two Wyoming college wrestlers were severely injured during a bear attack Saturday while hunting with teammates in an encounter that left them ""blood-soaked,"" their wrestling coach told Fox News.

Kendell Cummings of Evanston and Brady Lowry of Cedar City, Utah – both sophomores at Northwest College in Powell – were hunting antlers at the Shoshone National Forest with teammates August Harrison and Orrin Jackson when they encountered a grizzly bear.

The group split up with Cummings and Lowry hiking to higher ground, Lowry told Fox News. As they were walking they spotted feces from what they believed was a bear, he said.

""Before you could even think or blink, there's a bear that came running out of the trees right in front of me,"" said Lowry, who was attacked first. ""It was beating me up pretty good.""

He suffered a broken arm that required six screws and bolts and was bitten in the right thigh. He eventually curled up in a ball during the attack. Seeing his friend in danger, Cummings yelled and then grabbed the bear before being chased by the animal itself.

Lowry then called 911 and yelled at Harrison and Jackson for help. Harrison said he went up a hill and spotted Cummings who was on his way down and obviously injured.

""He was just drenched in blood coming down the hill everywhere,"" Harrison told Fox News. ""Me and Orrin took turns carrying him down to the bottom where the field was.""

The group flagged down first responders who arrived at the scene a short time later. Cummings was air-lifted to a hospital and Lowry was taken to a local hospital via ambulance, their wrestling coach Jim Zeigler told Fox News. Both eventually ended up at a trauma center in Billings, Montana.

Cummings and Lowry are expected to recover but will be sidelined from Wrestling as they recuperate from their injuries, he said. Harrison and Jackson said they plan to participate in upcoming wrestling matches.

""For those guys, there's a lot of emotional trauma. I don't think we can even begin to describe what went on there with them having to go and rescue a kid, bring him out and carry him out,"" Zeigler said of Harrison and Jackson.

Lowry was released from the hospital Monday. Cummings could possibly be released later in the week ""but with drainage tubes,"" Zeigler said.

""There's real serious puncture holes and wounds. He took a lot of staples to his head and also (there's) some cosmetic surgery for his cheek,"" he said. ""Neither one of them are going to be wrestling for a while.""

Bear sightings in the area where the attack occurred are not uncommon, officials with the Wyoming Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.

""In the vicinity where the attack occurred, reports from landowners and hunters indicate there may be six to 10 different bears moving between agricultural fields and low elevation slopes,"" said Dan Smith, Cody Region wildlife supervisor.

Alleged machete attack on American in Cancun highlights tourist destination risk,"Mexico’s Yucatan beaches provide a scenic backdrop for an ugly reality of kidnappings, gun violence and other crimes, with U.S. officials warning American travelers to be on their toes as they hit the sand.

The attorney general in Mexico’s waterfront Quintana Roo state announced an investigation last week into an alleged kidnapping and machete attack against a Utah dad visiting Cancun with his wife for Valentine’s Day.

Dustan Jackson, a 36-year-old contractor from Salt Lake City, told Fox News Digital on Thursday that he wanted to pick up some chewing tobacco before his flight home from Cancun and called a cab. As a result, he said, he spent months in and out of the hospital, underwent multiple surgeries and suffered permanent nerve damage in his left arm.

He said the driver pulled up to a grocery store around 10 a.m. on Feb. 12, and he got out to get a tin. Then: ""Bam!""

CANCUN MACHETE ATTACK: MEXICO PROSECUTOR LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION AFTER AMERICAN DAD SAYS HE WAS LEFT FOR DEAD

He blacked out and woke up after sundown, he said, with broken front teeth, a welt on his head and machete wounds up and down the left side of his body. The attackers took his cellphone and credit card, and he spent hours bleeding and looking for help before he said a police officer bandaged him up and drove him to the airport.

Jackson said he was not sure why the officer drove him to the airport instead of a hospital.

""She put a few bandages on me; why didn’t she take me to the hospital, I don’t know,"" he said. ""Some of the horror stories I’ve heard, I’m glad that [she] didn’t because I could have been stuck down there. Who knows?""

AMERICAN TOURIST CLAIMS HE WAS KIDNAPPED IN MEXICO, LEFT FOR DEAD AFTER MACHETE ATTACK

Once at the airport, he begged strangers for help until someone who spoke English called his wife for him and helped set him up in a hotel overnight and arrange a trip back to the U.S.

Police in Cancun’s tourist district and at the airport separately told Fox News Digital they had no record of the attack or of interactions with Jackson, but prosecutors confirmed last week they were launching an investigation. A State Department official also said the U.S. government was aware of the allegations and prepared to assist.

Quintana Roo, which includes tourist hotspots like Cancun, Tulum, Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, is far from Mexico’s most dangerous area, statistically speaking. However, the State Department warns that Americans visiting the region should ""exercise increased caution"" due to crime and kidnapping.

IS IT SAFE FOR AMERICANS TO VACATION IN CANCUN? WHAT TRAVELERS SHOULD KNOW

""Criminal activity and violence may occur in any location, at any time, including in popular tourist destinations,"" the State Department warns. ""Travelers should maintain a high level of situational awareness, avoid areas where illicit activities occur, and promptly depart from potentially dangerous situations. U.S. citizens and [lawful permanent residents] have been victims of kidnapping.""

As post-pandemic travel restrictions have wound down, alarming incidents in some of Mexico’s most desirable vacation beaches have shocked travelers.

Nine days after Jackson said he was attacked, a shooting in Tulum left two men dead and another wounded at the waterfront Art Beach Restaurant.

A cartel gunbattle in Cancun last December resulted in no injuries but left guests fleeing an all-inclusive beach-side resort in a panic. Gunmen on personal watercrafts jetted up to the shore near Grand Ocean Palm resorts and opened fire on rival drug dealers.

CUBAN DOCTOR KILLED IN MEXICAN HOSPITAL

Quintana Roo’s police chief at the time said the suspects were dressed up as soldiers.

Just a month prior, another shootout left two other suspected dealers dead at the Hyatt Riviera Cancun nearby. No tourists were ""seriously injured"" in the crossfire, authorities said.

Additionally, in October 2021, a California woman and another from Germany were struck and killed by stray bullets in Tulum, also a Quintana Roo resort town, in the crossfire of a gang shootout. Three other additional European tourists were injured.

The violence prompted Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to deploy 1,500 members of the country’s National Guard to patrol the beaches.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT HACK REVEALS MILITARY SOLD ARMS, RECEIVED ESCORT FROM CARTELS: REPORT

The State Department in August issued a series of travel warnings for different parts of Mexico.

Recommendations also urge Americans to completely avoid six of the country’s 31 states: Sinaloa, Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas. Kidnappings are plaguing all of those except for Guerrero, according to authorities.

Other Mexican regions where kidnappings are prevalent include Baja California, Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Sonora, Nuevo Leon, Puebla and San Luis Potosi.

Great white shark decapitates Mexican diver marking first fatal shark attack of 2023: Report,"The first fatal shark attack of the year has been recorded in Mexico after a man diving for mollusks was reportedly killed in a gruesome attack by a great white shark that resulted in the diver being decapitated.

Manuel Lopez was diving for mollusks in Mexico’s Tobari Bay in the Gulf of California when he encountered a 19-foot great white shark at a depth of about 50 feet around 11:30 a.m. on January 5th, the website TrackingSharks.com reported .

Two other fishermen who were with him at the time of the attack said that Lopez was decapitated.

""He was diving when the animal attacked him, impressively ripping off his head and biting both shoulders,"" Jose Bernal, a man speaking for the fisherman, said about the attack.

Bernal said that divers in the area had previously been warned about an increased shark presence in the area and that most divers had not been out on the water in the days leading up to the attack.

Lopez was reportedly diving with a surface supplied air source where compressor pumps send air through hoses connected to the diver who is also connected to the boat with tethered ropes.

Damage from Iran-linked drone attack on Saudi oil facility captured in satellite images,"Saudi oil sites attacked on Saturday -- in a drone assault linked to Iran -- were seen to have sustained damage after satellite images released Sunday captured char marks and smoke billowing from the world’s largest oil processing facility.

The weekend attack ignited huge fires at Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil processing facility and interrupted about 5.7 million barrels of crude oil production -- over 5 percent of the world’s daily supply.

DEFIANT IRAN BLASTS POMPEO'S SAUDI-ATTACK ACCUSATIONS AS 'BLIND AND FUTILE COMMENTS'

U.S. satellite images appeared to show approximately 17 points of impact on key infrastructure at the site after the attack.

While Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have since claimed responsibility for the attack, the U.S. has accused Iran of launching the assault. Tehran has denied the allegations, calling the claims ""maximum lies.""

Houthi leader Muhammad al-Bukhaiti reiterated his group's claim of responsibility, telling The Associated Press on Sunday it exploited ""vulnerabilities"" in Saudi air defenses to strike the targets. He did not elaborate.

Other images appeared to show black char marks and thick black smoke in an area of the facility.

The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies in August had identified that region as the plant's stabilization area. That zone included ""storage tanks and processing and compressor trains — which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations,"" the center wrote at the time.

Neither Saudi Arabia nor the state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco have said how much damage was done to the facility. Saudi Arabia has promised to fill in the cut in production with its reserves but has not said how long it would take to repair the damage.

POMPEO ACCUSES IRAN OF 'UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK' AFTER DRONES HIT SAUDI OIL FACILITIES

There was no immediate impact on global oil prices from the attacks as markets were closed for the weekend, but analysts have anticipated a spike in oil prices when markets reopen Monday.

However, higher oil prices could add to the struggles facing the global economy. The spike in prices could dip the global economy into a recession, limiting any prolonged period of excessive prices as demand rebalances the market, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics.

Meanwhile, the attack has ratcheted up the already high Mideast tensions amid escalating U.S.-Iran hostilities as the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, launched during the Obama administration, has continued to unravel.

"Irish rooster with a violent past kills man with attack to the back of his leg, court says","An Irish inquest found that a man who died in April 2022, was attacked by a rooster with a history of attacking people, according to reports.

The Irish Examiner in Cork, Ireland, reported that Jasper Kraus was allegedly attacked by a Brahma chicken that was moved to his property in Ballinasloe after it attacked a child.

Garda Eoine Browne said during the judicial inquiry that he responded to reports of a sudden death on April 28, 2022, and when he arrived, he spoke to paramedics who said CPR attempts to revive the victim were unsuccessful.

Brown said the man, later identified as Kraus, was on the ground in the kitchen in a pool of blood, with a wound on the back of one of his legs.

Corey O’Keefe, who was a tenant at Kraus’s house, told his daughter Virginia Guinan what happened.

When Kraus’s daughter arrived at the house, she saw blood on the floor and paramedics performing CPR, the Examiner reported.

Kraus had a puncture wound on his left leg and a trail of blood from the house to a chicken coop outside.

His daughter said during the judicial inquiry that she realized the chicken must have caused her father’s death.

The daughter said she suspected it was the chicken with blood on its claws because it had attacked her own daughter previously.

The Examiner also reported that O’Keefe was questioned about the incident and said he returned home from work at 8 a.m., fed the animals and asked Kraus how he was doing before heading off to bed. A little while later, O’Keefe reporters, Kraus was screaming for help.

When O’Keefe went to see what was going on, he said he saw blood spurting from a large wound on the back of Kraus’s calf, which also had two other scratches. He quickly called for emergency services and was talked through CPR for about 25 minutes, when paramedics arrived.

As Kraus went in and out of consciousness, O’Keefe reportedly said, he said the word ""rooster.""

Kraus was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene.

The coroner recorded the death as misadventure, or an accident, describing the incident as a dreadful experience for the family.

The Examiner reported that just before the end of the judicial procedure, Kraus’s daughter said there should be support for people in this type of situation when it comes to cleaning up the blood.

Officials did not identify who was responsible for the strike Friday, though Iran-backed forces in the region and ISIS have been known to carry out similar attacks in the past.

The attack came two days after U.S. and coalition forces carried out a helicopter assault on an ISIS stronghold in Syria and captured an extremist involved in recruitment for the terrorist organization.

No civilians were injured or killed in the operation and neither U.S. nor allied forces sustained any injuries in the Wednesday assault.

"Mexican border prison attack leaves 14 people dead, more than a dozen injured","Gunmen in armored vehicles attacked a state prison just across the border from El Paso early Sunday, killing 10 guards and four inmates, prosecutors said.

Various armed vehicles arrived at the state prison in Ciudad Juarez at about 7 a.m. and opened fire at guards, the Chihuahua state prosecutor’s office said in a statement.

Amid the chaos, an additional 13 people were wounded and at least 24 inmates escaped.

Mexican soldiers and state police regained control of the prison later Sunday. The state prosecutor's office said its personnel were investigating.

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES FIND 4 HUMAN SKULLS IN PACKAGE BOUND FOR US

The state prison was the scene of a riot in August that spread to the streets of Juarez, resulting in nearly a dozen people dead.

In that case, two inmates were killed inside the prison and then alleged gang members started shooting up the town, including killing four employees of a radio station who were doing a promotion at a restaurant.

Violence is frequent in Mexican prisons, including in some where authorities only maintain nominal control. Clashes regularly erupt among inmates in rival gangs, which in places like Juarez serve as proxies for drug cartels.

Shortly before Sunday's attack on the prison, municipal police were attacked and captured four men after a pursuit, according to the state prosecutor's office statement. Later, police killed two alleged gunmen traveling in an SUV.

Pro-Russian hackers claim cyber attack on FBI website: Report,"A group of pro-Russian hackers claimed to hack into the FBI website this week, the latest in a string of supposed attacks on U.S. government websites.

The group Killnet took responsibility for infiltrating the website on its Telegram page Monday. It said the group was doing justice and guarding Russian cyberspace, writing ""Glory to Russian and Killnet,"" Cybersecurity Insider reported.

""The FBI is aware of yesterday's reporting and regularly monitors for cyber threats impacting FBI website availability,"" the agency said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The FBI has no further comment at this time.""

A tweet from Better Cyber, which describes itself as a cybersecurity services company, said the FBI site was not reachable. It also shared a screenshot showing the website's web address leading to another page.

The incident occurred a month after Killnet claimed responsibility for taking the websites of multiple U.S. airports offline. The group launched a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, making the affected airports' websites unavailable.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport's websites were among those affected.

"Russia launches 'major missile attack' on Ukrainian energy facilities, infrastructure in multiple cities","Explosions were reported in at least three Ukrainian cities Friday as authorities said Russia launched a ""major missile attack"" on energy facilities and infrastructure.

Local authorities on social media app Telegram said air raid alarms sounded across the country as explosions were reported in the capital of Kyiv, southern Kryvyi Rih and northeastern Kharkiv.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported explosions in at least four districts, according to the Associated Press.

""The attack on the capital continues,"" Klitschko wrote on social media. He urged residents to seek shelter, reminding them that subway services in the capital were suspended as people flocked to the underground tunnels for protection.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a top official in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, reported a strike on a residential building in Kryvyi Rih.

""There may be people under the rubble,"" he wrote on Telegram, adding that emergency services had arrived at the building.

National railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia reported power outages at an undisclosed number of stations in the eastern and central Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions due to damage to the energy infrastructure.

Trains remained in operation by switching from electric power to steam-engine power.

Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure have been part of a new strategy to try to force Ukrainians into submission after key losses in recent months.

In contrast, some analysts and Ukrainian leaders believe Russia's losses have only strengthened Ukrainian forces as the conflict enters its tenth month.

Russia invades Ukraine in largest European attack since WWII,"Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday by land, air and sea in the largest military attack of one state against another on the European continent since the Second World War.

Russia’s all-out attack on Ukraine has killed at least 57 people and wounded 169 during the first day of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s Health Minister Oleh Lyashko said Thursday.

President Biden said Thursday afternoon that he’s reached a full agreement with G7 leaders to limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy, stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military and impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

In a public address from the White House, Biden said Putin has much larger ambitions than Ukraine and wants to ""reestablish the Soviet Union.""

Secretary of Defense Gen. Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of approximately 7,000 additional U.S. troops to Germany in a move aimed at bolstering NATO defense and deterring Russian aggression.

The wide-ranging attack on Ukraine hit cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee the country. Ukraine's government said Russian tanks and troops rolled across the border in a ""full-scale war"" that could rewrite the geopolitical order.

After several hours of fierce battle, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday raised concerns of repeated of the 1986 disaster.

A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters earlier Thursday that Putin’s goal appears to be seizing the capital of Kyiv, ""decapitating the government"" and ""installing his own method of governance.""

He claimed Putin indicated this himself during his overnight speech.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

According to the U.S. Embassy Riga, U.S. troops from the Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Latvia Thursday morning. They were the first U.S. forces being repositioned to the Baltics to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to Allies and bolster NATO’s eastern flank.

However, the defense official emphasized that, ""U.S. troops are not going to be fighting the war in Ukraine."" The U.S. military has no aircraft in Ukrainian airspace as of Wednesday morning, he said.

Russia has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles into Ukraine since its initial onslaught overnight. Starting around 9:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, Russian forces began launching missiles from land and sea-based platforms from the Black Sea toward key cities in central and eastern Ukraine, the official said.

The official said Russian forces were fighting all three major axes ""designed to take key population centers."" The heaviest fighting has been occurring near an axis from northeast of Ukraine to the south, starting from Belarus to an advance on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

A second axis extends from north central Ukraine to the south from Belarus toward Kyiv. A third axis in the south is spreading from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to the Ukrainian city of Kherson.

Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, called for Russia to be removed from SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, and for allies to support them through devastating financial sanctions against Russia, through defensive anti-air supplies, and by cutting all diplomatic ties with Russia.

Recognizing Ukraine is not a member of NATO, Markarova said she did not expect U.S. troops to defend Ukraine but expected other support give their ""strategic friendship.""

RUSSIA CRACKS DOWN ON ANTI-WAR PROTESTS, MORE THAN 1,700 DEMONSTRATORS ARRESTED

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine before the House of Commons Thursday and moved to freeze assets of Russian banks. He announced the ""largest ever"" set of sanctions against Russia and vowed to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian oil and gas.

Anti-Russian demonstrations have popped up across Europe and in the U.S. in cities including New York, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris and Berlin. Meanwhile, Russian authorities began cracking down on anti-war protests across the country, reportedly arresting more than a thousand demonstrators in several cities.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the country severed diplomatic relations with Russia and called ""on all our partners to do the same. By this concrete step you will demonstrate that you stand by Ukraine and categorically reject the most blatant act of aggression in Europe since WWII.""

While the attack on Ukraine was largely condemned by the West, it’s unclear whether forces will intervene, something Russian President Vladimir Putin warned would show grave consequences. NATO is sending additional forces to bolster defenses in eastern Europe.

Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Thursday about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country, The Associated Press reported. Several dozen people have been wounded. He didn’t specify whether casualties included civilians.

Zelenskyy said he would be providing weapons to citizens who want to help defend the country, instructing them on Twitter to ""be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE IN LARGEST EUROPEAN ATTACK SINCE WWII

""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said Thursday, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.

Russia ""has embarked on a path of evil,"" the president said, but Ukraine ""is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks."" Zelenskyy said sanctions would be lifted ""on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defense with weapons in hands.""

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history.""

The attacks came first from the air. Later, Ukrainian authorities described ground invasions in multiple regions, and border guards released security camera footage Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south.

In the north, video showed tanks rolling over the border from the Russian ally of Belarus through Senkivka. Russian forces also landed in the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol.

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defenses in a matter of hours, and European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone.

Russia's claims could not immediately be verified, nor could Ukrainian ones that it had shot down several Russian aircraft, according to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia’s massive air power and precision weapons.

Western counties were anticipating hundreds of thousands of people to flee from the attack on Ukraine, Reuters reported. Highways outside of Kyiv swelled with traffic Thursday leading to Poland, and lines of people waited for gasoline, to withdraw money or to purchase other supplies, such as food and water.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Ukraine said columns of Russian troops were passing over the border into the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk, Reuters reported. Russian missiles also targeted several Ukrainian cities, and explosions could be heard before dawn in the capital of Kyiv, home to 3 million people.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion. He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

In a reminder of Russia’s nuclear power, Putin said ""no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.""

Among Putin’s pledges was to ""denazify"" Ukraine. World War II looms large in Russia, after the Soviet Union suffered more deaths than any country while fighting Adolf Hitler’s forces. Kremlin propaganda sometimes paints Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis seeking revenge — a charge historians call disinformation. Ukraine is now led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust.

The head of the National Police of Ukraine on Thursday raised all units to combat alarm and warned civilians not to go outside in uniform or tactile clothing and to report all suspicious objects or people, especially those with red items on their clothing, to a special police line.

Zelenskyy has declared martial law in the country.

""Regarding the aggression of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, police have intensified measures to ensure law and order on the streets,"" Ukrainian national police said in a statement. ""The Head of the National Police of Ukraine also ordered the issuance of weapons to the veterans of Internal Affairs who have expressed willing to protect Ukraine from the Russian Federation's armed aggression.""

Shocking video shows Chinese robot attack dog with machine gun dropped by drone,"A Chinese military contractor created a video showing off its terrifying new military technology, revealing a robot attack dog that can dropped off by a drone.

The video that was initially released on the verified Weibo account of ""Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing,"" a page affiliated with a Chinese defense contractor, shows a drone hovering over a building and then dropping off a robot on the roof. After the drone flies away, the robot gets up on four legs and then begins to scan for targets around the building with what appears to be some sort of automatic weapons attached to its back.

According to a report from WarZone, the weapon mounted on the robot dog is possibly a Chinese QBB-97 light machine gun, which is capable of firing 650 rounds per minute at an effective range of 400 meters.

TEAM BIDEN'S 'WEAK,' WOKE MILITARY ISN’T READY TO FACE CHINA, RUSSIA. AMERICA NEEDS TO ACT FAST ON DEFENSE

A description of the robot posted by Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing and automatically translated to English boasts that the weapon can easily ""launch a surprise attack.""

""War dogs descending from the sky, air assault, Red Wing Forward heavy-duty drones deliver combat robot dogs, which can be directly inserted into the weak link behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack or can be placed on the roof of the enemy to occupy the commanding heights to suppress firepower. And ground troops [can] conduct a three-dimensional pincer attack on the enemy in the building,"" the description reads.

The Chinese technology and other similar weapons have so far been designed to be operated by a human at the controls, though military analysts fear that systems in which robots designed to operate autonomously are in development and could soon be deployed on battlefields.

Ukraine warns of massive Russian missile attack on anniversary of Putin’s invasion: ‘We have to be ready’,"Ukrainian officials are warning civilians to prepare for a massive barrage of Russian missiles on the anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion next week.

Russia fired three dozen missiles toward critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Thursday, but officials say they expect next week's volley to be much larger. Ukraine's air defenses have had some success in shooting down incoming missiles, disabling 16 of the 36 launched Thursday, but a larger barrage is likely to cause severe damage in major cities.

""Yes, it will be tough, and we have to be ready for it. We must maintain maximum calm,"" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Russia began its current invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

RUSSIA WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST PROVIDING ARMS TO UKRAINE: 'WILL LEAD TO AN ESCALATION OF THIS CRISIS'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned for weeks that Russia plans to ramp up its aggression at the one-year mark, though in the past he has referenced a ground offensive.

U.S. defense officials have agreed with Zelenskyy's assessment, saying it is likely Putin will try an offensive in an effort to turn the tables after months of Ukraine regaining territory.

""The situation on the frontline is complicated,"" he said in a sit-down interview with Fox News’ Trey Yingst earlier in February. ""Russia is preparing for the rematch. We can feel this. I believe that it has already started or not fully. We will see that in the nearest weeks.""

Ukrainian forces are killing nearly 1,000 Russian troops each day in the conflict, and they eliminated 5,000 troops in a single battle in late January, according to U.K. officials citing data from Ukraine.

Russian troops, including the elite 155th naval infantry, stormed the Ukrainian coal mining city Vuhledar near Dontesk in late January. Ukrainian forces repelled the offensive, however, and killed, injured or captured 5,000 Russian troops.
