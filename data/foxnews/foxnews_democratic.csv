‘SNL’ cold open offers up more ‘exciting’ Democratic candidates ahead of ‘big yikes’ midterms,"""Saturday Night Live""’s cold open this weekend had President Biden (James Austin Johnson) concerned about the ""big yikes"" midterms on Tuesday and wondering if the liberals should spice up their candidate lineup.

""This Tuesday, the midterm elections will determine the fate of our democracy and let’s just say: big yikes!"" Johnson, while standing behind a presidential podium, emphasized as the commander-in-chief at the top of the show.

""Folks, I’m trying like hell, I promise. I’m on the Peloton every morning tempting fate,"" Johnson said as Biden.

The fake president admitted he's ""boring"" and said the problem for Democrats this election cycle is that they don’t have ""any stars anymore.""

‘SNL’ COLD OPEN BREAKS DOWN RISE OF GOP CANDIDATES WITHOUT ‘ANY POLITICAL EXPERIENCE’ AHEAD OF MIDTERMS

""Too many Raphael Warnocks and not enough Herschel Walkers, which is why we’re going to make some last-minute changes with some Democrats who are exciting!"" he exclaimed.

Biden suggested replacing Rep. Adam Schiff with former presidential candidate and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson.

Williamson said as a ""level-four enchantress"" she’s ""ready to fight for the American dream"" as she hit a Tibetan singing bowl.

Biden called her ""America’s next ‘defense against the dark arts teacher,’ folks.""

He also suggested ""'Mayor of Flavortown' Guy Fieri"" (Molly Kearney) to replace Democratic candidate John Fetterman against Dr. Mehmet Oz.

""America is hungry for change,"" Kearney said as the fiery, bleach blond Food Network star. ""But do y’all want Dr. Oz’s crudité or a full plate of paid family leave dripping in donkey sauce? Whew!""

BIDEN PREDICTS DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE SENATE, HAVE CHANCE TO KEEP THE HOUSE IN MIDTERMS

Johnson's Biden also introduced rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine (Marcello Hernández) as ""your next senator from Ohio.""

""I want no cap on social security, no cap!"" the distinctive rapper said forcefully while waving his arms around. ""Democrats, baby!""

Biden called him a ""terrifying young man"" after the rapper left the stage before introducing former adult film star Stormy Daniels (Cecily Strong) as the ""next governor of Michigan.""

""Hi, TV,"" Strong as Daniels slurred slightly. ""I may be a former adult star currently on season seven of the ‘Surreal Life’ but I am willing to debase myself and enter U.S. politics.""

He said rapper Azalea Banks (Ego Nwodim) would beat Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ""because she’s not afraid to fight.""

""I’m a witch, b----!"" she shouted, holding her hands up like claws while Biden looked on scared as she walked off.

Finally, he introduced actor Tracy Morgan (Kenan Thompson) as the new person in charge of the student loan handout after saying people ""got mad"" at him over the policy.

In the ""SNL"" alum's laid-back style, Thompson said if ""y’all want that money"" people would have to ""come over here and rub my belly.""

Bringing back the motley crew, who all answered Biden’s ""What do we want?"" question (Morgan wanted sugar-free White Castle) and the ""When do we want it?"" questions differently (Williamson suggested a parallel timeline), the president decided half-heartedly, ""We’re going to be fine.""

"Democratic state senator boasts support of drag queen event for minors which offered lube, condoms","A Democratic Pennsylvania State senator – Steve Santarsiero – sponsored a ""queer prom"" event which featured lube, condoms and a drag queen show for minors, Libs of TikTok reported.

When Fox News Digital reached out for comment about the drag queen performance, the state senator boasted his support of the event which occurred at a Planned Parenthood-sponsored youth program called the ""Rainbow Room,"" which is located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

""I am proud to support the Rainbow Room’s annual Queer Prom for LGBTQ youth. I will continue to do so,"" Santarsiero told Fox News Digital.

DODEA SOURCES SPEAK OUT ABOUT WOKE ‘MARXIST’ INDOCTRINATION: ‘I'M NOT A… SEXUAL REALIGNMENT ENGINEER'

The ""Queer Prom"" was open to minors starting at age 14 and offered goodie bags of ""Condoms, lube, dental dams, latex dam[s]."" Fox News followed up with the senator on this fact but did not receive a response.

One of the hosts of the committee shared details of the goodie bag that was distributed to minors at the ""Queer Prom.""

""We've got… tarot cards and candy,"" the host said. ""Everyone's going to get a crystal star shaped pendant..., a progress pride flag, a Planned Parenthood bracelet.""

""Everyone will take one home when prom ends,"" the host added.

Planned Parenthood offers comprehensive sex education at ""Rainbow Room"" locations.

""Our weekly meetings are a safe space where you can feel empowered and know that you're getting accurate information about relationships, sex, and more,"" it explained on its website.

Fox News Digital previously reported that an executive director at Planned Parenthood 's sex education arm – Bill Taverner – claimed that children are born ""sexual"" while simultaneously advocating for comprehensive sex education from kindergarten through 12th grade and porn literacy for certain ages.

I USED TO RUN A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC. THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE WORKERS FEEL

Taverner, who has advocated for sexuality education at U.S. congressional briefings , is the executive director of Planned Parenthood's Center for Sex Education located in New Jersey. The Center provides training materials nationally and hosts the largest conference for sex educators in the U.S.

In 2015, he said, ""[We have] in our society, an assumption of asexuality of people with intellectual disabilities. It's a myth that's perpetuated, and really we are all sexual beings from birth until death.""

Planned Parenthood said in a guide entitled the ""Fundamentals of Teaching Sexuality"" that "" sexuality is a part of life through all the ages and stages. Babies, elders, and everyone in between can experience sexuality.""

Around the year 2012, Taverner said children of a certain age should be taught about pornography in sex education, a position he has maintained up until at least February 2021.

Additionally, a Planned Parenthood sex educator , Mariah Caudillo, shared on TikTok how youth can acquire sex toys. In another video she discussed how to use fruits and vegetables as ""spicy toys.""

Caudillo said that ""pleasure-based sex education"" can be appropriate for young people.

""Everyone deserves pleasure in the way they want to experience pleasure. *Reminder: pleasure-based sex education can be tailored to meet the need of the youth you might be working with; in other words, it can be age-appropriate,"" she said.

Planned Parenthood took home over $600 million in taxpayer dollars from reimbursements and grants, according to its 2021 report.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-state-senator-boasts-support-drag-queen-event-minors-offered-lube-condoms,N/A
"Liberal media, Dems erupt over Sinema leaving Democratic Party: 'Still great at being the f---ing worst'","Some liberal media pundits and commentators were stunned — or not surprised, but still angered — Friday morning after Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party and registering as an independent.

The news broke just days after Democrats celebrated expanding a slim majority in the Senate after winning in Georgia. Fellow independents Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont caucus with Democrats, and Sinema has said she will not caucus with Republicans.

Some Democrats, liberal media anchors and political commentators erupted with anger and shock at Sinema’s decision, including Democratic operative Adam Parkhomenko fuming, ""I see Kyrsten Sinema is still great at being the f---ing worst.""

ARIZONA SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, REGISTERS AS INDEPENDENT

Left-wing MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan also reacted to the news: ""In the most shocking, surprising, and unexpected news in modern American political history, Senator Kyrsten Sinema is leaving the Democratic Party, which makes sense because 1) she was never really a Democrat, and 2) she can’t win a Dem primary in 2024. So Sinema being Sinema…""

Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, who previously claimed that he dated Sinema, roasted her on Twitter: ""You are ethically unfit to continue serving as a United States Senator - manipulative, deceptive, messianic, without principles. I urge you to resign your office immediately.""

MSNBC analyst Brittany Packnett Cunningham called it ""confirmation that she is the worst,"" and far-left activist Charlotte Clymer wrote, ""Her own greed and narcissism is her political party.""

""Sinema has been planning this move for years. She’s been openly moving toward this with every hypocritical, self-serving move she’s made, from climate change to the filibuster. This has been the most cynical marketing effort in American politics and the worst kept secret in D.C.,"" Clymer wrote, predicting she was trying to at some point join a Republican national ticket.

Sinema has voted reliably with President Biden while in office, however, supporting his agenda 93 percent of the time, according to data website FiveThirty Eight.

Some figures more soberly assessed her decision.

""Obvious point but Sinema was almost certainly going to draw a primary challenge and was going to have a very tough race,"" MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes tweeted. He also complained that the other Democratic senator in Arizona, Mark Kelly, won his race with ""way less drama.""

""We don’t actually know what’s going on in the mind of Kyrsten Sinema, but sometimes we can look at her and we can ask ourselves: What’s she thinking?"" MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough said on ""Morning Joe.""

""She is less of an independent and more of an enigma,"" CNN political contributor Van Jones said on ""CNN This Morning,"" calling her a ""confounding political presence.""

LIBERALS IN MEDIA ATTACK SINEMA FOR DEFENDING BIPARTISANSHIP, 'FRIENDSHIP' WITH MCCONNELL

""What do you stand for and what do you stand against?"" Jones asked, accusing her of ""just gumming up"" the Democratic Party. CNN reporter Melanie Zanona backed up Jones: ""She likes being called an enigma. She probably relishes in that.""

Sinema tweeted Friday morning that she has ""joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington and formally registering as an Arizona Independent.""

In an interview with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, Sinema was warned that Democrats were going to call her ""every name in the book."" ""They're going to call you traitor, an ingrate,"" Tapper said. It wouldn't be the first time she has been insulted for her unorthodox political views. In September, Sinema was labeled the ""worst kind of Democrat"" by critics.

LIBERALS BLAST SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA AS RACIST, 'BIGOT' FOR OPPOSING ELIMINATION OF FILIBUSTER

Sinema similarly defended her decision in an op-ed for the Arizona Republic, arguing that she was ""declaring"" her independence from ""the broken partisan system in Washington.""

""When politicians are more focused on denying the opposition party a victory than they are on improving Americans’ lives, the people who lose are everyday Americans,"" she wrote in the op-ed.

Censor or else: Democratic lawmakers warn Facebook not to ‘backslide’ on censorship,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

With the restoration of free speech protections on Twitter, panic has grown on the left that its control over social media could come to an end. Now, some of the greatest advocates of censorship in Congress are specifically warning Facebook not to follow Twitter in restoring free speech to its platform.

In a chilling letter from Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., André Carson, D-Ind., Kathy Castor, D-Fla., and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Facebook was given a not-so-subtle threat that reducing its infamous censorship system will invite congressional action. The letter to Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, is written on congressional stationery ""as part of our ongoing oversight efforts.""

With House Republicans pledging to investigate social media censorship when they take control in January, these four Democratic members are trying to force Facebook to ""recommit"" to censoring opposing views and to make election censorship policies permanent. Otherwise, they suggest, they may be forced to exercise oversight into any move by Facebook to ""alter or rollback certain misinformation policies.""

In addition to demanding that Facebook preserve its bans on figures like former President Donald Trump, they want Facebook to expand its censorship overall because ""unlike other major social media platforms, Meta’s policies do not prohibit posts that make unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud.""

INDICT JACK DORSEY? FORMER TWITTER CEO'S POTENTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY AFTER CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY

Clegg is given Schiff's telephone number to discuss Facebook’s compliance – an ironic contact point for a letter on censoring ""disinformation."" After all, Schiff was one of the members of Congress who, before the 2020 presidential election, pushed the false claim that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation, and he has been criticized for pushing false narratives on Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election.

The letter to Clegg is reminiscent of another letter sent by several congressional Democrats to cable-TV carriers last year, demanding to know why they continue to carry Fox News. (For full disclosure, I appear as a legal analyst on Fox News.) As I later discussed in congressional testimony, it was an open effort by those Democrats to censor opposing views by proxy or by surrogate.

This is not the first time that some members of Congress have not so subtly warned social media companies to expand the censorship of political and scientific views which they consider to be wrong.

In a November 2020 Senate hearing, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story. But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., warned that he and his Senate colleagues would not tolerate any ""backsliding or retrenching"" by ""failing to take action against dangerous disinformation.""

Others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have called on social media companies to use enlightened algorithms to ""protect"" people from their own ""bad"" choices. After all, as President Joe Biden asked, without censorship and wise editors, ""How do people know the truth?""

Now, Democrats fear Facebook and other social media companies might ""backslide"" into free speech as Facebook, among others, is faced with declining revenues and ordering layoffs. Tellingly, these congressional Democrats specifically want assurances that those layoffs will not reduce the staff dedicated to censoring social media.

FEC NEEDS TO REOPEN TWITTER PROBE NOW THAT DOCUMENTS MUSK RELEASED WHO COMPANY MAY HAVE OUTRIGHT LIED

It is not hard to see the cause for alarm. This hold-the-line warning is meant to stop a cascading failure in the once insurmountable wall of social-media censorship. If Facebook were to restore free-speech protections, the control over social media could evaporate.

Despite an effort by the left to boycott Twitter and cut off advertising revenues, users are signing up in record numbers, according to Twitter owner Elon Musk, and a recent poll shows a majority of Americans ""support Elon Musk’s ongoing efforts to change Twitter to a more free and transparent platform.""

The pressure on Facebook is ironic, given the company's previous effort to get the public to accept – even welcome – censorship. The company ran a creepy ad campaign about how young people should accept censorship (or ""content modification,"" in today's Orwellian parlance) as part of their evolution with technology. It did not work; most people are not eager to buy into censorship. Instead, many of them apparently are buying into Twitter.

The public response has led censorship advocates to look abroad for allies. Figures like Hillary Clinton have called upon European countries to force the censorship of American citizens.

Censorship comes at a cost not only to free speech but, clearly, to these companies. Nevertheless, some members of Congress are demanding that Facebook and other companies offer the ""last full measure of devotion"" to the cause of censorship. Despite the clear preference of the public for more free speech, Facebook is being asked to turn its back on them (and its shareholders) and continue to exclude dissenting views on issues ranging from COVID to climate change.

These members know that censorship only works if there are no alternatives. The problem is that there are alternatives. Fox News reportedly has more Democrats watching it than left-leaning rival CNN, which now faces its own massive cuts and plummeting ratings.

For whatever reason, these companies face declining interest in what they offer. Yet, some Democrats are pushing them to double-down on the same course of effectively writing off half of the electorate and the audience market.

This type of pressure worked in the past because individual executives are loathe to be tagged personally in these campaigns. However, their companies are paying the price in carrying out these directives from Congress.

In the past, many companies willingly – if not eagerly, in the case of pre-Musk Twitter – carried out censorship as surrogates, as the internal Twitter documents released by Musk have indicated. Some public officials knew they could circumvent the First Amendment by getting these companies to block opposing views by proxy. However, the public and the marketplace may succeed where the Constitution could not – and that’s precisely what these officials fear, as they see the control of social media erode heading toward the 2024 election.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg once famously told his company to ""Move fast and break things."" When it comes to censorship, however, these members of Congress are warning ""Not so fast!"" if Facebook is considering a break in favor of free speech.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/censor-or-else-democratic-lawmakers-warn-facebook-not-backslide-censorship,N/A
Liz Peek: Why Democratic convention could be a good week – for Donald Trump,"The Democrat convention kicks off Monday.

With no hint of irony, Democrats have titled their event, “Uniting America.” How will they unite America when they can’t even bring their own party together? And when, over the next four days, they will spew nothing but hatred and vitriol about President Donald Trump, who is supported by roughly 45% of the nation?

Democrats and their partners in the liberal media will pretend their party is enthusiastically unified behind their ticket. They are not. Young Black voters, in particular, are not on board with Joe Biden.

RNC CHAIRWOMAN MCDANIEL: DNC SET TO SHOWCASE BIDEN-HARRIS' RADICAL POLICIES

Overall, Pew reports that only 42% of Democrats are “very” or “fairly” satisfied with the choice of candidates this year; that’s lower than when Hillary Clinton ran in 2016.

That’s why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand congresswoman from New York who thoroughly rattles Establishment Democrats, is allowed only a 60-second prerecorded sound bite at the convention, even though she has a huge, young following. Party officials are scared to death the Democratic Socialist might alarm moderate voters, and for good reason.

Instead of yielding AOC the floor, party officials have scheduled a few marquee speakers, like former first lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and some controversial picks like Jeffrey Epstein pal former President Bill Clinton, but have otherwise stuffed the program with snoozers like Hillary Clinton (from whom we have really heard more than enough), Al Gore, John Kerry, Lisa Blunt Rochester (?) and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.

Democrats admire Yates because she was fired by Trump for insubordination early in his tenure, a real badge of honor.

More recently, she developed amnesia when asked by the Senate Judiciary Committee whether Joe Biden, during a 2017 Oval Office meeting, suggested incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn be investigated for violating the Logan Act. Responding “I can’t remember” probably earned her a spot at the convention.

Spoiler alert: Democrats can’t really bridge the gap between the Biden Left and Sanders Far-Left. Instead, they plan to unify their party by spending the hours between now and Thursday night lambasting President Donald Trump as a terrible, terrible person and even worse president.

That’s what they’ve got. That’s what their voters want.

Polling shows Democrats are much more excited to oust Trump than elect his opponent; a recent Pew survey shows 56% of Biden supporters say their top reason for voting for the former VP is “He is not Trump.” That sentiment will not drive turnout.

Meanwhile, Biden’s announcement that Sen. Kamala Harris of California would join his ticket appears to have provided at best a fractional boost to his lead over President Trump.

The biggest challenge for Democrats, though, is that the tide is moving in Trump’s favor.

On the cusp of the Democrat convention, the president had a very good week. Top of the chart was the landmark deal establishing relations between the UAE and Israel. Try as they may, the liberal press cannot diminish the importance of this achievement.

Democrats remain mum about the horrific crime wave that is driving residents to flee some of our biggest cities.

Forming alliances between the Gulf Arab states and Israel creates a formidable bulwark against Iran, the most dangerous and anti-American provocateur in the region. While the Obama-Biden administration undermined our relationship with Israel to promote a disingenuous outreach to Iran, pretending that President Hassan Rouhani might work to normalize relations with the U.S. when they knew better, the Trump administration has strengthened our support of the Jewish state and begun to bring Arab nations along.

It is hoped that other countries, like Bahrain and Oman, will also establish ties to Israel. The breakthrough represents a formidable piece of diplomacy.

Last week also saw COVID cases declining 4% and unemployment claims tumbling below one million for the first time since March, raising hopes that the dire impact of the virus is beginning to fade. Housing is accelerating and June real retail sales rose 0.5% from June, indicating a quarter-to-quarter 50% annualized gain in the third quarter, economists say.

More and more, to the horror of Democrats, it looks like the country is recovering at a faster rate than expected from the virus shutdown. An indication of how powerfully the media is trying to scuttle this message comes from a recent survey in which 62% of Americans say the economy is poor, while at the same time 65% say that their own personal finances are good. That only makes sense if the press is overstating the gloom, which they are.

Meanwhile, Democrats remain mum about the horrific crime wave that is driving residents to flee some of our biggest cities. Democrats and their liberal media allies may not care about the increased looting and gunplay that are making our streets and neighborhoods unsafe, but most Americans do, and so does President Trump.

That’s why New York’s Police Benevolent Association, which represents about 24,000 rank-and-file officers, endorsed the president’s reelection bid last week. The head of the union, who stated that their members were under attack, said he could not remember another time in the past 36 years that the union had endorsed a candidate for president, and praised the president for being “one strong voice speaking up in our defense.” This, while Democrats on the Left push to “defund the police” even in cities like Minneapolis where crime has surged.

Then there was the announcement that Harris would be Biden’s running mate, a choice so fraught with issues that nervous Democrat-aligned groups felt obliged to instruct the media on how to report on the candidate.

Lastly, we have Joe Biden, who spent yet another week literally hiding from voters while his wife and surrogates met with donors, and who continues to decline any meaningful interviews for fear he will reveal … what? That he is actually suffering dementia or that he doesn’t believe in the progressive agenda he has endorsed to please the Bernie Sanders crowd?

Yes, Trump had a good week. Most likely, he’s about to have another one.

Your parent's Democratic Party is dead,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Long gone is the Democratic Party of your parents’ generation. They have morphed and contorted themselves into a political party no longer relatable or recognizable to most of America.

Today’s Democratic Party embraces the extreme, rewards the radical, shuns the sensible, and caters to the contemptible.

FORMER STRIPPER RUNNING FOR CONGRESS SAYS ‘CLIMATE EMERGENCY’ PARTIALLY PROMPTED DECISION TO GET AN ABORTION

Not too long ago there were Democrats who were concerned about the finances of the country. They were affectionately referred to as ""Blue Dog Democrats"" who were worried about deficits and debt. There is no place for them in today’s Democratic Party. President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris just introduce the largest budget ever with the largest tax increase ever requested. There very few ""Blue Dogs"" in Congress, and they are on their way to extinction.

Leftist policies have become so extreme, even traditional liberals no longer recognize today’s Democratic party. With never ending mask mandates, mandatory vaccinations, and control of individual self-determination, liberalism has been abandoned.

In the case of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) they have altered their liberal approach to free speech for everyone, no matter what they say. Now the ACLU that first considers if it is an assistance to the progressives. They even went so far as to justify mask mandates, stating, ""Far from compromising civil liberties, vaccine mandates actually further them."" Really?

Ira Glasser, the outspoken former ACLU Executive Director in January 2022 told Bill Maher, """"The ACLU has become … more of a political partisan, what they call ‘progressive’ organization.""

Today’s Democratic Party prioritizes illegal entry into the USA while abandoning the rule of law. They fight for the suspected and convicted criminals while ignoring the victims.

Often you will hear Democrats refer to rural America with contempt, labeling them as clinging to their guns and their religion while simultaneously lumping them together as uneducated. Rarely do you here them talk about ""middle America"" nor express a genuine understanding of what life is like outside of New York, Washington, and San Francisco.

Bill Hogseth, chair of the Dunn County Democratic Party in Wisconsin, in 2020 wrote in Politico, ""The pain and struggle in my community is real, yet rural people do not feel it is taken seriously by the Democratic Party. My fear is that Democrats will continue to blame rural voters for the red-sea electoral map and dismiss these voters as backward.""

Democrats are losing blue collar workers, parents, young voters, Hispanics, etc. It is difficult to find an area of growth for Democrats today.

It is policy that is repelling the voters. Inflation, energy, foreign policy, immigration, taxes, crime, and extreme positions on mask mandates, gender, and education all are driving people away from the Democratic Party.

Beyond the policy positions, they also lack dynamic leadership. Clinton and Obama were charismatic personalities that brought people into the party. Not anymore.

Joe Biden was supposed to be a uniter, a man with a plan, and a seasoned senator who could get things done in Congress. None of those turned out to be true.

Leo Terrell: The Democratic Party left me this year — here's what I am going to do now,"Fox News viewers have long known me as an ardent Democrat, ready to fight for the ‘other’ side. However, in the past eight months, this has changed. It has changed so drastically that I’m jokingly referred to as “Leo 2.0.” It is a change so complete that I am campaigning and preparing to vote Republican in this election — for the first time ever.

As the Democratic Party gets ready to hold its national convention, I’d like to explain why I’ve left the Democratic party and will proudly cast my vote for President Donald Trump. First let me say, I did not leave the Democrats, they left me. The party of the Civil Rights movement, the party of JFK and “Ask not what your country can do for you” has abandoned all its principles and handed the reins over to extremists.

Let’s start at the top with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. On May 22, in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, Biden told him, “I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” In case you don’t know, I AM Black, and I did not know that the color of my skin also came with a mandate that I vote for the old White guy who’s been in politics for 47 years (without a discernible record of accomplishments on behalf of Black people.)

WHAT TO WATCH FOR MONDAY AT THE DNC

I didn’t know that Black Americans were expected to form a monolithic voting bloc, one in which we bow down to the almighty Democrats, and do whatever they say. Again, I ask, what has Biden done for Black America? It’s not just Biden — or his dubious choice for vice president — that has me casting a Republican ballot.

What has happened to the Democratic party? I don’t even recognize it anymore — not since they allowed all policy decisions to be made by extremists within the Black Lives Matter and Antifa movements. Thanks, but I’ll take a hard pass on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. dressing up in a kente cloth and taking a knee.

I need, WE need, for Democrats to support law and order. We need Democrats to acknowledge that ALL Black lives matter ... that it means more than just the George Floyds of the world. It means the Black-on-Black crime that’s killing children in Chicago, and the looting and riots that killed retired St. Louis police captain David Dorn, a Black man.

Instead of seeing the very real and very necessary reason for police in poor neighborhoods, Democrats are calling to “Defund the Police.” If you do this, who will answer the call to fight the drug dealers and the gang members in the neighborhood? I can assure you, it won’t be a social worker and it won’t be Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

Finally, the Democratic party has left me by refusing to acknowledge that President Trump is right about the corrosion of America’s largest cities. Our cities are literally going up in flames, all while the elected officials blithely watch. And guess who’s running them?

Democrats. In New York, it’s Bill DeBlasio, who has even managed to appall traditional Democrats. Chicago has Lori Lightfoot. Seattle has its very own summer-of-love Mayor Jenny Durkan. And there’s Los Angeles, where Eric Garcetti has effectively managed the rapid decline and decay of my beloved home city. These cities regularly make the news for riots, looting, murders and rampant homelessness. The quality of life in these cities has declined — all on the watch of the Democrats.

As a Civil Rights attorney, it would seem out of character for me to vote for Donald Trump. But I am a fair-minded individual and have witnessed our president pass a comprehensive police reform executive order, at the same time supporting law enforcement.

I know from my work that inner-city residents need and depend upon a police presence to fight crime and violence. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has turned its back on me and all Americans by giving in to chaos and dismissing the needs of the poor and middle classes.

My vote depends upon one thing: who will fight for every American in this country? It’s the candidate who will fight for law and order, and fight for equality of educational opportunities.

TUCKER CARLSON: Antifa is the armed militia of the Democratic Party and is back in force,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Whatever happened to Antifa? Ever wonder that? The shadowy, heavily armed left wing militia group, the guys dressed like stormtroopers in black masks? You remember them, of course, well, from the summer of 2020, they burned our cities that year. Churches and police stations and courthouses.

Now, the point of the violence they committed, the extensive violence and the killings they committed, was to defeat Donald Trump – Make the country so chaotic that voters would want a change, and they were effective in doing that. So effective that Kamala Harris herself raised money to bail them out of jail. In the end, Antifa played a pivotal role in our presidential election that year, more so than any other organized bloc of voters. Then, the moment Joe Biden was inaugurated, Antifa seemed to disappear. Nobody asked any questions about where they went, much less about who they were or who was paying them. They'd served their purpose, and then they left.

MEDIA ACCUSED OF DOWNPLAYING VIOLENCE AGAIN DURING ATLANTA RIOTS: ‘IT WAS A NIGHT OF RAGE PLANNED BY ANTIFA’

So in retrospect, it's very clear who Antifa was and is. Antifa is the armed instrument of the permanent Democratic establishment in Washington. Their job is to mobilize when politically necessary. Now, this is a new thing in the United States, but political militia are a common feature in third world politics. They were a staple in Haiti. In our country, however, only one party has them, the Democratic Party. They're the only ones with armed militia in the street.

So with that in mind, it's interesting to note that Antifa is back in force, and that's probably not a very good sign for Joe Biden. If nothing else, Antifa has a solid track record of getting rid of sitting presidents. Here's a report from Fox 5 in Atlanta over the weekend:

FOX 5 REPORTER: Police arrested six people in the violent protest that left several buildings damaged and a police car destroyed after it was set on fire. Downtown Atlanta erupted into a scene of chaos Saturday night as a protest took a violent turn. At least three buildings were damaged when rioters threw bricks and rocks, shattering windows. At least two police cars were targeted. One even lit on fire. Atlanta police say within two blocks of the protesters starting their destruction, they disperse the crowd. Six people were arrested. All of them are facing eight charges, including domestic terrorism and arson. Only one is a Georgia resident.

Unleash the wackos. Somebody has unleashed the wackos. There's always a pretext for this. There's always a story. They tell you to pretend it's spontaneous. ""It just happened. They just got so mad that they flew in from all over the country to stage a riot.""

Now, the story behind this riot, the one you're seeing on TV, is that a guy called Tortuguita, apparently an Antifa environmentalist, person who uses they/it as pronouns, decided to shoot a state trooper in Georgia, and then the cops shot back and killed it in response.

So that's the story they're telling to explain the riots. It doesn't make a lot of sense, actually. But everyone in the media is running with this, CNN included, and especially. CNN, in fact, turned to a freelance reporter called David Peisner to explain exactly what happened this weekend in Atlanta. Watch this.

DAVID PEISNER: There's a real blurring of the lines in the use of the word ""violence."" Is property destruction violence? To some people, it certainly is. But, you know, this idea that breaking windows or other acts of property destruction are the same as actual violence against humans is kind of a dangerous and slippery concept. You keep using these words ""violent, violent, violent, violent."" and it gives the impression. I mean, the only violence or the only acts of violence against people that I saw were actually police tackling protesters.

Why does every neoliberal talk like a sociology professor at a community college? You ever notice that?

So that's David Peisner, identified by CNN as a freelance journalist, explaining that actually it's not really violence because it's against property. So when they burn your house down, it's not violence. It's not violence.

It's always the same script. Remember when Ali Velshi stood in front of a burning police station in Minneapolis and told you the protests were, quote, ""not generally speaking, unruly ""except for, of course, the torched police station right behind us. When CNN told us the protests, the protests, the riots in Kenosha were ""fiery but mostly peaceful."" Meanwhile, people were being killed.

They're still saying it, but this time they're even lazier and more corrupt. That freelance reporter David Peisner you just saw on CNN is not actually a reporter. He's a professional Antifa apologist. He is a fellow traveler for Antifa. And we're not just guessing at that. This week, he went on Twitter to raise money for Antifa, including a GoFundMe for Tortuguida, the attempted cop killer with the confusing pronouns. That's the guy CNN is calling a reporter. Freelance reporter.

So the question is not is CNN dishonest? Oh, they'll say anything.

The question is why this particular brand of dishonesty. Why the same people who warned you about right-wing extremists walking around the Capitol, running cover for domestic terrorism in the city they're based in? Keep in mind, this is CNN saying this, and it was CNN whose headquarters, it's world headquarters, CNN Center in Atlanta, was destroyed by Antifa in May of 2020 after Saint George Floyd died. Remember that?

So that day in May of 2020, Antifa actually got inside CNN Center. They smashed through the windows and went right in. So if you're CNN, you'd say, ""Well, look, we're going to have to put Antifa on the 'do not promote' list. We just can't, we just can't run cover for the people who smash the windows of our world headquarters."" But they are. They're doing it anyway. Why are they doing that?

Because CNN is not actually on the left. They have no ideology or beliefs. CNN is above all and always foursquare on the side of the people in charge. Always. That's whO they run cover for. So they're not actually defending Antifa. They're defending the people who benefit from Antifa. And that's the Democratic Party.

TUCKER CARLSON: WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM EXISTS TO ‘DESTROY NATIONAL ECONOMIES’

And in case you doubt the connection, consider Representative Katherine Clarke of Massachusetts, she/her. Katherine Clarke is one of the senior Democrats in the House of Representatives. In fact, she's the Minority Whip. She's the one who was so worried about climate change. Remember, she told you that her kids were having nightmares about it? Didn't stop her from buying $1,000,000 oceanfront home, but whatever.

So Katherine Clarke's own son, Jared Dowell, was riding along with Antifa in Boston on Saturday night. He was vandalizing a monument on Boston Common when police tried to arrest him. Jared Dowell and other protesters then assaulted the police, causing the specific officer to bleed from the nose and mouth. Oh, that was her son.

So Katherine Clarke was forced to issue a statement about this, of course. By the way, stop talking about her personal life. If you knew what the personal lives of the people who run the Democratic Party are actually like, you would understand their politics much better. So Katherine Clarke issued a statement and refers to her son as her ""daughter"" – Huh? Of course – and wrote that ""This is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting.""

It's just, you know, part of the cycle where your adult son pretends to be a woman and attacks police officers. It's totally normal, it's just part of the cycle of parenting. Yeah. Again, if you knew the details of their personal lives, you would understand their politics. This is the party of weak men and unhappy women.

But what you have in effect here is the official endorsement of domestic terrorism from the highest level of the Democratic Party. And why wouldn't you? Again, this is their militia. These are their state-sanctioned shock troops, and they are effectively immune from criticism.

So you go to jail for owning a 10-round magazine, but they get to do whatever they want. Merrick Garland and Christopher Wray, who runs the FBI, are making certain that every last January 6 defendant spends years in jail. Their lives are destroyed, on the no fly list. And yet Antifa terrorists get released almost as soon as they're arrested.

This week in Atlanta, the police arrested the 22-year-old son of a surgeon in Kennebunkport, Maine, called Francis Carroll. Now, in case you're wondering who these people are, well, they come from the key Democratic demographic, which, of course, is not people of color, working people. That's nonsense.

The key Democratic demographic is upscale professionals and their lunatic children. So this kid grew up in a $2 million mansion – pictures of him on his father's yacht. He was arrested on domestic terrorism charges a month ago in Atlanta. He assaulted police officers and terrorized residents.

Is he still there? No. He got out of jail immediately. So then apparently he went again to an Antifa riot. This weekend in Atlanta, police say Carroll went out and committed some more domestic terrorism, including arson. So why does this kid, the rich kid, get off when the people who showed up at the Capitol, consistent with their constitutional rights, to complain about what really did seem like fraud in the 2020 election, they went to jail?

Well, have you ever checked the percentage of January 6 defendants who've experienced a personal bankruptcy? Much higher than average. These were actual working class people, deeply frustrated, completely out of options and unheard by everyone in Washington. It's not an excuse for the vandalism some of them committed. But it tells you it's a very different group of people. They didn't go to Middlebury or some other liberal arts madrassa. They're actual working people.

But they're in jail and the rich kids are out. Is anyone going to ask Merrick Garland to explain that? Is anyone going to ask what Antifa is? Who leads this group? How many more riots do they have to lead before the New York Times gets interested and does a five-part series on what is this? Who are these people? Who pays for this? Where do they stay at night? What's their background? Give us some news on Antifa. They're the biggest armed militia in the United States, and we know nothing about them. Why? Because they're aligned with the Democratic Party.

But they're telling you the real threat is rural voters with AR-15s, assault weapons. You must disarm Republican voters. No, thanks.

Disarm? Why don't you go ahead and disband Antifa? Go full RICO on them. Let's find out who their leaders are. Let's see them in jail. Then maybe you can tackle street crime and then pay a little bit of attention to the drug cartels that control the southwestern United States. And then maybe at that point, you will convince some people to register their AR-15s, But until you do that, up yours.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-antifa-armed-militia-democratic-party-back-in-force,N/A
Tucker Carlson: The FBI has been working on behalf of the Democratic Party,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Every year since 1970s, the State Department has published a document called ""World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers."" You probably haven't read it, but it is interesting. It's a detailed accounting of global arms sales, what weapons were sold and where they wound up after they were. The U.S. government published this report in the interest of transparency and then continued to publish it through multiple politically charged scandals and conflicts that would include through Iran Contra, two separate wars in Iraq and all 20 years that we occupied Afghanistan. A report like this would be especially useful to have right now and would be critical to have as the Biden administration sends billions in high-tech military equipment every month to corrupt oligarchs in Eastern Europe.

Where are all of those weapons systems going? We should know the answer to that, but we don't know because this year, for the very first time in half a century, the Biden administration has stopped releasing that information. They never explained why they stopped. They just stopped and no one pushed them. Now you'd think this would be a scandal. If there's one thing the news media exists to do, it's to fight for the release of relevant government records because in a democracy, you have a right to know what is being done in your name, but not anymore. That information is classified, Mr. Citizen, so you don't get to find out where those billions of dollars of weapons that you're paying for are going. Who's getting them? What are they doing with them? You don't get to know.

You don't get to learn about anything about Ashley Biden showering with her father. You can get arrested for that. You don't get to know how many FBI assets were in the crowd on January 6 and what they were doing. As we just noted, you don't get to read the affidavit justifying the FBI's indefensible raid on the home of Joe Biden's primary political opponent. In fact, you don't even get to know why you're not allowed to know because that information has been redacted too. What are you a Russian agent? Stop asking. Didn't used to be this way at all. It's unrecognizable. A lot has changed in a very short time.

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DEFENDS BIDEN'S 'SEMI-FASCISM' CLAIM ABOUT 'MAGA REPUBLICANS'

So. it turns out, looking back 18 months, the 2020 election was the most consequential election of our lifetimes. You assume Joe Biden was incapacitated and couldn't change much. Well, true, he is incapacitated, but the people behind him most definitely are not. They are more ideological and more aggressive than ever. Now it turns out among those people is our largest and most heavily armed federal law enforcement agency. That would be the FBI. The FBI is not allowed to insert itself into domestic politics. That would violate the U.S. Constitution. It is completely illegal, but for several years it has become increasingly clear that that is exactly what the FBI is doing, actively working on behalf of the Democratic Party, mocking the rule of law, subverting our democracy from within far more effectively than any foreign government ever could.

If that sounds like an overheated claim, and it definitely does sound like an overheated claim, unfortunately, you should know it's entirely true. We know that for a fact. Here's how we know and we learned it yesterday. Weeks before the 2020 election, the FBI pressured social media companies to kill the story of Hunter Biden's laptop. Why? Because that was a story that might have prevented Joe Biden from becoming president. That happened and we know this not because The New York Times investigated it. They didn't bother. They didn't bring you a special report in yesterday's paper giving you the details. The New York Times would never do that, even if they knew it to be true and they may. No, we know this instead, because Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook blithely admitted it almost parenthetically during an interview with Joe Rogan. Watch this.

JOE ROGAN: There was a lot of attention on Twitter during the election because of the Hunter Biden laptop story. The Post, so you guys censored that as well?

MARK ZUCKERBERG: So, we took a different path than Twitter. I mean, basically the background here is the FBI, I think basically came to us, some folks on our team was like, ""Hey, just so you know, like, you should be on high alert."" We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump.. that's similar to that, so just be vigilant.

DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO BIDEN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED SEPARATE DEBT CANCELLATION BILL

Oh, so Zuckerberg, just to be clear, you just saw it, but let's just unwind what we saw. Zuckerberg was asked, ""Why did you censor the story about Hunter Biden's laptop?"" And he said ""some folks from the FBI came to us and indicated there was about to be a dump of Russian propaganda."" Now, there is still rewriting of history going on in which some are claiming, some on Facebook are claiming actually, that the visit from the FBI had nothing to do with the Hunter Biden laptop, but the answer you just saw was in response to a question about the laptop and the censorship of it and the answer was Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation.

Neither of those terms has an agreed upon meaning. They don't actually mean anything. What's Russian propaganda? Is it true? That should be the only question that any news or information company, including Facebook, ever asked. Is it true? Truth is the defense. No. It's Russian propaganda. Again, a term without a meaning. So, we wanted to know more. We reached out to Mark Zuckerberg after that interview and he responded to us to his credit.

Zuckerberg confirmed that the FBI didn't put any of these warnings about Russian disinformation propaganda in writing. Of course, they didn't. Nothing in writing and that makes sense. If you're the FBI, you wouldn't want to put that in writing because you were, of course, lying. At the moment, the FBI was warning Facebook about a propaganda dump that obviously would include Hunter Biden's laptop, they had Hunter Biden's laptop in their possession. So, they knew perfectly well it was authentic because anyone who looks at it does. We have looked at it and it's instantly obvious this is real and of course, we now know conclusively it is real.

BIDEN SEEMINGLY APOLOGIZES TO WHITE HOUSE STAFF AFTER TAKING TOO MANY MEDIA QUESTIONS: ‘I SHOULDN’T DO THAT’

So, that laptop was not censored because it was propaganda, whatever that means. By the way, the FBI should never be in the information control business anyway. It was censored because it might hurt Joe Biden and the FBI is the government agency that pushed for it to be censored. Has that ever happened in the United States, ever? That is the definition of police state behavior: a government agency independently decides it's going to determine the outcome of a supposedly democratic election.

So, why is it nearly two years until we learn this? Well, it turns out Facebook is a very political place. The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, paid hundreds of millions of dollars to affect the outcome of the election. Famously, we've reported on that and then, of course, there were Democratic Party operatives working within Facebook. So, on October 14, the Facebook communications official and former Democratic Party operative called Andy Stone claimed that Facebook was censoring this story because of Facebook's ""standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation"" whatever that means, but that was their initial explanation.

It wasn't until late October that Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of the company, publicly mentioned the FBI's involvement for the first time and here's what he said, ""We relied heavily on the FBI's intelligence and alerts, both through their public testimony and private briefings that they gave us."" He testified to that, but at the time, Mark Zuckerberg didn't mention anything but the FBI warning Facebook about, ""Russian propaganda specifically.""

BUTTIGIEG EMPHASIZES INFLATION ALLEVIATION AND NEW FLIGHT PROCEDURES WHILE PROMOTING NEW GRANT

Why didn't he say anything? That's odd because in October 2020, right before the election, weeks before a presidential election, every media outlet in the country and then candidate Joe Biden himself were using the very same line, ""It's Russian misinformation, it's propaganda"" and not surprisingly or coincidentally, dozens of former intelligence officials were saying the same thing. We can't play this enough. Here it is.

PETER STRZOK, 2020: When you look at this computer store owner in Delaware who allegedly received Hunter Biden's laptop, that is more in line with that when you think about somebody who's a useful idiot, that's kind of the entry point that is kind of, again, a classic indicator of the potential presence of disinformation.

KASIE HUNT, 2020: Right-wing media has been focused on Hunter Biden, this laptop that intelligence officials have warned is likely Russian disinformation .

NICOLLE WALLACE, 2020: Law enforcement is actively investigating whether the alleged Hunter Biden emails are linked to any foreign intel ops.

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS STAND TO BENEFIT FROM BIDEN STUDENT DEBT HANDOUT: WATCHDOG GROUP

JASON JOHNSON, 2020: The story is preposterous. So, we're supposed to believe that Hunter Biden, in a drunken stupor, dropped off his laptop in apparently a QAnon repair office.

So, those are the shills who will say whatever they're told to say. Of course, no sober person would take them seriously and we missed the bigger story, too. We will admit that. At the time we imagined that this lie, that the laptop was Russian misinformation, was being pushed almost exclusively by Democratic partisans, but that's not true. It was much worse and much more threatening to our democracy, in fact, utterly corrosive of our democracy than that.

Again, our media attributed these claims to former Intel officials who wrote a letter about Russian disinformation, but no, it wasn't just former Intel officials spreading that lie. It was members of the U.S. government, federal bureaucrats, people who work for federal agencies, senior FBI leaders who are still at the FBI. They lied and they knew they were lying and they never took steps to validate this claim that it was Russian propaganda or Russian disinformation. On this show in October of 2020, we interviewed one of Hunter Biden's business partners, a man called Tony Bobulinski, and he verified the authenticity of that laptop.

BIDEN JOINS OTHER DEMS IN DISMISSING REPUBLICAN VOTERS, SAYS HE DOESN'T 'RESPECT THESE MAGA REPUBLICANS'

He had firsthand information. He had texts and emails that were on his phone and also on the laptop. So, we reached out to Tony Bobulinski last night and we asked him a very simple question. Did anyone from the FBI ever call you or your lawyer to find out since your name was all over the laptop, if those texts and emails were real? If they wanted to know if this was Russian disinformation, they would, of course, call you, but not one of them ever did. They knew it wasn't Russian disinformation. They knew it wasn't propaganda, and they knew it was completely real and they lied about it. Here's what Bobulinski told us in October of 2020.

TONY BOBULINSKI: On May 13, that email was sent from James Gilliar to me. I didn't generate that email. James Gilliar generated that email and in that email, James Gilliar goes through intimate detail of what each individual's requests were from a compensation perspective and how the equity in the enterprise would be divvied up. Very important. May 13. That email was generated by somebody else to me. In that email there's a statement where they go through the equity. Jim Biden has referenced, as you know, 10%. Doesn't say Biden. It says Jim and then it has 10% for the big guy held by H. I 1,000% sit here and know that the big guy is referencing Joe Biden. That's crystal clear to me because I lived it. I met with the former vice president in person multiple times and I had been meeting and talking with Hunter Biden and Jim Biden and Rob Walker and James Gilliar.

So, to note the obvious, that's not some cable news mouth breather who's giving you his stupid partisan opinion about Hunter Biden's laptop. That's Hunter Biden's former business partner, who can prove he was Hunter Biden's former business partner. No one disputes he was Hunter Biden's former business partner. His name, his emails or texts are all over the laptop and yet somehow the FBI, the agency that sent a dozen agents to investigate a rope in a NASCAR garage, the agency that used hundreds of agents to hunt down grandmothers from the election justice protest on January 6, that same agency couldn't spare a single agent to make a telephone call to Tony Bobulinski to ask questions about the laptop. You claim it's propaganda, it's misinformation. Why don't you call the guy who's on it and ask him? They didn't bother. This is what the FBI has become: an agency that seeks to exert control over the information that you read in the media. What is this? Well, it's terrifying and again, this isn't speculation.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BREAKING THE WAVE

We just had it confirmed in public yesterday. These are people whose main goal is to ensure that they never lose power in Washington, interfering with our elections and not simply by hiding information, resorting to force because they know they can get away with it. Joe Biden's chief political opponent, right now—Biden says he's going to run again. Trump has indicated he's running—will be Donald Trump and so they're targeting them. Is anyone noticing this? John Paul Mac Isaac, the computer repair shop owner who first obtained the laptop, says an FBI agent threatened him so he wouldn't go public with the laptop. In case you've forgotten, watch.

JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC: The FBI met with me at my home and asked me about my concerns. I voiced my concerns and they I then shifted and said, ""Hey, can I just want this out of my shop. At this point, just get it out of my shop and give me a phone number I can call should somebody come looking for it or wants to harass me about it"" and they're like, ""Yeah, we can't do that."" When they showed up, instead of bringing in a tech guy with them, they brought a subpoena and they're like, ""Yeah, we're just going to take everything."" I was a bit uncomfortable, a little nervous, but then excited at the same time, so I kind of cracked a joke. I said, ""Don't worry lads. When I write the book, I'll leave your names out of this"" and that's when Agent Mike turned around and said, ""Oh, it's in our experience that nothing ever happens to people that talk about these things.""

No one should ever be afraid of the FBI except people who know full well they've committed federal crimes.

TUCKER CARLSON: Fetterman's candidacy tells us something dark about the Democratic Party,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Two days before the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania back in May, staffers for the John Fetterman campaign announced that their candidate had tragically suffered a stroke, but no problem. In a written statement purportedly written by John Fetterman himself from the hospital, Fetterman announced that he was absolutely fine.

""I'm feeling much better,"" the statement read. ""Doctors tell me I didn't suffer any cognitive damage."" The primary continued as planned with Fetterman's name on the ballot and Fetterman won. He became the Democratic nominee and that was the last that most voters heard about John Fetterman's stroke.

For months, Fetterman remained in semi-seclusion. Then as the campaign progressed and the polls tightened, he began to venture out. He had no choice. And video clips surfaced of Fetterman speaking at rallies in what seemed to be a bizarre and highly disjointed way. Some began to wonder if he'd really suffered ""no cognitive damage"" from his stroke.

It was at this point that Fetterman’s personal physician, a man called Clifford Chen, who also happened to be a campaign donor to him and other Democrats, rushed forward to bring science to bear on this question. In Clifford Chen's considered opinion as a respected medical professional who works at a major research university, John Fetterman was absolutely fine. Fetterman was ""recovering well"" from his stroke. He had ""no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office.""

In other words, John Fetterman was as sharp and as healthy as you or me, as anyone in America. In fact, more so, ready for the Senate. Fetterman's wife, who presumably would know, seconded this assessment and attacked anyone who disagreed—so did a group of Democratic officeholders who wrote a piece in the Huffington Post about how their own strokes had only enhanced their public service. A stroke? No big deal. It's a good thing, actually, ought to be a prerequisite for service in the Senate. For their part, most of the reporters who covered John Fetterman day-to-day worked hard to calm concerns about his health.

PENNSYLVANIA SENATE DEBATE: OZ DECLARES VICTORY OVER FETTERMAN AS THE TWO CLASHED OVER ABORTION, FRACKING

Is John Fetterman a silver-tongued wordsmith? No, they conceded, he never has been, but brain damaged? Come on. Don't be a bigot. That's ablest.

Until last night, that's pretty much where things stood. Some people, mostly Republicans, thought John Fetterman might not be mentally fit to work in the Senate. Others, mostly Democrats, agreed with Clifford Chen, his doctor, that Fetterman was absolutely fine.

It was a neat partisan split. Then, Fetterman appeared on stage for his first and only debate and settled this question for all time. John Fetterman, it turns out, is not capable of driving a car. He should not be allowed to operate a microwave oven. There is no chance that under any imaginable circumstances, John Fetterman could ""serve in the U.S. Senate."" It's not a close call. Watch.

MODERATOR: You're running for a seat that could decide the balance of power in Washington. What qualifies you to be a U.S. senator? You have 60 seconds.

JOHN FETTERMAN: Hi. Goodnight, everybody.

REPUBLICANS QUESTION FBI OVER HUNTER BIDEN PARTNER’S CHINA TIES, ABILITY TO ‘INFILTRATE’ FAMILY BUSINESS

What? That was the moment right at the top that you know, this was not a debate like the debates you'd seen before. Most of it is feel pretty scripted and in fact, this debate actually was scripted. John Fetterman had a script. He was reading it, but he was still incapable of following that script. Here, for example, is how Fetterman responded to maybe the most obvious question of the night, one he knew was coming and of course, would have prepared for it. Here's his answer.

MODERATOR: You're saying tonight that you support fracking, that you've always supported fracking, but there is that 2018 interview that you said ""I don't support fracking at all."" So, how do you square the two?

FETTERMAN: Oh, I do support fracking and I don't, I don't, I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking.

CONGRESSMAN DEMANDS RECORDS FROM DOJ DETAILING FACE ACT ABORTION PROSECUTIONS: 'EASILY WEAPONIZED'

OK, so a lot of conclusions here. The most obvious, why is Clifford Chen still practicing medicine? If you're a physician, are you allowed to lie for partisan reasons? Don't we have enough of that in this country? Should doctors be allowed to do that? He clearly was lying.

That's not a man who can work with no restrictions in the U.S. Senate. Far from it. And everyone watching, every honest person, would come to that conclusion. We could play you a lot of clips like that, probably seen them already today, but not everyone is an honest person and to prove it, we're going to show you how MSNBC covered this debate the moment it ended. Here is New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister.

REBECCA TRAISTER, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Clearly this was a candidate who was feeling stress and there was such intense scrutiny, often ablest scrutiny on how he was going to communicate, and he just did a debate in front of, you know, the nation, you know, an audience of anyone who could listen and it was so transparent. He did fumble. He did make verbal mistakes, you know, and it was all on view, but, you know, I think it's also really interesting. You played a lot of clips. There were moments where he was really strong, including that Bernie Sanders quip, including his very fluent and direct response on raising the minimum wage, I thought was a really strong moment.

We just keep clips like that around just for future historians to assess what went wrong in America and we wanted the hackiest possible response, the most dishonest assessment ever offered of any public event, and we just played it for you. He was facing ableist scrutiny.

Because we're literally can't control ourselves, ou just heard her say that Fetterman had a strong answer to a question. Talk about patronizing, by the way. Well, we thought we'd go and check what was his answer. You can assess for yourself whether this was ""strong.' Here it is.

GRASSLEY, JOHNSON SHARE HUNTER BIDEN'S CHINA-LINKED BANK RECORDS WITH US ATTORNEY LEADING CRIMINAL PROBE

MODERATOR: What do you say to small business owners who have told us that if the minimum wage were increased to $15 an hour, it would put them out of business? You have 30 seconds.

FETTERMAN: We all have to make sure that everyone that works is able to, that's, that's the most American bargain that if you work full time, you should be able to live in dignity is well true and I believe they haven't, have any businesses being, being, we can't have businesses being subsidized by not paying individuals that just simply can't afford to pay their own way.

Again, we could fill the hour recapping John Fetterman's sad responses, but it's not really that surprising. Anyone who's been following John Fetterman for the past five months, you knew that he was profoundly cognitively impaired and it turns out he is. So, you learn really not that much new about him. What you learn is that everyone around him, from his doctor to his wife to the media, to the Democratic Party, they're all liars and they all just got caught lying. Then they went on and on and on like this. During Dr. Oz's closing statement, Fetterman began shouting uncontrollably about social security until the moderator hushed him. Really? Look it up.

HOUSE HOMELAND REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM CBP, ICE ON ALLEGED MIGRANT PROCESSING FAILURES

The effect over an hour is to make you feel very sad for John Fetterman. This is humiliating. The guy looked exactly like Billy Bob Thornton in the movie ""Slingblade."" He really did. He couldn't even read the canned lines his staff was writing for him. It was pathetic. You do wonder about his wife, as you do about Joe Biden's wife. It seems cruel to do this to a man, even for political power.

But again, it's the media who cover John Fetterman, who should be the most ashamed. They've known the truth for months. With only one exception, that would be NBC reporter Dasha Burns, the media lied to voters about it. We don't know anything about Dasha Burns, but she at least tried to be sort of honest. Here's what she said after meeting John Fetterman.

REPORTER DASHA BURNS: You'll hear he also still has some problems, some challenges with speech and I'll say, Katy, that just in some of the small talk prior to the interview, before the closed captioning was up and running, it did seem that he had a hard time understanding our conversations.

Oh, that's not allowed. Here you have a young reporter who clearly doesn't know the rules. No matter what you actually see or experience or report, you can't reveal anything that might hurt the fortunes of the Democratic Party. That might slow down the team. So, clearly Dasha Burns hadn't gotten that memo and for daring to say that, for honestly reporting what she saw, liberals tried to destroy her.

Molly Jong-Fast said she spoke to Fetterman and, ""He understood everything I was saying and he was funny."" Podcast host Kara Swisher—this is like the worst people on social media—wrote this on Twitter, ""Sorry to say, but I talked to @JohnFetterman for over an hour without stop or any aides and this is just nonsense. Maybe this reporter is just bad at small talk.""

Blame the girl, will you, Kara Swisher? Of course. And then Charlotte Alter of Time Magazine, whatever that is, also interviewed Fetterman recently. She knew perfectly well he is incapacitated. They all did, but Charlotte Alter decided to cover for John Fetterman because supporting a Democratic Party is, of course, her job. In the hours before the debate Charlotte Alter did the bidding, the direct bidding of the Fetterman campaign, by trying to lower expectations. That was their goal, and she worked on their behalf.

""Fetterman has never been a good debater."" Alter added, ""Everyone will be watching for Fetterman stroke symptoms. I can tell you already what they are. He sometimes says the slightly wrong word or conjugates something the wrong way.""

Okay. They're not embarrassed. They're caught working for a Democratic Senate campaign and they just shrug it off and keep going. They never slow down.

Once Fetterman got on stage, it was really kind of no lying about it. He humiliated himself. The usual chorus piped up, not to admit that they were wrong, but to say, yeah, he's demented, but it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter that he's totally incapable of thinking or speaking. Why? Because abortion. Abortion is more important than anything because it's not a child sacrifice cult at all. No, it's not. Don't worry.

FETTERMAN STUMBLES DURING DEBATE WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT FLIP-FLOP ON SUPPORT FOR FRACKING

In response to a post stating the obvious, that Fetterman is totally impaired, a lawyer at the Democratic Party's main firm, Perkins Coie, sent this Stalinist tweet, ""His ability to protect a woman's right to choose is not in doubt. This is a harmful tweet. Delete it.""

""Delete it."" Of course, it's important to note the obvious, Senate Democrats tweeted effectively the same message after the debate. ""Mehmet Oz is a grave threat to woman's right to choose. John Fetterman will fight to protect abortion access nationwide."" That's their response to a guy who is literally incapable of talking.

What do we learn from this? We learn a couple of things. Obviously, it tells us that abortion is more important than anything else. Abortion is what really matters to the left. And if you doubt that, consider the case of 89-year-old Dianne Feinstein who supposedly represents the country's biggest state in the U.S. Senate. At this point, everyone in Washington knows, Dianne Feinstein isn't representing anyone. She's no longer capable of recognizing old friends and in April, the San Francisco Chronicle, to its credit, ran a story in which former staffers, not political enemies, but registered Democrats who voluntarily worked for Dianne Feinstein, in which these people, her friends, describe Dianne Feinstein's mental decline and said that she was too senile to serve in the Senate.

In response to that, Nancy Pelosi dismissed their firsthand accounts as ""unconscionable"" and ""ridiculous,"" not just wrong, but immoral. In other words, shut up. Dianne Feinstein is on our team and that's all that matters.

To emphasize that point, yesterday, Kamala Harris went on a tirade not about inflation or housing prices or fentanyl deaths or the border or the looming nuclear war with Russia, but about the thing that matters most to her and all of them, which is abortion . Watch this.

MONTHS LATER, JEAN-PIERRE STILL PLAYING DODGEBALL AT WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Laws that are being proposed that would punish women who dare to exercise self-determination and make decisions about what they know to be in their best self-interest because apparently there are some, I call them extremist so-called leaders who have decided they're in a better position than she is to make decisions about what's in her best interest. How dare they! I think that we need to take back the flag on this issue. This is about freedom and liberty.

Oh, it's about freedom and liberty, says the childless middle-aged lady who forced women across the country out of their jobs because they wouldn't take the vaccine that she was pushing on them. Suddenly it's their body, their choice again. Right. Barack Obama cut an ad for John Fetterman just a few days ago. He's not ashamed to do that. His argument? Of course, abortion again. Watch.

FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In Pennsylvania, you've got some important choices to make this year, including who represents you in the U.S. Senate. That's why I'm asking you to vote for John Fetterman this election day, November 8. So, when the fate of our democracy and a woman's right to choose are on the line, I know John will fight for Pennsylvanians. You can count on John Fetterman. Make sure he can count on you.

JILL BIDEN DEFENDS HUNTER TO NBC, SAYS SHE KNOWS HER SON IS 'INNOCENT'

It all goes back to that one issue. It always does. Why is that? We're not exactly sure, but it's hard not to notice that it does. But there's something bigger going on here. Fetterman's candidacy, like Joe Biden's candidacy two years ago, tells us something pretty dark about the Democratic Party. What it tells us is the Democratic Party has such contempt for voters and for democracy itself and so much confidence in its ownership of the media and of Big Tech that it no longer has to try to win your votes.

"5 'dirtiest' cities in America run by Democratic mayors, study says","The top five dirtiest cities in the country are run by Democrat mayors, a new study has found.

Among 152 of the biggest cities across the United States, Houston won the No. 1 spot for dirtiest city, followed by Newark, New Jersey, San Bernardino, California, Detroit and Jersey City, New Jersey, according to a study released Thursday by LawnStarter.

LawnStarter measured each city across four categories: pollution, which measures things like air quality and greenhouse gas emissions; living conditions, like the percentage of homes containing mold or rats; infrastructure, which measures waste output and regulations; and consumer satisfaction, or the percentage of residents who find the city dirty.

Houston, which is run by Democratic Mayor Sylvester Turner, ranked No. 1 in overall score for the dirtiest city. It ranked third in the nation on pollution, fourth on poor living conditions, 12th on infrastructure and 34th on consumer satisfaction.

ATLANTA, BALTIMORE, DETROIT: STUDY SHOWS DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES HAVE HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATES

Houston also ranks third-worst in greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities and has the biggest cockroach problem, the study said, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Turner's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Newark, which is run by Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka, came in second place for dirtiest city, earning the No. 3 spot for worst consumer satisfaction and No. 5 for poor living conditions.

San Bernardino, which is run by Democratic Party-endorsed Mayor Helen Tran, earned the No. 1 spot for worst pollution and worst consumer satisfaction.

Detroit, run by Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan, ranked No. 4 for worst consumer satisfaction and No. 9 for pollution.

Jersey City, run by Democratic Mayor Steven Fulop, ranked No. 2 for poor living conditions and No. 15 for consumer satisfaction.

"AOC hits Sinema for leaving Democratic Party, registering as an independent: 'People deserve more'","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. is criticizing Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema after she announced her decision to leave the Democratic Party and register as an independent on Friday.

Sinema announced the decision in an Arizona Republic op-ed published on Friday, criticizing America's two party system.

""Americans are told that we have only two choices – Democrat or Republican – and that we must subscribe wholesale to policy views the parties hold, views that have been pulled further and further toward the extremes,"" Sinema wrote. ""Most Arizonans believe this is a false choice, and when I ran for the U.S. House and the Senate, I promised Arizonans something different.""

In response, Ocasio-Cortez said that Sinema doesn't offer ""a single concrete value or policy she believes in.""

SINEMA'S EXIT FROM DEMOCRATS COULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE SENATE

""She lays out no goals for Arizonans, no vision, no commitments,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""It’s ‘no healthcare, just vibes’ for Senate.""

Ocasio-Cortez also said she's ""grateful this race & nomination has opened up.""

Sinema is up for reelection in 2024.

""I pledged to be independent and work with anyone to achieve lasting results. I committed I would not demonize people I disagreed with, engage in name-calling, or get distracted by political drama,"" Sinema said in the op-ed.

"Arizona Democratic Party 'thanks' GOP candidate for her donations, weeks before primary","The Arizona Democratic Party ‘thanked’ GOP gubernatorial candidate Karrin Taylor Robson for allegedly helping Democrats get elected over the years with her many donations to the party, in an apparent attempt to interfere with the upcoming Aug. 2 primary.

""The Arizona Democratic Party would like to extend a warm ""thank you"" to Karrin Taylor Robinson for her longtime financial support to help elect Democratic candidates up and down the ballot,"" said the statement.

The organization was clearly targeting Robson, who appears to be the front-runner in her race, making her the harder candidate to beat in November's midterm election.

""While Robson uses her millions to buy TV ads and hide her true self, voters just aren't buying what she's selling. And it's no surprise — this is precisely the kind of political hypocrisy that aggravates people,"" Arizona Democratic Party spokesperson Josselyn Berry also wrote in the statement.

DEMOCRATS ‘MEDDLING’ IN GOP PRIMARIES HOPING TO NOMINATE UNELECTABLE REPUBLICANS

Berry continued: ""As the Republican primary for governor continues to stir toxic infighting, the Arizona Democratic Party will always be grateful for Robson's longtime support in helping elect Democrats up and down the ballot, including this November.""

The claims suggest that Republican candidate Robson gave ""thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates as recently as 2020,"" ultimately aiding in the election of many Democrats over the years.

DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCE MASSIVE TV AD BUY FOR MIDTERM RACES

Josselyn Berry did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Spokesperson for the Karrin for Arizona campaign Matthew Benson told Fox News Digital Thursday, ""Just like Democrats are meddling in GOP primaries across the country, they’re trying desperately to boost Kari Lake in Arizona because they prefer to run against her in November. The Democrats aren’t dumb; they’ve seen the polling and know Karrin Taylor Robson’s conservative record and broad coalition will be unbeatable in the General Election.""

The organization is attempting to foil the GOP primary, and the Karrin for Arizona campaign believes it's an effort from the Democrat party to turn voters in the direction of her primary opponent, Trump-endorsed Kari Lake, who appears to be the easier candidate for Democrats to beat in the midterms.

Sinema, in a Friday op-ed in the Arizona Republic, cited increasingly partisan interests and radicalization of both political parties as the reason for her departure.

SENATORS TILLIS, SINEMA REVIVE TALKS ON POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION DEAL DURING LAME-DUCK SESSION

""Americans are told that we have only two choices – Democrat or Republican – and that we must subscribe wholesale to policy views the parties hold, views that have been pulled further and further toward the extremes,"" Sinema wrote in the op-ed.

SINEMA DOUBLES DOWN ON FILIBUSTER SUPPORT, DEALING LIKELY FATAL BLOW TO DEMS' ELECTION BILLS

Sinema went on to accuse mainstream political parties in the U.S. of worrying more about blocking each other out than the well-being of their constituents.

The senator has been the target of extensive intra-party mudslinging for not falling in line with the rest of her party on key issues — most notably, refusing to abolish the filibuster.

""When politicians are more focused on denying the opposition party a victory than they are on improving Americans’ lives, the people who lose are everyday Americans,"" Sinema wrote in the op-ed.

She added, ""That’s why I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington. I registered as an Arizona independent. ""

"Biden, Sanders viewed as top 2020 contenders among Iowa's Democratic voters: poll","Former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders are the preferred choices of Iowa's Democratic voters going into the 2020 election, a recent poll revealed.

The poll, conducted by the Des Moines Register, Mediacom and CNN, revealed that 49 percent of Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers believe a “seasoned political hand” would stand the best chance of defeating President Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Biden, who has floated the idea of running his own campaign, came in as the front-runner with 32 percent of respondents picking him for their first choice. Sanders, who ran for president in 2016 but lost the party's nomination to Hillary Clinton, came in second with 19 percent.

J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll, told the Des Moines Register that seasoned politicians seem to be the direction Democratic voters are leaning toward despite being open to fresh faces.

""This is obviously a warm welcome to some people who are really familiar to caucusgoers in the state,"" he said. ""But there’s also some welcoming of newcomers who are only now starting to come to the state and get to know the people who could shape their future.""

Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat who drew a national spotlight despite an unsuccessful bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is the upstart candidate Iowans would be most likely to support, with 11 percent of participants choosing him as their first choice.

The only other Democrat with a significant amount of support in Iowa was U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 8 percent.

Other notable contenders included Sen. Cory Cooker, D-N.J., and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Biden draws first Democratic challenger for 2024 as Marianne Williamson confirms plans to launch bid,"Spiritual adviser and bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson is making a second straight run for the White House and taking aim at President Biden.

Williamson, who called for reparations and a Department of Peace as part of her long-shot campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, declared she plans to launch her candidacy for president in 2024 in an exclusive interview with Medill News Service on Thursday.

""I wouldn’t be running for president if I didn’t believe I could contribute to harnessing the collective sensibility that I feel is our greatest hope at this time,"" Williamson said.

WILLIAMSON TELLS DEMOCRATS ‘IT’S TIME TO MOVE ON' FROM BIDEEN

With many leaders in the Democratic Party from both the establishment and progressive wings saying they will support Biden, who is expected in the coming weeks or months to announce his re-election campaign, Williamson becomes the first Democrat with a national following to primary challenge the 80-year-old president.

""Apparently Biden's going to run on a message that the economy is getting stronger. I think that speaks to the disconnect between the analysis of party elites versus the struggle of everyday Americans,"" Williamson said in a recent interview with Politico.

SPIRITUAL GURU MARIANNE WILLIAMSON CONSIDERS BIDEN CHALLENGE, SAYS DNC IS 'SPITTING IN THE FACE OF DEMOCRACY'

And in a press release a week ago, Williamson spotlighted that she was exploring ""the possibility of running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024.""

""As America gears up for the 2024 presidential election, I’m preparing for an important announcement on March 4th in Washington DC,"" she advertised.

An adviser in the White House contender’s political circle told Fox News earlier this week that Williamson will travel to South Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Nevada after March 4.

""You can appreciate what the president has done — defeating the Republicans in 2020 — and still feel it is time to move on,"" Williamson said Tuesday in an interview on a New Hampshire news-talk morning radio program.

Williamson told host Jack Heath on ""Good Morning New Hampshire"" that ""many of us, myself included, feel that in order for the Democrats to win in 2024, we’re going to have to be able to offer to the American people something much more than"" what she says Biden is offering.

During the 2020 cycle, Williamson was an unconventional candidate who preached the politics of love. She emphasized ""six pillars for a season of moral repair,"" including economic justice. She proposed creating a Department of Children and Youths and a Department of Peace, and she pushed for reparations for the descendants of African-American slaves. Among her unorthodox acts was holding a meditation session while campaigning in New Hampshire.

But Williamson struggled with fundraising and failed to qualify for most of the Democrat presidential debates. Days after laying off most of her small staff, she dropped out of the race in January 2020, just ahead of the start of the nomination primaries and caucuses.

""With caucuses and primaries now about to begin, however, we will not be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now,"" she said at the time. And pointing to what at that moment was a very competitive race for the Democratic nomination, Williamson added that she didn’t want to ""get in the way of a progressive candidate winning.""

Williamson traveled to New Hampshire a week ago, ahead of her 2024 announcement, and it's likely she'll spend plenty of her time campaigning there going forward. That comes as no surprise as political strategists have said that if there’s going to be a primary challenge against Biden, New Hampshire appears to be the state where the action will take place.

THE TIME MARIANNE WILLIAMSON LED A MEDITATION SESSION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""Now you have everyone who wants to take a shot at Biden coming to New Hampshire to do it,"" a longtime Granite State-based progressive strategist recently told Fox News as he pointed toward the near certainty of the state holding an unsanctioned Democrat presidential primary next year. ""New Hampshire is the place where it’s happening.""

New Hampshire, which prides itself on its well-informed electorate and its emphasis on small-scale and grassroots retail politics, has for a century held the first primary in the race for the White House. While Republicans are making no changes to their presidential nominating calendar in the 2024 election cycle, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a new top of the calendar pushed by Biden that upends the traditional schedule.

New Hampshire will now vote second in the DNC’s calendar, along with Nevada, three days after South Carolina, under the new schedule.

But Granite State Democrats warn that New Hampshire will still go first — courtesy of a long-standing state law that mandates the leadoff primary position — and that a primary not sanctioned by the DNC, where Biden doesn’t take part, could invite trouble for the president.

GROWING SIGNS BIDEN COULD FACE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY NOMINATING STATE

""President Biden will not file for election in the New Hampshire primary, which will still go first,"" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley emphasized on the eve of the DNC calendar vote. And he warned that ""this will set him up, we believe, for an embarrassing situation where the first primary in the country will be won by someone other than the president. This will only fuel chatter of about Democrats divisions.""

Buckley’s prediction appears to be materializing with the arrival of Williamson.

Asked about the DNC’s nominating calendar move, she told Politico last month ""that is spitting in the face of democracy.""

Biden invokes possibility of 'Armageddon' in Democratic fundraiser speech,"President Biden said in an address to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Thursday night that the country under his leadership is as close to ""Armageddon"" as it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.

Speaking at a fundraiser in New York, Biden addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin threatening to use a nuclear weapon.

PUTIN ALLY RECOMMENDS RUSSIA USE LOW-YIELD NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN UKRAINE

""[Putin was] not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons,"" Biden said. ""We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.""

Russia has hinted several times at the possibility it could unleash weapons of mass destruction in its battle with Ukrainian forces if Putin believes the fate of the country is at risk.

""I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of NATO countries , and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,"" Putin said in an address last month.

White House officials have said the Biden administration has communicated directly with Russian officials about what kind of response using a nuclear weapon would bring. While officials have said they aren’t going to share publicly what the U.S. response would look like, they have said it would be ""catastrophic.""

Porter – first elected to Congress in 2018 – prioritized many issues during her House re-election campaign, placing focus on protections for abortion and ""standing up to big corporations.""

Porter owns a four-bedroom, three-bath home in Orange County, California , where the typical house sells for $1 million. The residence, located in a leafy subdivision on the UC Irvine campus, was obtained by Porter in 2011 for $523,000, a below-market price secured through a program the university uses to lure academics who couldn’t otherwise afford to live in the affluent area. The only eligibility requirement was that she continue working for the school.

As previously reported, Porter, who has campaigned on the issue of making ""college more affordable,"" earned thousands of dollars in royalty fees from law school textbooks that she required her own students to purchase for the courses she taught.

Baugh, a resident of Huntington Beach, is a business owner and a lawyer. He previously served as a California assemblyman, representing Orange County from 1995-2000. He has also served as chairman of the Orange County Gang Reduction Intervention Partnership.

Ahead of Tuesday's election, Baugh centered his campaign messaging on several issues that align with overall voter concerns, including the economy, crime, and education.

As of October 19, Porter had raised more than $22 million and had nearly $9 million cash on hand. Baugh had raised nearly $2.7 million and had nearly $140,000 cash on hand.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-voters-katie-porter-gop-challenger-47th-district,N/A
Chaos erupted during embattled Democratic attorney Kim Gardner's press conference,"Chaos erupted during embattled St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's press conference on Thursday after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey took legal action to have her removed from office, citing negligence of her duties, with one attendee yelling out that Gardner was facing ""race harassment.""

Gardner held a press conference following the public outcry against her for the handling of a prosecution of 21-year-old Daniel Riley, who was out on bail after violating his bond multiple times. Riley over the weekend struck teenager Janae Edmondson, who was visiting St. Louis with her family on Saturday for a volleyball tournament. Police say Riley was speeding, failed to yield and caused a collision, ultimately striking and pinning Edmondson, who remains in the hospital after both her legs were amputated after sustaining injuries from the crash.

""Can you stop the race harassment … what do you have to stop the racist people from harassing you and intimidating you? And it still comes from not the federal government, but we know we have no friends in Jefferson City,"" one person shouted after Gardner gave her opening remarks. Jefferson City is the state capital, home to the attorney general's office.

A moderator stepped in, saying, ""Ask your question, bro. We not going to need a speech. We're going to take a couple of, three questions and that's it.""

""We're in this right now if you all can speak cordial and civilized,"" the moderator said, talking over yells from multiple reporters.

DEFIANT DEM ATTORNEY KIM GARDNER BLASTS AG MOVE TO REMOVE HER, BLAMES 'VOTER SUPPRESSION'

Gardner eventually responded, saying, ""Well, I think that's a very complex question. It's about the people of the city of St. Louis that elected me to do a job. And what we have to do is do our job fairly and justly. There are numerous attacks on our office. There are numerous individuals that have an agenda to make sure that my office does not succeed.""

""That is not an excuse. But at the same time, we know we do not control every part of the system. But what we can control is we're going to fight very hard for justice in spite of the vitriol, the hate, the racist attacks, the known manipulation of the court procedures to make sure our office fails,"" Gardner said.

Another reporter asked why, after Gardner claimed that her office had asked a court judge multiple times to revoke bond on the individual who eventually was let out on bail and caused the accident that left a teenage girl in critical condition, that there was no court record of that request. Before Gardner could answer, there was an audible kerfuffle among reporters and attendees.

""First of all, there are, we have what's called oral motions to revoke bond. Those can be made orally or written, and in this jurisdiction, they are made orally and that is normal practice and that was done in this case on numerous occasions,"" she replied.

MISSOURI AG MOVES TO FIRE DEM ATTORNEY KIM GARDNER AFTER SHE REFUSES TO RESIGN OVER PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCRY

Another raucous ensued before a person asked, ""How is it that the media organizations who are responsible for researching these cases before they get on the news and start spewing facts got this so wrong, since Judge Hittenbock was responsible for the bond which ultimately set the young man free who injured the young lady?""

""In the end of the day, we all know the facts. I want to focus on Miss Janae Edmonson and her family because we all can point fingers, but this young lady's life is affected by the criminal justice system right now. And we want to hold this individual accountable. But I'm not going to point blame to anybody,"" Gardner said.

""The buck stops with my office, and we did our job. As I said, could we do more? We could. But did we not do nothing? That is not true,"" she continued.

A reporter then asked Gardner's reaction to St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones saying that the public has lost confidence in her, after which yells from the room erupted.

WHO IS KIMBERLY GARDNER, ST. LOUIS PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING GUN-TOTING COUPLE?

At one point someone could be heard, ""We're here to support her and stand behind her 100%,"" followed by applause.

Gardner eventually responded, ""First of all, I'm going to focus on the people who elected me, that people have a process if they do not, no longer want me in this office. And that's called an election. And so I cannot speak for the people and I will not address anything that the mayor said because I think the people should speak for themselves.""

Gardner was asked to respond to Bailey's legal petition to have her removed from her post, to which she replied, ""The attorney general, as others use this unfortunate incident and tragic happening to this young lady as a political stunt of an unelected individual,"" adding that ""this is nothing more than voter suppression, which we've seen on a national level as well as in the state of Missouri.""

Bailey was appointed attorney general in November 2022 by Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons after former AG Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate.

The press conference concluded with applause for Gardner from those in the room, with some heard saying, ""We've got your back.""

CLEAN SWEEP: Democratic meddling in GOP primaries paid off in a big way on Election Day,"Democrats' strategy of spending millions to boost pro-Trump candidates in Republican primaries appeared to pay off Tuesday as the party ended the night with a clean sweep of the races in which it chose to meddle.

All six of the Republican candidates who seemingly benefited from the meddling in their primary victories fell to their Democratic opponents. Those races include a number of key House and gubernatorial races, as well as the New Hampshire Senate race.

Democrats spent more than $40 million boosting those six GOP candidates, all of whom expressed support for former President Donald Trump as a leader of the Republican Party or were backed by him.

In New Hampshire, incumbent Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan easily defeated Republican and former Army General Don Bolduc, who was the Democrat-aligned Senate Majority PAC's candidate of choice to face what many viewed as one of the more vulnerable Senate members.

ELECTION DAY 2022 IS OVER. READY OR NOT, HERE COMES 2024 WHITE HOUSE RACE

The group, aligned with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, spent at least $3.5 million bashing moderate Republican state lawmaker Chuck Morse in an effort to boost Bolduc, who Democrats saw as the easier candidate to face Hassan.

Also in New Hampshire, incumbent Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster defeated Republican Bob Burns in the state's 2nd Congressional District. Burns reportedly benefited from $94,000 in spending by a new Democratic PAC called Democrats Serve in his primary race against a more moderate George Hansel.

In one of the more high-profile races this cycle, Democrat Hillary Scholten defeated Republican John Gibbs in the race for Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, a seat held by anti-Trump Republican Rep. Peter Meijer. Gibbs narrowly defeated Meijer in the August primary after being publicly backed by Trump in what was seen as a sharp backlash against Meijer's vote to impeach the former president.

CONSERVATIVE TWITTER READY TO CROWN DESANTIS ‘HEAD OF THE PARTY’ AFTER DECISIVE ELECTION WIN

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spent $425,000 in advertising to boost Gibbs, described by many as a member of the ""extreme"" wing of the Republican Party, specifically running an ad highlighting his conservative credentials.

Democrats' meddling touched three top gubernatorial races that all went in the party's favor on Tuesday, including in Maryland in support of Republican Dan Cox, in Illinois for Republican Darren Bailey, and in Pennsylvania for Republican Doug Mastriano.

In July, the Democratic Governors' Association (DGA) spent nearly $2 million running ads boosting Cox in his primary against former Maryland state lawmaker Kelly Schulz, who was backed by outgoing Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.

MCCARTHY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES SPEAKER RUN, MAKING CASE TO FELLOW REPUBLICANS AFTER MIDTERMS MISS EXPECTATIONS

Three weeks prior to Cox's victory, Bailey won his primary after also being supported by the DGA, as well as incumbent Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who spent $35 million combined to boost Bailey over moderate Republican Mayor Richard Irvin of Aurora, Illinois.

In May, Mastriano was boosted to victory in his primary with more than $840,000 in ads run by the campaign of his opponent, and now Democratic Pennsylvania Governor-elect Josh Shapiro.

"Colorado cancels plans to send migrants to NYC, Chicago amid outcry from Democratic mayors","Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis will stop sending migrants to New York City, Chicago and other major Democrat-run cities after mayors expressed outrage at the plan in recent weeks.

Polis had agreed to work with local authorities in Denver to help send migrants to their final destinations. While Colorado is not a border state, it has seen a major influx of migrants seeking passage to elsewhere in the country. Mayors Eric Adams of New York City and Lori Lightfoot of Chicago called on Polis to end his assistance last week as their cities also struggle with a surge in migrants.

""People fleeing violence and oppression in search of a better life for themselves and their families deserve our respect not political games and we are grateful we have been able to assist migrants to reach their final destination,"" Polis had said of the program. ""We refuse to keep people against their will if they desire to travel elsewhere.""

Adams and Lightfoot wrote to Polis in a joint letter, urging him to halt his bussing program after it sent just a few hundred migrants.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES BORDER VISIT; NEW MEASURES AS PRESSURE GROWS OVER MIGRANT SURGE

""We have seen your statements in the media that you are simply accommodating the wishes of migrants to come to cities like New York City and Chicago,"" the pair wrote. ""However, you are sending migrants and families to New York City and Chicago that do not have any ties, family members or community networks to welcome them.""

Adams was outraged at Polis' bussing program during a press conference appearance last week, comparing it to similar programs that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used to flood his city with some 30,000 migrants last year.

MAYORKAS SAYS MASSIVE MIGRANT NUMBERS 'STRAINING OUR SYSTEM,' CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO ACT

""One time we had to deal with Republican governors sending migrants to New York. Now we’re dealing with Democratic governors sending migrants to New York,"" Adams said Wednesday.

""What’s callous is how we have been ignored as a city. And now I have to make tough decisions on the resources of New York … it is time for the federal government to step up,"" he added.

Adams' plea for federal assistance comes as President Biden makes his first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border Sunday. The White House also unveiled a handful of policies aimed at stemming the flow at the border last week. They include expanding a humanitarian parole program for Venezuelan nationals to include Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans, as well as increasing refugee resettlements.

Biden acknowledged the changes aren't up to the task, however.

DCCC chair under fire for 'wasting' Democratic donors' money on 'far-right republicans',"Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Chair, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., is taking heat from his primary opponent for ""wasting"" Democratic donations on ad campaigns boosting ""far-right"" Republican primary candidates.

New York Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, who is running in the Democratic primary against Maloney in New York's 17th Congressional District, ripped her opponent and the DCCC for their election strategy in a Wednesday statement.

""DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney is wasting valuable Democratic resources by investing in far-right Republicans instead of funding Democratic candidates. This is a dangerous investment and asymmetric risk. Just a few years ago, many Democrats also wrongly believed Donald Trump winning the Republican primary would ensure a Democratic Presidential victory -- and they were sorely mistaken,"" Biaggi said.

Democratic organizations have reportedly spent nearly $44 million in campaigns boosting far right candidates in an effort to persuade Republican voters to select candidates Democrats view as easier to beat in the general election in November.

HOUSE DEMS BLASTS DCCC INTERFERENCE IN GOP PRIMARIES BOOSTING PRO-TRUMP CANDIDATES

""Democrats win when we invest in candidates who put working people ahead of corporate donors,"" Biaggi said. ""Unfortunately, Sean Patrick Maloney would rather take dangerous risks in Republican primaries than invest in working class champions. Maloney's latest GOP investments are just one more sign that we need new bold Democrats in Congress who will put working people first.""

Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for the Maloney campaign, pushed back against Biaggi's criticism in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital.

""Rep. Maloney is fighting every day to ensure Democrats hold the House this fall and keep dangerous MAGA Republicans, who want to ban abortion nationwide and take our nation backwards, out of power,"" Ehrenberg said. ""Unlike his primary opponent, Congressman Maloney has experience winning tough elections in a Trump district and reaching swing voters, which is why he was chosen by his peers to lead the DCCC during this critical moment. Just as he’s won close elections in the past, he will lead the party to victory this November.""

Sen. Biaggi's press team told Fox News Thursday that they have nothing more to add and would let the statement speak for itself.

The most recent effort from the DCCC was an ad campaign about John Gibbs, the Trump-backed candidate running in Michigan's Third Congressional District, that claimed he ""is too conservative for West Michigan.""

The GOP candidate is running against Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., in the upcoming primary, a representative who was one of the ten Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump after the January 6 Capitol riot.

AOC-BACKED PROGRESSIVE GROUP TARGETS DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP OVER MEDDLING IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

Progressive group Justice Democrats confronted the organization on Twitter following the Michigan ad saying the ""Democratic Party leadership will literally support Republicans before they start supporting progressives.""

The DCCC told Fox News Monday that the committee plans to spend roughly $425,000 on ads in the Michigan race.

A similar attempt came from the Arizona Democratic Party, who recently sent out an email blast ""thanking"" GOP gubernatorial primary candidate Karrin Taylor Robson for her many contributions to the Democratic Party over the years.

Following the email release, the Robson campaign told Fox News Digital that they believed it was an attempt to promote her Trump-endorsed primary opponent, Kari Lake.

"Democratic PAC pours thousands into ad boosting far-right, pro-Trump candidate in latest meddling attempt","Democrats are once again meddling in the midterms through ad campaigns highlighting pro-Trump candidates before their primaries in an apparent effort to boost the candidate seeking the Republican nomination.

The latest effort came from Democrats Serve, a new Democratic PAC that supports candidates with a background in public service, which spent thousands to promote New Hampshire congressional candidate Bob Burns as the ultra-conservative candidate running in the Republican primary against Keene Mayor George Hansel. The winner of the primary will face off against vulnerable Democrat Rep. Annie Kuster in the midterm race for New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District.

""Meet Bob Burns, the ultra-conservative candidate for Congress,"" the ad narrator states over a photo of Burns with former President Donald Trump.

The ad shows Burns describing himself as ""The only pro-Trump, unapologetic conservative. I’m against pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens. I want to build the wall, and I’m an America First candidate.""

STRATEGISTS WARN ELECTION MEDDLING, PROMOTION OF CERTAIN GOP CANDIDATES COULD ‘BACKFIRE’ ON DEMOCRATS

""Burns follows the Trump playbook on the border, immigration and guns. If we sent Bob Burns, the ‘unapologetic conservative,’ to Congress, New Hampshire is going to get burned.""

DCCC CHAIR UNDER FIRE FOR ‘WASTING’ DEMOCRATIC DONORS' MONEY ON ‘FAR-RIGHT REPUBLICANS’

Kuster did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, asking for her thoughts on the Democratic group's investment in a Republican campaign as she runs unopposed for the Democratic nomination to the seat.

Democrats Serve has reportedly spent $94,000 on ads to boost Burns in the weeks ahead of his primary election.

The ad is one of many recent attempts from the groups in the Democratic Party to promote a far-right candidate ahead of their primary in hopes that they will advance to the midterms this fall.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) released several ads with the same intent, a move that appeared to be successful in some races.

An ad highlighting John Gibbs, the Trump-backed GOP nominee running in Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, claimed he ""is too conservative for West Michigan."" Shortly after the ad ran throughout the state, Gibbs won the Republican primary against Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., one of the 10 conservative representatives who voted to impeach Trump.

Another instance of Democratic meddling came from the Arizona Democratic Party, which ""thanked"" Arizona gubernatorial GOP candidate Karrin Taylor Robson for her contributions to the Democratic Party over the years. Her Trump-endorsed opponent, Kari Lake, won the primary election against Robson after the email blast was sent out.

The Democrats' strategy is considered politically risky since it could backfire and if more right-wing Republicans succeed in getting the nomination and go on to win in November.

"Democratic candidate Vicente Gonzalez claims Mayra Flores, supporters 'stole' Texas special election","Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who's running for re-election to Congress in the midterm elections, claimed during an event attended by House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that a June special election in Texas was stolen by Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, and her supporters.

The remarks from Gonzalez came during a ""vote blue"" event at Shotz bar in Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday.

""Our democracy is at stake,"" Gonzalez claimed. ""There's millions and millions of dollars from outside our region and outside our state that are coming here to try to steal our elections and take away your value and take away the process that we rely on, which is elections. And we don't have the resources to compete with these outside resources. We can't compete with the Koch brothers, we can't compete with big oil, and big tobacco, and the NRA. They can outspend us, but they can't outwork us.""

Taking aim at Flores, his Republican rival in the race to represent Texas' 34th Congressional District, Gonzalez said the newly elected GOP representative who defeated her Democratic challenger in a special election to represent the redrawn district, ""showed up to Congress and voted against keeping our communities safe.""

MAYRA FLORES RIPS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR 'POLITICIZING' BORDER CRISIS: ‘NOTHING SURPRISES ME ANYMORE’

""They stole that last election,"" Gonzalez claimed. ""They spent $3 million to our $250,000, they campaigned for two years, and they still only won by less than one percent. So, the way to turn this around is getting out and vote.""

Schiff, who serves on the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol protests, also spoke to Gonzalez's supporters at the event and offered remarks favoring his candidacy in the race.

""The work you're doing to support our Democratic institutions, the infrastructure of our elections, the rule of law, the rule of law applies to everyone equally could not be more important,"" Schiff said. ""It's been such a pleasure to meet so many of you and thank you for all you're doing to support my wonderful colleague.""

REPUBLICAN MAYRA FLORES FLIPS TEXAS HOUSE DISTRICT RED IN SPECIAL ELECTION

On Friday, Gonzalez shared photos of himself alongside Schiff, including one from the Thursday evening event in Brownsville.

""Thank you to my friend, @RepAdamSchiff, for visiting the #RGV this week,"" Gonzalez wrote in a tweet. ""It's important for those in Washington to know and appreciate what South Texans have to offer and I was thrilled to show him around.""

In response to Schiff's visit to the state to campaign for Gonzalez, Flores, the first Mexican-born congresswoman who took office on June 21, concluded the ""swamp is protecting one of its own.""

""The far left is getting pretty desperate when Adam Schiff is coming down to Texas to save Vicente Gonzalez,"" she wrote in a tweet. ""The swamp is protecting one of its own.""

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Maloney concedes in historic House loss,"Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Sean Patrick Maloney conceded Wednesday in a historic House loss.

At a press conference, Maloney said he called Republican candidate Mike Lawler and congratulated him on a ""good win"" in New York's 17th Congressional District.

Maloney's loss is the first by a sitting House campaign committee chair since 1992, according to the Cook Political Report.

Maloney, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chairman and member of Congress since 2012, sought re-election this fall in hopes of maintaining his seat in New York's 17th Congressional District against Lawler.

Lawler serves in the New York State Assembly and is a partner at Checkmate Strategies, a communications and campaign consulting firm.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

During an Oct. 12 debate, the two candidates sparred on issues ranging from the economy to abortion. Lawler attacked the Inflation Reduction Act — which Maloney voted for — and promised to vote to cut back on government spending. Meanwhile, Maloney doubled down on his support for the bill, citing its prescription drug price caps and Medicare provisions.

Lawler expressed his opposition to a national abortion ban, expressing that while he is pro-life, he believes in exceptions for incest, rape and life of the mother.

DCCC SPENDS $600K ON ADS DEFENDING LEADER REP. PATRICK MALONEY

Maloney, on the other hand, is strongly pro-choice. He co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, which sought to codify and even expand a right to abortion as protected under the Supreme Court's precedent in Roe v. Wade, which has now been overturned.

"Democratic darlings Schiff and Porter kick off an ugly, expensive fight for California's Senate seat","The race for California's coveted Senate seat has kicked off, and it's shaping up to be an expensive, ugly battle between two of the top political fundraisers in the House chamber.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who announced his bid for the Senate seat on Thursday, joins Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., in a competitive race for the seat held by Sen. Diane Feinstein, 89, who is up for re-election in 2024. Feinstein has not yet announced re-election intentions.

Porter, a progressive rising star and former pupil of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, raised a whopping $25 million in political donations last cycle, making her the second-highest-raising House member behind House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Porter's fundraising total even beat out that of her boss, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a renowned fundraiser in her own right.

Schiff was the fourth-highest-raising member of the House members up for re-election last year, taking in just over $23 million from 2021 through November 2022.

CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT REP. ADAM SCHIFF TO RUN FOR US SENATE SEAT HELD BY FEINSTEIN

Despite attempts to position herself as a progressive ""warrior,"" Porter and her political ambitions may be impeded by accusations of racist remarks and promoting a toxic work culture.

An ex-staffer for the California Democrat alleged that the congresswoman had made rude and racist comments to staff and said that she had ""ridiculed people for reporting sexual harassment."" The accusations came to light in December, but the news was mostly ignored by major news outlets.

Schiff, a figurehead of the impeachment investigations into former President Donald Trump, faces his own share of intra-party backlash. A progressive group attacked the congressman for his record on Trump only hours after Schiff announced his run for U.S. Senate.

""Adam Schiff plays the role of Trump antagonist on TV, but a recent book details how he stalled and undermined leaders trying to hold Trump accountable in Congress. And he never challenges corporations or the Democratic establishment,"" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), said Thursday in a statement.

SCHIFF HIT WITH ETHICS COMPLAINT ONE DAY INTO SENATE CAMPAIGN FOR USING TRUMP IMPEACHMENT VIDEO

Not long after, an ethics watchdog group called on the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) to investigate Schiff for using footage from the Senate floor in his campaign announcement video. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) said the California progressive had ""abused official resources for political purposes,"" according to its complaint filed Friday.

California Congresswoman Barbara Lee , 76, has said she intends to run for Feinstein's seat as well, but she has not made an official announcement.

Some have also speculated that Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, representing California's Silicon Valley, may also throw his hat in the ring for Feinstein's seat.

Democratic defector Tulsi Gabbard films ad for Republican Kristi Noem in final midterm push,"Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard threw her weight behind Republican South Dakota Gov. Christi Noem's re-election effort Tuesday.

Gabbard released a new ad supporting Noem on Tuesday as the governor enters her final week of campaigning before Election Day. Noem is the clear favorite to defeat Democratic challenger Jamie Smith, currently holding a double-digit lead in the race, according to polls. Gabbard has supported several Republicans since publicly leaving the Democratic Party last month.

""I'm Tulsi Gabbard, and Kristi Noem is a friend of mine. We believe in defending freedom and protecting what makes this country so special,"" Gabbard says in the ad. ""Kristi loves South Dakota and fights against extreme policies that Jamie Smith supports, like raising taxes, mandating vaccines, and taking away your gun rights.""

""Extremists like Jamie Smith are why I left the Democratic Party,"" she added before urging viewers to vote for Noem.

TULSI GABBARD: US FACES ‘DOMESTIC THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY’ FROM THE POWERFUL

Gabbard announced her departure from the Democratic Party with a nearly 30-minute long video in early October.

""I can no longer remain in today’s Democratic Party that is now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness who divide us by racializing every issue & stoke anti-white racism,"" Gabbard said.

""I believe in a government that is of the people, by the people and for the people. Unfortunately, today's Democratic Party does not.

Democratic groups fund third-party conservative longshots to siphon votes from Republican candidates,"Political groups aligned with the Democratic Party are spending heavily to boost third-party longshot candidates in must-win races across the country as polls show Republicans gaining ground in the homestretch of the 2022 midterm elections.

Democratic groups have popped up in recent weeks to bolster third-party candidates in high-profile contests in which vulnerable Democrats are struggling.

Tied to Democratic operatives and firms, the groups are spending money to convince voters that the third-party longshots are the true ""conservative"" choice, efforts that can split the conservative vote and help ensure a Democratic victory.

""It's an old tactic and one that both parties have used,"" said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist who has run several high-profile campaigns. ""It doesn't always work, but in a close race, if you can shift even a few hundred votes away from your opponent, it could mean the difference between winning and losing.""

GDP BOOST TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE TO HELP DEMOCRATS, STRATEGISTS SAY

In Kansas, an organization called the American Center is putting tens of thousands of dollars behind independent gubernatorial nominee Dennis Pyle, who, in a recent poll, was at just 3% while the GOP and Democratic candidates were well ahead of him and running neck and neck. The American Center is working to contrast Pyle with the GOP nominee, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt.

""Meet conservative independent Dennis Pyle,"" says a recent digital ad sent out by the group via text message. ""He's running as an independent against RINO Derek Schmidt, who supports illegal immigrants getting in-state tuition in Kansas.

The American Center, which shares an address with a prominent Washington, D.C.-based law firm used by the Democratic Party, is also spending $92,000 on radio ads boosting Pyle as the ""real conservative"" in the governor's race, intervening in the battle between Schmidt and incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

Political strategists say the organization is trying to splinter the GOP vote through deceptive advertising in hopes of ensuring a Democratic victory.

SANDERS STUMPS FOR SWING-STATE DEMOCRATS AS HIGH-STAKES MIDTERM NEARS

Democrats are similarly using the tactic in Michigan's 8th congressional district.

The Voter Protection Project (VPP), run by a former pollster to Sen. Bernie Sanders, has spent nearly $160,000 in recent weeks to promote Libertarian Party candidate David Canny. The money has gone into digital ads and campaign mailers contrasting Canny, a retired retail seller of seafood, with GOP nominee Paul Junge.

""Paul Junge spent a career in California politics,"" one of the group's mailers said. ""Don't let Paul Junge bring California values to Michigan. David [Canny] will stop wasteful spending.""

Junge, a small businessman and lawyer, is running against incumbent five-term Democratic Rep. Kildee. Most political prognosticators have rated the contest a toss-up. A poll conducted over the summer found Kildee only up three points over Junge.

VPP did not respond to requests for comment for this story. In recent years, the organization has raised millions to bolster Democratic candidates committed to expanding voting rights and stopping voter suppression.

Republicans were quick to note the irony of the organization trumpeting democracy while utilizing tactics that some say are ""undemocratic.""

""The new Democrat playbook is to meddle in our elections by boosting the libertarian candidate,"" said a spokesman for the Michigan Republican Party. ""Confusing the public and attempting to suppress voters.""

VPP is using the same tactic against Republicans in Kansas' 3rd congressional district. The group has even launched a website contrasting GOP nominee Amanda Adkins with Libertarian candidate Steve Hohe.

""Lobbyist and career politician Amanda Adkins serves the interests of the D.C. elites,"" the site states. ""Steve Hohe will: crackdown on illegal immigration [and] eliminate the federal income tax and replace with a flat tax.""

National Republicans are bullish that Adkins, who ran for the Kansas City-centered seat in 2020, can oust two-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids. To make sure that doesn't happen, VPP has already spent more than $261,000 on ads and mailers attacking Adkins as insufficiently conservative

Apart from boosting third-party candidates, VPP is also running ads in a heated California matchup, calling Rep. David Valadao a traitor for having voted to impeach former President Trump. The group's maneuver comes as Valadao is fighting a general election matchup against Democrat Rudy Salas.

The use of such tactics is nothing new for Democrats. Earlier this year, the party spent heavily to boost far-right Republicans in contested primaries from Arizona to Pennsylvania in an effort to prevent stronger candidates from ascending to the general election.

"Democratic House Leader Jeffries demands McCarthy reappoint Schiff, Swalwell to Intelligence Committee","Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Saturday, demanded to have two ""eminently qualified legislators"" reappointed to the Committee on Intelligence, despite one’s alleged ties to a Chinese spy.

Jeffries said Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff, both Democrats from California, have over two decades providing oversight of the nation’s intelligence community.

The demand comes as McCarthy plans to block Swalwell and Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee and and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

McCarthy recently told Punchbowl News that ""Swalwell can’t get a security clearance in the private sector. I’m not going to give him a government security clearance.""

McCarthy also said, ""Schiff has lied too many times to the American public,"" and argued that Omar's outspoken criticism of Israel is borderline antisemitic.

ERIC SWALWELL DENIES WRONGDOING IN CHINESE SPY SCANDAL

Swalwell's ties to suspected Chinese spy Christine Fang, also known as Fang Fang, were first reported by Axios in December 2020 and prompted House Republicans to draft a resolution to remove Swalwell from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The resolution was tabled by the Democrats.

Axios had reported that Fang targeted up-and-coming politicians, including Swalwell, and that federal investigators alerted Swalwell of Fang’s behavior in 2015. Swalwell then cut off all ties with Fang and has not been accused of any wrongdoing, the report said.

Fang was allegedly part of Swalwell’s fundraising effort for his 2014 reelection campaign, though she did not make any donations, according to Intelligence officials. She also interacted with Swalwell numerous times over several years and placed an intern in his office. She reportedly fled the United States and returned to China.

MCCARTHY CONFIRMS SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR WILL LOSE COMMITTEE SEATS

Swalwell continues to say he did not do anything wrong.

Schiff, Swalwell and Omar made formal requests to the Steering Committee to be reinstated as members of the intelligence committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee this month, along with Jeffries’ plea.

""It is my understanding that you intend to break with the longstanding House tradition of deference to the minority party Intelligence Committee recommendations and deny seats to Ranking Member Schiff and Representative Swalwell,"" Jeffries said. ""The denial of seats to duly elected members of the House Democratic Caucus runs counter to the serious and sober mission of the Intelligence Committee.""

He also said in the 117th Congress, two members were removed from their committees in a bipartisan vote after directly inciting violence against their colleagues during the violent insurrection and attack on the Capital.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS INTEND TO SIT ON ALL REPUBLICAN SELECT COMMITTEES

""It does not serve as precedent or justification for the removal of Reps. Schiff and Swalwell, given that they have never exhibited violent thoughts or behavior,"" Jeffries said.

Swalwell touted his experience on the Intelligence Committee in his plea to be reappointed.

Still, he was fully aware that the House speaker may have other plans.

REPORTER THREATENS LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ADAM SCHIFF AFTER TWITTER FILES BOMBSHELL

""...After conferring with Leader Jeffries, I write to request that I return as a Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,"" Swalwell said in a letter on Jan. 5. ""It is not for the Speaker to decide to remove Members from committees based on fabricated stories or political revenge, and there is no basis for attempting to remove me, Adam Schiff, or Ilhan Omar from our committee assignments.""

"Democratic kingmaker Clyburn 'all-in' for Biden 2024, issues warning against primary challengers","Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a kingmaker in Democratic Party politics, vigorously endorsed President Biden for re-election on Wednesday and warned members of his party against challenging the sitting president.

""I'm all-in for President Biden,"" Clyburn told CBS' Robert Costa in an interview. ""I think he's demonstrated, in these two years … that he is deserving of re-election. And I do believe he will be re-elected irrespective of who the Republicans, they put up.""

Clyburn is the assistant Democratic leader in the House and a well-respected and influential ally of the White House. His endorsement of Biden in 2020 is widely credited with delivering South Carolina for the president in the Democratic primaries, resurrecting Biden's campaign after defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire.

He said he's been talking with Biden and has encouraged him to run for re-election by campaigning against the new Republican majority in the House.

2024 WATCH: TRUMP'S IN – WHAT ABOUT DESANTIS, PENCE, AND OTHER POTENTIAL CONTENDERS, LONG SHOTS, & WILD CARDS

""I've told him on many occasions that I believe that he ought to announce for re-election and get the playbook laid down by Harry Truman back in 1948 and use that as their mantra upon which to run for re-election,"" Clyburn said.

In 1948, Republicans controlled Congress and blocked many of Democratic President Harry Truman's Fair Deal bills. Truman labeled it a ""do-nothing Congress"" and campaigned as fiercely against the GOP majorities as he did against the Republican nominee Thomas Dewey, going on to win the presidential election in a historic upset.

MATT GAETZ SAYS CLASSIFIED DOCS SCANDAL ‘FEELS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING OUT JOE BIDEN’

Biden – who at 80 is the oldest person to ever serve as president of the United States – has not officially declared his candidacy for re-election, but he is anticipated to do so soon. His 2020 rival, former President Donald Trump, announced a comeback campaign for the White House in November, and The Hill reported earlier this month that Biden will launch his campaign sometime in February, around the State of the Union address.

However, Biden does face several vulnerabilities as a candidate not limited to his age. He remains an unpopular president, with his approval rating hovering in the low 40s according to most opinion polls. And his recent controversy involving a special counsel investigation into his handling of classified documents has given House Republicans a target-rich environment to investigate his administration and potentially disarmed a line of attack he could use against Trump, who has his own troubles with alleged mishandling of classified materials.

GOP INSIDERS SAY NEWSOM WON'T SAVE DEMOCRATS IN 2024 IF BIDEN BOWS OUT, VOW TO ‘MOP THE FLOOR’ WITH HIM

Still, Clyburn said he's convinced that Biden will run for re-election, praising the president for ""passing more progressive legislation than any president since Lyndon Baines Johnson.""

Asked if Biden will face a primary challenge, Clyburn told CBS, ""I don't think he will, and I don't think he should.""

""The history is very clear on what happens when you challenge a sitting president like this,"" the congressman added. He noted that former Sen. Ted Kennedy's primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980 was unsuccessful and is widely believed to have hurt Carter in the general election against former President Ronald Reagan.

"Democratic National Committee panel votes to give NH, GA more time on new primary calendar","A Democratic National Committee panel voted Wednesday to give New Hampshire and Georgia more time to make changes that would allow both to be part of a revamped group of five states leading off the party's presidential primary starting next year.

But even as they voted 25-0 to extend the compliance deadline until June 3, members of the DNC rules committee complained about New Hampshire's ongoing feud with the national party because the new calendar would cost it the chance to hold the nation's first primary.

The fight underscores how the effort to shake up the Democratic presidential primary could turn increasingly bitter, even at a time when the party will be counting on staying unified as it tries to hold the White House and Senate in 2024.

The DNC rules committee voted last month to approve a plan championed by President Joe Biden that would strip Iowa’s caucus of its traditional post leading off the primary and replace it with South Carolina, which would open primary voting on Feb. 3. New Hampshire and Nevada would hold primaries together three days later, with Georgia's primary coming Feb. 13 and Michigan's two weeks later. Most of the rest of the country would subsequently vote on Super Tuesday in early March.

NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMS WARN BIDEN’S PUSH TO HOLD FIRST PRIMARY IN SOUTH CAROLINA COULD BACKFIRE

The Democrats’ proposed shakeup comes after Iowa’s 2020 caucus was marred by technical problems. Biden says the new proposed calendar better reflects his party’s deeply diverse electoral base, which relies heavily on African American voters.

The president is also seeking to reward South Carolina, where nearly 27% of the population is Black, after a decisive win there revived his 2020 presidential campaign following losses it suffered in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

Those changes are set to be formally approved for next year's presidential race by the full DNC at its meeting next week in Philadelphia.

Nevada and South Carolina have already agreed to comply with the new calendar's requirements. In Michigan, moving the primary date requires an act of the Legislature. Democrats control both chambers in that state, but they would need Republican support to enact the change before the end of February 2024, so it's not yet clear when the proposed changes might be approved.

The greater sticking points have been New Hampshire and Georgia.

New Hampshire state law mandates that it hold the nation’s first primary — a rule Iowa was able to circumvent only because it held a caucus. Top New Hampshire Democrats say they've handled that responsibility successfully for more than a century and have vowed to simply jump the other states and lead off primary voting again in 2024, regardless of the DNC's new calendar.

NEW HAMPSHIRE’S GOP GOVERNOR TO DNC: ‘WE WILL NOT BE THREATENED … WE WILL NOT GIVE UP’

In Georgia, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger sets his state's primary date. He has indicated he’d only be willing to move it if the Republican National Committee pushes to change the date of its Georgia primary, which hasn’t happened.

Wednesday’s vote gave Georgia and New Hampshire more time — but also saw committee members voice their frustrations with New Hampshire.

""I really do believe it is irresponsible, the statements being made in New Hampshire,"" said Lee Saunders, a rules committee member and president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

""I would just urge everybody to cool down a little bit,"" Saunders said.

Rules committee member Leah Daughtry said she was ""similarly taken aback and quite frankly shocked"" by New Hampshire's objections to the new calendar. She also rejected that state's assertions that it shouldn't lose its place because of tradition stretching back more than a century.

""Hanging their argument on this 100-year-old privilege is really, for me as an African American woman, really quite disturbing,"" Daughtry said, noting that Black women didn't have the right to vote about a century ago.

Rules committee member JoAnne Dowdell from New Hampshire countered that ""politics is part of our DNA.""

""We believe it is possible to lift up diverse voices and keep New Hampshire at the start of the process,"" Dowdell said.

The Democrats’ 2024 primary calendar could be moot if Biden opts to run for reelection, as expected. In that case, Democrats will have little appetite for building out a robust primary schedule that could allow a major challenger from his own party to run against the president.

NEW HAMPSHIRE’S GOP GOVERNOR TO DNC: ‘WE WILL NOT BE THREATENED … WE WILL NOT GIVE UP’

The DNC rules committee also has already pledged to revisit the primary calendar after 2024. Still, any changes it makes for next year — even if there is ultimately no competitive primary — could help shape future decisions about which states go first, potentially triggering an important shift on where presidential candidates campaign hardest as future races begin.

Rules committee co-chair Minyon Moore said its members remain committed to ""the president’s vision.""

""We want to make sure the states can have as much time as they need to work though this process,"" Moore said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-national-committee-panel-votes-give-nh-ga-more-time-primary-calendar,N/A
"Democratic Party embraces nonreligious voters, criticizes 'religious liberty' in new resolution","The Democratic National Committee (DNC) passed a resolution Saturday praising the values of ""religiously unaffiliated"" Americans as the ""largest religious group within the Democratic Party.""

The resolution, which was unanimously passed at the DNC's summer meeting on Aug. 24 in San Francisco, Calif., was championed by the Secular Coalition of America, an organization that lobbies on behalf of atheists, agnostics, and humanists on public policy. The group celebrated the DNC's move as the first time a major party ""embraced American nonbelievers.""

""Religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party’s values,"" said the resolution, which adds they should advocate for ""rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.""

Sarah Levin, director of governmental affairs for the Secular Coalition of America, praised it as a way ""to ensure that policy is driven by science and evidence, not sectarian beliefs.""

The move comes as Democratic presidential candidates have ramped up their religious rhetoric on the campaign trail, but the party announced it is targeting ""nonreligious voters"" to try to beat President Trump, who solidified the evangelical vote in 2016.

""America was founded as a secular government charged with representing and protecting the freedoms of people of all faiths and none,"" Levin added. ""I am proud to see the Democratic Party take that to heart by bringing secular Americans into the fold.""

Democratic Party responds to Trump's 2024 announcement: 'He will lose again',"The Democratic Party has issued a statement responding to former President Donald Trump’s announcement that he is running for the presidency in 2024, predicting he will lose.

""Donald Trump was a failure as president; that’s why he lost in 2020 and it’s why he will lose again,"" DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement about Trump’s candidacy.

Harrison said it would be likely that other Republicans would try to contest Trump’s effort to snag the Republican nomination. Still, he said the Democratic Party would ""be ready for them all.""

""Today is just the kickoff to what will be a messy Republican primary with candidates competing to be the most extreme MAGA Republican in the race,"" Harrison added.

DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES 2024 RE-ELECTION RUN FOR PRESIDENT

""Democrats stand ready to remind Americans what Trump brought America: the worst jobs record since the Great Depression, rigged the economy for the super-rich with massive tax giveaways to corporations, the right-wing Supreme Court that overturned Roe and paved the way for extreme Republicans across the country to criminalize abortion, a diminished standing across the world, and absolute chaos that culminated in inciting a mob to attack the Capitol to try to overturn an election he knew he lost,"" Harrison also said.

In Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday, Trump formally announced he is running for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.

The ""Make America Great Again"" movement leader’s presidential bid will be his third, after defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016, but falling to President Joe Biden in 2020.

""In order to make America great and glorious again. I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,"" Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago estate to a group of eager supporters.

2024 WATCH: MEET THE POTENTIAL GOP PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS

""But just as I promised in 2016, I am your voice. I am your voice,"" he added. ""The Washington establishment wants to silence us, but we will not let them do that. What we have built together over the past six years is the greatest movement in history because it is not about politics. It's about our love for this great country, America, and we're not going to let it fail.""

""I am running because I believe the world has not yet seen the true glory of what this nation can be. We have not reached that pinnacle, believe it or not,"" said Trump. ""In fact, we can go very far. We're going to have to go far first. We have to get out of this ditch. And once we're out, you'll see things that nobody imagined for any country.

Democratic Party has gone too extreme on abortion: Pro-life Democrats,"Pro-life Democrats say the party has gone too extreme on abortion and worry the legislation leadership is pushing this week to expand abortion access nationwide will alienate voters in an already tough midterm election.

Currently, there are only two consistently pro-life Democrats left in Congress – one in each chamber – as the national Democratic Party has taken the position that abortion is an essential health care. With the Supreme Court poised to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, Democrats in the Senate will seek to codify the right to an abortion into federal law with a vote Wednesday that is doomed to fail, but will lay the groundwork for midterm campaigning.

But in a very crowded Democratic primary election in Chicago to succeed retiring Rep. Bobby Rush, one candidate is running on a pro-life platform that he hopes will propel him to Congress and force the Democratic Party to rethink its abortion stance.

PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATS SOUND OFF ON SUPREME COURT LEAK, DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM NATIONAL PARTY LEADERS

""My pro-life position is a distinguishing factor which is important in a 17-way race,"" Democratic candidate Chris Butler told Fox News Digital. ""If folks want to vote for somebody who is going to go to Congress and take the very unpopular position of abortion on-demand up to the ninth month of birth paid for by tax dollars… they've got 16 people to choose from.""

""That's the thing about the Democratic primary, if you do not sign on to that extreme orthodoxy, then you have only one candidate.""

Butler, 37, is a pastor at Chicago Embassy Church Network and said it's a ""huge mistake"" for the Democratic Party to position itself as pro-abortion which signals to certain people of faith there's ""no room"" for them. Butler is endorsed by former Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, a longtime anti-abortion Democrat in Congress who was booted out of office by a pro-choice challenger, Marie Newman, in 2020.

If he wins, Butler says his victory should ""stir something"" on the national level and help ""the party to see that Democrats need to make room for pro-life Democrats in the party.""

The bill Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is bringing for a vote Wednesday is the Women's Health Protection Act. It's been criticized by pro-choice Republican Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, as ""overly broad,"" including striking down state limits on abortion, even bans on gender-based abortion.

SCHUMER TO FORCE DOOMED ABORTION 'SHOW VOTE,' AS TOUGH MIDTERMS LOOM FOR DEMOCRATS

Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats For Life of America, called out the Democratic Party for actively pushing out anti-abortion Democrats and going ""way off the rails"" with extreme abortion legislation, including the Women's Health Protection Act.

""It's a huge mistake,"" Day said of Schumer forcing a vote on the abortion bill. ""He thinks he's motivating his base, which maybe he is, but he already has that base. So who is he trying to reach? Because he's alienating people like me with doubling down on this extreme abortion policy goes further than Roe. It's like Roe on steroids. It basically eliminates all health and safety regulations across the nation.""

Day worries the party is alienating some 20 million pro-life Democrats with its legislative agenda and official stance that ""abortion is health care."" She calls that messaging ""ridiculous."" Abortion, she said, ""is the death penalty.""

The House passed the Women’s Health Protection Act back in September and just one Democrat voted against it — moderate Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar — in a sign that the pro-life Democratic caucus is in the verge of extinction on the federal level.

As a life-long Catholic, Cuellar said he's pro-life and won't support ""extreme"" positions like late-term or partial birth abortion.

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., announced Tuesday he would join with Democrats in voting in favor of the bill to ensure access to abortion nationwide despite calling himself ""pro-life."" The announcement is notable since he's the son of the prominent pro-life former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey who is the namesake of the landmark 1992 Supreme Court case on abortion restrictions, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.

Day said the elder Casey was unapologetically pro-life and slammed the senator's stance on Tuesday. ""His spine must be made of jelly,"" she said.

For his part, Sen. Casey said he's concerned about a number of states banning abortion outright if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, as expected by the leaked draft opinion. He's also troubled by Republicans in Congress seeking legislation to impose a six-week ban nationwide.

""I don’t support a ban on abortion,"" Casey said Tuesday.

The Senate abortion bill marks a political line in the sand, but it's expected to fail Wednesday without the necessary 60 votes.

Republicans oppose the measure and they are likely to get the support from the one remaining pro-life Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said the vote is needed to show Americans exactly ""where their elected representatives in Congress stand.""

""Every senator will have to explain whether they defend the right of every person to have control over their own bodies and their own futures,"" Warren said in a speech Tuesday. ""Or whether they will stand by as women’s constitutional rights are brazenly stripped away.""

Butler, the Democrat running in Chicago, said there should be no litmus test on abortion for Democrats. He wants the pro-life Democratic caucus in Congress to grow beyond Cuellar and Manchin.

Pro-life Democrats who could be outstanding candidates are too afraid to run because ""they know that the party … would rather smack them down on this one issue than see them provide leadership,"" Butler said.

Democratic presidential hopefuls already jockeying for 2020,"Fresh off a bruising midterm battle, political observers are already looking ahead: At the 2020 presidential election.

A handful of Democrats are already jockeying to be on the 2020 ballot, with some hoping to capitalize on the momentum they generated from this year’s hard-fought midterm elections.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has not been shy about expressing her interest in running against President Trump.

“After November 6th, I will take a hard look at running for president,” Warren said recently.

Beyond Warren, plenty of senators are expected to consider a bid for the White House: New Jersey’s Cory Booker, New York’s Kirsten Gillibrand, Virginia’s Tim Kaine, Minnesota’s Amy Klobuchar, California’s Kamala Harris, and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders.

“Well, it's going to be fun to watch the Democratic presidential aspirants, of which we have a number, in the Senate,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. “And Chuck (Schumer) might have some attendance problems from time to time, but it – it'll be interesting to watch.”

One possible candidate getting a lot of buzz is Harris, who drew praise and condemnation during the Supreme Court confirmation fight over Brett Kavanaugh because of her tough questioning, which some called grand standing.

""Kamala Harris is the one who is sort of considered generating a lot of interest because she's new… she's sort of the fresh face,"" Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of RealClearPolitics told Fox in an interview.

Harris has been out in the first in the nation caucus state of Iowa.

""There may be powerful forces out there sowing hate and division among us, trying. But we're gonna take back the power,"" Harris told a rally in Polk County, Iowa last month.

Booker tried to create some buzz with his “I am Spartacus” moment during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. He’s been widely talked about as a possible presidential candidate.

He has also been testing his message in Iowa, telling an audience, “You are never defined in life by what happens to you. You're defined by how you respond.”

But it’s not just senators who are testing the waters of a 2020 presidential run – there are also governors who are considering it. They include Andrew Cuomo of New York, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Jay Inslee of Washington, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, and former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Even some local mayors are believed to be considering a run, including Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

""Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans and he is one of those candidates, very charismatic when you see him in person, really great retail politician,” Bevan told Fox.

Some believe former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost Tuesday to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas but became a national political sensation and shattered fundraising records, should explore a presidential run. On Wednesday, #Beto2020 quickly became a trending term on Twitter.

There are also familiar faces from the Obama years, including Vice President Joe Biden, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Housing and Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.

Biden spent a lot of time during the midterms trying to help Democrat Senators like Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp across the finish line.

""We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose our allies over enemies. We choose truth over lies,” Biden told a rally in Missouri, perhaps testing some themes for a possible upcoming campaign.

Many hopefuls and Democrats will be faced with a critical choice – according to Bevan.

""Do they want to go with someone who's older, or is that too much looking to the past?” Bevan said. “Do they want to try and go with someone who’s younger, a fresher face, someone looking to the future?""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democratic-presidential-hopefuls-already-jockeying-for-2020,N/A
"Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman says Trump, Biden classified document scandals are 'apples and oranges'","Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who has defended President Biden's handling of classified documents, dismissed comparisons of Biden's situation to former President Donald Trump's legal controversies, calling them ""apples and oranges.""

Goldman is a freshman lawmaker who previously served as House impeachment counsel against Trump. In an interview with Punchbowl News published Tuesday, he rebuffed GOP accusations that Democrats are holding a ""double standard"" for Biden after they assailed Trump, who may be indicted for failing to turn over hundreds of classified documents to the National Archives.

""The American people are smart enough to understand the difference here,"" Goldman said.

""On the one hand, you have classified information where it shouldn’t be. And President Biden’s team is doing exactly what you would hope they would do. They weren’t even asked for these documents. They self-reported,"" he continued.

LAWYER IN TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PRAISES BIDEN FOR HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCS: ‘BY THE BOOK’

""And on the other hand, you have a former president trying to obstruct justice and withhold classified information from the proper authorities. So these are apples and oranges.""

Trump is under criminal investigation by Jack Smith, a career prosecutor appointed as special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Last year, the FBI executed a search and seizure at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and retrieved approximately 300 documents with classified markings – some ""top secret"" – that the former president neglected to turn over to the National Archives as required by law. Trump and his legal team have said the former president was working with the National Archives to turn over those documents before the FBI raid.

JIM JORDAN LAUNCHES FIRST INVESTIGATION AS JUDICIARY CHAIR INTO BIDEN CLASSIFIED DOCS SCANDAL

Garland has also appointed Robert Hur as special counsel to investigate Biden after documents with classified markings from the Obama administration were discovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C., and subsequently at Biden's private residence in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden and his legal team have been emphatic that they immediately turned over all documents to the Justice Department and have been fully cooperating with law enforcement.

House Republicans have already begun requesting copies of Biden's documents as part of their own investigation into the president's classified materials. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., have also planned investigations into Hunter Biden's laptop.

‘NOT A PLACE I’D WANT TO BE IN': WILL BIDEN'S CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS DEBACLE HAMPER A 2024 RE-ELECTION BID?'

Goldman panned these investigations and dismissed the newly formed ""Weaponization of the Federal Government"" committee as ""nothing else than the committee to obstruct justice.""

""The American people do not care about Hunter Biden’s laptop,"" he said. ""And what we’re going to see, as they have foreshadowed, is excessively overreaching partisan investigations that are solely designed to hurt President Biden’s re-election chances in 2024.""

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna expressed concerns over Twitter’s censorship of Hunter Biden laptop story,"U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, appeared to be the only Democrat who expressed concerns about the ramifications of Twitter's decision to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020, according to his communications with the social media platform that were released Friday.

Twitter owner Elon Musk released bombshell revelations Friday evening about what led the tech giant to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story in the final weeks of the 2020 presidential election. Musk outsourced his findings to Substack journalist Matt Taibbi, who published a lengthy thread about what had transpired behind the scenes at Twitter.

""Khanna was the only Democratic official I could find in the files who expressed concern"" about the move to censor the story, Taibbi tweeted Friday night.

ELON MUSK RIPS NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE AS ‘UTTERLY FALSE' FOR CLAIMING MAJOR RISE IN HATE SPEECH

According to Taibbi, Khanna emailed Vijaya Gadde, then a Twitter executive who was charged with overseeing the social media platform's trust and safety, legal and public policy, to relay his concerns.

""Generating huge backlash on hill re speech,"" Khanna wrote in the Oct. 14, 2020, email. ""Happy to chat if you're up for it.""

Gadde quickly replied, according to screenshots of the email posted by Taibbi. In her email, she went over Twitter's policies.

In his reply, Khanna seemed more concerned with First Amendment issues concerning the Hunter Biden story reported by the New York Post.

""If there is a hack of classified information or other information that could expose a serious war crime and the NYT (New York Times) was to publish it, I think the NYT should have that right,"" Khanna wrote. ""A journalist should not be held accountable for the illegal actions of the source unless they actively aided the hack.""

""So to restrict the distribution of that material, especially regarding a Presidential candidate, seems not in keeping of the principles of NYT v. Sullivan,"" he added, referring to the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case that limits the ability of public officials to sue for defamation.

Twitter famously blocked its users from sharing the Post's reporting of Hunter Biden's laptop in tweets and in direct messages when the story was published in 2020 during a heated election between President Biden and then-President Trump.

At the time, Twitter Safety alleged that the articles were in violation of its ""hacked materials policy."" Twitter's then-CEO Jack Dorsey admitted his company's actions were a mistake. Many critics have argued the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story by Big Tech and the media at large was enough to sway the election in favor of his father.

""I say this as a total Biden partisan and convinced he didn't do anything wrong,"" Khanna wrote. ""But the story has become more about censorship than relatively innocuous emails and it's becoming a bigger deal than it would have been.""

He added that ""in the heat of a Presidential campaign, restricting dissemination of newspaper articles (even if the NY Post is far right) seems like it will invite more backlash that it will do good,"" he said.

He then asked that Gadde keep the communication private between themselves and Dorsey.

""I believe our Constitution and First Amendment are sacred. As the congressman who represents Silicon Valley, I felt Twitter’s actions were a violation of First Amendment principles so I raised those concerns. Our democracy can only thrive if we are open to a marketplace of ideas and engaging with people with whom we disagree,"" Khanna wrote in a statement to Fox News.

In a letter from Carl Szabo, of the research firm NetChoice, to Lauren Culbertson, Twitter's then-head of public policy, Szabo said his firm met with nine Republican and three Democratic House staffers to gather intelligence about Facebook and Twitter and the Biden story.

Some figures on Capitol Hill referred to the laptop story as ""tech's Access Hollywood moment,"" appearing to refer to the television entertainment show in which Trump was heard on an audio recording making degrading remarks about women.

In his letter, Szabo said Democrats complained that the social media companies let Republicans ""muddy the water and made Biden look corrupt despite him being innocent."" They were also in agreement that social media needs to moderate for harmful content more often.

""When pushed on how the government might insist on that, consistent with the First Amendment, they demurred: the First Amendment isn't absolute,'"" the letter said.

Democratic senator in key battleground state announces 2024 re-election campaign,"Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown announced that he will officially be seeking a fourth term in the Senate in 2024, according to a Spectrum News report.

Brown is one of the first members of Congress, whose Senate term ends in 2025, to announce that they will run for re-election next cycle. The Democrat has survived three terms in the Senate, even as past elections indicate Ohio voters are moving to the right.

In the 2016 presidential election, former President Donald Trump won the state of Ohio against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by about 8 percentage points. Trump also defeated President Joe Biden in Ohio in the 2020 election by the same margin, 53% to 45%.

Despite running in a red state, Brown defeated his Republican opponent Jim Renacci in the 2018 election by about 6 percentage points.

Brown's announcement comes just one week after Republican JD Vance won the general election for the open Senate seat in Ohio, defeating his Democratic challenger who was endorsed by Brown, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio.

"Democratic senators question Biden administration on end to Title 42, potential migrant surge at border","A group of Democratic senators wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security chief expressing ""deep concerns"" about the end to Title 42, a Trump-era policy allowing for the rapid removal of migrants encountered at the border.

The policy, originally implemented in March 2020, was struck down earlier this month by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, who ruled that it violates the Administrative Procedure Act.

It will officially expire on Dec. 21 amid record-breaking levels of immigration, with more than 2.3 million migrant encounters at the border in fiscal year 2022.

DHS PUSHES BACK AGAINST MCCARTHY CALL FOR MAYORKAS TO RESIGN OR FACE POTENTIAL IMPEACHMENT

""Record annual encounters have led to untenable situations,"" Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., wrote in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that was made public Monday.

""In Arizona, shelters have been forced well beyond capacity. This month, El Paso has seen over 700 migrants released directly onto city streets due to overcrowding. This is not safe, and creates a dangerous situation for migrants and communities.""

Mayorkas testified before the Senate earlier this month, saying that the Biden administration has a plan once Title 42 expires.

""We are enhancing the consequences for unlawful entry, especially with respect to individuals who seek to evade law enforcement, including removal, detention and criminal prosecution when warranted,"" Mayorkas said.

Republicans, meanwhile, have pledged to investigate the DHS once they retake the House of Representatives in January, calling for Mayorkas to either resign or be impeached.

Democratic support for Biden in 2024 rises while Republicans grow skeptical of Trump: poll,"A new national poll suggests that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters are becoming more supportive of the idea of President Biden as their party’s nominee in 2024.

Half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents questioned in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday said their party has a better chance of winning the White House in 2024 with Biden as the nominee. Forty-five percent said another candidate would improve their chances of winning.

That marks a major shift in public opinion in the Marist poll, as the president was underwater on that question in November.

The 80-year-old Biden has said he intends to seek a second term in the White House but has yet to launch a presidential re-election campaign.

Meanwhile, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents questioned in the nationwide survey said the GOP has a better chance of winning back the White House in 2024 with someone other than former President Donald Trump as the party’s standard-bearer.

Fifty-four percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the GOP has a better chance of winning in 2024 without Trump, identical to last November. Just 42% said Trump would give Republicans an advantage in the 2024 general election.

The poll also indicates that Trump's favorability rating among those who identify or lean towards the Republican Party dropped from 79% in November to 68% in February — his lowest level in Marist polling since before he won the 2016 presidential election.

The first three months of Trump’s latest White House bid have raised questions about his political durability, with pundits from both the left and the right criticizing his mid-November campaign launch as well as controversial actions and comments he has made since declaring his candidacy. In the wake of a lackluster performance by the GOP in the midterm elections — where the party underperformed in what many expected to be a red wave election — Trump has also been blamed for elevating polarizing Republican nominees who ended up losing in the general election.

Democratic voters cheer on gas stove ban: poll,"Most Democratic voters would welcome a ban on natural gas hookups in new construction and buildings located in their own communities, according to a poll conducted last month.

Roughly 56% of Democrats said they would support such a ban, which would effectively mandate electric stovetop and heating appliances in new construction, while just 26% would oppose a ban and 18% were undecided, according to a poll conducted between Jan. 18-19 by Morning Consult. By comparison, 39% of Independent voters and 28% of Republican voters would support a natural gas hookup ban.

Overall, 42% of all adult-age Americans surveyed would support the ban and 39% would oppose it, the poll showed. However, 38% of homeowners would support it compared to the 47% who oppose the ban.

In addition, the Morning Consult survey showed that, among all adults who owned gas stoves, 46% were interested in switching to electric versions and 44% weren't interested. Half of the respondents, though, said electric stoves don't work as well as natural gas-powered stoves.

BIDEN AGENCY REFUSES TO CITE RESEARCH SUPPORTING POTENTIAL NATURAL GAS STOVE BAN

The survey results come after the White House was forced to walk back comments from administration officials that it would consider a federal ban on gas stoves after widespread criticism. Days earlier, Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) member Richard Trumka Jr. told Bloomberg that ""any option is on the table"" and that unsafe products can be banned, noting that gas stoves were a ""hidden hazard.""

DEMOCRAT-LED CITIES ARE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD WITH GAS STOVE BANS THAT WILL AFFECT MILLIONS

""Research indicates that emissions from gas stoves can be hazardous, and the CPSC is looking for ways to reduce related indoor air quality hazards,"" CPSC Chairman Alexander Hoehn-Saric said following the report.

""CPSC is researching gas emissions in stoves and exploring new ways to address any health risks,"" he continued. ""CPSC also is actively engaged in strengthening voluntary safety standards for gas stoves.""

The CPSC chairman, though, echoed the White House, saying that he wasn't ""looking to ban gas stoves,"" but that the commission would ask the public for information about gas stove emissions and potential solutions in the coming months.

A study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in December tied 12% of childhood asthma cases to gas stoves.

However, critics have noted the study was partly funded by RMI, a nonprofit research firm that advocates for aggressive green policies and works to ""transform global energy systems across the real economy.""

Opponents of the ban have also argued that restricting natural gas usage would lead to significantly higher heating and energy costs for consumers.

"Democrats continue handing votes to Jeffries, who has long history of denying elections","As House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy struggles to garner the 218 required votes to obtain the speaker's gavel, Democrats are repeatedly delivering votes for incoming Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has a history of denying the legitimacy of elections.

The final tally in the fourth round of voting on Wednesday was 201 votes for McCarthy , 212 for Jeffries, 20 for Rep.-elect Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Rep.-elect Victoria Spartz's lone ""present"" vote. All Democrats voted for Jeffries in the last five votes and no other Democrat has been nominated by the party to serve as speaker.

President Biden and other prominent Democrats, as well as White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, have fumed over individuals who question or deny the legitimacy of elections, referring to them at times as ""extremists"" and threats to democracy.

But Jeffries, who was first elected to Congress in 2012 and now has widespread support among members in his party, has a history of displaying the very behavior that many in the Democratic Party now accuse their opposition of.

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY GRILLED ON TWEET CALLING 2016 ELECTION 'STOLEN'

In multiple tweets, ranging from June 2017 to January 2018, Jeffries seemingly refused to acknowledge Donald Trump as the rightful winner of the 2016 presidential election.

HAKEEM JEFFRIES CALLED TRUMP'S 2016 ELECTION VICTORY A 'HOAX,' REFERRED TO HIM AS 'SO-CALLED' PRESIDENT

""Climate Change is NOT a hoax. But 45's election may have been,"" Jeffries wrote in a June 2017 tweet , nearly five months after Trump entered the White House.

Jeffries — who was elected in November by his Democratic House colleagues to succeed Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as leader — has faced scrutiny from high-ranking Republicans over previously resurfaced remarks he made apparently denying the legitimacy of Trump's presidential election victory. But numerous times in tweets during Trump's presidency, Jeffries repeatedly suggested that Trump's election was fraudulent.

In September 2017, Jeffries stated in a tweet that Trump's ""Election Integrity Commission is the real FRAUD"" and that it ""should investigate his so-called victory.""

That same month, Jeffries, responding to remarks made by the president on Twitter, issued a similar tweet and called Trump's ""so-called election victory"" a ""hoax.""

""The real hoax is likely your so-called election victory,"" Jeffries claimed at the time. The congressman also included ""#RussianHacking"" in the tweet, appearing to suggest that Russia helped to elect Trump in the 2016 presidential election by hacking into America's elections.

Other tweets denying Trump's election victory from Jeffries have also been made public, primarily from the Republican National Committee , which criticized Jeffries as an ""election denier"" and posted tweets that Jeffries had posted in 2018.

Hakeem Jeffries believed to be in the driver's seat to succeed Pelosi as Democratic leader,"House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries is believed to be the leading candidate to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader after her decision to step down, which she announced from the well of the House Thursday.

Jeffries, 52, a five-term New York Democrat, represents a major Democratic power center in New York City – just as Pelosi represents a similar stronghold in San Francisco.

By the current leadership chart, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer is second-in-line to replace Pelosi. The 83-year-old Maryland Democrat has served as Pelosi's top deputy in the House leadership for nearly 20 years.

Hoyer is well-liked by colleagues and commands respect for his legislative knowledge. But Hoyer announced Thursday that he would not be running for a leadership position next congress, appearing to clear the path for Jeffries.

""I believe that it is time for me . . . to continue my service in a different role,"" said Hoyer. ""Therefore, I have decided not to seek elected leadership in the 118th Congress.""

NANCY PELOSI WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION AS LEADER OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS

Jeffries would inject a relative element of youth into a Democratic leadership that includes three octogenarians at the top. He also brings to the table experience in a leadership position that some others don't have, strong support from many in the party establishment, and respect from even some Republicans. Jeffries was also an impeachment manager for former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial.

But in a House Democratic caucus that's become increasingly progressive in recent years, Jeffries could very well face a challenge from his left flank. The New York Democrat, however, also has a deep bench of support from the more than 50-member Congressional Black Caucus (CBC).

""I'm very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries,"" said CBC Chariwoman Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGER CICILLINE RALLIES DEMOCRATS TO BAN FORMER PRESIDENT FROM PUBLIC OFFICE

In addition to Pelosi and Hoyer, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn also plans to step down from leadership. The South Carolina Democrat's exit clears the way for a full turnover of House leadership.

Incumbent assistant House Speaker Katherine Clark, D-Mass., is expected to run for minority whip. Similarly, current Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Pete Aguiliar of California is likely to run for chairman of the House conference.

It remains to be seen whether Jeffries or any the others will be challenged. Speculation has arisen that Rep. Prmaila Jayapal, D-Wash, could be a leadership contender.

Jayapal, the chair of the nearly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, has long been speculated to have leadership ambitions.

Over the past two years, Jayapal has worked hard to push Pelosi and House Democrats to the left by threatening to derail President Biden's legislative initiatives, including the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, unless they were tailored to progressive priorities.

Outgoing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has also been rumored to be planning a leadership bid for months.

Democrats to maintain control of the United States Senate,"Democrats will have continued control of the Senate, the Fox News Decision Desk can project.

Democrats will maintain power in the Senate thanks to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto being declared the winner in Nevada on Saturday night in her race against Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.

Democrats now hold 50 seats compared to the 49 seats held by Republicans with one seat yet to be decided in Georgia where a runoff election will be held between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock on December 6th.

Even if Walker were to win in Georgia, Democrats would still have control with Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

""Voters across the country have delivered a resounding endorsement of Democrats’ Senate majority,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Sen. Gary Peters said in a statement. ""These historic results in race after race speak for themselves, and they reflect the strength of our candidates, the popularity of Senate Democrats' message to the American people, and a rejection of the extremism espoused by the GOP. Now our work continues in Georgia to ensure Herschel Walker is defeated and Rev. Warnock is re-elected.""

Prior to Tuesday's nationwide midterm elections, Democrats held a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber of Congress with 50 seats in their party's control. Because Vice President Kamala Harris has the ability to cast tie-breaking votes, Democrats only needed 50 seats to keep control.

Prior to 2021, the last time Democrats controlled the Senate was from January 2013 to January 2015 during the 113th Congress.

In this year's midterm elections, Republicans were forced to defend 21 seats, while Democrats had to defend just 14. Three of the four closest Senate races this cycle featured a Democrat incumbent.

Throughout their campaigns, Republican candidates focused their messaging around issues that they believed voters care most about, including rising crime , out of control inflation, and the southern border crisis.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SENATE MIDTERMS, CANDIDATES, AND IMPORTANT RACES

Democrats, however, focused on protections for abortion after the Supreme Court's summer ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade. The party also focused on voting rights and election deniers, with President Joe Biden declaring just before the elections that ""MAGA Republicans"" who promoted former President Trump’s ""Big Lie"" about the 2020 election and engaged in voter intimidation are a ""threat"" to democracy.

The Senate consists of 100 lawmakers serving six-year terms; every election year about one-third of Senate seats are up for grabs.

Prior to Tuesday's elections, the Fox News' Power Rankings showed 47 seats going to the Democrats and 49 to the Republicans, leaving four crucial toss-up races to decide control of the Senate: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

The new Congress will officially be sworn into office in January.

Republicans are still hoping to take back control of the House of Representatives and appear on track to do so needing to win 7 races out of the two dozen congressional races across the country that are still outstanding.

So far, after Tuesday’s midterm elections results, Republicans have secured 211 seats of the chamber's 435 members — just shy of a 218-member majority.

Former Google CEO emerges as key Democratic power player ahead of midterms,"Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, a longtime Democratic donor, has recently ramped up political contributions to Democrats in the form of big-dollar donations and technological campaign assistance.

Schmidt — who has an estimated net worth north of $19 billion, according to Bloomberg — has for decades made political donations to Democratic campaigns and political action committees, but he has become a prolific donor for progressive causes since 2016, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. Over the last six years, the former Google executive has pushed more than $13 million, mainly to Democrats.

Schmidt particularly ramped up contributions in 2020, the data showed. He forked over $224,000 during the 2016 presidential cycle before giving a whopping $8.5 million in 2020 and more than $4 million during the current cycle.

The vast majority of his donations have gone to Democratic campaigns — his most recent Republican contribution, four payments to Sen. Mike Lee's, R-Utah, campaign, was recorded in March 2018.

ARIZONA, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO AND OTHER STATES WITH IMPORTANT MIDTERM RACES: WHY DO THEY MATTER?

In addition, Schmidt has quietly funded a key cog in the Democratic state election technological apparatus. During the current election cycle, Schmidt has wired $227,000 in in-kind contributions to STAC Labs — a tech start-up launched in 2019, which he has bankrolled through a nonprofit — for its work boosting tech and voter data analysis services on behalf of 18 state Democratic parties, according to FEC filings.

""At stac labs we work to make sure that progressives don’t just have the best data and technology, but that they also use it effectively,"" says the company's website, which offers few other details about its operations. ""By pooling data support staff and offering discounted tools, stac labs accelerates party, state and local campaigns' analytical and technological capabilities.""

Tying the three groups together, Jason Berkenfeld, the senior managing director of Schmidt Futures, lists OneOne Ventures on his LinkedIn profile and is identified as a board member of STAC Labs.

STAC Labs has focused particularly on battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan, and has worked with at least 200 campaigns. The company has also been hired for direct one-on-one coaching in 81 campaigns this cycle.

In addition, STAC Labs has assisted state parties with organizing voter file data, building voter reports with demographic and geographic information, designing templates for candidate websites, assembling field reports with data that shows information about specific voters and using software to analyze new congressional districts. The company also purchased Empower Engine, a voter analytics firm, last year.

Meanwhile, Schmidt has also had an outsized influence on White House policymaking during the Biden administration, Politico reported in March. More than a dozen White House Office of Science and Technology Policy officials have been close associates of Schmidt and some even continued to receive paychecks from Schmidt Futures after taking on their government roles.

Schmidt, who backed a nonprofit venture capital fund to boost domestic chip-making, according to the New York Times, also worked to urge Congress to pass the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act, which Biden signed into law in August.

A spokesperson for Schmidt declined to comment.

Schmidt first joined Google in 2001 and departed the company in 2020.

Republicans and media research groups have accused Google of having an anti-conservative bias. The Media Research Center concluded in a recent report that the company manipulated search engine results to hide Republican candidates' websites, and the GOP said earlier this year that its emails were wrongly being classified as spam by Google's mail service.

""New research reveals that your company makes it much harder for Republicans to reach their supporters even while your company makes it very easy for Democrats to reach theirs,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote to current Google CEO Sundar Pichai in April.

""I am particularly alarmed by this pattern because political dice-loading is nothing new for your company,"" he continued, noting Google's previous statements threatening to de-platform conservative news outlets.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-google-ceo-emerges-key-democratic-power-player-ahead-midterms,N/A
Fox News Poll: Biden holds commanding lead for Democratic nomination,"Joe Biden is the lone top tier candidate in the Democratic nomination race, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

The former vice president captures 33 percent support among Democratic primary voters (up one point since June). That’s more than double any of the second-tier competitors, which includes Bernie Sanders at 15 percent (+2), Elizabeth Warren at 12 percent (+3) and Kamala Harris at 10 percent (+2).

Another six candidates receive at least two percent support: Pete Buttigieg (5 percent), Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang (3 percent a piece), and Cory Booker, John Hickenlooper, and Beto O’Rourke (each at 2 percent). All others receive one percent or less.

Having the most voters in nearly two decades feeling positive about the economy and 52 percent approving of his job on the economy should position President Trump well to win re-election.

However, the exact same number, 33 percent, think economic conditions will get better whether Trump gets re-elected or a Democrat is elected. A touch more think the economy will get worse if Trump wins (39 percent) than if a Democrat wins (36 percent).

That ambivalence about the economy contributes to Trump’s support staying between 39-42 percent in hypothetical 2020 presidential match-ups.

“When the economy is good, incumbents typically have the wind at their back,” said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson.

“The president has an obvious target group -- the 10 percent who approve of his handling of the economy, but aren’t voting for him.”

Trump trails Biden by ten points and Sanders by six. He edges both Warren and Harris by one. None of the candidates hit 50 percent support.

Biden’s is the only lead outside the poll’s margin of sampling error -- notable when a majority of Democratic primary voters prioritizes ousting Trump.

By a 56-41 percent margin, primary voters say supporting a candidate who can beat Trump will be more important than supporting one who will fundamentally change how the economy works.

Among those saying winning is more important, Biden is the top choice by a wide 26-point margin. Those prioritizing major economic change support Biden and Sanders about equally.

There are indications the nomination process is pulling the Democrats left. While 9 percent think the Democratic field is too conservative and 37 percent say it is “about right,” some 40 percent say the field is too liberal. Nineteen percent of Democratic primary voters agree.

The new poll, released Thursday, also finds some of the policy proposals discussed in the Democratic primary are out of sync with the broader electorate.

Getting rid of private health insurance and moving to a government-run health care system is favored among Democratic primary voters by a 30-point margin, but opposed among all voters by 5 points.

By a 15-point margin, primary voters favor providing health insurance coverage to undocumented immigrants. Voters overall oppose that by a 28-point margin.

Decriminalizing entering the U.S. without proper documentation is favored among primary voters by 10 points and opposed by voters by 23 points.

There is one proposal both groups like -- changing the health care system so every American can buy into Medicare. Democratic primary voters favor that by 64 points and voters by 42.

By a 14-point margin, voters say Democrats would do a better job than Republicans handling health care, and they have a favorable view of Obamacare by a 9-point margin (that climbs to +69 among Democrats).

Meanwhile, there is a 19-point gap between voters overall and Democratic primary voters on the U.S. moving more toward socialism: 53 percent of primary voters say that would be a good thing compared to 34 percent of all voters.

Biden leads (28 percent) among primary voters saying a move toward socialism is a good thing, followed by Sanders (18 percent) and Warren (15 percent). His advantage widens among those who think that would be a bad idea: Biden (36 percent), Sanders (14 percent), Harris (8 percent), and Warren (6 percent).

A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s policy of making asylum seekers apply in countries they pass through on the way to the U.S. southern border.

By a 9-point margin, voters favor (50-41 percent) allowing refugees from Central American countries to seek political asylum in the U.S. Among Democrats, it is favored by a big 52-point margin (72-20 percent).

Sixty percent of voters are concerned about the treatment of migrants detained on the U.S.-Mexico border, including 82 percent of Democrats and 36 percent of Republicans.

"Fox News Poll: Biden still leads Democratic race, Warren climbs into second","In the first major shakeup to the lineup, Elizabeth Warren moves ahead of Bernie Sanders to claim second place behind Joe Biden in the Democratic nomination race. In addition, primary voters sharply divide between embracing former President Obama’s legacy and taking a new path.

A new Fox News Poll finds Biden continues to lead the nomination race with the support of 31 percent of Democratic primary voters. Next is Elizabeth Warren at 20 percent, Bernie Sanders at 10 percent, and Kamala Harris at 8 percent.

READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS

Warren’s move up came in steady steps. From March to May she gained 5 points, then 3 more in July, and 8 more in August -- for a total 16 percentage-point increase.

During that same time, Sanders dropped 13 points (from 23 percent in March to 10 percent now).

Biden and Harris are both exactly where they were in March.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent apiece, and Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke are each at 2 percent. Julian Castro, Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson each receive 1 percent.

John Hickenlooper, who dropped out of the race Thursday, received less than one percent.

Warren’s gains come at Sanders’ expense, as she’s now the favorite among primary voters under age 45 as well as those who identify as “very” liberal. Since last month, Warren is up 12 points among the under 45 crowd, while Sanders lost 10. And her support increased 18 points among very liberal voters, as backing for Sanders dropped 16.

Biden leads Warren among both men (+11 points) and women (+11), and has a 22-point advantage among voters over age 45. Plus, among non-whites, Biden is up by 17 points over Sanders and by 19 over Warren.

By a wide 60-36 percent margin, Democratic primary voters prefer a nominee who will “restore the country and get American politics back to normalcy” over one who will “fundamentally change” how Washington works.

They divide sharply, however, when deciding between a candidate who will build on Obama’s legacy (48 percent) and one who will take a new and different approach (47 percent).

Those favoring a new approach go for Warren over Biden by 5 points, while those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy back Biden by 26.

By a 20-point margin, Biden is also preferred over Warren among those who want a nominee who will restore normalcy (39 vs. 19 percent). The vote preference is mixed among those who want to fundamentally change how Washington works: Warren (20 percent), Biden (19 percent), Sanders (18 percent), and Harris (10 percent).

Each of the Democratic candidates tested in the poll beats President Trump in possible 2020 matchups -- and each makes gains compared to July. And while Trump never hits 40 percent support, it’s important to note that none of the challengers breaks 50 percent, and there are enough remaining undecided/third-party voters -- between 12-15 percent -- to swing the race either way.

“Biden and Sanders have held sizable leads over Trump before,” said Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. “But this is the first time our poll results give Warren and Harris the chance to stake a claim to an electability argument as well.”

Trump trails Biden by 12 points (50-38 percent), Sanders by 9 (48-39), and Warren by 7 (46-39). Those leads are outside the poll’s margin of error. This is the first Fox News Poll to show a lead for Warren outside the margin of error.

Harris’s 6-point advantage in a matchup against Trump sits right at the error margin (45-39).

“So much can happen in a day, let alone 14 months,” said Shaw. “But the president’s inability to capitalize on the strong economy, especially among independents, has to concern the White House.”

While interest in the 2020 election remains high among all voters, more Democrats (63 percent) than Republicans (56 percent) are “extremely” interested.

When Democratic primary voters are asked whether they have a favorable or unfavorable view of Obama, 93 percent say favorable compared to 6 percent unfavorable. That gives him a net favorability rating of +87 points.

Primary voters give Sanders a net rating of +71 points (83 favorable-12 unfavorable), while Warren is at +69 (79-10), Biden +67 (81-14), and Harris +58 (73-15).

Among Republicans, Trump gets a net positive score of +71 (85-14). Among voters overall, he gets a net negative by 14 points (42-56).

The top tier Democratic candidates garner positive ratings among all voters: Biden +8 points (50-42), Sanders +7 (50-43), Warren +6 (46-40), and Harris +1 (41-40). Obama does even better, receiving a net +23 points (60 favorable-37 unfavorable).

Voters who have a negative view of both Biden and Trump back Biden by a 43-10 percent margin in the head-to-head matchup, although many would vote for someone else (27 percent), wouldn’t vote (12 percent) or are undecided (8 percent).

The Democratic Party has a +6 net positive rating (51 favorable-45 unfavorable), while the Republican Party is viewed negatively by 13 points (41-54). Part of the reason is more Democrats (92 percent) rate their party favorably than Republicans rate theirs (84 percent).

Fox News Poll: Biden up by double digits in Democratic race,"Former Vice President Joe Biden leads the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

Among Democratic primary voters, Biden’s 35 percent (up from 31 percent in March) leaves Bernie Sanders in a distant second place with 17 percent (down from 23 percent).

Elizabeth Warren is next at 9 percent, Pete Buttigieg receives 6 percent, followed by Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 4 percent, Cory Booker at 3 percent, and Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Jay Inslee, Tim Ryan, Marianne Williamson, and Andrew Yang each garner one percent.

Since March, Warren and Buttigieg gained five percentage points and Biden is up four, while Sanders dropped six points, O’Rourke four and Harris three.

About half of Democratic primary voters (49 percent) are paying “a lot” of attention to the candidates, and Biden performs even better in the ballot test among this tuned-in group: 41 percent back him, 17 percent Sanders, 10 percent Warren, and 7 percent Buttigieg.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

The highest priority of Democratic primary voters is defeating Donald Trump, as 73 percent feel that is “extremely” important. Next, 71 percent say it’s extremely important their nominee has high ethical standards. Roughly half want a candidate who shares their views on major issues (51 percent), has new ideas (47 percent), and has a record of accomplishments as a political leader (47 percent). Fewer prioritize someone who is likeable (39 percent), will shake up Washington (38 percent), and represents a new generation (37 percent).

For each trait, Biden leads among those primary voters who say it is extremely important.

Biden also performs best in hypothetical 2020 matchups. Among all registered voters, he leads Trump by 11 points (49-38 percent), up from a 7-point advantage in March. Biden’s is the only lead outside the margin of sampling error in the matchups tested -- and he is the only Democrat to push Trump’s support below 41 percent.

Sanders tops Trump by 5 points (46-41 percent) and Warren is up by two (43-41 percent), while Harris ties Trump (41-41 percent) and Buttigieg trails him by one (40-41 percent).

The president’s reelect number holds steady at 38 percent, while 54 percent would back someone else if the 2020 presidential election were today. In December, it was 38-55 percent.

Trump’s 16-point reelect deficit is far larger than the 5-point gap former President Barack Obama had around this same point in the election cycle. For Obama, it was 44 percent reelect vs. 49 percent someone else in June 2011.

Overall, 28 percent of voters would “definitely” reelect Trump, while 46 percent would “definitely” vote for someone else.

The first primary elections are about nine months away and the 2020 general election is 18 months off, yet interest in next year’s election is already remarkably high. Nearly 6-in-10 voters, 57 percent, are extremely interested.

That’s even higher than the 54 percent who felt that way the week before the 2016 presidential election. In July 2015, a similar point in the electoral cycle, 31 percent were “extremely” interested.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's family boasts deep ties to Democrat power players,"The family of Sam Bankman-Fried, the beleaguered founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, has significant ties to the Democratic establishment in Washington, D.C.

The FTX CEO's family — consisting of his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, and brother Gabe Bankman-Fried — has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and actively worked with left-wing organizations committed to supporting Democrats. The four appear to have had subtle influence on the Democratic establishment for the better part of a decade.

""We’re ambitious and looking to make a splash,"" Gabe Bankman-Fried said in an interview with NBC News in May.

The Bankman-Fried brothers have led joint efforts to raise money to prevent future pandemics. Of the $38 million Sam Bankman-Fried donated to political campaigns and groups during the midterm election, about $27 million went to Protect Our Future PAC, a political action committee dedicated to boosting candidates who would push forward anti-pandemic policies, according to Federal Election Commission data.

WHAT IS THE ALLEGED CONNECTION BETWEEN SAM BANKMAN-FRIED, FTX, DEMOCRATS AND UKRAINE?

The PAC only gave money to Democrats and the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund. Bankman-Fried's donations to the PAC represented more than 99.5% of its total money raised.

Gabe Bankman-Fried, who has contributed more than $361,000 to mainly Democratic campaigns and causes over the last several years, founded the group Guarding Against Pandemics. The group researches and endorses candidates who then often receive cash from Protect Our Future PAC.

HERE ARE THE DEMS WHO BENEFITED FROM THE LEFT-WING PAC THAT FTX FUNNELED $27M THROUGH

A webpage highlighting Gabe Bankman-Fried's role starting Guarding Against Pandemics on the group's website was recently wiped, but was archived and reviewed by Fox News Digital. The webpage stated that he was previously a legislative correspondent for Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., on Capitol Hill between 2019 and 2021 — and worked for Civis Analytics, a data firm that works hand-in-hand with Democratic PACs.

Civis Analytics has positioned itself as a Democratic powerhouse in recent years. The firm was ""born"" from President Obama's campaign after Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO and executive chairman of Alphabet, helped as a recruiter and trainer for the campaign and later teamed up with Dan Wagner, the chief analytics officer for Obama's 2012 campaign, to help launch the company.

Schmidt provided seed money for the firm and helped gather tens of millions of dollars in funding. Civis has since been on the payroll of several major Democratic committees, including presidential contenders.

As Gabe Bankman-Fried worked for the firm during the 2018 election cycle, Civis received nearly $4.4 million from the likes of the Senate Majority PAC, House Majority PAC, Priorities USA Action, Democratic National Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The cash was primarily for research and data analytics consulting, FEC filings shows.

And Sam Bankman-Fried's parents have also been involved with Democratic lawmakers and groups. Together, the pair have contributed more than $196,000 to mainly Democrats, FEC records show.

In addition, Barbara Fried leads Mind the Gap, a secretive organization that funnels massive amounts of money to Democratic campaigns, according to Influence Watch. The group has received major funding from well-known Silicon Valley donors including Schmidt, the former Google CEO; Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founder of Facebook; Allen Blue, the co-founder of LinkedIn; and Jeff Horing, the co-founder of top venture capital firm Insight Partners.

FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED'S CRYPTO COLLAPSE APOLOGY

""The core mission of Mind the Gap is to empower private political donors to strengthen our democracy by providing them with evidence-based guidance on the electoral strategies, tactics, and programs that are likely to achieve the greatest impact in a given election cycle,"" the group's mission states.

""Drawing on rigorous research conducted over multiple elections, Mind the Gap uses quantifiable metrics to vet and compare promising programs and to direct donors to the organizations and tactics most likely to increase the probability of Democratic victory in key races.""

Fried's connection to Schmidt is notable since he emerged as a key power player ahead of the midterm elections this month, giving millions of dollars to Democrats and bankrolling STAC Labs, a start-up tech firm that builds out data infrastructure for progressives.

Schmidt also still serves on Civis Analytics' board of directors. In 2018, Mind the Gap paid Civis about $90,000 for data analytics services.

George Soros predicts 'Democratic landslide' in 2024 if Trump and DeSantis 'slug it out',"Left-wing billionaire George Soros recently shared his hopes for the 2024 U.S. presidential election and the conditions he believes will lead to a ""Democratic landslide.""

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Thursday, Soros said it is likely that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will challenge former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination – and win. His hope is that Trump, pride wounded, will mount a third-party campaign for president that will split the GOP vote and hand Democrats another four years in the White House.

""My hope for 2024 is that Trump and Gov. DeSantis of Florida will slug it out for the Republican nomination,"" Soros said.

TRUMP EDGES DESANTIS IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY MATCHUP, BIDEN REMAINS LARGELY UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS: POLL

""Trump has turned into a pitiful figure, continually bemoaning his loss in 2020. Big Republican donors are abandoning him in droves,"" he continued.

Calling DeSantis ""shrewd, ruthless and ambitious,"" Soros predicted the Florida governor will be the Republican candidate for president.

TRUMP WELCOMES NIKKI HALEY INTO THE 2024 RACE: ‘THE MORE THE MERRIER’

""This could induce Trump, whose narcissism has turned into a disease, to run as a third-party candidate. That would lead to a Democratic landslide and force the Republican Party to reform itself,"" Soros said longingly. ""But perhaps, I may be just a little bit biased.""

The 2024 race for the Republican nomination is on, with former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley joining Trump as a declared candidate this week. DeSantis is widely expected to announce his own campaign for president in the spring or early summer, once the current session of the Florida legislature wraps up.

Polls consistently show Trump and DeSantis as the top two candidates in the Republican field. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed Trump edging out DeSantis 42%-36% in a hypothetical matchup.

Race forecaster shifts Georgia Senate runoff race from Toss-up to Leans Democratic,"On the eve of Georgia's runoff Election Day, Sabato's Crystal Ball shifted the battleground Senate race from Toss-up to Leans Democratic, pointing to early voting trends expected to benefit the Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock.

""As we see it, with the Black share of the early vote up a few notches from what we saw ahead of November’s election, Walker starts out even deeper in the hole,"" the ratings report reads.

Herschel Walker, the Trump-endorsed Republican nominee, is running to unseat the Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock.

The ratings change comes after early voting concluded last week in the Peach State, hitting a record-high for single-day early in-person turnout with 352,953 ballots cast on Friday, according to state elections data .

WARNOCK STILL WON'T SAY IF HE SUPPORTS ANY ABORTION LIMITATIONS JUST ONE DAY BEFORE GEORGIA RUNOFF

The total early vote count is expected to reach 1.9 million votes, a top official at the Georgia Secretary of State's office said on Friday.

To offset positive indicators in the early vote, Walker ""needs a big Election Day showing,"" according to the ratings report.

Hakeem Jeffries announces bid for House Democratic leader,"Rep. Hakeem Jeffries announced Friday he will run to replace outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the House Democrats next Congress.

Jeffries, a five-term New York Democrat, announced his intention to seek the post one day after Pelosi bowed out as leader after a nearly 20-year run.

""Today, I write to humbly ask for your support for the position of House Democratic Leader as we once again prepare to meet the moment,"" Jeffries wrote in a letter to fellow House Democrats. ""Our Caucus must unify with purpose, communicate with discipline, legislate with precision and partner with the Biden administration to vigorously address the continuing challenges impacting our constituents.""

The announcement came after Jeffries's most likely Democratic challenger, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, announced she would seek another term as chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Jayapal said that although she had entertained the idea of a run for Democratic leader, her focus was on ensuring House Democrats succeeded in delivering on progressive priorities.

WHO IS HAKEEM JEFFRIES, HOUSE DEMOCRATS' LIKELY NEXT LEADER?

""As Chair of the CPC, I will put my energy toward ensuring Democrats are not only a critically important ‘opposition' party to push back on draconian MAGA-Republican policies, but also a 'proposition' party, with a real vision that builds an even bigger movement to lift up poor people, working people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, and those who just need a leg up to thrive not just survive,"" Jayapal wrote in a letter to House Democrats. ""That is what will help propel us to victory in 2024.""

NANCY PELOSI WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION AS LEADER OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS

Jayapal's exit clears the way for Jeffries. The 52-year-old New Yorker has served as a member of leadership for nearly six years, first on the Democratic policy committee and as chair of the House Democratic Caucus since 2019.

Jeffries also represents a major Democratic power center in New York City, just as Pelosi represents a similar stronghold in San Francisco. He has strong backing from the more than 50-member Congressional Black Caucus, which was quick to signal its support even Pelosi made her departure official.

""I'm very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries,"" said Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who chairs the group.

Pelosi, who has led House Democrats since 2003, announced her decision to step down on Thursday. The move came as it was confirmed that Republicans won a narrow majority in the midterm elections.

""For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect, and I'm grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility,"" said the 82-year-old Pelosi.

Also exiting the Democratic leadership are Pelosi's top two deputies, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men have signaled they will back Jeffries for leader.

Officers were called to the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday evening about a protest.

When they arrived, they saw Dowell allegedly spray-painting ""ACAB,"" which stands for ""All Cops Are Bastards,"" and ""NO COP CITY,"" an apparent reference to a police training facility in the suburbs of Atlanta that has sparked protests after officers shot and killed a protester who allegedly opened fire on them, injuring one, earlier this week.

Clark’s middle child, Riley Dowell, was arrested Saturday evening for allegedly tagging a monument with anti-police slogans in spray paint and assaulting a law enforcement officer during the protest.

The House Democratic whip in December recalled Dowell ""waking up with nightmares"" over climate change.

""One of the biggest changes is going to be that we're coming into this in the minority, but the commitment that we have had to the people of this country, to workers, to women, to the climate is going to continue on,"" Clark said.

""And let me tell you what it means to me coming in as a different generation,"" she continued. ""I remember my middle child waking up with nightmares over concern around climate change. I've had my family at a movie theater, when the movie stopped, my children immediately felt there must be a shooter in the theater with us.""

""These are the type of experiences that we are going to bring as we continue to push to meet this moment of challenge for the American people with progress,"" she added.

INCOMING DEM WHIP CLARK RECALLS CHILD ‘WAKING UP WITH NIGHTMARES’ OVER CLIMATE CHANGE

Dowell, 23, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, destruction or injury of personal property, and damage of property by graffiti.

The Boston Police Department referred to the suspect as ""Jared Dowell."" Clark has spoken in the past about how one of her children is non-binary.

Officers were called to the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common around 9:30 p.m. Saturday about a protest.

When officers arrived, they saw Dowell allegedly spray-painting ""ACAB,"" which stands for ""All Cops Are Bastards,"" and ""NO COP CITY,"" an apparent reference to a police training facility in the suburbs of Atlanta that has sparked protests after officers shot and killed a protester who allegedly opened fire on them, injuring one, earlier this week.

While police arrested Dowell, a group of 20 protesters ""began to surround officers while screaming profanities though megaphones on the public street causing traffic to come to a standstill,"" according to police.

The protesters were ""interfering with the arrest"" and ""an officer was hit in the face and could be seen bleeding from the nose and mouth.""

Clark addressed the arrest in a tweet posted Sunday.

""I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting,"" Clark tweeted. ""This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.""

Dowell will be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.

Clyburn’s comments to Fox News Digital come as Democrats debate a potential leadership change as a minority in the House of Representatives. Leadership elections set for Nov. 30 will decide who leads the party in the House next year.

Clyburn was House majority whip from 2007 to 2011, and was assistant Democratic leader from 2011 to 2019 before taking on the job again.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has yet to announce her intention to maintain the top position in party leadership, but said her colleagues have encouraged her to do so.

Clyburn added that he does not intend to compete for House minority leader, which will be the top slot for Democrats next year.

""No, it won’t be for that,"" he told Fox News Digital.

"Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker re-elected, defeats Republican Darren Bailey","The Fox News Decision Desk projects that Democratic Governor JB Pritzker will win a second term. He prevails over GOP challenger Darren Bailey.

In Illinois, which sets no term-limits on the governor's seat, the two battled it out during several debates and Bailey pressed Pritzker on various critical midterm issues.

During the last debate of the cycle, Bailey blamed the Democrat incumbent for the rise of violent crime in the state, specifically in one of the country's crime hotspots, the city of Chicago.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

""I’m gonna call it ‘Pritzkerville’ because every one of Gov. Pritzker's extreme policies are destroying the city,"" Bailey said of crime-ridden Chicago.

""Out-of-control crime, devastated education, the fact that corporations are packing up and leaving every day. Pritzkerville fits nicely because Gov. Pritzker, it's time for him to own it,"" the GOP candidate said.

Pritzker attempted to dismiss his opponents' accusation, claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the main causes of the crime surge and that he is focused on investing in the development of DNA testing and advancing criminal identification technology to tackle rising crime in the Windy City.

ILLINOIS GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE BLAMES CHICAGO CRIME ON PRITZKER IN HEATED DEBATE

""If you want to reduce crime, you got to solve crime. And all the things that we’ve invested in over the last four years have been aimed exactly at that,"" the Democratic incumbent added.

Another major midterm issue that the two candidates argued about was the influx of migrants coming over the southern border that were being sent to Illinois. Over the past several months, thousands of migrants have been sent to the ""sanctuary city,"" but the newly re-elected governor was called out for sending buses of migrants from Chicago to the suburbs, reportedly giving the town officials barely any notice ahead of their arrival.

At the end of the Sept. 30 quarterly reporting period, Pritzker reportedly raised about $81 million, while Bailey's campaign reported that he raised $2 million.

Jennifer McClellan wins Democratic 'firehouse primary' for the late Rep. Donald McEachin's Virginia House seat,"Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan has won the Democratic nomination for the House seat vacated by the late Rep. Donald McEachin.

The race was called by The Associated Press shortly after 4 a.m. Thursday, with McClellan receiving 84.81% of the vote.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called a special election for the state's 4th Congressional District after McEachin's death, instructing both parties to file candidates by Dec. 23. In that short time, four Democrats registered for the so-called ""firehouse primary,"" named for how the party had to scramble to organize the election.

""Tuesday’s party-run process saw historic turnout with 27,900 votes cast, making it the largest party-run nomination process in the history of the Democratic Party of Virginia; voter turnout even exceeded the last state-run primary in VA-04, when 15,728 votes were cast,"" the Democratic Party of Virginia said in a statement Thursday.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATIC REP. DONALD MCEACHIN DEAD AT 61 AFTER BATTLE WITH COLORECTAL CANCER

The two front-runners were McClellan and Democratic state Sens. Joseph Morrissey, who received 13.56% of the vote. Each announced their candidacies less than a week before voters went to the polls for Tuesday's primary.

The other candidates included Tavorise Marks (0.78%) and Joseph Preston (0.62%).

McClellan won the endorsement of McEachin's wife, Richmond Commonwealth Attorney Colette McEachin, as well as backing from Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, as well as several other prominent state Democrats.

She launched a blitzkrieg campaign, spending around $15,000 on Google Ads targeting voters in the district according to FWIW, a newsletter that tracks political ad spending.

A McClellan campaign advisor told Roll Call she had raised about $200,000 as of Friday.

VIRGINIA GOV. YOUNGKIN WARNS OF ‘CATASTROPHIC’ EFFECTS FROM TITLE 42'S END

Morrissey, meanwhile, is a scandal-plagued attorney who attacked Democratic Party leadership for the way they conducted the primary election.

""Instead of holding a firehouse primary on Saturday, December 17, 2022, like we have always done firehouse primaries on Saturday, letting everybody vote, the Fourth Congressional District Democratic Committee chose an unprecedented Tuesday, special election nomination process. It will have the direct effect of chilling and limiting voter turnout,"" Morrisey said in a statement ripping the ""Democratic elite"" for scheduling the primary on a weekday.

YOUNGKIN ADDRESSES 2024 RUMBLINGS AS SOME IN GOP SEEK TRUMP ALTERNATIVES

""I am not whining. I'm not complaining. I will fight back. I will work hard. My parents taught all of us never to give up, never to quit. And that's what we'll do. So we'll play by your rules. Shame on you, Susan Swecker, and the Democratic elites for what you did. We'll play by your rules and we'll beat you,"" he said, referring to Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Virginia Democratic Party.

Morrissey, 65, was accused in 2014 of having sex with his 17-year-old secretary, who he later married. He was in his mid-fifties at the time.

Susan Swecker, Chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, will join Alexsis Rodgers, Chairwoman of the Fourth Congressional District Democratic Committee, for a press conference 10:00 a.m. Thursday to formally announce McClellan's victory, the Virginia Democratic Party said.

McClellan will face Republican Leon Benjamin Sr. in a special election on Feb. 21. Benjamin previously ran unsuccessfully against McEachin twice and was defeated by tens of thousands of votes in November.

Is Joe Manchin next? Strategists say the West Virginian isn’t about to leave the Democratic Party,"Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's decision to leave the Democratic Party raised immediate questions about whether West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin might follow her out the door, since the two senators have often played a role in gumming up the congressional pipeline for President Biden’s more progressive policies in a 50-50 Senate.

But political strategists familiar with West Virginia politics say there's little to no chance Manchin leaves the party he's been with for decades.

""Joe Manchin will switch parties the day after the sun rises in the west,"" said one Republican strategist who works in West Virginia politics, adding Manchin’s connection to the party reflects a ""deep sense of identity"" for the senator.

ARIZONA SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, REGISTERS AS INDEPENDENT

""He views their progressive turn as an aberration, historically speaking,"" the strategist said. ""Expect him to spend the next two years voting against everything Biden wants in an effort to restore his brand as a moderate and to bury memories of his dishonesty on Build Back Better.""

""He despises the Republican Party and would never join it,"" the strategist added.

SINEMA'S EXIT FROM DEMOCRATS COULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE SENATE

Democratic operatives also say Manchin, despite the obstacle he’s become in some cases to the Biden administration, is a stalwart figure in the Democratic Party and will remain.

""Joe Manchin has served in elected office going back to 1982. That's 40 years of running and winning as a member of the Democratic Party in West Virginia,"" a Democratic strategist and former Biden campaign surrogate told Fox News Digital.

""The senator has been successful because of his personal brand and the trust he’s built with voters over four decades, not being of the party label next to his name. I don’t think Sen. Sinema’s announcement today changes anything about Manchin’s thinking heading into 2024, when both senators are up for re-election,"" he said.

Party leaders in the Mountain State also agree Manchin is likely to stay loyal to the party he has represented for decades as secretary of state, then governor and now two-term senator.

GREEN NEW DEAL DEMOCRATS CHANGE TUNE ON JOE MANCHIN AFTER $433 BILLION CLIMATE, INFLATION BILL

West Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Mike Pushkin said any ""rumors"" Manchin wants to take an independent route away from the party is ""wishful thinking"" for Republicans.

""We have no reason to believe that any of that is the case. And that's not what we're hearing in Sen. Manchin's home state of West Virginia,"" Pushkin said.

Pushkin's counterpart in the state, Elgine McArdle, chair of the West Virginia Republican Party, agreed that ""Joe is so ingrained with the Democratic Party, always has been.""

McArdle said she hopes Manchin finds more common ground with Republicans in the next Congress but noted that, in the times when Manchin did break Republican, it was often following Sinema's lead.

What Kyrsten Sinema's departure from Democratic Party means for pivotal Arizona Senate seat,"Independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's departure from the Democratic Party on Friday raises questions concerning the future of her pivotal Senate seat in the body's already slim margin between Democrats and Republicans.

The former Democrat was first elected in 2018, winning a tight race against then-Republican Congresswoman Martha McSally, and is up for re-election in 2024 in what is expected to be a primary target for Republicans to flip.

Regardless of whether Sinema chooses to continue to caucus with her Democratic colleagues in the Senate, Arizona law will not allow her to run as a candidate of a particular political party if she is an independent. Therefore, she would likely be forced to run in a 2024 general election against a future Democratic and Republican nominee if she seeks re-election to win a second term.

LIBERAL MEDIA, DEMS ERUPT OVER SINEMA LEAVING DEMOCRATIC PARTY: ‘STILL GREAT AT BEING THE F---ING WORST’

One progressive group already appeared to be looking ahead to 2024 following Sinema's announcement that she was no longer a Democrat. ""Kyrsten Sinema has no constituency in Arizona among Democratic, Republican, or Independent voters. Her constituency is Wall Street — and she hurt Arizonans by tanking universal child care, voting rights, and taxing billionaires,"" Stephanie Taylor, the co-founder of the Progressive Campaign Change Committee said, referring to Sinema's siding with Republicans on certain Democrat-backed legislation.

SINEMA'S EXIT FROM DEMOCRATS COULD COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE SENATE

""She should join her friends on Wall Street in 2024, and Democrats should nominate someone truly on the side of the working class who can unite and win Arizona,"" she added.

Prior to Sinema's announcement, Democrats were expected to take control of the Senate in January with a slim 51-49 seat majority after largely outperforming Republicans in tight races across the country during the midterms.

But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was confident that Sinema's move would not affect the balance of power. In a statement after Sinema's announcement, Schumer said that the Arizona senator had asked to retain her committee assignments, to which he agreed.

""We will maintain our new majority on committees, exercise our subpoena power and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes,"" Schumer said.

Sinema will become the Senate's third independent senator, joining Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who both caucus with Democrats.

"Liz Cheney calls on Democratic voters to switch parties, give her boost in GOP primary","Wyoming voters will go to the polls Tuesday to vote in the state's primary elections, and Republican congresswoman Rep. Liz Cheney is looking to an unusual source for support in her GOP race: Democrats.

While only members of a given party are allowed to vote in that party's primary in Wyoming, the state does allow for same-day voter registration. This means that people can switch parties the same day they vote, so those who had been Democrats can become Republicans just to vote for Cheney in the primary, where her main challenger is Harriet Hageman.

""When Liz Cheney’s only hope is to appeal to Democrats to raid a Republican primary, you know she has gone all the way over to Nancy Pelosi’s side,"" Hageman's campaign manager Carly Miller told Wyoming Public Media. ""Wyoming is fed up with Cheney, and it’s too late for any election shenanigans to save her.""

Cheney, who has served in the House since 2017, drew the ire of many fellow Republicans with her opposition to former President Donald Trump, including her prominent role as one of two Republicans on the House January 6 Committee. Trump himself has endorsed Hageman in an effort to unseat Cheney.

TOP TRUMP TARGETS CHENEY, MURKOWSKI, FACE VOTERS IN TUESDAY'S PRIMARIES IN WYOMING, ALASKA

With prominent Republicans like Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, looking to sway existing Republican voters away from Cheney, the incumbent is hoping to convert new ones to save her. A page on her campaign website with voting information even has a section with instructions for how people can change their party so they can vote for her.

The site notes that a voter could register as a Republican up to 14 days before the primary date, when they request an absentee ballot, or on the day itself at the polling site.

Whether a result of Cheney's efforts or not, there has been a swing in voter registration numbers since January, with Democrats losing almost 7,000 voters and Republicans gaining more than 11,000, according to Wyoming Public Media.

Mike Sullivan, former Democratic governor of Wyoming, counts himself among those who will make the switch and vote in the Republican primary. He told the Star-Tribune that for him, it was ""a choice between the politics of courage, character and integrity or revenge, vindication and chaos.""

Manchin claims Democratic social spending and tax bill is filled with GOP priorities,"As Democrats prepare to advance their social spending and taxation bill via a party-line budget reconciliation process, one of its chief sponsors, Sen. Joe Manchin, says he thinks Republicans should be on board with it too.

Manchin, D-W.Va., cut a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the legislation last week, which would spend $433 billion and raise $739 billion in tax revenue, according to Democrats.

It's unclear whether the bill will pass with support from all 50 Democrats. But Republicans are in lockstep against it, arguing it amounts to reckless taxing and spending during a recession.

MANCHIN HAS ‘NICE TALK’ WITH SINEMA BUT WON'T DISCUSS DETAILS ON FATE OF SOCIAL SPENDING AND TAX BILL

Manchin, however, says they're being blinded by partisanship, and would be on board with the bill if Congress weren't so polarized.

""The thing I talk to my Republican friends, they always want to make sure that – we've just got to have more energy. Well, guess what? We're going to have a lot more,"" Manchin told Fox News Digital Thursday. ""We're going to drill a lot more… We're going to build some more gas lines to take the energy. And we're going to invest in the future, energy for the future.""

""They always say, ‘well, we want to pay down debt.’ Well, we're paying down $300 billion for the first time in 25 years,"" Manchin added. ""And then they're saying, 'you know what, we've just got to change the permitting processes, so we can do things quicker and better in America.' We do that too.""

Manchin's bill is the progeny of more than a year of negotiations on legislation that was originally called ""Build Back Better."" Now titled the ""Inflation Reduction Act,"" it's massively scaled down from the initial $3 trillion-plus reconciliation proposals.

The legislation includes provisions on fossil fuel energy, climate and green energy, prescription drugs, the Affordable Care Act and the tax code. Manchin's deal with Schumer also included a promise from top congressional Democrats to pass oil permitting reform before the end of September.

Republicans, meanwhile, say the bill will hurt the economy and middle class families right as the United States has entered a recession. They cite Joint Committee on Taxation data that shows nearly every income bracket will feel the burden of the new taxes, if indirectly. And they say that the taxes will harm manufacturers disproportionately, just after Congress passed legislation aimed at boosting U.S. semiconductor chip manufacturing.

MANCHIN VOTES ALIGN CLOSELY WITH SCHUMER, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WARREN, SANDERS DESPITE PORTRAYAL AS MODERATE

""Folks who work in these companies – and remember half this is going to fall on manufacturers – they're gonna see their wages and benefits be reduced because of this taxation at a time when they're having a really hard time keeping up with current inflation,"" Sen. Rob Portman. R-Ohio, said at a press conference Wednesday

Manchin's comments on Republicans come as he's still trying to get all Democrats on board with his legislation. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., is the most high-profile holdout on the bill.

A spokesperson for Sinema's office told Fox News Digitial that the senator is waiting for the Byrd Bath process to conclude before she decides on the bill. The Byrd Bath is when the Senate parliamentarian combs through the legislation to ensure all of its provisions conform with the Byrd Rule, which governs reconciliation bills. It requires that elements of the bill be fiscal in nature, and not pure policy matters.

Sinema and Manchin spoke to each other at length on the Senate floor Thursday.

Also still a holdout is Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. He said Thursday that he is not decided on the bill, and will also wait until the Byrd Bath is over.

Schumer announced Thursday that the Senate is expected to take a procedural vote to begin debate on the reconciliation bill on Saturday afternoon. That likely means that he anticipates the Byrd Bath process will be over by then. It also sets a deadline for any undecideds – particularly Sinema – to come to a decision on whether they will support the legislation.

""I sure hope, you always hope for that,"" Manchin said when asked by Fox News Digital if Democrats will have the bill ready for a vote by Saturday.

"Manchin says he won't support climate, tax provisions in sweeping Democratic bill","Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and his staff told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D, N.Y., unequivocally Thursday that he is only willing to support a reconciliation bill in August that includes a provision to lower prescription drug prices and a two-year extension of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversations.

Manchin was explicit that he won't support a bill before the midterms with any provisions on energy and climate or closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy and biggest corporations, despite his support for those specific things during months of negotiations.

Democrats had hoped to pass a sweeping package to tout during the midterms.

Schumer and Manchin have been negotiating the package for months and the West Virginia moderate had previously said he would be amenable to climate language and tax increases on higher earners in a bill roughly half the size of the $2 trillion social and environmental bill Manchin single-handedly killed last December.

WAPO REPORTER: DELAYING BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL COULD HAVE ‘FATAL, PERMANENT AND GLOBAL’ EFFECTS, BLAME MANCHIN

""Political headlines are of no value to the millions of Americans struggling to afford groceries and gas as inflation soars to 9.1%,"" Manchin spokesperson Sam Runyon said in a statement to Fox News Digital Thursday. ""Senator Manchin believes it’s time for leaders to put political agendas aside, reevaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire.""

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BUILD BACK BETTER BUDGET FIGHT RETURNS, THIS TIME AMID MORE INFLATION

Manchin's demands mean Democrats would probably only be able to produce a far smaller bill that erases the hopes of many in the party to use it to fund clean energy incentives that could begin to help curb global warming.

Previously, Democrats had removed other provisions like paid family leave amid negotiations with Manchin.

His vote is imperative for Democrats to be able to use the budget reconciliation process for the party-line bill, a process that only requires a majority vote rather than the 60-vote filibuster threshold.

Massachusetts Democrat told to step down after abortion comments leave parents irate,"A local Democrat official in Massachusetts is facing calls to step down after complaining about the cost of special education for children with disabilities who are not aborted.

Michael Hugo, the chair of the Framingham Democratic Committee, made the remarks during a city council meeting when discussing a proclamation about access to abortion and crisis pregnancy centers in the city. He said crisis pregnancy centers could misdiagnose a defect in a baby in the womb, leading to them being born and becoming a strain on a school budget. He issued a public apology after 10 days of backlash from members of his own party and parents of special needs children.

""I saw what Michael had said as a personal attack against my own children,"" said Sheryl Goldstein, the chair of the Framingham Disabilities Commission. ""That my children who had special needs were not worth the expense in the school system.""

MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT TOLD TO RESIGN AFTER ABORTION REMARKS LEAVE PARENTS IRATE

In his public apology letter, Hugo called his comments ""offensive and hurtful.""

""I am writing to offer my most sincere and humble apology to members of the Framingham Democratic Committee, but more especially my fellow members of Framingham's disability family community, for comments that I made at the last City Council meeting which were offensive and hurtful,"" he wrote.

He said members of the committee did not ""see or review"" his remarks despite being sent out the night before the meeting.

""Our fear is that if an unqualified sonographer misdiagnoses a heart defect, an organ defect, spina bifida or an encephalopathic defect that becomes a very local issue because our school budget will have to absorb the cost of a child in special education, supplying lots and lots of special services to children, who were born with the defect,"" Hugo said at the Feb. 7 meeting.

Laura Green, a disability advocate in Framingham told Fox News that she does not accept his apology.

""I feel that it was generic and lackluster. I feel like after a statement like that is made, you can’t just pretend that it didn't happen or take it back because it's damaging to a community of people,"" she said. ""The disability community is the only minority group that you can become a part of at any time.""

According to his LinkedIn, Hugo is also the director of policy and government affairs for the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards.

Jon Fetherston, a special needs advocate and registered Republican said he was in disbelief when he heard the comments.

""As a parent of an autistic child, I read those comments and go ‘what?’"" he said. ""A peer of mine thinks that I should’ve aborted my child because he was going to be a burden to a school budget?""

Kristan Hawkins, the mother of two children with cystic fibrosis and the president of Students for Life told Fox News she was deeply offended by Hugo’s comments.

""This is discrimination plain and simple,"" she said. ""I think people who say that the sick cost too much for our society better find the fountain of youth real quick because someday that’s going to be them, it's going to be their family members.""

""This is eugenics, this is eugenics in 2023 America, this is an argument that sadly we’ve heard before and throughout American history, just regurgitated using a bunch of fancy lingo or support for abortion,"" Hawkins added.

In his speech, Hugo said he was ""speaking on behalf of the Framingham Democratic Committee,"" adding that it's their mission to ""work for the common good by promoting racial, ethnic, social, and economic equality for the people of Framingham.""

A speaker that came shortly after Hugo at the meeting denounced him and said he went ""off the rails.""

""I’m a lifetime member of the Democratic Committee, and the person who wanted to represent us went off the rails on a different direction that was never brought before the Democratic Committee,"" said Pat Dunne, a former Framingham School Committee member, according to Framingham Source . ""We’re not talking about eliminating special education students and the like. We’re talking about getting out good information to the people in Framingham. And he’s casting a bit too wide for me and that’s why I did want to say something.""

In a letter sent to city council members several hours before the meeting and obtained by Fox News, Hugo provided a preview of his remarks reported to the Source, asking if the state will ""cover the medical costs for a fetus that had sound medical reason to be terminated.""

He questioned if the state would ""cover the costs of special education for a down syndrome affected child"" and ""pay for the extraordinary medical expense of a child with an atrial septal defect?""

""How much does Framingham’s Public School Department pay for unreimbursed special needs school transportation, specialized education and durable supplies?"" he asked.

Hugo also claimed crisis pregnancy centers' sonographers would likely misdiagnose defects ""while proclaiming that it is a beautiful child living inside the mother and handing her an ultrasound photo that nobody can figure out without training, some diapers and a couple of ‘onesies’ for her new baby.""

Hugo said he and others are working to prevent pro-life crisis pregnancy centers from opening up in Framingham.

Hawkins disputed Hugo’s complaints about crisis pregnancy centers.

PRO-LIFE GROUPS SOUND ALARM ON OHIO ABORTION BALLOT PROPOSAL THEY SAY WILL 'CANCEL THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS'

""Pregnancy care centers offer such excellent free services that even the abortion-supporting community has taken note,"" she said. ""Preventing young mothers from getting free services is a sign that the abortion mindset has poisoned far too many in our culture.""

Goldstein added that due to her leadership position with the disabilities commission, she has received many calls and texts from families with special needs children in the community.

""People are quite frankly very upset,"" she said ""They want action.""

The Framingham Democratic Committee echoed Hugo’s apology in a statement issued last week, claiming his remarks did not reflect the full committee, adding ""we fully disavow and denounce them.""

""If they disavow and do not support those comments, how do you leave him in charge of your organization?"" Fetherston who has a child with autism asked. ""He has an influential position inside the party and if he even thinks that, much less says it in a public meeting, then he shouldn’t be in a leadership position.""

""I think he should immediately step down,"" Fetherston added.

NC Democratic Rep. Butterfield resigns early from Congress,"Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina has resigned early from Congress, his office announced.

Butterfield's resignation comes ahead of his scheduled end of term on Tuesday.

2022 NORTH CAROLINA ELECTION RESULTS

The representative previously announced his intention to retire from public office and did not seek re-election in the midterms.

""It is time for me to retire, and allow the torch to be passed to someone who shares the values of the district, and continue the work I have labored so hard for the past 18 years,"" Butterfield said in November 2021.

NORTH CAROLINA CHURCH DESTROYED BY CHRISTMAS DAY FIRE: 'GOD WILL GET THE GLORY'

At the time of the announcement, Butterfield harshly criticized recent redistricting in his area that transformed the previously solidly Democratic territory into a more competitive race.

""The map that was recently enacted by the legislature is a partisan map. It’s racially gerrymandered. It will disadvantage African American communities all across the 1st congressional district,"" he said at the time.

Nevada far-left fumes after Democratic reps vote to condemn 'horrors of socialism',"Nevada’s Democratic socialists were outraged this month when state Democratic lawmakers from their state voted for a resolution condemning the ""horrors"" of socialism, and the state party refused to condemn them -- one of a number of flashpoints between the progressive left and the more centrist party officials.

The Las Vegas branch of the Democratic Socialists of America took aim at the Nevada State Democratic Party for ""oscillated between playing respectability politics and making compromises to the center,"" even after a slate of progressives gained power in the state party apparatus.

The group was particularly incensed by a bipartisan vote in the U.S. House of Representatives which condemned the ""horrors of socialism"" -- noting the human rights abuses in places such as Cuba, North Korea, and the Soviet Union. The democratic socialists were not impressed by the vote, or the state party’s refusal to condemn the condemnation.

‘SOCIALIST’ BERNIE SANDERS INCINERATED FOR EMBRACING CAPITALISM AHEAD OF BOOK TOUR: ‘FULL OF CRAP’

""The Party… took no stance when every single one of our elected State Representatives proudly voted to condemn ‘the horrors of socialism,’ and indeed continued to do free messaging for the handful of so-called progressive Representatives who insisted that voting against socialism was necessary for passing a progressive agenda,"" they said in the lengthy statement

That, along with a number of other grievances, led the group to conclude that the Democratic Party ""is a dead end.""

""It is a ‘party’ in name only; truly, it is simply a tangled web of dark money and mega-donors, cynical consultants, and lapdog politicians. The establishment is Lucy with the football: no matter how effectively socialists organize for power, the establishment will simply pull the football away, using dirtier and dirtier tricks,"" they say. ""Enough falling for the tricks and even the most dedicated socialist can’t help but give up and play the ugly game. We don’t want milquetoast progressive reformist-reforms; we want socialism. We won’t get it by playing the DNC’s games, and we won’t get it by being a mildly obnoxious thorn in their side, either.""

The fiery statement comes amid an ongoing feud between the progressive democrats in the state and the more centrist machine built by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

NEW YORK DEMOCRATS IN CHAOS WITH PROGRESSIVE LEFT CALLING STATE PARTY NEARLY AS UNDEMOCRATIC AS 'NORTH KOREA'

Politico on Saturday published a deep-dive into the left’s issues in the state after supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took over the party two years ago.

The outlet reported how even Sanders himself is upset with party chair Judith Whitmer as she faces criticism for allegedly abandoning her progressive principles and failing to build a grassroots infrastructure.

""The senator is pretty disappointed in Judith’s chairmanship, specifically around her failure to build a strong grassroots movement in the state,"" a person familiar with Sanders’ thinking told the outlet. ""A lot of us feel sad about what could have been. It was a big opportunity for Bernie-aligned folks in the state to prove some of the folks in the establishment wrong. And that hasn’t happened.""

Whitmer, meanwhile, defended her record, saying she was elected to make change and deliver that change within political realities — something she says her critics on the left are not interested in.

""They really did not want to do electoral politics,"" she said. ""They wanted to work outside of the current electoral system. As the state party chair, I can’t do that. I can’t work outside of the system itself. I represent the Democratic Party. I don’t represent the [Democratic Socialists of America.]""

"New York City, Chicago plead for federal aid as Democratic governor joins migrant bussing train","Leaders of Democratic-run major cities are pleading for President Biden to provide federal aid as migrants continue to flow into their jurisdictions from border states.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams expressed outrage this week after Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced plans to transport migrants to New York, echoing programs from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Adams says his city is currently working to house some 30,000 migrants.

""One time we had to deal with Republican governors sending migrants to New York. Now we’re dealing with Democratic governors sending migrants to New York,"" Adams said at a Wednesday press conference.

What’s callous is how we have been ignored as a city. And now I have to make tough decisions on the resources of New York … it is time for the federal government to step up,"" he added.

BIDEN ADMIN FACING THIRD YEAR OF CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH UNCERTAIN IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN 2023

Polis argues he is not emulating the programs of his Republican counterpart, saying the increase in migrant transports is due to a backlog caused by the severe winter storm that struck much of the U.S. just before Christmas.

The mayors of Chicago and Washington, D.C. have also been demanding federal assistance since the fall, however. City officials have been in contact with the White House throughout the latter half of 2022, according to Politico. The mayors seek direct funding and the ability to transfer migrants elsewhere, among other things.

""We need federal support, resources, communication and collaboration,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in September. ""And that has to come in short order.""

DENVER MAYOR DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER ARRIVAL OF MIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN BORDER: ‘AN IMMENSE STRAIN’

Biden's administration has lauded significant immigration funding included in the 2023 budget, but the president has rarely addressed tech issues directly. Republican governors first began bussing migrants in an attempt to force America's leaders in powerful cities to confront the reality of the ongoing immigration crisis.

The U.S. has seen record-breaking border crossings throughout Biden's tenure, and especially in the final months of 2022. The White House long sought to dismiss the surge as an annual occurrence, but historical data shows the current crisis is far beyond traditional yearly surges.

Biden announced plans on Thursday to visit the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in his presidency. The White House also unveiled a handful of policies aimed at stemming the flow at the border. They include expanding a humanitarian parole program for Venezuelan nationals to include Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans, as well as increasing refugee resettlements.

'What am I doing in the Democratic Party?': NY Councilman announces exit from Democratic Party to join GOP,"Ari Kagan, a council member from Brooklyn, officially announced his exit from the Democratic Party for the GOP.

""Every month I found myself, like, ‘What am I doing in the Democratic Party?’"" Kagan said during a Monday news conference announcing his switch. ""It’s not about numbers or an election. It’s about [sending] a message.""

""The Democratic Party in New York was moving to [the] left at such a speed I couldn’t keep up,"" Kagan urged. ""It’s not me leaving the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party very quickly started to leave me.""

WEST VIRGINIA STATE SENATOR LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR THE GOP

Kagan cited surging New York crime as one of the primary reasons he decided to make the party switch.

""I believe right now, the Democratic Party is doing everything possible in New York City to make everybody less safe,"" the councilman said.

Kagan currently represents parts of Coney Island, Gravesend and Sea Gate.

TULSI GABBARD LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, DENOUNCES IT AS ‘ELITIST CABAL’

Along with the party switch, Kagan is also planning to compete in the 2023 general for Democrat Council Member Justin Brannan's seat in the newly redrawn 47th council district, according to the New York Daily News, which first reported on the change in affiliation.

Brannan posted a photo of the two council members together in an apparent dig after the reports of Kagan leaving the Democratic Party emerged. Brannan previously endorsed Kagan before the 2021 election, but now the two will reportedly go head-to-head next fall.

Kagan did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment regarding the switch.

New York Democrats in chaos with progressive left calling state party nearly as undemocratic as 'North Korea',"Progressive New York Democrats have had enough of party leadership and are demanding the removal of the party chief and reforms to the entire apparatus after a disastrous 2022 midterm cycle for the state.

Four U.S. House seats in New York flipped from Democratic control in the 2022 midterms, greatly contributing to Republicans retaking the majority. But progressive activists see the problems as far deeper than one election.

""First of all, they have to run the party democratically,"" George Albro, co-chair of Brooklyn Progressive Action Network, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""The Democratic Party has to become democratic. Right now, it vies with North Korea in their degree of democracy.""

Much of the ire is directed at state party Chairman Jay Jacobs, who has faced numerous calls to step down as party leader since November.

DESANTIS KICKS OFF PRO-POLICE TOUR IN DEMOCRAT-RUN CITIES AS WHITE HOUSE RUMORS SWIRL

Jacobs has a history of separating himself from the far left, particularly those aligned with Democratic Socialists of America, but more moderate Democrats are joining calls for his ouster, according to Albro.

Albro's Progressive Action Network originated in support of democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns and has grown into a nationwide grassroots organization.

More than 1,000 state Democrats, including dozens of elected state officials, signed a letter in November saying Jacobs, whom they see as indelibly linked to disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has to go.

""Here in New York, however, the State Democratic Party, led by Cuomo appointee Jay Jacobs, failed to commit the time, energy and resources necessary to maintain our deep-blue status: 4 Congressional seats flipped to Republican control, and Governor Hochul won by a slim majority — the smallest in two decades,"" the letter states. ""The writing is on the wall and has been for some time: Jay Jacobs is not fit to serve as Chair of the State Democratic Party.""

In a dig at Jacobs' party operation, the Brooklyn-based Independent Neighborhood Democrats pointed out that the left-wing ""Working Families Party seemed to have been the only party putting organizers in the field to support Democratic Party candidates.""

In a resolution calling for him to resign or be removed as party chair, the group also blamed Jacobs for losing three Democratic-held state Senate seats in his home county of Nassau, where he also serves as the county Democratic Party chairman.

Jacobs, who did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, has been open about his disagreements with the left wing of the Democratic Party and placed some of the blame for midterm losses on progressives.

""New York did underperform, but so did California,"" Jacobs told City & State last year. ""What do those two states have in common? Well, governmentally, we’re among the two most progressive states in the country.""

Jacobs vowed to never endorse a socialist Democratic candidate because he doesn't agree with what they stand for.

""I will never endorse a DSA candidate running for office. I know what they stand for, and I totally disagree with many of those things. I’m not comfortable endorsing someone running on that platform, and I won’t do it as an individual and I won’t do it as a party chair,"" Jacobs told Crain's New York Business last week.

""I don’t hold any animus. I don’t believe anything other than they have every right and even obligation to represent their views as best as they can. I just wish there wasn’t so much rancor.""

In a 10-page report detailing why he believes Democrats lost seats in the midterms, Jacobs pointed out that the Republican Party's emphasis on crime in the midterms was a winning message.

""NY was one of the only states where Republicans, though unfairly, could point to a specific action taken by Democrats (""Cashless Bail"") as the reason for the spike in crime. Unfair and untrue as it may be, in New York, Republicans were able to successfully weaponize Bail Reform to a degree unmatched anywhere else,"" Jacobs wrote In a 10-page report detailing why he believes Democrats lost seats in the midterms.

Albro views the insinuation that progressive policies cost Democrats at the ballot box as only part of the story. The issue was a ""red herring"" in the election, he said, since ""crime is on the increase throughout the entire country, not just in New York.""

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS IN HOT WATER WITH HIS PARTY FOR SAYING ‘WOKE’ DEMOCRATS DRIVE AWAY MINORITY VOTERS

""The Democrats completely mishandled that issue [of crime]. They either tacitly agreed with it or didn't respond to it,"" Albro said, adding that he views Republicans as promoters of crime because of their stances on firearms and the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Chief among Albro's complaints about his party's operations is a proxy system that has rankled New York Democrats for years. In 2018, the system allowed a Brooklyn County party official to overrule a record number of meeting attendees over multiple votes because he held more proxy votes than the record number of Democrats who showed up to a meeting, The New York Times reported that year.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul backed Jacobs as calls for his resignation mounted after the midterm elections.

""I think he [Jacobs] did a great job as chair, and he continues as chair. We’re not changing anything,"" Hochul said.

Though Albro called on Hochul, as the top Democrat, to come out against Jacobs, he said changing the leadership of the party alone won't be enough.

""That's necessary, but not sufficient. It has to be part of a reform movement that reforms the party, democratizes it, and gets young people involved,"" Albro said.

At a state party meeting later this year, Albro said he expects ""there's going to be a movement to elect (someone) else.""

"Outgoing Tennessee Democrat congressman says party 'facing extinction' in his state, relying on 'blind hope'","Outgoing Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee sat down for an interview with a local newspaper on Tuesday to give his thoughts on upcoming elections and the future of the Democratic Party in his state.

Cooper's predictions were far from optimistic, as he said that the party is ""facing extinction"" in Tennessee and claimed that Democrats have no strategy to appeal to rural voters.

CORI BUSH WON'T DROP 'DEFUND THE POLICE' SLOGAN EVEN THOUGH DEMS FEAR IT'S POISON AT THE POLLS

""As usual, Democrats are not alert to future dangers,"" Cooper lamented to the Nashville Scene. ""The biggest danger we face in an off-year election after we won the White House is the 100-year trend toward the other party. Redistricting is small potatoes compared to that historical trend.""

Asked if he believed the Democrats would prove competitive in the long term, Cooper said that he hopes so, but ""hope is not a strategy."" Cooper criticized the management of the party in his state, and told the Scene that the Democrats in Tennessee needed a new direction.

""Their strategy is blind hope,"" Cooper said. ""Many of the folks you’re probably listening to have probably never visited these counties. They’re not kin to these folks. Their best friends don’t live out there. I had the advantage of being born in Nashville but raised in Shelbyville.""

Cooper insisted that while he is retiring from office at the end of his term, he does not plan to stop working. He expressed interest in assisting the party if possible, but said he is more focused on his own endeavors.

""I always want to be available and helpful, but I plan on getting a job and being a productive citizen. It can’t be handed to you. You’ve got to study it and work at it and be good at it. And then we can put on some finishing touches. There are many people today who want this stuff handed to them, and life doesn’t work like that,"" Cooper said. ""It’s important to make money. It’s important to be productive. It’s important to pay taxes. Work organizes life. I plan on working until the day I die, because work is fun, work is interesting, work is important.""

""It’s important to be in communication with your constituents, not to be their boss. You’re their representative. We’ve got to get this formula right. The Democratic Party in Tennessee is basically facing extinction. We’ve been on a long downhill slide for a long time. Tennessee has fewer statewide elected offices than I think any other state, and now the only path upward will be through Memphis, which is not nearly as successful as Nashville. That fits Republican strategy very well. Their intent is to ghettoize the state Democratic Party.""

Cooper has clashed repeatedly with more progressive and left-wing Democrats. In fact, some within the party have attempted to remove him from office with a replacement of their own.

Odessa Kelly, a progressive candidate backed by Justice Democrats, sought to defeat Cooper in 2020. She boasted endorsements from key Democrats, but had a history of inflammatory social media posts, including calls for violence against Republican lawmakers.

Kelly, while staging the primary challenge against Cooper, went on Facebook the day of President Biden's inauguration and posted a list of suggested agenda items for the new administration's first 100 days.

The agenda included standard Democratic wishes for stimulus checks, packing the Supreme Court and student loan forgiveness, as well as jokes about attacking GOP leaders.

Progressive group preemptively blames Manchin for likely Democratic losses in midterms,"A prominent progressive political group is preemptively blaming Sen. Joe Manchin for any losses that Democrats may endure this midterm cycle.

Even before polls closed on Tuesday, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) lashed out at the West Virginia Democrat for having delayed President Biden's agenda last year.

""Candidates up and down the ballot — from progressive to more conservative — were hurt by Joe Manchin’s stalling of the Democratic economic agenda for an entire year,"" said Adam Green, the PCCC's co-founder. ""Manchin owes all Democrats and the country an apology.""

The comments come as polling ahead of Election Day showed Republicans surging and Democrats struggling in the shadow of Biden's low job approval numbers. They also underscore the pivotal role that Manchin has played on Capitol Hill over the past two years in a 50-50 Senate.

Shortly after Biden took office, Democrats began working on a massive spending bill, named Build Back Better. The legislation proposed an ambitious overhaul of the nation's economy and climate energy infrastructure.

Given widespread GOP opposition the legislation only's path to passage was via a party-line process known as budget reconciliation. That iteration of the bill died within the 50-50 Senate amid Manchin's fears it would exacerbate 40-year high inflation.

The West Virginia Democrat reversed course this year after getting sufficient concessions from Schumer and whittling the bill down from its initial $3.5 trillion price tag to roughly $700 billion.

Green, whose group has raised nearly $2 million for progressive candidates, said that Manchin's tactics had prevented vulnerable Democrats from having accomplishments to run until late in the cycle.

Republican George Santos flips Democratic House seat in New York,"New York Republican George Santos flipped New York’s 3rd Congressional district Wednesday and secured another House seat for the GOP.

Santos defeated Democratic Robert Zimmerman, who was vying to fill the Long Island seat after Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi announced he would be retiring to take a stab at New York governor.

Suozzi came in a distant third in the Democratic primaries in the governor’s race, but Santos secured his place in Congress by running on cutting taxes, boosting border security and rallying against cashless bail.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

The Associated Press called the race shortly after 1:30 a.m. once the Republican held a lead of 54.2% of the vote over Zimmerman’s 45.8%, with 90% of the votes already counted.

The Santos-Zimmerman race was the first time two openly gay men ran against each other in a congressional election.

Santos took to Twitter to champion his success and said, ""We did it! NY03 has spoken!""

""I promised one thing throughout this entire campaign: to be your champion in DC,"" he added. ""Thank you for this opportunity to be your voice.""

Republicans have looked to pick up seats anywhere they can in the House in what some said would be a ""red wave"" in the lead up to the elections.

Retention issues? Political strategists weigh in on recent departures from the Democratic Party,"Several elected Democrats — despite a great deal of success in the 2022 midterm cycle — have chosen to end their affiliation with the Democratic Party in recent weeks, raising concern over whether the party may be suffering from a retention problem as political divides continue to widen in the United States.

From all levels of government — local, state and federal — elected officials once labeled Democrats announced after the recent midterm elections they would be switching parties or becoming independent voices in their respective roles.

Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has refused to fall in line with other Democrats on key issues, announced Friday in an op-ed for the Arizona Republic that she was leaving the Democratic Party and had registered as an independent, citing increasingly partisan interests and radicalization of both political parties as the reason for her departure.

Sinema isn't the only elected leader who recently made the decision to ditch the Democratic Party. Last week, New York City Councilman Ari Kagan, who was elected to the council in 2021 as a Democrat, announced he would be exiting the party to become a Republican. In West Virginia, state Sen. Glenn Jeffries announced earlier this month he was forgoing his affiliation with the party to join the GOP.

With the recent departures, the question has been raised whether the party is facing retention issues after Democrats maintained control of the Senate and narrowly lost the House. But strategists from both sides of the aisle appear divided over the reasoning why some elected officials have decided to abandon the party.

Acknowledging that ""both parties have challenges,"" Kevin Seifert, who served as chief of staff to former GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan , told Fox he believes ""Democrats have an ideological problem because of their woke, progressive base.""

""Progressive activists literally chased Sen. Sinema into a bathroom when she wouldn’t agree to their policy demands on immigration,"" Seifert said. ""In recent cycles, they systematically primaried moderate Democrats who didn’t toe the far-left line. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that leaders are responding to these overt pressure tactics by leaving the party and becoming independents.""

In announcing his decision to part ways with the Democratic Party last week, Kagan, a New York City council member from Brooklyn, said at a news conference, ""The Democratic Party in New York was moving to [the] left at such a speed I couldn’t keep up.

""It’s not me leaving the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party very quickly started to leave me.""

Despite the recent shakeups within the party, some Democratic strategists conclude the departures have nothing to do with the success of the party and that Sinema's recent exit has to do with her logic in winning the next election.

""I don’t think this has anything to do with retention issues,"" Jessica Tarlov, a Democratic strategist who serves as the head of research for Bustle, told Fox News Digital. ""Sinema made a strategic decision to avoid a primary that she would’ve lost to [Democrat Rep. Ruben] Gallego.

""As an independent, she knows that a three-way race would be handed to the GOP,"" Tarlov, who also serves as a Fox News contributor, added of Sinema. ""She’s keeping her assignments and caucusing with Dems, votes with Biden 90%-plus. This isn’t about a problem with Democrats.""

Similarly, Sarah Norman, a Democratic strategist who served as senior adviser to digital for Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign, told Fox she believes Sinema's decision to leave the party came because she ""was going to lose a primary and is trying to blackmail Democrats into functionally letting her run for re-election alone.""

""If Democrats had lost badly, Sinema could have pushed to say that only she can win in Arizona in current conditions,"" Norman added. ""We saw in 2022 that Arizona is totally winnable by a normal Democrat, which means any argument she had in a primary is gone.""

In announcing her leave from the Democratic Party, Sinema, who has represented Arizona in the Senate since January 2019, wrote in the Friday op-ed, ""When politicians are more focused on denying the opposition party a victory than they are on improving Americans’ lives, the people who lose are everyday Americans.

""That’s why I have joined the growing numbers of Arizonans who reject party politics by declaring my independence from the broken partisan system in Washington. I registered as an Arizona independent. ""

While he didn't go into much detail as to why he was switching parties, Jeffries, who represents parts of Putnam and Kanawha counties in the West Virginia state Senate, said, ""Our politics have gotten so personal and difficult"" when he announced his departure from the party early this month.

""I have the greatest respect for the many friends and supporters I have been blessed with during my time in public office,"" he added. ""I hope to continue and strengthen those relationships going forward.""

Discussing Sinema's decision, Seifert said he believes the senator, along with other former Democrats, are ""positioning themselves differently"" in an effort to appeal to the desires of Americans who seek unity among the two major political parties.

""Most Americans want elected leaders working on a bipartisan basis to solve problems and, because progressive Democrats have seemingly no interest in doing this, Sen. Sinema and others are smartly positioning themselves differently,"" he said. ""They should be applauded for putting their constituents first, rather than kowtowing to the Democratic Party’s loudest and most extreme voices.""

"Sanders slams Sinema as ‘corporate Democrat,’ legislative saboteur after Arizona senator leaves Dem party","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Sunday blasted newly registered Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona as a ""corporate Democrat"" and a saboteur of Democratic legislation after she ditched the Democratic Party last week.

Sanders said that Sinema ""has her reasons"" when asked about her decision to leave the Democratic Party during an appearance on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""

""I happen to suspect that it's probably a lot to do with politics back in Arizona, I think, or the Democrats there are not all that enthusiastic about somebody who helped sabotage some of the most important legislation that protects the interests of working families and voting rights and so forth,"" the democratic socialist said.

Sanders continued to excoriate Sinema over how she voted on Democrats’ legislation when asked if she has the ""guts"" to take on powerful special interests.

""She is a corporate Democrat who has, in fact, along with Sen. [Joe] Manchin, sabotaged enormously important legislation,"" Sanders said of Sinema.

The former presidential candidate said he may even back a Democratic challenger should one be nominated to go against Sinema in 2024.

Sen. John Fetterman hospitalized after 'feeling lightheaded' at Senate Democratic retreat,"S⁠⁠en. John Fetterman has been hospitalized overnight following lightheadedness he experienced at a Senate retreat Wednesday.

""Towards the end of the Senate Democratic retreat today, Senator John Fetterman began feeling lightheaded,"" a statement from his office read.

The office said Fetterman, D-Pa., was in ""good spirits and talking with his staff and family.""

The hospitalization does not appear to be related to his previous stroke, the statement added.

Sinema's exit from Democratic Party opens the door for a GOP pickup — Could she run as a Republican?,"Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced her departure from the Democratic Party to become an Independent on Friday morning. The move made headlines, though many Democrats, and Sinema herself, don't see her defection as particularly surprising.

An unabashed centrist and staunch defender of the filibuster, Sinema has exercised outsized influence in the Senate throughout her first term. Sinema’s propensity to rein in the Biden agenda has earned the senator blowback from some in the Democratic Party .

The Arizona Senator will not state publicly if she will seek re-election in 2024, but her defection removes the threat of a possible primary challenge from another Democrat.

Sinema has so far said that she will not caucus with Republicans and her voting behavior will not change; however, Republicans could still renew efforts to recruit Sinema into the GOP's camp in the meantime.

ARIZONA SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, REGISTERS AS INDEPENDENT

In late 2021, Senate Minority Whip John Thune told Newsweek that he has tried to court Sinema multiple times in the past. The South Dakota Senator did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on if they will renew these efforts.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a potential successor to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has remained vague on the matter, saying he would be surprised if Republicans mounted a serious challenge to Sinema in 2024, in an interview with Politico last year.

Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton invited Sinema to ""dip her toe in the Republican Party's pool"" in an interview on Fox & Friends Friday morning. Cotton noted that he has welcomed Sinema to join the GOP various times throughout her term in office.

LIBERALS THROW A TANTRUM AFTER SINEMA LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Republicans don't have a clear front-runner in the Arizona U.S. Senate race; however, Kari Lake, one of the most well-known Republicans in the state, could be a potential contender given her narrow loss in Arizona's gubernatorial race. Some have also floated Lake as a possible running mate on the Trump 2024 presidential campaign.

Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who has expressed dissatisfaction with Sinema in the past, is widely expected to enter the Democratic primary for Sinema's seat, though the congressman has not announced a bid.

Who's next? Six Democratic senators who may retire ahead of a potentially brutal 2024 election,"Several Senate Democrats may be considering retiring rather than face a potentially bruising 2024 re-election campaign.

While Democrats performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, the 2024 election cycle – where Democrats will be defending seats in several battleground states – could have a far different outcome.

In what could be the first of many similar announcements, Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow announced last week she will not seek re-election in 2024. Stabenow's decision to conclude her decades-long Senate career in 2025 provides Republicans with a pickup opportunity.

Democrats will be defending 23 of the 34 Senate seats up for grabs next cycle. Of their 23 seats up for election, seven are in states won by former President Trump in either 2016 or 2020. Republicans, however, will not be defending any seat in a state won by President Biden, unlike the 2022 midterms where the most competitive races were in states Biden won: Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona.

DEMOCRAT SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW ANNOUNCES SHE WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION IN 2024

From Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, political prognosticators are wondering if some Democrats could soon announce a retirement from the chamber.

Here are six senators who may decide to step down rather than face the risk losing in a 2024 election map that favors Republicans:

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin

Sen. Joe Manchin, perhaps the most vulnerable senator in 2024, has not yet announced his re-election intentions. Trump won the state by a whopping 39 percentage points in the 2020 election, making this seat ripe for a Republican pickup.

Manchin played an instrumental role in getting the Inflation Reduction Act across the finish line and may face a political price for his perceived capitulation in a predominantly working-class state with one of the leading coal industries in the nation.

IS JOE MANCHIN NEXT? STRATEGISTS SAY THE WEST VIRGINIAN ISN’T ABOUT TO LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

Rep. Alex Mooney, the five-term West Virginia congressman, announced his intent to run for the Senate seat just a week after the midterm elections.

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has also been eyeing Manchin’s seat for some time and hinted he was considering running again. After a narrow loss to Manchin in the state’s 2018 Senate race by just 3 percentage points, Morrisey said in November he is ""seriously evaluating"" a gubernatorial run or launching a second bid for the Senate in 2024.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who at age 89 is the oldest-serving senator, has not announced whether she will seek re-election in 2024.

Following a 10-year reign as the mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein lost a bid to become governor of California in 1990 but later won a 1992 special election to the Senate.

Feinstein is widely expected to announce in the coming months that she won't seek another term in office. Even though she has not announced her intentions, other Democrats are lining up to take her place.

In a video clip shared to social media Tuesday, Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., announced that she is entering the Golden State's 2024 Senate race.

THESE SENATORS FACE THE MOST TROUBLE GETTING RE-ELECTED IN 2024

""We're living through a time of extraordinary change. … Change can be electrifying and exhilarating, but change can also be disruptive – like the constant assault on our democracy and the dangerous imbalance in our economy,"" said Porter, who represents California's 47th Congressional District.

Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine

Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who once ran for vice president as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016, won re-election to his seat in 2018 with 57% of the vote.

But after Virginia elected Gov. Glenn Youngkin – flipping the governor's mansion in 2021 – the state looks less like a sure thing for Democrats to hold the Senate seat.

Youngkin, though he has not made any announcement about future plans, has been floated as a potential candidate for Kaine's seat in 2024.

Though Kaine said he intended to run again as recently as August, Democrats in Virginia have begun speculating that the senator may retire instead, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported last week. When asked about why Democrats seemed nervous about him dropping out of another Senate run, Kaine told the paper, ""They know I haven’t made up my mind yet.""

Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin

Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has served as the junior senator from Wisconsin since 2013, has not declared whether she will seek re-election in the state won by Trump in 2016 by less than a percentage point.

Following the state's 2022 Senate election, in which Sen. Ron Johnson defeated Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes by a little more than 25,000 votes, Baldwin, should she seek re-election, would be faced with a number of concerns from conservative voters in the state.

Baldwin, the first openly gay senator in the United States, has garnered respect from members of her own party in a variety of ways, most notably from her work on the Affordable Care Act. In her last two Senate elections, Baldwin won by unexpected margins. In 2012, she won by nearly six percentage points. In 2018, she won by a little more than 10 points.

Johnson's win over Barnes has boosted momentum in the state for both major political parties, and now the GOP is seeking to build on that momentum in an effort to oust Baldwin, who formerly served in the U.S. House for six years.

Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester

Sen. Jon Tester, the three-term Democratic senator from Montana, is up for re-election in 2024. Tester has said his final determination on whether to run again would come early this year, and he told MSNBC's Chuck Todd he ""feels good about his chances"" in a December interview.

Tester's seat is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrat-held seats in 2024. Montana overwhelmingly voted for Trump by 16 points in 2020 and saw a string of GOP victories in the 2022 midterm elections.

Rep. Matt Rosendale, who has represented Montana’s 2nd Congressional District since 2021, ran for Senate against Tester in 2018 and lost by a narrow margin. Rosendale has communicated interest in a rematch with Tester but has not announced whether he will run.

VULNERABLE MONTANA SENATOR WON'T COMMIT TO RE-ELECTION BID: 'RETIRE OR LOSE' SAYS STATE GOP

Rep. Ryan Zinke, elected to Montana’s 1st Congressional District in 2022, has also hinted interest in the seat but will decide on a Senate run some time in 2023, he said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey

Sen. Bob Casey announced last week that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in December, casting concern over whether he will seek re-election in 2024.

Despite the diagnoses and concern over how it could have an impact on his congressional career, Casey, who has served in the Senate since 2007, said he will undergo surgery in the next few months and that treatment for his condition will not interrupt his service in the Senate .

Casey, the son of former Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey Sr., defeated his GOP challenger, Lou Barletta, in the 2018 Senate election by 13 points.

Following Republican nominee Mehmet Oz's loss in the state's 2022 Senate election to Democrat John Fetterman, Republicans are seeking redemption. David McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO who narrowly lost the GOP primary to Oz, is considering another run, according to a November report from Bloomberg.

Casey has not declared whether he will seek re-election.

"South Dakota's last Democratic governor, Harvey Wollman, dies at age 87","Harvey Wollman, who 45 years ago became the last Democratic governor of South Dakota, has died. He was 87.

Wollman died of natural causes Tuesday at a hospital in Huron, his son, Mike, told The Associated Press.

Harvey Wollman had a short stint as governor. He was serving as South Dakota’s lieutenant governor in 1978 when Gov. Richard Kneip was appointed U.S. ambassador to Singapore. Wollman's gubernatorial term lasted five months because he had already been defeated in the 1978 Democratic primary election by Roger McKellips prior to assuming office.

SOUTH DAKOTA INMATE CAUGHT WITHIN 10 MINUTES OF ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE

Republican Bill Janklow defeated McKellips for governor in the 1978 general election, starting the run of GOP control.

""He worked hard for people and politically it didn’t work out for him as well as he had hoped, but boy, he loved his side of the state with all his heart,"" Mike Wollman said of his father.

SOUTH DAKOTA GORGE FULL OF DOZENS OF CLASSIC CARS IS ONE MAN'S DREAM

Wollman was born on March 14, 1934, in Frankfort, South Dakota, and grew up on his family farm in Spink County, where he lived in the same house with his wife of 63 years, Anne.

A 1953 graduate of Doland High School, Wollman became motivated for public service by another Doland grad, Hubert H. Humphrey. As senior class president, Wollman was called upon to shepherd Humphrey around during a school reunion and was ""really inspired by his style and his politics and his leadership,"" Mike Wollman said.

Top Democratic prosecutors revolt against criminal justice reform law they say will 'destroy' Illinois,"A Democratic prosecutor in the Chicago-area is sounding the alarm over a criminal justice reform law that will ""tie the hands"" of prosecutors and ""destroy the criminal justice system in Illinois.""

The Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, signed by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., in 2021, will implement sweeping reforms to Illinois’ criminal justice system, though it has drawn criticism from law enforcement professionals across the political spectrum.

""I never, in my 40-years in this profession, ever thought I'd ever see anything close to this,"" Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""The intent of this law is to destroy the criminal justice system in Illinois, and I'm not going to let that happen.""

AMERICA'S 'MOST DANGEROUS' LAW? ILLINOIS CANDIDATE WARNS OF 'ANARCHY' AFTER CRIMINAL JUSTICE OVERHAUL

The law includes numerous provisions that proponents say will improve public safety in Illinois and make the state's criminal justice system more equitable.

Critics of the law take issue with some of those provisions, including ending cash bail; prohibiting judges from considering a defendant's previous behavior when determining whether he or she is a flight risk; allowing a 48-hour period between the time a defendant on electronic monitoring leaves home without permission and the time authorities can charge that person with escape; and new police training policies without additional funding for departments.

Glasgow is suing Pritzker and the Illinois attorney general in hopes of preventing the law from going into effect in January.

Glasgow, one of the most high-profile state prosecutors to come out against the SAFE-T Act, is joined by 100 of 102 Democratic and Republican state's attorneys in Illinois who oppose the law.

ILLINOIS SAFE-T ACT: FORMER CHICAGO-AREA POLICE CHIEF, PROSECUTOR SOUND ALARM OVER FAST-TRACKED SAFETY LAW

Under the SAFE-T Act, second-degree murder, aggravated assault, drug offenses, intimidation, carjacking, and arson will not be detainable offenses unless the suspect is proven to be a flight risk or risk to public safety.

The standards to prove ""willful flight"" in these instances have also been raised to unrealistic standards, according to Glasgow, further reducing the chance of detaining individuals on these charges.

There are over 600 inmates in the Will County jail, however under Pritzker's recent law, about half of these inmates will be released on day one of it going into effect, according to Glasgow, with the remaining half released 90-days later.

""Have you ever heard of any government passing a law to release everyone in their jails? No one has ever done that before, and no one would ever think to do that,"" Glasgow went on. "" That would be suicide.""

Glasgow said that the greatest ""fallacy"" of this new law is that felony defendants will still be detained, pointing out that prosecutors will be required to take cases to trial within 90 days, otherwise defendants are released — a task he said is virtually impossible given the complexity of many legal cases.

The Will County state's attorney has been public that he is not against bail reform, often pointing to New Jersey as a successful model of modernizing the cash bail system without increases in violent crime rates, however he believes the SAFE-T Act is not the correct course of action.

""The bottom line is there has to be a balance,"" Glasgow said. ""And when someone crosses a line, with regards to violent crime, that has to be addressed aggressively in order to prevent that person from harming other people.""

Parson added that ""$30 is the floor,"" and called on people to reflect on why they ""punch down on poor people"" while praying to ""Saint Elon.""

""1 adult supporting 1 kid needs $30 an hour across the country. Rural, urban, suburban: $30 is the floor. As you say your nightly prayers to Saint Elon while you fall asleep tonight, reflect on why you punch down on poor people instead of up at your heavenly billionaire,"" she added.

""Nobody should be poor in the richest country on Earth,"" she added.

Parson joined the Democratic Socialists of America after Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her bid to join the U.S. House of Representatives.

Parson lost Washington's nonpartisan primary election for the 6th Congressional District seat in 2020, gaining a share of just 13.5% of the total vote, which translates to 35,631 votes.

Rep. Derek Klimer, D-Wash., by comparison, won the primary election by receiving a total vote share of 47.3%, which translates to 125,019 votes. He went on to win the general election.

Parson told Fox News that she's calling for a $30 federal minimum wage because a $15 minimum wage ""is no longer commensurate with real-world conditions.""

""I'm calling for a federal minimum wage of $30, because that's the floor across the country for one working adult to be able to support one child. From rural to urban to suburban areas in the Northeast, South, Midwest, Southwest, West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii, the federal minimum wage isn't enough to support a family, and neither is $15 an hour. The Fight for $15 campaign started 10 years ago and the demand is no longer commensurate with real-world conditions,"" Parson said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-state-democratic-socialist-candidate-30-minimum-wage,N/A
WATCH: Warnock voters name surprising choices for Democratic presidential candidates,"Supporters of incumbent Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock have some surprising names they'd like to see at the top of a future Democratic presidential ticket.

Fox News Digital traveled to a Warnock campaign rally in Conyers, Georgia, on Monday and spoke with a number of attendees who praised the job they said he'd been doing representing them in the Senate, and even included him in the list of big-name Democrats they'd like to see eventually take up residence in the White House.

""If Joe Biden want[s] to run, we can give him a shot to run… but as a real progressive I want to see Warnock to run in 2028,"" Flavien Shirandi told Fox.

Other supporters didn't mention Warnock as a potential presidential candidate despite their enthusiasm about his runoff election against Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker, however some did echo Shirandi's preference for Biden.

HARRIS DODGES WHEN ASKED IF SHE'LL GO TO GEORGIA TO CAMPAIGN FOR WARNOCK

""My little old man Joe Biden. I love him. I don't care what they say. I love Joe Biden, and I will support him if he runs again. Yes,"" Toni, an area resident, told Fox.

""I do feel the same way. He's a little old, but I guess he's doing a good job. So keep it up until the end,"" another resident, Carlos, agreed.

Marilyn, a local nurse, had other Democrats in mind, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 after serving as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

""He is so well-spoken, and he knows where he stands on all of these positions. And I just think that he's wonderful. And of course Bernie [Sanders]. I'll always love Bernie,"" she added.

KEMP, TRUMP THROW SUPPORT BEHIND HERSCHEL WALKER AS GOP UNITES IN PUSH FOR GEORGIA RUNOFF

The supporters who spoke with Fox News Digital made up part of an energized crowed of over 100 attendees hoping to propel Warnock to victory just two weeks ahead of the runoff election. Each of them expressed excitement about the chance to send him back to the Senate for a full six-year term, and said his work since first being elected in a 2020 special election was what drove them to show up.

""Well I'm a progressive Democrat, OK. I've seen the things that he's done over the last two years, Monday will be my third vote for him, and I'm off work and I'm like, there is nothing better to do on a Monday,"" Marilyn said.

She added that as a nurse, health care was the top issue on her mind as she votes, and that she wanted to see the country move in the direction of universal health care, as well as protecting abortion, Medicare and Social Security.

Toni emphasized Warnock becoming the 51st vote for Democrats in the Senate, while Carlos was convinced more Georgians would show up to vote for Warnock if they knew more about the work he said the senator had been doing for the state.

GEORGIA RUNOFF: TRUMP FACTOR, SHORTENED SCHEDULE POSE CHALLENGES FOR WALKER

""I have to support him. I need him back in the Senate. I need him back in the Senate, and that's why I'm here. 100% I'm backing him up. This is my third time – I voted for him in 2020, and everyday I am going to do my duty,"" Toni said.

""I would like him to be back in the Senate. And I do believe he's doing a good job. But a lot of things he's doing we're not hearing about it. So I guess we should hear more what he's doing. This means more people will support him,"" Carlos said.

""And I agree. You know, he does a lot, and he need[s] to put it out there because him telling what he has done, he has a better chance to get back into the Senate. And we need that 51,"" Toni added.

Toni went on to emphasize the work she said Warnock had done on prioritizing education.

WATCH: WARNOCK RESPONDS TO ALLEGATIONS HE WANTS LAST MINUTE CHANGE TO RUNOFF VOTING RULES

Shirandi, who told Fox he was a naturalized U.S. citizen, said he'd been following Warnock for a long time and was impressed by the story of his personal life and how he became the leader of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.

""I just believe in him,"" Shirandi said. ""He has all my support.""

He added that although he believed in the value of life and the connection between a baby and a mother, he still believed abortion and the option to choose were an important issue, as well as voting rights and the balance of the Supreme Court.

West Virginia state senator leaves Democratic Party for the GOP,"West Virginia state Sen. Glenn Jeffries left the Democratic Party to become a registered Republican this week.

Jeffries, who has represented West Virginia state Senate District 8 since 2016, claimed ""economic development"" as one of the driving reasons he made the party switch.

""I look and see how I can best represent the state of West Virginia and my constituents. I never have been a party person. I've always been able to work together with whomever it may be,"" the new Republican said in an interview with Metro News West Virginia. ""Making this switch is going to help me be more effective as far as recruiting and bringing companies here to this state.""

I WAS A DEMOCRAT WHO WORKED FOR A TEACHERS' UNION, BUT I'M VOTING REPUBLICAN FOR EDUCATION FREEDOM

When questioned on how switching from being a Democrat to a Republican would help West Virginia economics, the state senator said it's because he wants to be part of the economic decisions being made in his state.

Jeffries also confirmed that the paperwork was filed, and his transition to the GOP is official.

TULSI GABBARD LEAVES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, DENOUNCES IT AS ‘ELITIST CABAL’

""Change is difficult,"" the state senator said when asked if he struggled with the decision. ""I had wrestled with this.""

""I have the greatest respect for the many friends and supporters I have been blessed with during my time in public office,"" Jeffries said in a statement. ""I hope to continue and strengthen those relationships going forward.""

According to the Metro News West Virginia report, Tony Hodge, the Putnam County Republican Party chairman and the co-chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, publicly welcomed Jeffries into the GOP.

""I warmly welcome Sen. Glenn Jeffries into the West Virginia Republican Party,"" Hodge said in a statement.

In this year's midterm elections, the GOP built a 30-seat majority in the 34-member Senate. Jeffries' move takes the Republicans' majority to 31.

Who could be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 if 80-year-old Biden bows out?,"President Biden became the oldest serving president on Sunday when he turned 80 — a feat that has some wondering if the octogenarian commander-in-chief should seek re-election in 2024.

While Biden has publicly expressed his ambitions to run for a second term, at least one Democratic strategist said the president should make good on his promise to be a bridge to the next generation of center-left leaders.

""The best thing would be for President Biden to call it a day sooner rather than later so that we can be the party of the next generation--not the expiring generation,"" said Colin Strother, a Democratic political strategist. ""[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi is gone, Mitch McConnell has established he's way behind the times, and there are legitimate concerns about someone of the President's age being able to do this tough job well.""

Here are some of the top options Democrats have if Biden opts to bow out of re-election in 2024:

DEMOCRATS SPLIT ON WHETHER BIDEN'S AGE MAKES HIM TOO OLD FOR WHITE HOUSE OR THE 'TOM BRADY’ OF POLITICS

Vice President Kamala Harris

Harris, as Biden's second in command, is seen as a logical choice for Democrats. The former California senator, 58, is the first female vice president in the nation's history. She is also the first African American and first Asian American to hold the role.

During the 2022 midterms, Harris was a top political surrogate for Democrats. She has also represented the White House at various global summits.

Despite the resume, Harris' 2020 presidential campaign ended before the primaries even took place. Harris is also a polarizing figure for Republicans because of her responsibility in overseeing the surging migrant crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Complicating matters is that Harris's job approval rating is even lower than Biden's, according to the Los Angeles Times.

""She would have the burden and blessings of the Biden administration,"" said Mike Madrid, a consultant who advises both parties and helped found the Never-Trump Lincoln Project. ""But as vice president you get all of the downside without being able to take credit for the accomplishments.""

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg

The transportation secretary was one of the most sought-after surrogates for the national Democratic Party during the recently passed midterms. Buttigieg is also responsible in his official capacity for doling out money from the administration's $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package.

The dual roles have served to raise Buttigieg's profile after his own 2020 presidential bid fizzled out after winning the Iowa Caucuses. Although Buttigieg has denied talk of another White House run, his political action committee has resurfaced in recent months to endorse candidates for state and federal office this cycle.

PETE BUTTIGIEG REGULARLY CONSULTS DARK MONEY-FUNDED GREEN GROUPS, CALENDAR ENTRIES SHOW

Buttigieg's candidacy could face serious obstacles, though. The transportation secretary is like to face a GOP congressional investigation next year over how infrastructure money has been spent. Republicans are also eager to look into Buttigieg's efforts at mitigating a national rail strike and shoring up the supply chain crisis.

The transportation secretary has also faced criticism for taking parental leave last year, while the White House was trying to secure passage of its infrastructure law and dealing with the supply chain crisis.

Sen. Bernie Sanders

Although older than Biden, the 81-year-old Sanders has kept his political operation going after having made two unsuccessful White House bids. The self-described democratic socialist from Vermont was active on the campaign trail in 2022 and has a new book out geared toward younger voters.

While few expect Sanders to make another presidential run, the lawmaker has a deep base of support within the left wing of the Democratic Party. Those grassroots supporters helped propel Sanders to several upsets in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. It also provided the senator with the fundraising efforts needed to mount a campaign, but without being reliant on big-money donors.

Sanders struggled to reach older African American voters, a core constituency for the Democratic Party, in both of his national campaigns.

""Sanders has a high floor and a low ceiling,"" said Strother. ""His irreverence has turned into grouchy old man yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off his lawn. He'll raise money and make noise, but he has no path.""

Rep. Ro Khanna

The California Democrat has been traveling the country in recent months touting his book on dignity in the digital age. Khanna has even put consultants onto his payroll within the early 2024 Democratic nominating contests.

While the lawmaker has ruled out running against Biden, he has made no effort to hide his interest in a White House run in the future. Khanna is little known outside his California district, however.

Democratic Governors Newsom, Whitmer

Outside the national government, Democrats have several popular governors that could mount an effective campaign should Biden rule out another term.

In the swing state of Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won re-election this month by more than 10 percentage points, despite facing a spirited challenge by Republicans. Whitmer also has strong ties to labor unions, a core group that was instrumental in Biden's campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

Outside the Mid-West, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is seen as a potential White House aspirant. Newsom, like Whitmer, was just re-elected by a large margin to a second term.

Newsom has also been active in needling red-state governors over their abortion policies. The governor has spent money in Florida and Indiana in recent months pitching businesses to move to California if they oppose new restrictions on abortion.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-could-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-2024-80-year-old-biden-bows-out,N/A
Why it matters where Sinema caucuses after leaving the Democratic Party,"""I’ve known Richard for such a long time,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of retiring Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""I knew Richard when he was a Democrat. We go back a long way.""

Alabama voters first sent Shelby to Washington in the fall of 1978 as a freshman Democrat to serve in the House. Shelby moved to the Senate as a Democrat in early 1987. He switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican the day after the 1994 midterm elections. Shelby retires in early January as a conservative Republican — although perhaps not as conservative as some GOPers would prefer.

But as Pelosi says, few toiling in Washington these days remember when Shelby was a Democrat.

Shelby’s party switch in 1994 made a splash. Republicans had just flipped the Senate, scoring 52 GOP seats. Shelby’s move made it 53. Former Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., ditched the Democrats a few months later, giving Republicans 54 seats.

OUTGOING ALABAMA SENATOR SAYS BODY ‘LESS COLLEGIAL’ THAN IS WAS 36 YEARS AGO

Shelby’s move the day after the election punctuated the bicameral Republican victories. Not only did it win the Senate, but the GOP seized control of the House for the first time in four decades.

Shelby’s decision to abandon the Democrats didn’t have any practical effect on which party controlled the Senate. However, it did make a statement, emphasizing that Washington was under new management.

""We’ll be happy to accept other applications,"" Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., proclaimed at the press conference welcoming Shelby to the GOP.

CONGRESS ACHIEVES ‘FRAMEWORK’ FOR OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

In short, all party switches are not equal.

That brings us to the recent transmogrification of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz. Sinema quit the Democrats and joined a political ""Switzerland"" occupied by independents Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Angus King, I-Maine. Yet Sinema, Sanders and King aren’t quite ""Switzerland."" They agreed to ""caucus"" with the Democrats.

It’s notable that, like Shelby, Sinema announced her decision to leave the Democrats the day after an election. Sinema departed right after Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., prevailed in a runoff election over Republican challenger Herschel Walker.

Democrats were already assured control of the Senate after Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., won her re-election campaign in mid-November. That guaranteed Democrats of at least 50 seats, and Vice President Harris could still break ties. Warnock’s win meant Democrats would then have 51 seats.

So Sinema waited until the Senate’s landscape was clear before bolting from the Democratic Party. A move prior to Warnock’s win would have called into question which party controlled the Senate. Moreover, it would steal the thunder Democrats needed to win in Georgia.

Therefore, Sinema waited until ""the day after"" to announce her defection. And Sinema still managed to steal thunder from Warnock.

Sinema is always in the middle. Now she’s truly in the middle.

KYRSTEN SINEMA'S SWITCH TO INDEPENDENT DESCRIBED AS ‘GUT PUNCH’ TO DEMOCRATS: ‘NO WIGGLE ROOM’

""Registering as an independent and showing up to work with the title of independent is a reflection of who I've always been,"" Sinema said in a video.

However, Sinema would still ""caucus"" with the Democrats. That meant Democrat retained Senate control.

""It doesn't change the complexion of what our Democratic majority is going to look like in the Senate,"" said White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre.

The key here is the act of ""caucusing."" Sinema indicated she will not caucus with the GOP and will still associate with Democrats.

Each senator notifies the secretary of the Senate as well as the ""secretary for the majority"" and the ""secretary for the minority"" for which team they’ll play.

In 2006, former Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., changed his affiliation from Democrat to ""independent Democrat."" Lieberman’s contrived characterization wasn’t even formally recognized by the Senate. Lieberman technically left the Democratic Party after losing his primary. But Lieberman continued to caucus with the Democrats and won re-election.

That said, a senator could decide not to caucus with either side. That means neither the Democrats nor the Republicans will let you in ""their room.""

""You can have a room. You’re just going to be the only person in it,"" said Casey Burgat who teaches political science at George Washington University.

As they say, you want to be in ""the room where it happens.""

For now, the Democrats are in the majority and control the ""room.""

SINEMA'S EXIT FROM DEMOCRATIC PARTY OPENS THE DOOR FOR A GOP PICKUP – COULD SHE RUN AS A REPUBLICAN?

And, even if Sinema considered formally joining Republicans, it would have been foolhardy for her to leave Democrats and move to the minority.

That’s why Shelby and Campbell essentially rewarded themselves after Democrats lost control of the Senate in 1994. They’d be in the minority if they stuck with the Democrats. But the ol’ switcheroo propelled Shelby and Campbell into the majority when they signed up with Republicans.

In the case of Sinema, she got to enjoy the best of both worlds. She would remain in the majority but put a little bit of real estate between herself and the rest of the Democratic Party.

Sinema’s record with the Democrats was mixed. She provided a key vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act. She was central to engineering passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. But Sinema bucked Democrats when it came to changing the filibuster.

Still, Republicans hope to court Sinema.

""We'd be happy to welcome her into our party,"" said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Fox. ""We're a big tent party.""

Everyone’s eyeing Sinema’s next move.

VOTERS FIRED NANCY PELOSI, SO WHY ARE REPUBLICANS HELPING HER PASS ANOTHER SPENDING BILL?

""I watch Sen. Sinema,"" said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ""She spends a lot of time hanging out in the well of the Senate on the Republican side.""

Lott knows something about senators switching parties.

Lott was Senate Majority Leader in 2001. That’s the last time America had a 50/50 Senate. Republicans began the year in the majority due to the tie-breaking vote of former Vice President Dick Cheney.

But late Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., drifted from the GOP. A few months into 2001, Jeffords left the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Jeffords decided to caucus with the Democrats.

That suddenly meant Democrats had 51 members and Republicans 49. Democrats immediately seized control of the Senate.

Sinema’s switch seemed eerily familiar to Jeffords' move two decades ago.

""This ain't that,"" Burgat said of Sinema’s decision. ""This seems to be a cosmetic change.""

Party control of the Senate didn’t move because Sinema decided to still caucus with the Democrats.

Williamson tells Democrats it’s ‘time to move on’ from Biden as she plans trips to NH and early primary states,"Spiritual adviser and bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson will travel to the early voting states in the Democratic presidential nominating calendar following her expected launch early next month of a primary challenge against President Biden, Fox News has learned.

Williamson, who called for reparations and a Department of Peace as part of her long-shot and unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, declared in a press release last week that she was exploring ""the possibility of running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024.""

""As America gears up for the 2024 presidential election, I’m preparing for an important announcement on March 4th in Washington DC,"" Williamson advertised.

An adviser in the likely White House contender’s political circle told Fox News that Williamson will travel to South Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Nevada after March 4.

GROWING SIGNS BIDEN COULD FACE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY NOMINATING STATE

With many leaders in the Democratic Party from both the establishment and progressive wings saying they will support Biden, who is expected in the coming weeks or months to announce his re-election campaign, Williamson would likely become the first Democrat with a national following to primary challenge the 80-year-old president.

""You can appreciate what the president has done — defeating the Republicans in 2020 — and still feel it is time to move on,"" Williamson said Tuesday in an interview on a New Hampshire news-talk morning radio program.

Williamson told host Jack Heath on ""Good Morning New Hampshire"" that ""many of us, myself included, feel that in order for the Democrats to win in 2024, we’re going to have to be able to offer to the American people something much more than"" what she says Biden is offering.

TRUMP, DESANTIS, PENCE SPOTLIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AS GOP 2024 RACE HEATS UP

During the 2020 cycle, Williamson was an unconventional candidate who preached a politics of love. She emphasized ""six pillars for a season of moral repair,"" including economic justice. She proposed creating a Department of Children and Youths and a Department of Peace, and she pushed for reparations for the descendants of African American slaves. Among her unorthodox acts was holding a meditation session while campaigning in New Hampshire.

However, she struggled with fundraising and failed to qualify for most of the Democrat presidential debates. Days after laying off most of her small staff, Williamson dropped out of the race in January 2020, just ahead of the start of the nomination primaries and caucuses. In late February 2020, she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, who at the time was the front-runner for the nomination. However, the progressive champion from Vermont, who was making his second White House run, was decisively defeated by Biden in South Carolina’s primary at the end of February and in the March contests, and later ended his bid and backed the then-former vice president.

In her Tuesday interview, Williamson pushed for universal health care and a livable wage, free childcare, free college and called for ""a fundamental reform of the economic landscape in this country""

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON TEASES ‘IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT’

Williamson said ""what’s important is that we have a candidate who can win in 2024 and that is by offering the kind of fundamental reform that Bernie Sanders"" has championed throughout his career.

Sources close to Williamson tell Fox News that she has traveled to New Hampshire a handful of times over the past year, and she returned late last week for meetings with progressive leaders and activists in the state.

Her trips to New Hampshire come as no surprise as political strategists have said that if there is going to be a primary challenge against Biden, the Granite State appears to be the state where the action will take place.

New Hampshire, which prides itself on its well-informed electorate and its emphasis on small-scale and grassroots retail politics, has for a century held the first primary in the race for the White House. While Republicans are making no changes to their presidential nominating calendar in the 2024 election cycle, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a new top of the calendar pushed by Biden that upends the traditional schedule.

THE TIME MARIANNE WILLIAMSON LED A MEDITATION SESSION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

New Hampshire will now vote second in the DNC’s calendar, along with Nevada, three days after South Carolina, under the new schedule.

However, Granite State Democrats warn that New Hampshire will still go first — courtesy of a longstanding state law that mandates the leadoff primary position — and that a primary not sanctioned by the DNC, where Biden does not take part, could invite trouble for the president.

""Absolutely you will see me in New Hampshire because what matters is democracy, not just what the DNC decides,"" Williamson stressed on Tuesday. ""The voters should decide who should be the nominee in 2024….The people should be making that decision. Not the DNC.""

Williamson may not be the only challenge to Biden from the left flank of his own party.

Environmental lawyer and anti-COVID vaccine crusader Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will hold an event in New Hampshire early next month. Kennedy, the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of the late President Kennedy, will hold an event on March 3 at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, which for nearly a quarter-century has been a must-stop in the Granite State for potential or actual White House contenders.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/williamson-tells-democrats-time-move-on-biden-plans-trips-nh-early-primary-states,N/A

Tucker Carlson: Tulsi Gabbard's career as a rising Democratic Party star came to a halt after questioning this,"This is a rush transcript of ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on October 11, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.



So, when Tulsi Gabbard won the Democratic Party's primary for a congressional seat in Hawaii 10 years ago, she had effectively won the seat. Hawaii may be the most liberal out of all 50 states. It is a Democratic state, flat-out. It has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in nearly 40 years, so if you get elected as a Democrat in Hawaii, it's not exactly breaking news, it is standard operating procedure.



And yet when Tulsi Gabbard won that primary and then the seat, the Democratic National Party took a deep interest in her, and you can see why.



Here was a smart, appealing 31-year-old who knew what she believed and could explain it fluently. And by the way, she was also an Iraq War veteran.



So, in political terms, Tulsi Gabbard was near-perfect, and they got it immediately. Barack Obama endorsed her right away. Nancy Pelosi called her personally and invited Tulsi Gabbard -- do you remember this -- to speak on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention.



And then when she was sworn into Congress in January, the DNC named Tulsi Gabbard, Vice Chair of the National Party. She had just gotten there, and she was Vice Chair of the DNC.



And then, of course, the media played its prescribed role: If Nancy Pelosi likes you, well so do they. So, fawning profile after fawning profile emerged.



If you lived in Washington at the time, you remember it very well. Here, ladies and gentlemen, the future of the Democratic Party, Tulsi Gabbard. In case you don't remember, here's a selection to jog your memory:



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, 2012: Watch out for the next superstar -- listen, Tulsi Gabbard.



JONES, 2015: Tulsi Gabbard is a rising star in this party. Tulsi Gabbard should be here tonight. The reality is we do not have enough young veterans in this party, enough young women in this party, enough people of color in this party.



CHRIS JANSING, MSNBC, 2016: You're considered a rising star in the Democratic Party. You had a position of leadership in the Democratic National Committee.



LEA GOLDMAN, MARIE CLAIRE MAGAZINE, 2012: Tulsi's story is really, I think, tailormade for Hollywood. I half expect Natalie Portman to be vying for the role any day now because this story is not to be believed.



SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT, 2012: Tulsi Gabbard, she is going to be the one to watch tonight at the DNC.



WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR, 2015: And Tulsi Gabbard, she's an Iraq War veteran. Yesterday she was promoted from Captain to Major in the Hawaii National Guard. So, she certainly is a rising star. The fact that she is not here tonight for whatever reason is unfair.



ANA NAVARRO, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't know, but in a battle, I want her in my trench. I can tell you that.



VAN JONES: Me, too. Me, too.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Did you hear that? She's a rising star. Hollywood is going to make a movie about her. ""I want her in my trench.""



It's pretty hard to believe now, but that was the absolute consensus among Democratic Party sycophants until 2016.



In 2016, as if by command from above, the fawning stopped abruptly, replaced initially by silence, and then by howls of scorned rage.



So, what happened in 2016? Well, Donald Trump was elected President and then a few days later, displaying the independence of spirit that Democrats claim to love in young women, but actually despise more than anything, Tulsi Gabbard decided to talk to the new President about an issue that she cared about, which was US policy towards Syria, a country that, again, Gabbard was virtually alone in pointing out has an awful lot of Christians in it, so maybe we should pay attention.



As she put it at the time, ""I felt it was important to take the opportunity to meet with the President-elect now before the drumbeats of war that neocons have been beating, drag us into an escalation of the war to overthrow the Syrian government."" Woah. We can't say that in Washington. Maybe she didn't know, but they told her, ""Stop, let the adults do it,"" but Gabbard didn't seem to care.



A few weeks later, she went personally to Syria. She was a Member of Congress. You can do that, and she wanted to see conditions for herself and then while she was there, she met with the Syrian President, Bashar al- Assad, and that was it. It was over.



Whether Tulsi Gabbard knew it or not, her career as a rising star within the Democratic Party came to a complete, abrupt and final halt. She had done the one thing you're not allowed to do. She committed the one unforgivable sin, which is to question permanent Washington's foreign policy. You can't do that, and everyone knows it, and if you look around, you can see that no one does do it.



They always tell you how radical Sandy Cortez is, Rashida Tlaib. Would they do that? No way. AOC may be a socialist, but in the end, she is with Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney on Team Raytheon. She does not cross that line because you're not allowed to.



But Tulsi Gabbard -- as someone who had served in the US military, in fact was still serving in the US military, was an elected Member of Congress -- decided, why shouldn't I say what I think? And so she did.



And for doing that, overnight her fellow Democrats accused Tulsi Gabbard, the combat veteran you'd want in your foxhole, of committing treason against the country she was serving.



Hillary Clinton went even farther than that. Speaking of conspiracy nuts, Hillary Clinton, way crazier than Alex Jones ever thought of being, she claimed the Russians were grooming Tulsi Gabbard as some kind of Manchurian candidate.



You want to listen to lunacy? Listen to this:



(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)



HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER US SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's a favorite of the Russians.



(END AUDIO CLIP)



CARLSON: Well, that's just completely whacked. Was she a crisis actor, too? What a lunatic, but no one noticed because everyone was saying it.



""The LA Times,"" which at one point was an actual newspaper, accused Tulsi Gabbard of ""talking like"" a Russian asset, maybe a spy.



So, the years went by and Tulsi Gabbard decided to run for President, still as a Democrat as she had been in her entire time in Congress. She had always been a Democrat, of course, the Vice Chair of the DNC and so she wound up in a presidential debate in October of 2019, and she responded to the smears against her. Watch this:



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TULSI GABBARD, THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ""The New York Times"" and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.



Just two days ago, ""The New York Times"" put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all of these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.



As President, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: Ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like al-Qaeda in Syria who've been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: They called her a Russian asset. Now, that slur is so common that we don't really think of it, but think about it just for a second. This is a transparently patriotic person, an elected Member of Congress who is serving in the US Army, who is also, by the way, one of the nicest people in all of Washington who is making traditionally liberal points about war - - not that all wars are bad or war is never necessary. She has participated in wars personally.



She is merely saying and has said dozens of times on television that wars that don't benefit the United States are probably a bad idea for us to engage in. That's all she said and for that, she was run out of town.



Now, why is that? Why is that such an unacceptable thing to say? Well, of course, because there's a pattern here. Certain people do benefit from wars, and they want more.



So, three years after that debate, another US-funded regime change war is underway and that is exactly what's happening. This time our stated goal is removing not some third world dictator who might have WMD, but removing a guy who was the world's largest nuclear stockpile (6,300 nuclear warheads) Vladimir Putin, and once again, because Tulsi Gabbard has questioned the wisdom of this complete lunacy, Democrats are accusing her of working for Vladimir Putin.



So, if you want to know what the Democratic Party actually believes, don't listen to what they say. ""Oh, we want to empower women of color who are also veterans."" No, they don't. They want people who support regime change war. That's their red line. That's the one thing they will brook no dissent on whatsoever. They don't care what you think about that. They don't want to debate you on it. If you disagree or even ask questions, they go right to traitor.



So today, Tulsi Gabbard did what is probably inevitable and probably has been since 2016. She left her own party, the Democratic Party, and we don't have to guess as to why because she explained it in some detail. And we ask you, please listen carefully to this, because it's inspiring and interesting, and she did it on her new podcast called ""The Tulsi Gabbard Show."" It launched today. Here she is:



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



TULSI GABBARD, HOST, ""THE TULSI GABBARD SHOW"": I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party. It's now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-White racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and who are hostile to people of faith and spirituality, who demonize the police, who protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans, who believe in open borders, who weaponize the national security state to go after their political opponent and above all, are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.



Now, these are some of the main reasons I'm leaving the Democratic Party.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So, keep in mind, until today, this was a registered Democrat, an office holder, a standard-bearer of the Democratic Party, the future of the Democratic Party from the country's most liberal state. This was a liberal Democrat.



Did you hear that? Is there a single word you disagree with? Is there a single word that the Republican who represents you, who you send money to, who you vote for, would repeat in public?



In other words, here you have someone who, until yesterday, was a member of the Democratic Party saying things the overwhelming majority of Republican voters believe, but only a tiny, a vanishingly small minority of Republican officeholders are willing to say out loud, because it's too scary. Oh, it just tells you so much.



Tulsi Gabbard joins us tonight, and we're happy that she is.



Tulsi Gabbard, thank you so much for coming on tonight. That was quite a statement. I'm listening to this and I'm thinking, you know, we have Republicans on the show from time to time, they don't put it as clearly and bravely as you do.



So, how do you feel? I mean, you've been in this party a long time. You were its future, you left. I mean, this has got to be kind of a fraught moment for you.



TULSI GABBARD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Tucker, as you know, I've always been an independent-minded person. A Democrat, yes, but an Independent Democrat and my loyalties are very clear.



I love our country, and I took an oath both as a service member, as a soldier as well as a Member of Congress to support and defend the Constitution, and that is an oath that I take extremely seriously.



And so when you look at this party, today's Democratic Party, it is controlled by fanatical ideologues who hate freedom. They despise the Constitution. They actively find ways to undermine our God-given rights enshrined in the Constitution, like freedom of speech. If you say something, and I say something that they don't like, instead of saying, ""You know what? Agree to disagree. Live and let live,"" in the traditional liberalist kind of way. No, that's not good enough.



They will do all that they can to destroy you, silence you, smear you, work with Big Tech, work with corporate media to actively destroy anyone who dares to even question their agenda. They are against freedom of religion, they are hostile towards people of faith, people who have their own spiritual practice, especially Christians 0be vindictive, to discriminate, to punish people who happen to exercise that freedom of religion.



The list goes on and on, but the foundation of freedom is really what was at the heart of my making this decision that I cannot be a member of a party that is against freedom and actively trying to undermine it.



CARLSON: Well, it was inspiring to hear that, but also disappointing. I mean, I feel like printing out your words and asking every Republican candidate who comes on the show to read them, and if you can't read them, I'm not voting for you. Right? I mean, why is it so hard to say out loud? First of all, the people are always talking about racism are committing it. Why is that so hard for people to acknowledge it? It's so obvious.



GABBARD: It speaks to the whole environment of fear that those in power, these elitists in power have fomented to where people are afraid to speak the truth. They are afraid to exercise their right to free speech, because hey, you might lose your job, you might be canceled, you might be trashed, and God forbid, in Washington, you might not be invited to the cool kids' parties, you might not be as popular and this is really what it comes down to. It is rather than taking a stand for peace, for prosperity, security, and freedom of the American people, we have too many people in Washington who are war mongers, subservient to the military industrial complex, and continuing to put their own selfish interests with the interests of their donors first, with no mind for the costs and consequences that their decisions have on the American people.



This is exactly what we're seeing right now with President Biden and leaders in Congress whose decisions are actively pushing us to the brink of a nuclear holocaust, of which they may have their bunkers where they'll be saved, but we, the American people will have no shelter, no place to go, no place to hide and face the consequences that could destroy all of humanity and the world, as we know it.



CARLSON: You were the first person I heard say that back in February when this all started. I believed you.



GABBARD: That's why I ran for President.



CARLSON: Well, it turns out you were absolutely right. Really quick. Since you did serve for so many years in the Congress in the party you just left, you know everybody, of course. Has anyone called you today? Your former colleagues? Democrats to say anything to you?



GABBARD: One. One got in touch with me and sent me a text message with three thumbs up.



CARLSON: I would love to know who that is, but I'm glad you're influencing people.



Tulsi Gabbard, I'm not going to ask you what you are doing next. We will all watch, but I hope you'll come back on the show soon. Thank you.



GABBARD: I look forward to it. Thanks, Tucker.



CARLSON: Thank you.



So it has only been a couple of months, but you can still hear it in the back of your head, can't you? ""This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" If you don't get the COVID vaccine you're immoral.



Then we found out the COVID vaccine doesn't actually prevent the transmission of COVID. Hmm. Even Pfizer doesn't deny that. In fact, they knew that and we know that they knew it because one of the company's executives just made a stunning admission about it. Not beating a dead horse here. It's kind of important. We've got details just ahead.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: Well, even the zombies in Brooklyn aren't defending Tony Fauci anymore. He has been unmasked as the sinister buffoon he is. But it wasn't that long ago, he was in charge of everything. And when he was in charge of everything, he told us repeatedly that if you get the COVID vaccine, you're not going to get COVID. Period. We know that, and we're quoting, ""You become a dead end for the virus,"" said Tony Fauci.



And so widely accepted was that statement that Twitter banned anyone who disagreed with it or even questioned it as part of his COVID misinformation policy. But it soon became clear that that itself was misinformation, because of course, you can get COVID and pass it on if you've had the shot.



And in fact, that shouldn't be surprising, because Pfizer, which made the vaccine, never even tested to see if it prevented the transmission of COVID. What? You'd think they would know that, since Tony Fauci and everyone in the US government and everyone at your kids school and everyone on television and ""Morning Joe,"" and all the rest of them knew for a fact, but Pfizer didn't even know, and we know that because Pfizer executive, Janine Small, answered questions on Monday at the European Parliament and here is how it went.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



ROBERT ""ROB"" ROOS MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market? If not, please say it clearly; if yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee? And I really want a straight answer, yes or no and I'm looking forward to it. Thank you very much.



JANINE SMALL, PFIZER EXECUTIVE: Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? No. These -- you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: Oh, the speed of science. That's the speed at which you're moving too fast to do science, and you just sort of hope for the best and yell at anyone who disagrees with your preferred and hoped for outcome, the speed of science.



Rob Roos is the man you just saw on tape. He is a conservative Member of the European Parliament. He's from the Netherlands. And we are grateful to have him on tonight.



Rob, thanks so much for coming on.



Did you know the answer to that question when you asked it? And were you shocked by what she said?



ROOS: Well, good evening, Tucker.



It really was a special moment. For the first time, Pfizer admitted that the vaccine was not tested on stopping the transmission of the virus when it entered the market, and this has massive implications.



Governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them -- by telling you to do it for your grandmother.



CARLSON: Yes.



ROOS: And they took perfectly healthy young people into taking this jab using false arguments. And they used big words such as ""antisocial"" to sow immense hatred against people who refused to comply with the government's wishes. And even worse, many governments, including mine actually introduced so-called COVID passports. These passports made access to parts of society conditional. Those who did not wish to get vaccinated lost that access, not being able to visit a restaurant or a gym, all in the name of public health.



Our governments love to talk about institutional discrimination, but this was real institutional discrimination.



CARLSON: Yes.



ROOS: In many countries like the US and Italy, vaccine mandates were introduced for certain professions. Many people lost their job, their livelihood, their business because they stood by their principles.



Austria even had a lockdown for the unvaccinated because of this reason. The government literally imprisoned people within their own homes. All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society?



But this has now proven to be a big lie. Even the President for International Development Markets of Pfizer now admits that there was no scientific basis to say vaccination would stop the transmission of the virus. And I find this one of the biggest scandals of our time. The politicians responsible for this will be angry that people are looking back at this time, but I won't forget what they did to millions of people. And if we are a democracy, we should have accountability and that is what I'm calling for.



CARLSON: Yes, if we are a democracy -- and by the way, Pfizer knew this. None of its executives bothered to correct these politicians and yet no Pfizer executive has been charged with the crime they committed, which is pretty unbelievable. I wish there would be more politicians like you in Washington.



Rob Roos, thank you for coming on tonight. We are really grateful.



ROOS: Thank you very much. Have a good evening.



CARLSON: Thank you.



So Biden announced at a fundraiser the other night, not to you, not on television, but to his donors, and by the way, we're on the brink of nuclear Armageddon. That's not a big deal. What? Did you know that? We are on the brink of nuclear Armageddon where your children get killed? Okay, we've got more on that next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: So Joe Biden was at dinner with donors the other night no doubt talking about trans rights and how vitally important it is to get equity at the Federal Reserve when he casually dropped the observation: Oh, by the way, we're pretty close to nuclear Armageddon.



Nuclear Armageddon? We could all die. You, your kids, the grandkids you don't yet have, all dead. All humanity gone.



It was kind of a headline, right? No, not in this country. The media know their job. It was just to cheer on the war until it gets to the point of nuclear Armageddon.



MSNBC is super excited because all the celebrities are for it. Ukraine's drone has a celebrity endorsement. Watch.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



MEHDI HASAN, MSNBC HOST: Zelenskyy has also been doubling down on his PR savvy, leveraging the soft power of his now huge global celebrity status, and that of some of his newfound friends to bring more attention to the Ukrainian cause.



One such newfound friend, hero of the Battle of Yavin, Jedi Master, and veteran freedom fighter, Mark Hamill.



Yes, I kid you not, Luke Skywalker himself, the very Tatooine farm boy who shot a proton torpedo into an exhaust pipe the size of a one brat to destroy the first Death Star. Pardon my momentary detour into ""Star Wars"" fanboy-dom.



MARK HAMILL, ACTOR: Basically what they were wanting me to do was become the so-called ambassador which is a glorified word for representative of their army of drones.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So save that tape, if we survive, we'll look at it because that's what peak insanity looks like. And the craziest of all is Zelenskyy who literally called for nuclear strikes on Russia, which has more nuclear warheads than any country on the planet now wants to take Crimea. What? What does it have to do with the Russian invasion? This is getting super, super crazy, and life on the planet is endangered by it. Maybe we could note that at least, maybe you should know.



Glenn Greenwald has said this before. He is a truly independent journalist who writes in Substack. He joins us tonight.



Glenn, thanks so much for coming on.



Now, I don't want in any way, my opinions to be seen as a challenge to the intellectual hegemony of the surviving ""Star Wars"" cast. But nuclear Armageddon seems like something that we should be talking about, no?



GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Yes. I mean, it would seem like it would be a topic at least worth mentioning in passing when the President of the United States draws closer to nuclear Armageddon than any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is where the United States and Cuba were very close, minutes away, in fact, from destroying the planet and all life on it through nuclear annihilation.



And the question I have, Tucker, and it is the question we've been asking since this all began and even before is, if you're going to go to a war, if you're going to get involved in a war as the United States undoubtedly is in Ukraine, the question is, what is the reason to risk tens of billions of dollars and in this case, a possible nuclear exchange? Are there really people in the United States (AUDIO GAP) Eastern Ukraine, which 99.9 percent of Americans couldn't name because they shouldn't, because it doesn't matter to them is that question of who rules those provinces really, so vital and prescient to your lives that is it worth the risk of nuclear war in order to fight Russia over it. It's worth it to Russia. It is right on the other side of the border. Why is it worth it to the United States?



CARLSON: Well, that's a really great question, but you're not allowed to ask it. So, it does -- I would just say one thing, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, I think most Americans were aware of the stakes and how close we were. Do you think most Americans have any idea how close we are now?



GREENWALD: How can we have any idea of how close we are now when even when the President comes out and says it? They just continue to ignore that and emotionally manipulate the public.



CARLSON: Yes. Glenn Greenwald, I'm sorry, from Rio tonight. Audio cut out. That's weird.



So, I want to bring you a story that you may not be aware of, as well, and that is that some prominent Republicans in Washington actually don't want to win in November. It seems really important to you maybe for the future of the country, but some of them are actively trying to lose. Mitt Romney is one of them.



He is working against his fellow Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee in his reelection campaign. It seems like a big story. Not getting a ton of coverage.



Senator Mike Lee joins us tonight.



Senator Thank you very much for coming on. So your race, which I haven't been really paying attention to, but I just started reading about it, you are being painted as some sort of dangerous extremist, which I can see firsthand you are not, and you have your fellow Utah Republican senator working against you, like how did this happen?



SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): Well, he has explained that he has got two friends in this race. When he first told me that my reaction was, ""Who is the other friend?"" And that he therefore wants to remain neutral.



Look, I understand it. I respect him.



Here is what's going on. My opponent, Evan McMullin is a Democrat running in disguise. So, I understand the commitment made by my colleague and I work with him and like him, but here is the deal.



I don't think Mitt Romney wants Chuck Schumer to continue to be the Senate Majority Leader. If I'm right on that, then he has to get on board because that's exactly what he will be producing. That's exactly what this will lead to, if you're target and tricked into electing Evan McMullin, a closeted Democrat into the United States Senate.



And so as soon as Mitt Romney is ready to, I will eagerly accept his endorsement. He's got a big family and I encourage all of them to go to leeforsenate.com and make donations to my campaign because Evan McMullin is raising millions of dollars off of ActBlue, the Democratic donor database, based on this idea that he is going to defeat me and help perpetuate the Democratic majority.



CARLSON: So maybe you don't want to say this, maybe you're not even aware of it, but I believe it is true that members of Mitt Romney's immediate family, his nuclear family are actively helping McMullin against you.



So, is it possible to just call Mitt Romney whom I know you've known probably your whole life, and say, ""Please, like there's a lot at stake here.""



LEE: Well, I've asked him. I'm asking him right here again, tonight, right now. Mitt, if you'd like to protect the Republican majority, give us any chance of seizing the Republican majority once again, getting it away from the Democrats who are facilitating this massive spending spree and a massive inflationary binge, please, get on board. Help me win reelection. Help us do that.



You can get your entire family to donate to me through leeforsenate.com.



I'd invite all of your viewers to do the same because this is a race that's getting closer and closer because Evan McMullin continues to raise millions of dollars from progressive Democratic donors nationwide who are hell bent on getting rid of me and replacing him with Evan McMullin.



CARLSON: I don't think -- do you think the voters of Utah understand how fervently Evan McMullin's donors hate the values of the State of Utah? I mean, for real. It is not about tax rates, it is the way people live. They are religious people with families, like they don't -- they hate that. Do you think your voters get that?



LEE: No, I don't because look, the local media in Utah is complicit in this. They want Evan McMullin to win. For that very reason, they are refusing to ask him policy questions. They allow him simply to engage in ad hominem attacks on me notwithstanding the fact that the guy claims to be campaigning on this platform of civility, which is laughable, but they never make him answer any actual policy questions.



So yes, I think a lot of Utahns are being duped and fooled, and it doesn't help to have the tacit acquiescence, that tacit assistance of my Republican colleague for Utah. It's noteworthy here that 48 -- all 48 of my other Republican colleagues are on board with me, have supported me, have supported my campaign, and have endorsed me. It's not too late, Mitt. 1You can join the party. I welcome you to do so, because otherwise you'll be stuck with two more years of Chuck Schumer being the leader and two more years of Joe Biden having unfettered rule over the United States Senate without any Republican backstop.



CARLSON: I mean, this is a guy Pierre Delecto, who marched with Black Lives Matter which hates the nuclear family and endorsed riots like, I think he has gone insane. My view, not yours.



But Senator Mike Lee, I appreciate your coming on tonight. It's an amazing story that we were not aware of. Thank you.



LEE: Thank you.



CARLSON: So the first thing you hear if you complain about rates of illegal immigration is ""Shut up. They're way better than you."" Illegal aliens have lower crime rates than you do, the native born Americans. That's actually not true. Like a lot of things, it's just a flat out lie. We have got the numbers to prove it, it is straight ahead.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: John Carter Cash is the only son of June Carter and Johnny Cash, so imagine that childhood. Well, he is working on a new documentary about it. The documentary is called ""Johnny Cash: The Redemption of an American Icon,"" coming out later this year.



We just spoke to John Carter Cash for a brand new episode of ""Tucker Carlson Today."" He tells us what the last part of his father's life and his faith. Here is part of it.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



JOHN CARTER CASH, AMERICAN COUNTRY SINGER-SONGWRITER, AUTHOR AND PRODUCER: In the face of his struggles, he didn't only endure, but he quadrupled his efforts and he made arguably some of the best music of this life.



CARLSON: Yes, he did.



CASH: . in the last part of his life. You can hear the frailty. You can hear -- you can hear the fact that he knew he was broken, and then he wasn't going to be able to get backed up in many ways. You can hear that in his voice.



But there's something else there: You can hear the tenacity. You can hear the endurance. You can hear the almost preternatural strength that was rising in him to continue his creativity.



He lost his eyesight in the last part of his life. And, you know, I mean, it is -- and yes, a lot of it was brought on by his own, you know, his own nature. But the way he lived while he was dying was a testament to the human spirit.



And so, you know, I carry that with me. There's -- but it is really -- it all comes back around to his faith.



He had that sense of peace, and for one thing, it's like, he never -- he was never angry with God. One of his favorite books from the Bible was the Book of Job, and likened to Job, Dad was surrounded by loss, loss of his brother when he was a child, the loss of his wife towards the end of his life, something that devastated him that he never got over.



But he never cursed God for that and he always -- I think he had a sense of peace and understanding that this was grace, this was life. But it didn't mean that we didn't go without struggles, that we didn't go without pain. We live on a fallen plane.



And I mean -- but he had a way of showing that kindness and that love and that connection with the spirit to everyone in his life.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: How he lived while he was dying revealed who Johnny Cash really was. That's true many people. That's a great conversation, you can see the whole thing on ""Tucker Carlson Today"" on foxnation.com.



So, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ian, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis announced the arrest of four looters, three of them were here illegally.



(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)



GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We've had four looters that were arrested, I guess, a couple of days ago and they need to be brought to justice and we're not going to tolerate it. But you know, three of the four are illegal aliens, and so these are people that are foreigners. They are illegally in our country and not only that, they try to loot and ransack in the aftermath of a natural disaster.



(END VIDEO CLIP)



CARLSON: So you come to the country illegally, you break a law to get here and you start stealing when you get here? Really, it's really too much. How common is this? Because it is insulting in addition to everything else.



We don't really know because most States do not identify illegal aliens when they're arrested. So, you don't know how often they commit crimes, and there is a point, of course, a political point in hiding that from you.



But a new analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies looked more deeply into it and we can tell you the results of this study exclusively tonight.



CIS found that illegal immigrants in Texas, for example, ""Appear to be convicted of crimes such as homicide, sexual assault, and kidnapping at higher rates than the State average."" For example, in one recent year, the homicide conviction rate for illegals in Texas was 3.3 per 100,000. That was much higher than the State's overall rate, which is 2.9.



So these are meaningful numbers and they demolish the talking point that's often thrown at you when you bring up this topic.



Sean Kennedy was lead researcher on this for the Center for Immigration Studies. He joins us tonight.



Sean, thanks so much for coming on.



How did you find these numbers which had been hidden?



SEAN KENNEDY, LEAD RESEARCHER, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Well, a number of studies had been done by first the libertarian, Cato Institute and then repeated by ""The Washington Post"" and ""The New York Times"" debunking the notion that illegal immigrants commit any crime for that matter and I was just curious, and my lead authors were curious as well as to what the actual data said and we found out that the data was being absolutely misrepresented.



They claimed that native born Americans could be compared apples to apples to illegal immigrants except for Texas doesn't collect data on native born Americans. That's some other category which includes unidentified illegal immigrants.



And every year, especially in serious crime categories, Texas keeps finding more illegals in its prisons that weren't identified initially upon arrest. So, there is more and more illegals amongst the convicted felons in Texas when Texas goes back and checks on people's immigration status.



CARLSON: So the Cato study was a lie, and yet, as you said, it was weaponized immediately by the usual liars to shout down anyone who said, ""Well, maybe we shouldn't have open borders.""



KENNEDY: Absolutely, it was a mischaracterization because you used to be entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. But now you're entitled to your own facts, but not your own opinions and that is where we stand. It is that one of these lies gets halfway around the world before we get our pants on with the truth, and that is where we stand on illegal immigration and crime because a subsequent study by the University of Wisconsin also confirmed Cato's analysis, except for, it made even more egregious methodological errors and mischaracterized more data about illegal immigrants than what Texas collects.



And we spoke to Texas Department of Public Safety at length and got the original data they used, and it just doesn't say what they said it says. It doesn't include the categories that they represent in their papers.



CARLSON: Well, that makes sense that people willing to break immigration law will break other laws. I mean, most normal people would not break immigration law. If I said, ""Hey, Sean, why don't you and I sneak into Japan, they've got a high standard of living, good food, you can ride the subway without getting murdered. Let's sneak in."" You would say, ""We can't because it's against the law."" Right?



So, it takes a certain sort of person to sneak into a country, does it not?



KENNEDY: Absolutely. It also takes a certain kind of country to allow people to come in with impunity, and not hold them to account. At the end of the day, we don't know how many people in our prisons, though some estimates by the Bureau of Justice Statistics say that one in five prisoners in California is illegal, one in 10 in Oregon, nine percent in Massachusetts, so we know that there are non-citizens in our prisons. How they got there, why they're still here are questions we need to answer, but the only way we can answer those is if we have the truth out there.



And unfortunately, the media and some supported research institutions are hell bent on misleading us because they want to push for their policy. Facts be damned.



CARLSON: Yes. It is the pandemic of the unvaccinated.



KENNEDY: Yes.



CARLSON: A lot of lying about numbers. Sean Kennedy, I appreciate you actually getting to the truth. Thank you.



KENNEDY: Thank you, Tucker.



CARLSON: So do you remember this guy, the hatchet in McDonald's guy threatening ladies with a hatchet? Well, he's out of jail, he never went to jail, but he's back in trouble.



We'll tell you how, next.



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



CARLSON: If you were trying to have dinner in McDonald's in Manhattan last month, you may remember the guy who showed up with a hatchet and was threatening people on a rampage or maybe you saw a media coverage of it. Nothing happened to him. Prosecutors let him out of jail with no bail, whatsoever, but that doesn't mean he stopped being the man he is. We've got an update. FOX's Matt Finn has that for us tonight.



Hey, Matt.



MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. Our viewers may remember this shocking viral video of this man smashing up a Manhattan McDonald's with an axe. He was arrested and released without bail on that incident.



And now, ""The New York Post"" reports that this man was arrested again, this time in Brooklyn. Thirty-one-year-old Michael Palacios dubbed the ax-man was arrested Sunday. Palacios was allegedly busted spray painting graffiti in Brooklyn, and then stealing a $3,500.00 bike to escape from police.



Officers ultimately took the man into custody. This time he was charged with two counts of criminal mischief and possession of stolen property. He was released without bail, again, yesterday, according to sources.



Now last month, Palacios was seen on this video terrorizing a McDonald's with an ax after reportedly getting into an altercation. At one point he pointed that ax at an innocent horrified woman inside that McDonald's.



Palacios claims he was defending himself and didn't chop up the people in that McDonald's because he did not want to.



We will keep you updated on this second arrest for the ax-man -- Tucker.



CARLSON: So you're saying, Matt, he didn't chop up the people in that McDonald's, so he has got that going for him on his LinkedIn page.



FINN: Right.



CARLSON: I am the man who did not chop those people at McDonald's. We are going to try and get in touch with that man, book him on our show. We're going to ask him, why didn't you chop up those people at McDonald's? We will see.



Matt Finn, great to see you tonight. Thank you.



And we will be back 8:00 PM tomorrow night. In the meantime, here is Sean Hannity.



SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, ""HANNITY"": He did not chop them up because he didn't want to.



CARLSON: He didn't want to. Just didn't. Just didn't want to.



HANNITY: This is a scary world. Anyway, thank you, Tucker.



CARLSON: Yes.

Wes Moore wins Maryland Democratic gubernatorial primary over former Obama Cabinet member Tom Perez,"Maryland Democratic candidate Wes Moore won the state’s gubernatorial primary over former Barack Obama administration Labor Secretary Tom Perez late Friday night.

The Associated Press declared Moore, a best-selling author and veteran, the winner three days after the polls closed Tuesday.

Moore beat out several high-profile Democrats, including Perez who as the former Democratic National Committee chair had the backing of top Democrats like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and other Maryland state officials.

Perez also released a TV advertisement in March that was narrated by an archived clip from when Obama was in office that introduced the Maryland candidate's background.

The former president described him as ""the son of immigrants"" who ""worked on the back of a trash truck to help pay for college"" and championed his work as the Secretary of Maryland’s Department of Labor.

It does not appear Obama endorsed Perez during his most recent campaign.

Moore will now face off with Republican candidate Dan Cox who has been endorsed by Donald Trump.

Though Maryland voted in Republican Larry Hogan in the previous two gubernatorial elections, Cox will likely face an uphill battle.

Maryland has voted Democrat in every presidential election since 1992 and saw its highest percentage of voters turn out blue in the 2020 election where President Biden won by 65 percent of the vote.

Moore also saw his share of top-ranking Democratic support when the number two House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, endorsed him for governor in April.

Oprah Winfrey held a virtual fundraiser for Moore last month and drew in 300 attendees with tickets ranging from $100 to $6,000, according to a local Fox News report.

Cox was declared the winner of the Republican primary Tuesday.

But due to Maryland state regulations that prohibits mail-in ballots from being opened until the Thursday after the election, Moore’s win took several days longer to confirm.
