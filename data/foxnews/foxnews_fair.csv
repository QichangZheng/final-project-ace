5 errors that contributed to Halyna Hutchins' death: Vanity Fair,"In October, a horrific tragedy occurred in New Mexico on the set of ""Rust"" – cinematographer Halyna Hutchins d ied after a gun that actor Alec Baldwin was holding discharged and a live projectile fatally hit the rising star.

With an investigation still underway, lawsuits mounting and questions unanswered, Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies is speaking out.

In an interview with Vanity Fair, which describes the tragic incident as ""an event cascade"" with ""each incident contributing to the moment that claimed [Hutchins's] life,"" Carmack-Altwies ""already sees that Hutchins's death was caused not by a single action but by numerous failures and mistakes.""

Here's a look at those factors, according to Vanity Fair, which notes that the former public defender has yet to file charges ""and won't know for several more months if she will.""'

‘RUST’ MOVIE WAS TURNED DOWN BY VETERAN PROP MASTER OVER ‘MASSIVE RED FLAGS’

1. Armorer hiring

Veteran prop master Neal W. Zoromski detailed why he turned down the opportunity to work on the movie "" Rust "" when he found ""warning signs"" ahead of filming. Among the alleged reasons, according to Vanity Fair: ""the production lowballed him,"" ""they were rushing things,"" and there were two prop assistants but no separate armorer, which Zoromski described as the ""dealbreaker.""

‘RUST’ ARMORER HANNAH GUTIERREZ REED SAYS SHE’S 'NOT READY' TO SPEAK BUT PROMISES IT WILL 'COME'

""This was the dealbreaker, when they wanted to compress the responsibilities of these two positions,"" he said.

The armorer job ultimately went to Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has since echoed Zoromski's claims, alleging she held a second role as the prop master's assistant.

2. Sabotage on the set?

In her Vanity Fair interview, Carmack-Altwies told the publication that regarding claims of sabotage – and that some scorned members of the crew had allegedly been swapping real bullets into the prop weapons for leisurely target practice in their downtime – she stated that she has ""not heard anything yet that that actually occurred.""

""The notion that there’s sabotage — I mean, there is not one iota of evidence at this point,"" Carmack-Altwies added.

Meanwhile, Carmack-Altweis ""hopes the upcoming FBI lab report on those materials will help resolve the chain of custody,"" Vanity Fair says.

It was previously reported that Gutierrez-Reed has sued Seth Kenney, the man who provided the prop ammunition used by the production team. Gutierrez-Reed's lawsuit accuses Kenney's prop company, PDQ Arm & Prop, of providing a mix of dummy and live rounds to the set, creating a ""dangerous condition.""

A separate lawsuit, stemming from the on-set medic, which also dove into Kenney's recent background, claimed that he and Gutierrez Reed's father Thell Reed had recently worked together on a film. The suit alleged that Thell provided Kenney with ""reloaded rounds"" or ""live rounds that are created using empty casings.""

According to the docs, Thell requested that Kenney return the rounds, but that Kenney ""retained possession"" of the ammunition.

Meanwhile, Kenney told authorities he had received ""reloaded ammunition"" that had a logo matching dummy and blank ammunition he provides to films, but later denied that the live round on the set of ""Rust"" could have come from his prop company.

""It’s not a possibility that they came from PDQ or from myself personally,"" Kenney previously told ABC News.

Vanity Fair also noted that Sarah Zachry, the lead prop master, told investigators she believed ""the ammunition for ‘Rust’ was provided from various sources."" These sources, per the outlet, included Kenney, Guitierrez-Reed and another individual known as ""Billy Ray.""

3. Bullet being loaded into gun

As Vanity Fair puts it, Gutierrez-Reed ""was responsible for prepping the vintage Colt. 45"" and ""there is little to no dispute about that."" However, the outlet says Gutierrez-Reed's attorney ""insists she was a conscientious worker"" who was ""overwhelmed by the demands and chaos of a poorly run set.""

Per Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, after lunch she went back to the prop truck's safe to retrieve the firearm and ""fix that empty sixth slot,"" but at the same time ""he says she was being urgently summoned to set over her radio,"" Vanity Fair writes.

""She thought it had rattled, but at the same time, people are screaming in her earpiece, ‘Get the gun, get the gun.’ But she thought it had rattled,"" her lawyer Jason Bowles described to the outlet.

Bowles also gave examples where Gutierrez-Reed was getting ""mixed messages"" from production, Vanity Fair writes, as well as shared instances in which she was praised for her work, once by director Joel Souza who was wounded in the incident.

""It wasn't that she was inexperienced. It was that production had her doing two different jobs,"" Bowles said.

'RUST' SHOOTING INVESTIGATION: EVERYTHING TO KNOW

4. Safety inspections

When it came to who handed the firearm to Baldwin, Gutierrez-Reed and assistant director Dave Halls have different accounts. ""Her attorneys say she handed the weapon to Halls and left the church,"" per the outlet, while Lisa Torraco, who is representing Halls, claims the armorer, herself, handed ""the weapon directly to"" Baldwin.

""He wasn't distracted and he wasn't under duress and he didn't overlook anything,"" Torraco said via Vanity Fair. ""He did his job the way he was told and taught to do his job. He relied on other people to do their job because they're professionals as well.""

Following the incident, former colleagues of Halls complained about his work as did Gutierrez-Reed's.

5. Gun discharged

Baldwin, who also served as a producer on the film, would go on to say in a December 2021 sit-down interview that he did not pull the trigger.

Carmack-Altwies said Baldwin’s adamancy that he did not fire the weapon came as a surprise to her when she watched the interview.

""I didn’t know too much about guns, certainly not about 1850s-era revolvers. So when I first heard that, I was like, ‘Oh, that’s crazy,’"" she told Vanity Fair.

Since Baldwin claimed he only pulled back the hammer on the old revolver, Carmack-Altwies said she suggested to one of her investigators that he bring into the office his own period-era revolver for a crash course in education and firearms inspection.

'RUST' ON-SET MEDIC FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST MOVIE PRODUCERS AND CREW MEMBERS

""One of the investigators in my office happens to have a very old type revolver, and so he brought it, at my request, so that we could look at it and see if that was at all possible,"" she told the outlet, adding that the room was cleared and two independent inspectors looked over the weapon — one who supplied the piece and another who verified it was empty.

""Then they visually showed me you can pull the hammer back without actually pulling the trigger and without actually locking it,"" Carmack-Altwies explained. ""So you pull it back part way, it doesn’t lock, and then if you let it go, the firing pin can hit the primer of the bullet.""

Per Vanity Fair, ""what the district attorney does with that information will become clearer as the year progresses.""

The Santa Fe Sheriff's Department has said it is awaiting results from the FBI that would shed light on how the gun could have been fired, whether that was just pulling back the hammer — which hits the firing pin — just pulling the trigger or both.

Demi Moore and Rumer Willis opted for a family night out at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Sunday.

The pair made a statement as they posed for the cameras on the gray carpet with Moore, 57, and Willis, 31, both wearing glittering dresses.

RUMER WILLIS REVEALS HOW SHE OVERCAME ONLINE BULLYING AND BODY-SHAMING

For Moore's look, the star wore an all-black dress featuring a thigh-high slit and sequin detailing, while Willis opted for a nude-colored gown, which featured a sheer, plunging top, a tulle bottom and beaded detailing.

The duo's outing comes on the heels of another event the mother-daughter pair recently attended together: the Tom Ford AW20 Show on Friday in Hollywood.

ASHTON KUTCHER IS 'NEVER GOING TO STOP LOVING' EX DEMI MOORE'S DAUGHTERS

""@tomford thank you for having us at your show. It was absolutely magnificent,"" Willis captioned a snapshot of herself -- in an all-white pantsuit -- alongside Moore -- who rocked a black dress with lace trim for the occasion -- on Instagram.

Emily Ratajkowski recreates Demi Moore's iconic Vanity Fair maternity shoot,"Emily Ratajkowski chose to dress like Demi Moore for Halloween.

The 29-year-old model and actress shared two Instagram stories where she dressed and posed to recreate Moore’s iconic 1991 maternity cover shoot pose for Vanity Fair.

Ratajkowski, who announced her pregnancy five days before the costume-centered holiday, wore a black bra with matching underwear, heels and a choppy pixie cut wig. She also sported a white button-down shirt that hung from her arms while she held her stomach and side as she stared into the camera.

At the bottom of Ratajkowski’s photos, a stylized red font says “Demi’s Body,” which looks nearly identical to the one used in Moore’s almost three-decade-old cover shoot.

Just like Ratajkowski, Moore was 29 at the time and was prepping for the birth of her second child, Scout.

Ratajkowski penned an op-ed for the outlet where she explained that she won’t reveal her child’s sex because she wants to respect their gender expression.

""When my husband and I tell friends that I'm pregnant, their first question after 'Congratulations' is almost always 'Do you know what you want?' We like to respond that we won't know the gender until our child is 18 and that they'll let us know then,"" she wrote.

""Everyone laughs at this. There is a truth to our line, though, one that hints at possibilities that are much more complex than whatever genitalia our child might be born with: the truth that we ultimately have no idea who — rather than what — is growing inside my belly,"" Ratajkowski continued. ""Who will this person be? What kind of person will we become parents to? How will they change our lives and who we are?

James Franco was quickly erased from Vanity Fair cover following sexual misconduct allegations,"Vanity Fair erased James Franco from its coveted Hollywood Portfolio cover due to the sexual misconduct allegations against him.

A Vanity Fair spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter the magazine decided not to include Franco on the cover “once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him.”

Franco was initially photographed for the cover along with 12 other stars, but he was digitally removed before production, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

OPRAH, REESE WITHERSPOON HAVE MAJOR PHOTOSHOP FAILS IN VANITY FAIR ISSUE

The cover, shot by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, was done in November. Celebrities on the cover titled “12 Extraordinary Stars, One Momentous Year” included Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain, Gal Gadot, Oprah Winfrey, Claire Foy, Harrison Ford, Zendaya, Michael B. Jordan, Tom Hanks, Nicole Kidman, Michael Shannon, Robert DeNiro and the magazine’s editor-in-chief Graydon Carter.

It was not immediately clear when the magazine decided to scrub Franco from the cover. Franco did not immediately comment on the exclusion.

Five women came forward to accuse Franco of sexual misconduct, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month. Franco told “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that if he did “something wrong” he would “fix it.”

OSCARS SNUBS: TOM HANKS, SPIELBERG AND JAMES FRANCO LEFT OUT

Franco received a Golden Globe Award for best actor in a musical of comedy for his role in “The Disaster Artist.” Franco was not nominated for an Oscar for the role.

Besides Franco being edited out, Vanity Fair has come under scrutiny for other issues in the photo. Online readers pointed out it appeared Witherspoon had three legs on the cover. Another picture of Winfrey in the magazine showed her with three hands. Vanity Fair said Winfrey’s extra hand was “a mistake” but claimed Witherspoon’s dress lining made it appear she had three legs.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/james-franco-was-quickly-erased-from-vanity-fair-cover-following-sexual-misconduct-allegations,N/A
"Kanye West's social media posts 'fair game' in divorce proceedings with Kim Kardashian, legal experts say","Kanye West's social media posts are ""fair game"" and could ""become evidence"" against him in his divorce from Kim Kardashian, according to legal experts.

Kardashian, 41, filed for divorce from West, 44, in February 2021 after seven years of marriage. The two share four children together: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.

West has been going after Kardashian's new boyfriend Pete Davidson in a flurry of Instagram posts, which he continues to later delete. He's also shared text messages from Kardashian on his account and speaks about their divorce on the social media app.

When it comes to the divorce proceedings, legal experts tell Fox News Digital that social media posts are ""fair game"" and can be used in custody battles.

KANYE WEST APOLOGIZES FOR ‘HARASSING’ KIM KARDASHIAN, TAKES ‘ACCOUNTABILITY’: ‘I’M LEARNING IN REAL TIME'

""Social media posts are fair game when it comes to divorce proceedings,"" Katherine Miller, founder of New York City-based Miller Law Group, who is not involved in the ex-pair's case, explained.

""Kanye West’s rants about his divorce could hurt his arguments on any custody and other parenting issues since he is clearly willing to put his own needs to express his feelings over their best interests,"" Miller added.

Decision on custody

Divorce proceedings typically entail a decision on custody, although Kardashian and West have agreed on joint custody of their children at the moment. However, if there were to be a custody battle, social media posts that don't foster a ""healthy parent-child relationship"" could affect a judge's decision, according to California divorce lawyer Mark Ressa.

""Social media posts that show a failure of one parent to foster a healthy parent-child relationship with the other parent can absolutely affect the court’s ultimate determination of custody and visitation; i.e., whether custody is awarded primarily to one or to both parents equally and whether there will be restrictions on visitation, such as supervised visitation,"" Ressa, who is also not involved in Kardashian and West's case, told Fox News Digital.

""Certainly calling into question on social media a parent’s new significant other, especially when children are old enough to access and read social media, does not help foster a healthy parent-child relationship,"" he added.

New York divorce attorney Sandra Radna emphasized that ""disparaging"" a parent on social media could also be used as ""proof"" in any potential custody battle.

""If one parent is disparaging the other parent as Mr. West is doing to Ms. Kardashian on social media, that could be used as proof that he will not foster a feeling of love for Ms. Kardashian when he is with the children and that could be a reason for the court to grant sole custody to her,"" Radna, who is not involved in the ex-couple's divorce, told Fox News Digital.

‘I’m still learning'

For his part, West has addressed criticism from many that he was attempting to besmirch Kardashian by divulging private messages and maintained that he has owned up to the mistake and is learning to better manage his impulses.

""Thank everybody for supporting me,"" West recently wrote. ""I know sharing screen shots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim. I take accountability. I’m still learning in real time. I don’t have all the answers. To be good leader is to be a good listener.""

In a separate post , West, also known as ""Ye,"" shared a screenshot of a comment that read: ""That’s what a real man does; fight for your family Ye.""

""THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY,"" West wrote for his 12.6 million followers. ""MY FAMILY MEANS MORE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT IN LIFE.""

Meanwhile, one legal expert noted that even if she wanted to, there isn't much Kardashian can do to keep West from airing his grievances on social media.

""Kim could try asking the court for a gag order restricting both parties from airing their grievances publicly during the divorce, but I doubt she would be successful,"" Miller told Fox News Digital. ""Free speech is valued in this country, and Kim would have to show a risk of grievous harm in order to be successful,"" and ""the harm caused by [the social media posts] is mostly to his dignity if Kim can find a way to shield the kids.""

Kardashian could file a non-disparagement agreement, although they are typically added to a final divorce or separation documents, according to Radna.

""Although a non-disparagement clause is something that is typically in the final divorce or separation agreement, the court may issue an interim non-disparagement order immediately since Mr. West continues to publicly disparage Ms. Kardashian,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Katy Perry: Strict Christian Upbringing Kept Me From Having a Childhood,"Singer Katy Perry says she left her strict religious upbringing behind her after evangelical-minister parents left her without “a childhood.”

The sexy pop singer is on the June cover of Vanity Fair magazine, where she reveals the differences between hers and her parents way of thinking .

“I didn’t have a childhood,” she tells the magazine, adding that she was not allowed to say things like “deviled eggs” or “Dirt Devil,” to listen to secular music or read any other books but the Bible.

“Growing up, seeing Planned Parenthood, it was considered like the abortion clinic. I was always scared I was going to get bombed when I was there … I didn’t know it was more than that, that it was for women and their needs. I didn’t have insurance, so I went there and I learned about birth control.”

Earlier this month, Perry’s mother revealed that she was shopping a book about her daughter’s career choices’ impact on her ministry, saying she was proud of Katy, but disagreed “with a lot of choices she makes in her career.”

“I think sometimes when children grow up, their parents grow up,” Katy Perry tells Vanity Fair. “Mine grew up with me. We coexist. I don’t try to change them anymore, and I don’t think they try to change me. We agree to disagree. They’re excited about [my success]. They’re happy that things are going well for their three children and that they’re not on drugs. Or in prison.”

Perry credits her husband, actor Russell Brand, with opening her mind even more.

“I come from a very non-accepting family, but I’m very accepting,” Perry says of her current religious beliefs. “Russell is into Hinduism, and I’m not [really] involved in it. He meditates in the morning and the evening; I’m starting to do it more because it really centers me. [But] I just let him be him, and lets me be me.”

“I’ve always been the kid who’s asked ‘Why?’ In my faith, you’re just supposed to have faith. But I was always like … why?” she says. “At this point, I’m just kind of a drifter. I’m open to possibility…. My sponge is so big and wide and I’m soaking everything up and my mind has been radically expanded. Just being around different cultures and people and their opinions and perspectives. Just looking into the sky.”

The June issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands everywhere May 10.

Meghan Markle was 'very unhappy' over her 2017 Vanity Fair cover and found the headline 'racist': report,"Meghan Markle became infuriated over her 2017 Vanity Fair cover, which ran with a headline that she deemed ""racist,"" according to ""Courtiers: The Hidden Power Behind the Crown,"" a new book by royal author Valentine Low.

Markle and Prince Harry reportedly objected to the October issue's headline ""She's Just Wild About Harry!"" as they pointed out that ""I'm Just Wild About Harry"" was the title of song that Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney performed as a blackface number in the 1939 musical ""Babes In Arms.""

""They [Harry and Meghan] tried to get it changed online, because [they thought] it had been racially motivated,"" said a source, according to an excerpt from Low's book that was obtained by the Daily Mail.

In addition, Markle was reportedly ""furious"" with her public relations adviser Keleigh Thomas Morgan over the headline.

""[Meghan] was so angry with Keleigh, she wanted to fire her,"" a source said, according to the excerpt.

At the time, Morgan, a longtime PR guru with the prestigious firm Sunshine Sachs, had been recently hired to help guide Markle as she managed her new celebrity status after revealing her relationship with Prince Harry.

Kensington Palace reportedly approved of Markle's choice to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair's October 2017 issue and participate in the accompanying interview but left the negotiations up to Morgan.

In the excerpt, Low wrote, ""Ostensibly to mark the 100th episode of Suits, the interview was, in effect, Meghan’s big launch. The couple were not officially engaged — though everyone in Kensington Palace knew they had been privately engaged since the late summer — but this was Meghan putting herself out there in a confident, proactive way.""

However, Markle reportedly ""hated it"" and was ""upset"" that the main focus was on her relationship with Harry.

Low wrote that the Duchess of Sussex was ""furious"" with Morgan. ""She was very unhappy with how that had been handled,"" said a source, according to the excerpt.

""And she was looking to throw blame in every possible direction, despite it having been a positive piece.""

""She did not like the photographs. She thought the story was negative. She was upset that it was about Harry, not about her.""

"Vanity Fair trying to expose Gwyneth Paltrow cheating scandal, report says","What exactly is Gwyneth Paltrow afraid of from Vanity Fair? Sources told The New York Post's Page Six the glossy magazine might be digging deep into her “friendship” with handsome Miami billionaire Jeff Soffer.

The Post first reported back in June that Gwynnie had warned friends not to talk to Vanity Fair, which is working on a story about her. She e-mailed pals, “If you are asked for quotes or comments, please decline.” VF editor in chief Graydon Carter this week told The Times of London, “We have a very good writer and it’ll run.”



Now, according to The Post, researchers on the story by top VF writer Vanessa Grigoriadis have been asking Miami society sources questions about Paltrow and Soffer, who is considered Miami royalty, owns the lavish Fontainebleau Hotel and recently married Elle Macpherson.



One source said, “Vanity Fair is asking if Gwyneth had an affair with Jeff back in 2008 when he reopened the Fontainebleau. He flew her in for the party, and she stayed at his house.” Paltrow has been married to Coldplay rocker Chris Martin since 2003. They have two kids, Moses and Apple.

Best foods at this year’s Iowa State Fair,"Classic fried food gets a twist at the Iowa State Fair, but the best finds are on a stick.

There are 16 new foods this year at the fair that run the gauntlet from the half-pound Ultimate Bacon Brisket Bomb (smoked brisket infused with jalapeño, cheese, onion, and seasonings wrapped with bacon), to apple pie on a stick served with a side of caramel and apple wedges, to ultra-cold canned beer served at a temperature of least 27 degrees Fahrenheit.

Six of the new items, including the Brisket Bomb, come on a stick – pushing the fair’s “Food on a Stick” count to over 70 different items, ensuring you’ll always have something easy to snack on.

The unusual items helping lure in over a million visitors last year and generating revenues of more than $14 million on food and beverage sales alone. There are nearly 200 food vendors at the fair, peddling classics like strawberry lemonade, deep fried butter, corn dogs and ethnic cuisine like Mexican and Chinese.

But it's the new fare that gets all the attention. A New Fair Food Contest is held every year among the newcomers – one of 228 different food competitions at the fair. Voting started Thursday online, the first day of the fair, and runs for five days. Before the general vote, judges get together in before the fair to taste test the new foods and determine the finalists for the competition.

Apart from taste, presentation and value are also important.

“You have to try to keep things reasonably priced,” says Mindy Williamson, marketing director at the Iowa State Fair. “For the serving size, is that worth three dollars, or is that worth six dollars? When it’s judged, they do look at those things.”

The gourmet Corn in a Cup- billed as the “Caviar of Iowa” and mixed with pork chorizo is one of three top contenders- along with the Toasted Coconut Caramel Cluster, which is toasted coconut, caramel fudge and bits of pretzel, and the Ultimate Bacon Brisket Bomb.

“They smoke for two and a half hours at 250 degrees,” says Joni Bell, owner of the Rib Shack and creator of the Brisket Bomb. “Once they’re done smoked, then they’re going to get tossed in a sweet chili sauce. Then they get broiled off in the oven.”

If the Brisket Bomb wins, it’ll be the first time in state fair history that the same vendor wins twice in a row. The Rib Shack was the creator of last year’s winning new item, the Smoked Brisket and Bacon Mac and Cheese.

For dessert, there’s the deep-fried Cherry Pie on a stick. A slice of pie is frozen onto a stick to prevent it from sliding off, then dipped into batter and thrust into boiling oil. Once it’s done, the already-decadent dessert is taken to a whole new level by being doused liberally with frosting.

“I’ve got a grandson that loves cherry pie, and screams cherry pie,” says deep-fried pie creator Terri Shell. “So when we were trying to come up with something, he came up with it.”

These are not low calorie items. The Brisket Bomb clocks in at 640 calories, while the Cherry Pie’s frosting pushes its calorie count to 720. But the most calorie-rich food by far is a serving of the deep-fried Nacho Balls at 1650 calories, which also includes 157 percent of a day’s worth of sodium and over 170% of a day’s worth of fat.

It also comes with a “sour cream drizzle” and a side of “zesty salsa verde sauce,” according to the Iowa State Fair.

The wrap was chosen from more than two dozen other food items new to the Iowa State Fair this year, among them “bacon-wrapped pig wings” (pork shanks wrapped in bacon and deep-fried), “apple nachos” (cinnamon-sugar chips covered in caramel, apple filling, whipped cream and crushed Red Hots candies) and the “super dog” (a hot dog stuffed inside a hollowed pickle, which is then deep-fried in corn dog batter).

The runners-up for “Best New Food” eventually came down to just three offerings: “Georgie’s Roast With the Most” from G Mig’s; “Chicken Street Tacos” from the Chicken City stand; and “The Chief” from the Rib Shack, which featured Navajo BBQ fried bread around smoked beef brisket (or smoked pork) with a cilantro-lime slaw.

George Migliero of G Mig’s later told the Des Moines Register he came up with the idea for the “Roast With the Most” after committing himself to pot roast.

“Then I was thinking about other flavors and I kind of went with a little bit of a Southwest (twist), but I know how Iowans sometimes don't like things that are spicier, so I toned it down,” he told the Register, adding that this was the third time being considered for the top three at the Iowa State Fair.

The fair also recognized two other winners, including the Cookies and Cream Wonder Bar (cookies and cream ice cream on a stick, dipped in chocolate and Oreo pieces) which won Best New Deal, and the Cluck ‘n Coop stand, which won Best In Show.

Iowa State Fair unveils new treats for food competition,"next Image 1 of 3

Ready to try a Brownie Blitz: cream cheese, brownie bits, whipped cream, chocolate syrup and coconut? Or how about Caprese salad on a stick: a skewer of cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinaigrette?

The food at the Iowa State Fair is for the adventurous eater. And this year they’ll have a whole new batch of items to chomp on while checking out the fair exhibits, livestock, and people.

Over 1 million people flock to the fair grounds each year, and over-the-top food items are a huge draw --generating sales of nearly $10 million, say officials.

There are about 200 vendors selling unique treats, including almost anything wrapped in or covered with bacon, mashed potato sundaes, deep fried Ho-Hos, and more.

As part of a competition among fair concessioners, eight entries battled to be a top five finalist in the Iowa State Fair New Food Contest. Fairgoers will vote on their favorite during the fair and the top pick will get bragging rights for the next year.

One finalists, the Brownie Blitz from Bauders Ice Cream, is made of brownie cheesecake bites, covered in whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and topped with coconut.

Mark Graziano came up with the idea after wanting to do an ice cream dish, but decided to go with brownies because they hold up better in the August heat. Graziano said as soon as they tried the concoction they knew they had something special.

“Everybody likes the idea. We did a trial run at the store and now have people coming in for it, but I’m not bringing it out until the fair,” said Graziano. “It’s a quality item for three bucks…I think it’ll attract a whole new crowd.”

Another finalist, the Smoked Brisket and Mac N Cheese from the Rib Shack, is chunks of smoked brisket in a three-cheese mac n cheese with apple wood smoked bacon on top.

The Steer N Stein’s Three Buck Bowl is two potato skins with scrambled eggs on top with salsa and shredded cheddar cheese.

And the fair’s New Food competition wouldn’t be complete without food on a stick, with some 60 items to choose from.

Included in that is Arnold’s Concession’s Funnel Cake Sticks made with a choice of vanilla, chocolate or strawberry batter, which is served on-a-stick and topped with icing.

And the odd-ball item of the batch is the Caprese Salad On-a-Stick. It’s cherry tomatoes skewered together with basil, mozzarella, and balsamic vinaigrette. It’s served by the Salad Bowl concession stands and is one of the Fair’s healthy food options.

If you’re wondering how a salad made it to the final round in an event dominated by decadent food, Iowa State Fair’s marketing director Lori Chappell said the presentation and the balsamic vinaigrette were what helped it pass the judge’s taste test.

The three entries that did not make the top cut are sour shaved ice treats called Zombie Cones, Jumbo Toasted Marshmallows On-a-Stick, and Red Velvet Flurry ice cream. All will still be available at the Fair.

Other new items available at the fair this year include Chicken Fried Bacon, Tater Dogs On-a-stick, Pineapple Inside Out Funnel Cake, Mexican Grilled Corn On-the-cob, and Chocolate Covered Bacon Nougat On-a-stick.

The only rule for the competition is the food had to be priced $3 or less. Chappell said the contest encouraged concessioners to get creative with their ideas.

“It was judged based on the value, on the flavor, the presentation, the appearance, and creativity,” she said.

Chappell said the best selling foods at the fair are foods that you can eat on the go. Corn dogs, said Chappell, are consistently the most sold food item at the fair.

“The contest is to encourage them to come up with new ideas, think outside of the box, and fairgoers love new foods and to try them. It’s a fun way to come up with new ideas.”

Krispy Kreme triple cheeseburger will debut at San Diego County Fair,"The world's most gluttonous burger made famous by Paula Deen is getting a major upgrade.

A triple-decker Krispy Kreme cheeseburger is set to make its debut at the San Diego County Fair in a few weeks.

If you can open your mouth wide enough to inhale the three cheeseburger patties sandwiched between two glazed donut buns, then good luck to your heart.

A few brave fast food fans were treated to a preview of the new burger and took to social media to proclaim their praise and, in some cases, disgust.

The burger is the creation of Chicken Charlie’s, a county fair staple across California, that also sells deep fried Oreos and Twinkies.

Minnesota State Fair pulls offbeat menu item: doughnuts with syringes,"The Minnesota State Fair is dropping a new food item -- doughnut bits with a side of syringes -- a snack apparently too extreme even for an industry perpetually pushing culinary boundaries.

The move follows an outcry over The Wingwalker Donut Flight, comprising doughnut holes and three syringes for injecting Bavarian cream, chocolate custard and Minnesota lingonberry jam.

The optics -- a lot of unnecessary plastic, and the syringes' similarity to drug paraphernalia in the midst of an opioid crisis -- simply didn't sit well with some.

""We understand the impact food packaging has on the environment, and The Hangar -- along with the fair -- has decided that plastic syringes will not be used as part of the Wingwalker Donut Flight,"" fair officials said in a statement to Fox News.

Jason Holtz launched the petition over the new doughnut item when he heard about the syringes, the Star Tribune reported.

“I don’t want to see however many thousands of syringes that are used for a few seconds and then end up in the ocean or wherever they’re going to end up,” he told the paper. “And with the opioid crisis, it’s sending a bad message that tasty things come from needles.”

The doughnut holes will still be available, but will be served on a compostable tray with areas to dunk them into the fillings, the fair said. Replacing the Wingwalker snack will be The Tailspin -- fried onions and coleslaw layered with pork, corn, cheese, spices and barbecue sauce.

Minnesota State Fair removes doughnut offering from 2019's New Foods List amid controversy,"A food vendor at the upcoming Minnesota State Fair has pulled its controversial menu item ahead of opening day on Aug. 22.

Fair organizers recently confirmed that the Wingwalker Donut Flight from The Hangar – a dish of doughnut holes, which came complete with three plastic syringes to allow guests to inject their own fillings – is no longer on the Official New Foods List over concerns that the provided syringes would create far too much waste.

“We understand the impact food packaging has on the environment, and The Hangar, along with the fair, has decided that plastic syringes will not be used as part of the Wingwalker Donut Flight,” the Minnesota State Fair wrote in a statement posted to Twitter on July 12.

“The item will no longer be offered on the Official New Food List, but will be offered on The Hangar’s menu with the fresh, hot cake donut holes served in a compostable tray with three compartments that can be used for dunking the donut holes in Bavarian cream, chocolate custard and Minnesota lingonberry jam.”

Fair officials decided to nix the doughnut holes following feedback from the public, who voiced concerns after the item was announced alongside the other Official New Food offerings on June 18.

One critic, Jason Holz, had even started a Change.org petition to convince fair organizers to ditch the doughnuts, calling the idea “absurd.”

“Filled donut holes sound like a fine idea,” Holtz wrote. “Fill them for us from a big dispenser that's not going to last centuries in the ocean or landfill.”

The petition earned 4,300 of the 5,000 signatures it was seeking before fair organizers took the Wingwalker Donut Flight off the menu.

The Hangar has since submitted a different menu item — a pulled pork dish layered atop a seasoned hash brown waffle — for the fair’s Official New Foods List, which already includes items such as the Fried Taco On-a-Stick and Cheesy Sriracha Funnel Cake Bites among other over-the-top offerings from various fair vendors.

The owners of the business have also vowed to provide only “eco trays” made from post-consumer recycled paper, along with wooden utensils, with all of the dishes they serve at the fair.

A representative for the Minnesota State Fair was not immediately available to confirm if other vendors would be following suit.

She brought Belgian waffles to NYC's 1964 World's Fair _ but she's not giving up the recipe,"next Image 1 of 3

prev next Image 2 of 3

prev Image 3 of 3

The notion of introducing a new food to the American public is almost inconceivable in an era of TV chefs, global cuisine and foodie websites.

But that's what happened 50 years ago at the 1964 New York World's Fair in Queens, N.Y., when a family from Belgium introduced Belgian waffles, topped with fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar and sliced strawberries.

Once Maurice and Rose Vermersch and their daughter MariePaule began serving the delicacy, there was no turning back the crowds.

""From the moment we opened there was a line. We couldn't see the end,"" recalled MariePaule Vermersch, 66, who helped her parents serve an average of 2,500 waffles a day during the fair, which opened 50 years ago on April 22, 1964. ""It was wild.""

They were supposed to be called Brussels waffles — named for the Belgian capital, where they were a specialty — but her mother soon realized many Americans didn't know where Brussels was.

The Vermersches first served the treat two years earlier at the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, and for years after they made the waffles at the annual New York State Fair in Syracuse. But it was at the 1964 event in New York City that the waffles became a sensation.

Compared to American waffles, the Belgian treat was light, crispy and fluffy. To this day, baby boomers fondly recall the memory of enjoying them at the fair.

Vermersch said that for years she ran a coffee shop, MariePaule's Authentic Belgian Waffles, in her current home of Albuquerque, New Mexico, that featured a picture of the 1964 World's Fair.

""People would look at the name and see the picture and say, 'I ate those waffles at the World's Fair,' and they'd pick up the phone and call their parents,"" said Vermersch, who is in New York to attend the fair's 50th anniversary celebration this month, and also to care for her 95-year-old mother, who lives in Queens. ""I couldn't believe how often that would happen.""

What made the waffles so good? Vermersch cited a special cast-iron pan that heats up to 500 degrees. ""As soon as the batter touches the grill, it gets crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,"" she said. ""You don't want to put anything syrupy on it or it will turn it into a sponge.""

They served the waffles with whipped cream, adding hand-sliced strawberries for color.

Waffles in the United States date back to the Pilgrims, who were familiar with them from time spent in the Netherlands, which has a similar waffle culture. And during the latter part of the 18th century, ""waffle parties"" were all the rage. Today, a version of the Belgian waffle can be found in diners and restaurants across the country.

Vermersch said she vowed never to create an instant mix because the recipe requires fresh, carefully prepped ingredients: pure vanilla, fresh yeast or self-rising flour, melted but cooled sweet butter, and eggs at room temperature, with egg whites added at the end.

But that's as much information as she'll divulge. About 12 years ago, she sold the Maurice Authentic Belgian Waffle recipe to a Syracuse family on condition that it be served only at the New York State Fair. The exact recipe, she says, is a secret.",https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/she-brought-belgian-waffles-to-nycs-1964-worlds-fair-_-but-shes-not-giving-up-the-recipe,N/A
State Fair of Texas to serve its fried food via 'drive-thru experience' for first time in history,"Try as it might, the coronavirus pandemic can’t stifle America’s hunger for fried Oreos or sausages on sticks.

For the first time in the event’s history, the State Fair of Texas will be offering up its famed fair foods via a “drive-thru experience” on select weekends in September and October.

DRIVE-THRU HAUNTED HOUSES ARE KEEPING HALLOWEEN TRADITIONS ALIVE IN 2020

“Saddle up for the ride of the year, Fair fanatics – you asked, we listened, and we cannot wait to deliver you a safe, one-of-a-kind, State Fair Drive-Thru experience,” reads a Thursday press release touting the drive-thru.

Meanwhile, the State Fair of Texas itself remains canceled out of an abundance of caution amid the ongoing coronavirus health crisis. But food has always been a big draw at the event — so much so, that the Dallas fairgrounds were sometimes referred to as the “Fried Food Capital of Texas.”

So, on Thursday, fair officials officially announced the drive-thru as a “special event for 2020 in lieu of the annual 24-day exhibition.”

Anyone interested in stopping by for a taste of Texas can pre-purchase food and photo packages starting on Sept. 2, for use during the weekends of: Sept. 25-27; Oct. 2-4; Oct. 9-12 (excluding Saturday, Oct. 10); and Oct. 15-18.

Packages start at $65 for one or two people, and $99 for three or four, and include drinks, “Corny Dogs,” french fries, fried Oreos, cotton candy, kettle corn and “Midway prizes.” Visitors can also purchase “add-ons” including corn on the cob, sausages on sticks and turkey legs.

All packages also come with the opportunity to take a photo with the fair’s official mascot Big Tex, a 55-foot figure that towers over the fairgrounds. This year, Big Tex will also be wearing a “Big Tex-sized face mask,” the State Fair of Texas confirmed.

“In a year of many firsts, this historic event will offer Fair lovers the opportunity for a once-in-a-lifetime photo and experience,” the press release reads.

Texas Walmart opening restaurant that will serve only State Fair foods,"The bizarre, greasy, and often double-deep-fried foods of the State Fair of Texas are iconic and often imitated-- but sadly, they only come around once a year.

Well, not anymore. Isaac Rousso — two-time winner of the Big Tex Choice Award for Most Creative — is opening State Fair Treats, a restaurant dedicated to serving the finest State Fair fare, inside his local Walmart in Plano, Texas, later this month.

The menu will feature 45 delectable snacks and treats that have been spotted at various state fairs around the country including Rousso’s own award-winning cookie fries, smoky bacon margarita, fried Pop-Tarts, and deep-fried Cuban rolls.

""At the end of the day it's incredible that you have someone like Wal-mart believing in a small entrepreneurial guy and seeing the potential of what we can bring,"" Rousso told The Dallas Morning News. ""The State Fair of Texas for me has been the greatest blessing that's ever come to my family. And the opportunities that were coming to us because of the State Fair, words can't describe it.""

Rousso and his family have been staples at the State Fair of Texas every year, and Walmart approached him with the idea of opening up a restaurant.

If all goes well, Rousso plans to take his state fair restaurant on the road and expand across the country.

"Child exposed to E. coli at San Diego County Fair dies, 3 others sickened: officials","At least one child has died and three others have been sickened after being exposed to E. coli at the San Diego County Fair, health officials said late this week.

The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency in a Friday news release confirmed the four pediatric cases and noted they are “linked to contact with animals” at the county fair.

The children between the ages of 2 and 13 visited the fair from June 8 to 15 and had symptoms from June 10 to June 16.

SALMONELLA OUTBREAK CONNECTED TO BACKYARD POULTRY EXPANDS TO 41 STATES, SICKENS HUNDREDS: CDC

“Three of the four cases were not hospitalized. However, one of the four cases, a 2-year-old boy, was hospitalized and unfortunately died on June 24 from a complication of this disease,” the health agency said.

While officials are still investigating the bacteria's source, all the children who were sickened reported having contact with animals at the fair.

“As a result, San Diego County Fair officials have closed public access to all animal areas, including the petting zoo,” officials said in the release. Fair officials do not plan to close the fair at this time.

AMID SALMONELLA OUTBREAK, CDC WARNS: DON'T 'KISS OR SNUGGLE' CHICKENS

While most strains of E. coli are harmless, some are pathogenic and can cause illness, which typically includes stomach cramps and diarrhea, according to the CDC. The bacteria can be transmitted through contaminated water or food and sometimes through contact with other people and animals.

Though most people recover after several days, some E. coli infection cases can be life-threatening. This is especially true for pregnant women, newborns, older or elderly adults and those with weakened immune systems.

The CDC recommends thorough handwashing, washing fruits and vegetables, cooking meat thoroughly and avoiding cross-contamination in food preparation areas as ways to prevent E. coli illness.

Legionnaires' disease outbreak linked to North Carolina state fair kills 3rd person: officials,"A third person has died following an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in North Carolina.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed a third death and 140 cases of Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac Fever, a milder form of the illness.

LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE OUTBREAK IN NORTH CAROLINA KILLS 2ND PERSON, HOSPITALIZES 88, OFFICIALS SAY

Residents in “multiple states and North Carolina counties” have been affected, officials said in the update.

The outbreak is linked to the North Carolina Mountain State Fair, which took place from Sept. 6-15 at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center in Fletcher.

More specifically, those sickened were likely exposed to Legionella bacteria near a hot tub display within the Davis Event Center at the Agricultural Center. The event center housed many vendors during the fair, including those for hot tubs.

Those sickened were more likely to say they walked by the hot tub display compared to those who were not sickened, health officials said in an Oct. 3 update. Testing identified Legionella bacteria in at least one water sample taken from the Davis Event Center.

“Low levels of Legionella present were able to grow in hot tubs or possibly some other source in the Davis Event Center leading to exposure through breathing in aerosolized water that contained the bacteria,” authorities said at the time.

Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of pneumonia. People contract the disease when inhaling Legionella bacteria; it’s not spread via person-to-person contact. Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium, is usually the cause of the illness, per the Mayo Clinic. It can be found in soil and water, but more commonly causes infection when it multiplies in water systems (e.g., hot tubs and air conditioners).

The disease is treatable with antibiotics and those who are sickened typically recover in full. Symptoms often include fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath.

At the time, a state health official told Fox News that the Legionella outbreak was the largest ever recorded in Georgia.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/legionnaires-disease-north-carolina-third-death,N/A
Maine toddler dies of E. coli after visiting county fair,"A Maine family is grieving the loss of their toddler after they say he was exposed to a deadly strain of E. coli at a county fair.

MyFoxBoston.com reported that 20-month-old Colton Guay died Monday after visiting the petting zoo at the Oxford County Fair in Maine, where he was infected with the bacteria E. coli. Some strains of E. coli are harmless, while others can lead to severe anemia and kidney failure. The Guays said Colton died after contracting Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that results from the abnormal destruction of red blood cells.

According to the Mayo Clinic, in HUS, damaged red blood cells can disable the kidneys’ filtering system, leading to organ failure. HUS is most common in children, and the most common cause of acute kidney failure among this demographic, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

According to MyFoxBoston.com, the state’s health commission hasn’t confirmed the link between the fair and the boy’s death, but Colton was one of two toddlers who contracted HUS in Maine and went to the same petting zoo.

Jon Guay, Colton’s father, posted on Facebook that he and his wife, Beth, accompanied their son to the hospital after he suffered from severe diahrrea and then massive brain seizures that eventually claimed his life.

He also wrote that their son’s illness followed news that the couple was expecting their second child, a girl to be named Ainsley, in February.

“I have learned that there is no pain worse than losing the life of your childs [sic],” he wrote. “I am relieved to know that he is in a better place free from any further pain or suffering.

“Life is precious and can be taken from you without warning,” he wrote later in the post. “It is truly important to let those closest to you know how much you care about them.”

Pigs at Michigan fair test positive for swine flu: health officials,"Pigs at a recent fair in Michigan tested positive for swine flu, the Livingston County Health Department said in a statement over the weekend.

Officials with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development first noticed pigs at the Fowlerville Family Fair showing signs of sickness on July 25. The next day, the pigs were confirmed to have swine flu, according to a press release from the Livingston County Health Department (LCHD).

The sick pigs were isolated before they were confirmed to have swine flu, as the virus can spread quickly between pigs, per the LCHD. Following confirmation, however, all pigs were removed from the fair.

Though there are no human reported cases at this time, the county health department is warning fairgoers who may have “been in close contact with the infected pigs"" to be wary of signs of the virus.

“The LCHD is also instructing healthcare providers in the area to watch for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms who report exposure to swine or who visited the swine barn,” officials said in the statement. “In addition, any individuals who attended the fair and were exposed to the pigs who begin to have influenza-like symptoms should contact LCHD.”

Humans can contract swine flu through droplets in the air when infected pigs sneeze or cough, health officials said. There is no vaccine to prevent swine flu; the seasonal flu shot does not protect against the virus. But some antiviral drugs can treat swine flu if a person is infected.

Symptoms of swine flu — a respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza viruses — include fever, cough, runny nose, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Young children, older adults, pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are typically more at risk.

Iowa State Fair's strangest food this year could be cookie dough spaghetti,"It’s no secret the Iowa State Fair is a fried food lover’s paradise. But with nearly 200 concession stands, this year’s vendors are urging fairgoers to make room for dessert.

Mike Biegger, a 15-year employee of Dipped in Chocolate, said sweet treats are becoming the new main course at the fair famous for its deep-fried corndogs and pork chops on a stick.

“We began experimenting with chocolate chip cookie dough a few years back and it just blew up like crazy with the fair attendees,” he said.

The booth, which specializes in items like chocolate-dipped bananas, cookie dough balls, and strawberries, is now introducing its newest show stopper – cookie dough spaghetti, a dish Biegger said can rival any fried concoction.

“It’s probably the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” he said.

The dish is a fun take on cookie dough in the form of a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with red sauce. Cookie dough spaghetti noodles are topped with a Ferrero Rocher chocolate ""meatball,"" while the red sauce is substituted with a strawberry dessert sauce.

Other stands are joining the strange wave of entrée-themed goodies, including ice cream nachos, brisket mango tango, and beef sundaes. And with 56 new items just this year, fairgoers can expect the unexpected when it comes to the “new foods” lineup.

While Iowa may not be the biggest fair in the nation – Texas and Minnesota are larger – the 164 year-old-tradition sets the tone for bizarre food and competition.

“Every year we have a new foods contest and our concessionaires get real fired up about that and they’ll try crazy and wacky things,” said Mindy Willamson, marketing director of the fair. “The booth owners aren’t just after the best original recipes, they are also competing to attract the most visitors.”

Concession sales are a critical part of the fair’s success. The unusual food items helped lure in over a million visitors last year. According to fair officials, roughly 70 percent of the nearly 1 million visitors in Des Moines identified themselves as foodies who wanted to try the new and odd food.

“We had one individual concessionaire break a million dollars alone,” Willamson said.

But it’s still the new cuisines that get all the attention. A New Fair Food Contest is held every year among the newcomers – one of 228 different food competitions at the fair. Voting began on the first day of the fair and ends today.

Apart from taste, presentation and value are also important.

“You have to try to keep things reasonably priced,” Williamson said. “For the serving size, is that worth $3, or is that worth $6? When it’s judged, they do look at those things.”

This year, there are three finalists. The brown sugar pork belly on a stick, the all Iowa belly up burger, and the third finalist an apple egg roll. The winner will be announced on Wednesday.",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/iowa-state-fairs-strangest-food-this-year-could-be-cookie-dough-spaghetti,N/A
"Mom hosts hilarious in-house job fair for kids, post goes viral","This mom means business.

GIRL APOLOGIZES TO NATIONAL PARK SERVICE FOR TAKING A ROCK HOME, SENDS ADORABLE LETTER

A Georgia mom has gone viral after setting up a job fair in her home for her three young children.

Shaketha Marion McGregor decided to set up the hiring event at her house after her children “continue[d] to ask for a new cell phone, an allowance, and to go places.”

McGregor posted “open jobs” – which included kitchen manager, lead housekeeper and laundry supervisor – as well as a sign for “Mom’s Credit Union,” and printed applications for each of her three children to apply for the positions.

“If you want it, work for it, earn it!” the mom wrote in the post, which went viral, earning more than 200,000 reactions and 34,000 comments on Facebook.

McGregor responded to the attention with a follow-up, explaining that she had conducted her interviews, and shared more photos of her children’s applications – calling attention to the salaries they were requesting, which ranged from $20 a month to $15 a week.

There were, however, some snags during the first round of interviews, she admits – especially with her 13-year-old.

“I'm going to make my son reapply and interview again because he laughed 90 percent of the time,” she said.

“My 10yr old would sometimes start speaking in an English accent like that would help her. And my 6yr old surprised me the most. She was super professional,” she continued in the post.

The hilarious job fair idea seems to have caught on with other parents, who shared their own photos on McGregor’s Facebook page of their makeshift hiring events for household chores.

"Unilever to remove terms like 'whitening' from beauty products, rename Fair & Lovely line","Unilever says it is dropping terms like “whitening,” “lightening” and “fair” from its marketing language to better promote racial inclusivity in the beauty industry. As part of the push, the consumer products giant will rename its Fair & Lovely product range.

Calls to rebrand products and logos with problematic histories and racist connotations have swept the globe following the Memorial Day death of George Floyd in police custody.

In order to celebrate a “more inclusive vision of beauty,” Unilever announced on Thursday that the company will no longer be using the words “white/whitening,” “light/lightening” and “fair/fairness” across its Beauty and Personal Care portfolio of brands.

A spokesperson for Unilever told Fox News that the change applies to all beauty and personal care products designed for skin, including creams, moisturizers, soap, body wash and deodorants.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON PULLS SKIN-WHITENING PRODUCTS SOLD IN ASIA, MIDDLE EAST

“We are fully committed to having a global portfolio of skin care brands that is inclusive and cares for all skin tones, celebrating greater diversity of beauty,” Sunny Jain, president of Beauty and Personal Care, said in a statement. “We recognize that the use of the words ‘fair’, ‘white’ and ‘light’ suggest a singular ideal of beauty that we don’t think is right, and we want to address this.”

“As we’re evolving the way that we communicate the skin benefits of our products that deliver radiant and even tone skin, it’s also important to change the language we use.”

With that being said, Unilver now plans to rename its Fair & Lovely brand, sold in Asia.

The Associated Press reports that the change will involve dropping the word “fair,” per a statement from Hindustan Unilever Limited. The new name is said to be awaiting regulatory approval.

In the release, Unilever stressed that its Fair & Lovely range “has never been, and is not, a skin bleaching product.” The global consumer company said its advertising for the Fair & Lovely products has been evolving since 2014.

Competitor Johnson & Johnson also recently revealed it would be pulling two skin-whitening products lines from sale in Asia and the Middle East, with plans to launch Band-Aid bandages to match more diverse skin tones.

"Vanity Fair outrage: Michelle Obama, not Melania Trump, makes International Best Dressed List and people blame politics","Vanity Fair just released its annual International Best Dressed List, but there’s one name in particular that’s missing and people have taken notice.

First Lady Melania Trump didn’t make the cut, although her predecessor, Michelle Obama, did (not for the first time). But while no Trump family members are on the list, the Washington Post points out that Melania’s go-to stylist, Hervé Pierre – who dressed the First Lady for her husband’s inaugural ball, along with several other high-profile events – was named.

In addition to Obama, who appears in the “couples” section of the list alongside former president Barack Obama, a small group of other politicians made the cut, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron (along with his wife, Brigitte).

MELANIA TRUMP WEARS ITALIAN-MADE DRESS IN TWEET PROMOTING 'AMERICAN LABOR'

Trump’s wardrobe has been discussed by Vanity Fair in the past — recent topics include her penchant for pink, and her decision to board a flight to flood-ravaged Houston in stiletto heels — but the site has also reported on her more innocuous fashion choices, too. In late August, the site ran an article titled, “Melania Trump Takes a Fashion Cue from Michelle Obama,” which likened Trump’s more affordable ensemble to the J.Crew outfits Obama was fond of wearing.

In response, fans of the First Lady are fuming over the Trump family’s exclusion from the Vanity Fair list, with some accusing the publication of ignoring her purely out of spite.

While many are claiming Vanity Fair seemingly left Trump off the list due to the magazine’s political position, The Cut notes that both Obama and Macron made the list as a best dressed couple, so perhaps Trump would be included if her husband dressed differently.

However, not everyone agrees that Trump should’ve made the list, sparking a heated debate on Facebook.

“Just because Melania is 'First Lady' -- she had to wear a tacky hat in Texas to remind us -- doesn't give her an automatic entrée to the Best Dressed List; especially since every time I see her she's dressed like a ‘high-end’ hooker,” one person commented.

Another wrote: “Vanity Fair and Vogue have much different criteria than our personal taste.”

“It's not ONLY about clothes, but rather someone's entire persona. Melania has been on the job almost a year and has done NOTHING but wear clothes, she's the least interesting First Lady in history.

Chicago mayor candidate reveals tax-the-rich plan that will make the suburbs 'pay their fair share',"Chicago mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson released a policy plan Monday that would increase taxes on middle and upper class Chicago residents in order to fund increased government social spending.

As part of his plan, Johnson has pledged to ""make the suburbs, airlines & ultra-rich pay their fair share"".

The progressive candidate seeks to create $800 million in new government revenue to help pay for his proposed $1 billion in new spending.

NATIVE SAN FRANCISCAN DESCRIBES ‘DYSTOPIA’ ON TRIP TO DOWNTOWN BAR: ‘I FELT SCARED’

""The suburban tax base utilizes Chicago’s infrastructure to earn their disproportionately higher income, yet their taxes fund already wealthy towns. A Metra ‘city surcharge’ will raise $40 million from the suburbs,"" Johnson's plan states.

Johnson's plan also includes a so-called ""head tax"" on businesses, which will tax them per employee they have on payroll. Some fear this will discourage hiring and incentivize companies to reduce jobs. Another component of his plan includes increasing the city's hotel tax, which is already the highest in the United States.

However, Johnson stated he was against raising property taxes for city residents.

""As mayor, Brandon Johnson will not raise property taxes on Chicago families. Property taxes are already painfully high,"" his campaign stated.

DC-AREA SHOOTING SUSPECT MISTAKENLY RELEASED FROM JAIL SHORTLY AFTER ARREST: POLICE

Other campaign priorities for Johnson include reducing racial income disparities, confronting climate change, advocating for abortion, and maintaining Chicago as a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.

Johnson currently serves on the Cook County Board of Commissioners, representing the 1st district. Last September, the Chicago Teachers Union voted to endorse Johnson and encouraged him to get in the race. He was also endorsed by the progressive group, United Working Families. He is competing in a crowded democratic primary field that includes the incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot.

"DeSantis presidency would be just as 'terrifying' as Trump's, Vanity Fair article laments","Vanity Fair on Monday published a ""comprehensive guide"" detailing how a hypothetical Ron DeSantis presidency would be as ""terrifying"" as a Donald Trump one.

The piece from the left-wing magazine began with a series of reasons DeSantis should not be the next U.S. president, including an endorsement from Twitter CEO Elon Musk, ""bigoted policies,"" and ""authoritarian"" behaviors. It was the latest in a string of reports and stories from outlets vehemently opposed to Trump who have declared DeSantis just as bad, if not worse.

""Shouldn’t we be happy about the fact that, at the very least, he doesn’t seem like the type of guy who would Sharpie over a hurricane map to cover his own a-- or force people to think about what he gets up to in the bathroom? And the answer is no! We shouldn’t be!,"" Bess Levin wrote.

The political correspondent made sure to clarify that her condemnation of DeSantis was not an endorsement of Trump, asserting that the latter would benefit humanity if he were never ""heard from or seen again.""

Levin then outlined 13 reasons DeSantis is a bad pick for the top job in Washington, claiming that the Florida governor thinks it is okay to treat humans like ""chattel,"" that he is ""dangerously anti-science"" for opposing COVID-19 lockdowns, and that he is ""anti-free speech"" for signing into law the ""Stop WOKE act.""

The piece also suggested that DeSantis is ""waging a war"" on trans people, sees ""no need"" for the Respect for Marriage Act, has no interest in preventing gun violence, and is a ""massive bully.""

Citing a former college teammate who previously spoke with The New Yorker, Levin added that DeSantis is also an ""awful person"" and has been for many years.

RON DESANTIS RECEIVES MULTIPLE STANDING OVATIONS AT FIRST MAJOR GOP 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CATTLE CALL

""Ron is the most selfish person I have ever interacted with. He has always loved embarrassing and humiliating people. I’m speaking for others—he was the biggest dick we knew."" We’ll repeat that for emphasis: ""He has always loved embarrassing and humiliating people,"" the former college teammate allegedly said.

A December national poll of Republican primary voters from The Wall Street Journal found that DeSantis would top Trump by double digits in a hypothetical 2024 GOP presidential nomination showdown between the two most popular politicians in the party.

Eighty-six percent of likely GOP primary voters said they held a favorable view of DeSantis, who in November overwhelmingly won re-election to a second term steering the nation’s third most populated state, compared to 74% who viewed Trump favorably.

In a hypothetical DeSantis-Trump face-off for the nomination, the poll suggests the Florida governor ahead of the former president 52%-38%.

"Monica Lewinsky marks 25 years since Clinton scandal with Vanity Fair essay, recounts lessons she's learned","Ahead of the 25th anniversary of her sex scandal with former President Bill Clinton, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky published an article listing the 25 things she has realized about life and the world since that event.

Lewinsky said she noticed that society has embraced ""bullying"" and gotten much closer to the dystopian future described in Margaret Atwood’s book ""The Handmaid’s Tale.""

In remembrance of the scandal that changed her life and catapulted her into national media scrutiny, Lewinsky composed a list-icle in Vanity Fair on Wednesday of the 25 things ""she observed and learned in the quarter-century since"" it happened.

INDIANA BECOMES FIRST STATE IN NATION TO APPROVE NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN POST ROE

For instance, she wrote, ""If you can’t laugh at yourself, you are so f*****,"" and offered, ""Turns out our parents are not ‘dumb.’ Quite the opposite. (But they are still annoying at times.)""

She also stressed the importance of ""Finding joy"" in life.

However, in addition to these tidbits of wisdom, Lewinsky made some searing political condemnations about the world, including the point that society is getting closer to a future ruled by an iron-fisted patriarchy that forces women to have children.

She wrote, ""In 2023, we are (sadly) closer to the reality of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale than we were when the book was published in 1985."" Her observation referenced Atwood’s misogynistic dystopia where women’s rights and bodily autonomy are all but gone.

BILL CLINTON SPREADS DISPUTED DEM CLAIM THAT GOP WANTS TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE

It’s a point radical leftists on Twitter often echo when pro-life Americans aim to make political strides. Lewinsky’s line may be a reference to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last year.

She also condemned the political class in America for embracing bullying, writing, ""5. As evidenced by some members of the political-operative class in this country, bullying, both online and in public, has become not only an accepted line of work but an ever-growing profit center. (It has also contributed to too many innocent people’s suffering.)""

In addition to finding faults with society, Lewinsky devoted a few entries to praising progressive strides it has made since her White House incident , including a point on how Congress is more diverse now.

She wrote, ""In 1998, the 105th Congress was made up of 65 female members and 67 members who identified as Black, Hispanic, Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Native American, or multiracial. In 2023, the 118th Congress is composed of 149 female members and 133 members who identify themselves in diverse categories.""

Lewinsky also praised the U.S. for allowing for gay marriage and codifying it as a ""benchmark for social triumph"" in those 25 years, stating, ""The freedom to marry whomever one wants was made possible (2015) and protected (2022).""

Another ""social triumph"" she noted was that ""#MeToo is now a baseline, not an aberration.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/monica-lewinsky-marks-25-years-since-clinton-scandal-with-vanity-fair-essay-recounts-lessons-shes-learned,N/A
MSNBC analyst 'can't say' Georgia election is 'fair and equitable' because of new election law,"MSNBC analyst Jason Johnson began casting doubts on the results for Georgia’s midterm elections hours before the polls closed on Tuesday's ""Deadline: White House.""

Johnson appeared as one of several guests monitoring the 2018 midterm elections and highlighted the battleground state of Georgia. He immediately highlighted the election law within the state, claiming that it’s an example of ""voter suppression.""

""I think this is the greatest indicator that we always have to talk about voter suppression. It’s almost 5 o'clock. In the state of Georgia, Brian Kemp and Raffensperger, they changed the state law so that you cannot get a provisional ballot in Georgia before 5:00. So if you waited in line for 2 1/2 hours, got there, and they said oh, there’s a mistake, you can’t get a provisional ballot here,"" Johnson said.

He emphasized, ""The level of voter suppression is beyond anything that we saw in 2018. So I think it’s completely up in the air. There has been youth turnout at levels we haven’t expected. Democrats feel confident, Republicans I’ve spoken to feel confident. But we can’t say that whatever happens tonight is a fair and equitable election, because there have been too many laws passed by election deniers to keep people from expressing themselves.""

STACEY ABRAMS SAYS SHE WILL BE GEORGIA GOVERNOR IF VOTERS CAN NAVIGATE GOV. KEMP’S ‘VOTER SUPPRESSION’

Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., enacted an election reform law in 2021. His Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams has frequently attacked this law as an example of ""voter suppression.""

Despite Johnson and Abrams’ accusations, however, Georgia has seen record levels of turnout on early voting.

Johnson later claimed that the election could be more complicated than polls promoting a Republican wave have suggested. He also reiterated that election results could take days or weeks to find depending on the state’s situation.

New York Times staffers speak out against management amid strike: ‘We’re fighting for a fair contract’,"Reporters and editors of The New York Times spoke out during a 24-hour walkout as negotiations with management failed to produce results prior to Thursday's strike, which saw hundreds of employees rally in the streets of the Big Apple.

""We’re fighting for a fair contract, we’ve been at the bargaining table for 20 months, and we don’t have a contract yet,"" Times journalist Larry Buchanan told Fox News Digital. ""We’re out here striking because we want a fair contract. We haven’t had a wage raise in two years.""

Times and union members have continually sparred on proposed wages and bonuses for employees, as well as remote work policies and the company’s performance rating system. One employee of the Times, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that she worked as an assistant for the paper for six years without the salary needed to sustain a living in or around New York City.

NEW YORK TIMES UNION CALLS ON READERS TO JOIN ‘DIGITAL PICKET LINE' AS STRIKE BEGINS

The employee added that a $65,000-floor salary for all staffers was the most important condition needed to have a successful negotiation with the company, which has been occurring for 20 months across 40 sessions.

The New York Times Guild, a union part of the NewsGuild of New York, said in a Wednesday statement that the paper’s proposal failed to meet ""the economic moment,"" and was ""far behind"" inflation and average wage gains across the U.S. At least 1,100 employees have signed the pledge to strike for the 24-hour period. The strike is notable because of how rarely Times employees have rallied to receive greater compensation and benefits.

Kevin Draper, an investigative reporter for the Sports section, is a member of the Guild’s Contract Action Team that is tasked with keeping the bargaining committee up to speed with staffer priorities.

""We feel that the New York Times management, they are not making proposals that recognize our value to the Times or the strong position the company is in,"" Draper told Fox News Digital.

Draper said the strong work of Guild members has allowed management to receive pay increases, offer stock buybacks and increase dividends for the stock, while ""the editors, the reporters, the security guards, the temps, the photographers"" go unrewarded.

ELON MUSK RIPS NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE AS ‘UTTERLY FALSE' FOR CLAIMING MAJOR RISE IN HATE SPEECH

""They sort of make The New York Times what it is,"" Draper told Fox News Digital.

Draper dismissed the notion that management is ""intentionally"" bargaining in bad faith, but doesn’t believe they’ve making acceptable proposals, either.

""Whatever sort of faith they are bargaining in has not led them to put forward proposals that are adequate,"" he said. ""Feeling like we were sort of forced into a position of walking out is a sad position. Most of us like our jobs and would prefer to just do our jobs.""

New York Times management has complained in the press that the Guild doesn’t want to negotiate in person, as the union prefers Zoom sessions so that all members can witness the bargaining attempts. Buchanan believes a ""silver lining"" of the COVID pandemic was that Zoom was normalized and Guild members have been able to witness bargaining sessions first-hand.

""We were able to see what happens and see how the process plays out,"" Buchanan said. ""I don’t think that’s been a bad thing. I think that’s kind of been an amazing thing, and it’s partly why you’ll see so many people out here rallying for a fair contract, because we have been able to see the behind-the-scenes process. This idea that if we were just hammering it out behind closed doors it would go faster is just not true.""

NEW YORK TIMES ARGUES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ‘ENABLES POLITICAL VIOLENCE,’ DOWNPLAYS LEFT-WING ATTACKS

Sports reporter Jenny Vrentas, who spent the morning handing out flyers on the street outside the Times’ headquarters, agreed that bargaining should be open to everyone involved. She said management hasn't been ""committed to getting a fair, complete deal"" done, and Guild members have seen the situation unfold with their own eyes.

""We’re a democratic union, we want all of our members to be part of this and know what’s going on, so it has been a huge deal for us to be able to witness bargaining sessions. It’s not just the bargaining committee at the table, it’s hundreds of us,"" Vrentas told Fox News Digital. ""I think that’s played a huge part in where we are now because people can see first-hand how management responds, how they slow walk negotiations, their refusal to bargain in good faith.""

Times journalists engaged in a strike for less than a day in 1981. A strike in 1978 was the most significant, lasting 88 days and disrupting the paper’s publication. Most recently, in 2018, there was a short walkout in protests of the elimination of the copy desk.

Joe Kahn, the executive editor of The Times, said he was disappointed by the walkout, and denied the idea that negotiations between NewsGuild and management had reached a deadlock.

""While the company and the NewsGuild remain apart on a number of issues, we continue to trade proposals and make progress toward an agreement,"" he said.

Photos of ex-Biden official wearing dress designer alleges was stolen spotted in Vanity Fair 'style' feature,"Vanity Fair was found to have featured images of Sam Brinton, a non-binary former Biden administration senior Department of Energy official, wearing dresses a female designer says were stolen from her.

This latest controversy emerged after Asya Khamsin, a Tanzanian fashion designer, accused Brinton of stealing her luggage full of custom-made dresses in an airport in 2018.

Brinton, facing various theft charges for stealing luggage in airports across America, was released without bail last week. He was removed from the Biden administration over the incidents last year.

In the wake of the designer's allegation, an eagle-eyed Twitter user spotted an old Vanity Fair article featuring Brinton in one of Khamsin's dress.

After Gov. Ron DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw posted Khamsin's photos of her dresses and Brinton wearing them (tweeting, ""'Cultural appropriation' … is stunning and brave as long as you are ~non binary~""), one Twitter user responded with a screenshot of the Vanity Fair article.

""OMG. Vanity Fair did a fashion article on Sam Brinton featuring him in one of the stolen dresses. [laughing emojis],"" the account tweeted.

The Vanity Fair article, published in the Italian version of the magazine on February 21, 2022, was titled ""All the style of Sam Brinton."" It showed the bureaucrat wearing Khamsin's dresses at a Trevor Project event in 2018, the same year she said her dresses were taken.

Khamsin told Fox News Digital Wednesday she recently saw a report that Brinton had been charged with stealing multiple pieces of luggage across the country and noticed that the former official appeared to be wearing her clothes in several photos. Khamsin said she had packed the same clothes in a bag that vanished on March 9, 2018, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

"Ari Fleischer: Taxes and the rich -- Yes, they pay their fair share, and they will after tax reform, too","Of all the tall tales told about taxes, the tallest is that the rich don’t pay their fair share.

The Internal Revenue Service this month released its latest numbers and they show that not only do the rich, along with the middle-class, pay the most in income taxes, but their burden has been going up, not down.

Our tax system is unfair, at least if you measure fairness by the fact that a very small number of taxpayers carry almost all the income tax burden.

The top ten percent of earners, those making more than $138,000 in 2015, made 47 percent of the nation’s income, but they paid 71 percent of the nation’s income tax. The top 1 percent, the people former President Obama decried the most, made 21 percent of the nation’s income in 2015, but they paid 39 percent of the nation’s income tax.

Not only are these people paying their fair share, they’re picking up other people’s shares as well.

Roughly half the taxpayers in the U.S. pay no income taxes. As a practical matter, most taxpayers need to make around $39,000 before they’re hit by the income tax. All taxpayers pay the payroll tax, but according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, when workers retire, Social Security and Medicare give taxpayers their money back. The less money you make, the more likely you are to get all your payroll taxes back, and then some.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

Income taxes are different. You don’t get them back. They pay for the military, nuclear weapons upkeep, environmental protection, food stamps, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid and a myriad of other services and transfer payments.

There are 140,000 million taxpayers in the United States. Half of them make less than $39,275, the cutoff point that divides the top 50 percent from the lower 50 percent. Because taxes are so high on upper income Americans, that means that 70 million Americans – 50 percent of the country – pay 97 percent of the income tax. The other half pay less than 3 percent.

When critics of tax reform claim it’s a tax cut for the rich, that’s of course because it’s only middle-income and upper-income people who pay income taxes. And it’s been that way for a long time.

In 2001, the top 10 percent made 43 percent of the money and they paid 64 percent of the income tax. The top 1 percent made 17 percent of the money and paid 33 percent of the income tax.

The proposed tax reform pending in the Congress will likely continue this trend because the doubling of the standard deduction and the increase in the child credit mean more people will pay no taxes, shifting the burden even more to the few people who do. As for upper income people, so long as their share of the tax cut is in proportion to their share of the taxes they pay, it’s hard to argue that the tax cut is unfair.

But what about Warren Buffet’s secretary? Remember her? We were told she pays a higher tax rate than her boss. Perhaps Mr. Buffet reduced his tax rate thanks to an abundance of charitable giving combined with other reasons, but examples like this, according to the IRS, are exceptions to the rule. It’s bad policy to legislate by rare anecdote, especially when the facts run contrary to the anecdote.

The system is incredibly progressive. According to the IRS, in 2015, the top 1 percent paid an average tax rate of 27.1 percent, the top 10 percent paid an average rate of 21.4 percent, the top 30 percent paid an average rate of 17.4 percent and the top 50 percent paid an average rate of 15.7 percent. The bottom 50 percent paid an average rate of 3.6 percent.

Average Tax Rate:

Top 1% 27.1% Top 10% 21.4% Top 30% 17.4% Top 50% 15.7% Bottom 50% 3.6%

Not only do middle-income and upper-income Americans pay the most, they make it possible for their fellow Americans to receive quite a bit of government largesse. According to a study from the American Enterprise Institute, 60 percent of U.S. households, those making less than about $51,000, receive more in transfer payments than they pay in federal taxes.

The bottom 20 percent of earners, according to AEI, received $9600 in government transfer payments in 2013 and paid only $800 in federal taxes. They got back twelve times what they paid in.

The United States is a generous nation. A small group of people pay an awful lot of money which gets redistributed to their fellow citizens.

As Congress considers tax reform, the best policy would be a new tax code with lower rates that stimulates the economy to create more jobs and lift wages. When the economy booms again, fewer workers will need government payments and instead, they can join the ranks of taxpayers who earn enough to see the merits and fairness of income tax rate cuts.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ari-fleischer-taxes-and-the-rich-yes-they-pay-their-fair-share-and-they-will-after-tax-reform-too,N/A
"At the NATO summit, Trump is standing up for fair treatment for America","President Trump is in Europe, attending a two-day NATO summit in Belgium as part of a trip that will include meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The American political establishment has learned over the past 18 months that with President Trump in office, business as usual is over. The international political establishment is now finding this out as well.



Countries in the European Union and Asia in particular are coming to grips with the fact that President Trump is fighting for fair trade and security for our citizens – putting “America First.”

The United States has spent the seven decades in the post-World War II era going above and beyond the call of duty in providing security and financial aid around the world. Since 1949, our steadfast allies in NATO have gotten used to America doing more and more for everyone, while expecting little in return.

Over the course of the past 20 years or so, the American people have grown weary of their government prioritizing seemingly everything but the hardworking American taxpayer. These are the forgotten men and women who wake up early every day, go to work, pay their taxes on time, and take care of their families. Fighting for these folks is a big part of the “Make America Great Again” Trump doctrine.

Throughout history, leaders of entrenched power structures have not reacted well to change. But President Trump has courage to take them on when necessary.

President Trump is not interested in continuing the failed status quo that’s been perpetuated by presidents of both parties for decades. On issue after issue, if he sees a policy that he believes is not in America’s best interests, this president is asking the tough questions that career politicians never do.

To tens of millions of American voters it’s just common sense; and it’s precisely the outside-the-box thinking that propelled the change agent Donald Trump to the presidency in the first place.

With attention focused on President Trump’s outstanding choice in nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy as the next associate justice on the Supreme Court – and on the heels of the our trade disputes with other nations– the president is in Brussels to advocate for America once again at the NATO summit.

President Trump prides himself on taking a fresh look at how American taxpayer dollars are spent at home and abroad. That means he is not a typical politician in the mold that organizations like NATO have grown used to.

The businessman and master negotiator in the president has him taking reform-minded stances on behalf of the American people.

Throughout history, leaders of entrenched power structures have not reacted well to change. But President Trump has courage to take them on when necessary.

The president asks simple straightforward questions like: Why does the United States pay so much to support NATO’s mission compared to every other NATO member?

Similarly to renegotiating some of our unfavorable trade deals, President Trump knows nothing will change unless he educates the American people and the world that the United States can ask to be treated fairly in international relationships and agreements – just like everyone else.

NATO member nations have committed to try and spend 2 percent of their gross domestic products on national defense. President Trump wants to know why only five countries have reached that goal, when the United States is leading the way with over 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP spent on defense – a much larger share of GDP than every other country.

For example, why is an economic powerhouse like Germany only spending 1.24 percent of its GDP on defense? Would it be too much to make the 2 percent threshold a requirement instead of a suggestion? After all, there is nothing more important to citizens than their national security.

If President Trump thinks the United States is being taken advantage of, he’s not going stand idly by and let it happen. The bottom line is that if all 29 countries in NATO made good on their 2 percent commitment, the U.S. taxpayer would be paying less.

President Trump takes seriously our security commitments. However, we need our allies to step up and do the same. It’s only fair.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/at-the-nato-summit-trump-is-standing-up-for-fair-treatment-for-america,N/A
"Mary Anne Marsh: Democrats, 2020 and the Iowa State Fair -- It's not just the food that will be fried","With the latest round of Democratic primary presidential debates behind us, we head into the Iowa State Fair, the annual agricultural event and quadrennial political test before the Iowa caucuses. It’s a good time to assess the race for the Democratic nomination.

At the fair you can get almost any food fried on a stick. Of the 20 candidates speaking there this week, many of them are fried on a stick, too. A number of them won’t make it to February's Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the nomination process.

If you didn’t make the debates, and you’re not going to make the next one, then you’re done. If you made the debate by the skin of your teeth and are polling in low single digits, you’re done, too. Some candidates are starting to realize it. California Rep. Eric Swalwell dropped out before the second debate. Ex-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper may do the same, possibly entering the Colorado Senate race. More candidates will have to quit as the money starts to dry up for everyone except the top tier, and self-funding, candidates.

JESSICA TARLOV: DEM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WON’T BENEFIT BY BASHING OBAMA

Where does that leave top four, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris?

While Biden had a more animated performance than in the first debate, it did nothing to assuage concerns about his ability to take on President Donald Trump.

Yes, he continues to lead in the polls but his margin is buoyed by the support of African-American voters. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, Biden has the support of 53 percent of black voters, the majority of whom are women. Those women are the most pragmatic voters, and they will decide the Democratic nomination. African-American women know all too well what is at stake in this election. If they decide Biden isn’t up to taking on Trump then they will support the candidate best suited to beat him.

Sanders' Tuesday night debate performance could have been from 2016. It was classic Bernie -- the crusading promoter of his policies and ideas accompanied by his trademark hand-waving gestures. But did it do anything to stop his slide in the polls?

This week's straw poll is a reminder that the 2020 campaign is much further along than most people, and even many candidates, realize.

No. Is it likely Warren will continue to pick up support at Sanders’ expense? Yes. Will Sanders will have the money to stay in this race until at least Super Tuesday? Yes. But that doesn’t mean his standing will improve as the process continues.

If Sanders doesn’t win one of the first two contests it is hard to see him picking up enough delegates to finish in the top two, let alone secure the nomination.

The winner of the debates last week was Warren. Her performance on Tuesday night was by far the best and better than anyone on Wednesday night as well. She drew contrasts between herself, Sanders, and the moderate candidates on stage with her. Warren also had the most memorable moment when she took out John Delaney with her comment “I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for. I don’t get it.” As soon as I heard that remark I tweeted, “Hello 911 I want to report a murder.”

Whether it is on the debate stage or the campaign trail you always see the same Warren; tough, passionate, and full of plans. That approach has served her well as she continues to climb in the polls.

Last, but not least, is Kamala Harris. After her superb performance in the first debate that catapulted her in the polls, she came back to earth in the second one. I have called Warren methodical and Harris mercurial. We saw the mercurial Harris on Wednesday night. In that debate she reminded me of Barack Obama as a candidate. He would have a great performance one night and a terrible one the next, only to come back even better on the third performance. That is Harris too. If she can settle into a series of consistently strong performances using the prosecutorial approach that is so natural to her, then she will be a formidable opponent against Warren for the nomination.

Another indication of the position held by Warren and Harris in the wake of the latest debate is the impressive crowds at their events just after it. Warren had over 3,000 people the day before the AFSCME Presidential Forum in Nevada, site of the all-important caucus that is the fourth contest in the nomination process. Harris had a crowd of more than 2,000 people in Colorado, home of presidential candidates Michael Bennet and Hickenlooper. In addition to the crowds, this week Warren should see another increase in the polls and Harris might as well.

Beyond the fried food on a stick and the iconic Butter Cow, another big attraction at the Iowa State Fair is the unscientific straw poll open to all attending the fair. In 2015, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ran away with the poll. Hillary Clinton won the Iowa caucus and Trump came in a very close second behind Ted Cruz. Trump and Clinton eventually faced one another in the general election.

This week's straw poll is a reminder that the 2020 campaign is much further along than most people, and even many candidates, realize. The fact is elections -- and the nomination process -- are won in June, July and August. With only 182 days until the Iowa caucuses, Warren and Harris are on the rise, Biden and Sanders are fading, and the rest of the field is fried on a stick.

Democrats' push to expand Social Security isn't fair to the taxpayer,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Americans are scared about retirement. Barely half of working-age Americans believe Social Security will provide them the same benefits that are paid to today’s retirees. More than two-thirds of Americans fear that workers cannot save enough on their own to achieve a secure retirement. After nearly four decades of inaction to fix Social Security’s now-$20 trillion funding shortfall, policymakers should look to our fellow English-speaking countries for inspiration.

These nations, with similar political and economic traditions to our own, provide valuable lessons in forging sustainable retirement programs and building adequate retirement incomes.

Countries around the globe face the same demographic challenges of aging populations. Low birth rates and increased lifespans are squeezing the finances of government retirement programs in nearly every developed country.

Political progressives sometimes look to continental Europe for policy inspiration. In some of those countries, retirement benefits provided by Social Security-like programs comprise the vast majority of retirees’ total incomes. In Luxembourg, for instance, government benefits replace 89 percent of a typical worker’s pre-retirement earnings, well above the 70 percent ""replacement rate"" that financial planners consider sufficient for retirees to maintain their previous standard of living.

SOCIAL SECURITY NOW ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO SELF-SELECT GENDER

But, to put things bluntly, most Americans don’t care how things are done in Luxembourg. Or France, or Germany, or Belgium, or most other continental European countries. Those nations' traditions and roles for government are different from those that most Americans consider right for our own country.

But there is a class of countries that much more closely resemble the U.S., including the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Not solely due to linguistic commonality, these Anglo countries are familiar to Americans in how they build the general relationship between citizens, government and the economy.

But on retirement income provision, the other English-speaking countries are forging a different path from the U.S. Even as U.S. progressives advocate for expanding Social Security benefits, most of the other Anglo countries assert a more limited role for government-provided benefits while taking greater steps to increase households’ personal savings for retirement.

The main English-speaking countries all offer a stronger retirement income safety net than the U.S. Australia pays a means-tested benefit set at approximately the U.S. poverty threshold, effectively eliminating poverty in old age. New Zealand offers a universal flat dollar retirement benefit with no means test. The U.K. also offers a flat retirement benefit, but the benefit is scaled based on retirees’ number of years of work. And Canada offers two minimum retirement benefits, one based on years of residence in the country and the other based upon need.

While these Anglo countries pay higher minimum retirement benefits than the U.S., they also pay far less to higher-income retirees. In 2022, the maximum Social Security benefit was $41,206, paid to someone who earned an average of about $130,000 annually over their career. That’s compared to $11,456 per year in New Zealand, $13,150 in Australia, $11,608 in Canada, and just $11,141 in the U.K. Retirement benefits for high earners are simply much more generous in the U.S. than in other English-speaking countries, straining the federal budget to pay benefits for households that can easily afford to save for retirement on their own.

But differences in government retirement programs tell only half the story. With the exception of Canada, all the English-speaking countries also do more to encourage retirement savings on top of their government-provided benefits. In Australia, every employee must be enrolled in a retirement plan, to which employers must contribute 10.5 percent of employee pay. In the U.K. and New Zealand, employees are automatically enrolled in supplementary retirement accounts that include an employer matching contribution, though employees may withdraw if they wish. Canada does not yet require or auto-enroll employees into private savings plans.

The U.S. Social Security program, under which a high-income couple could retire with more than $80,000 in annual benefits, is an exception in the English-speaking world. Social Security-like programs in other English-speaking countries focus more on preventing poverty in old age, while more strongly encouraging private retirement savings to supplement these core benefits. There is no reason the U.S. cannot follow these other countries’ lead to provide stronger retirement security at lower cost to the taxpayer.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-push-expand-social-security-isnt-fair-taxpayer,N/A
"Sen. Paul, Scott Bullock: Civil forfeiture has ruined countless lives. It's long overdue for reform","Justice Clarence Thomas made headlines last month when he criticized civil forfeiture, a notorious police practice that allows law enforcement to confiscate property, even from people who have never been charged with a crime. “This system,” he wrote, “has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses.”

Hearing one of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members denounce such a shameful violation of our civil liberties gives us hope that civil forfeiture can be drastically curtailed.

To prevent future abuses, I, along with Rep. Tim Walberg, reintroduced the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act (FAIR Act) in March. The FAIR Act would dramatically reform federal civil-forfeiture laws to respect the American people’s Fifth Amendment rights while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds from crime.

During the 1980s, as the war on drugs was ramping up, Congress enacted legislation that made it far easier for the federal government to seize cash, cars, and even real estate.

Worst of all, Congress created powerful financial incentives to pursue civil-forfeiture cases.

Once a property is forfeited, federal agencies can auction it off and collect up to 100 percent of the proceeds or retain it for their own use; previously, forfeiture proceeds were directed to the Treasury’s General Fund.

According to a report by the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, the Justice Department’s Assets Forfeiture Fund skyrocketed from just under $94 million to more than $4.5 billion between 1986 and 2014.

State and local law enforcement can get a cut of the action, too, thanks to a program that Congress also created in the 1980s. Under “equitable sharing,” police and prosecutors can bypass state laws and collaborate with a federal agency to forfeit property under federal law. If successful, local and state agencies can even receive up to 80 percent of the proceeds.

In a bombshell report released last week, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the Justice Department has funneled more than $6 billion in equitable-sharing funds to local and state agencies since 2000. Several law enforcement officials even told the OIG that the “primary reason” they turn to equitable sharing is because “their states’ forfeiture laws restrict law enforcement’s use of forfeiture.”

Allowing agencies to win bounties from forfeiture has warped priorities for law enforcement.

Russ Caswell knows this all too well. Russ owned a motel in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, which had been run by the Caswell family since 1955. But his small business, which he owned free and clear and was valued at $1.5 million, became a tempting target for equitable sharing.

Although Russ was never charged with a crime, the federal government and local police claimed his motel “facilitated” criminal activity.

The reason? Prosecutors identified 15 “drug-related incidents” that occurred out of 196,000 rented rooms.

It was later revealed that a federal drug agent was found combing through public records, searching for properties the government could seize.

Thankfully, after the Institute for Justice took on his case pro bono, Russ won in federal court and could finally sell his motel and retire.

But the vast majority of forfeiture victims are not so lucky. A sweeping investigation by The Washington Post found over 60,000 cash seizures where police never filed charges. The seizures disproportionately affected African-Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities.

Stories like these are why the FAIR Act is so critical. First and foremost, the FAIR Act would abolish equitable sharing and redirect all forfeiture proceeds to the Treasury’s General Fund. Both reforms would end the perverse incentives that encourage police to pursue cash over criminals.

In order to restore the constitutional right to due process, the FAIR Act would ensure all property owners facing civil forfeiture have a right to an attorney, and it would restore the presumption of innocence. Right now, owners must bear the burden of proof, which flips our constitutional protections on their head.

The FAIR Act is bipartisan, bicameral legislation that has brought together a diverse coalition. The ACLU, Americans for Tax Reform, Campaign for Liberty, Drug Policy Alliance, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action, Institute for Justice, NACDL, and NFIB — organizations from all across the ideological spectrum — have endorsed the FAIR Act.

Further, forfeiture reform is the rare issue that earned the backing of both the Republican and Democratic Party platforms last summer.

For far too long, civil forfeiture has ruined the lives of tens of thousands of Americans who have done nothing wrong.

Government agents should not profit from seizing property, especially if that property was taken from the innocent. We call on Congress to support the FAIR Act and end this un-American injustice.

TUCKER CARLSON: Hunter Biden versus laptop repairman doesn't seem like a fair fight,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

You know you're living in a non-democracy when it's dangerous to displease the ne'er do well children of the supreme leader. If you were, for example, at a red light in pre-invasion Baghdad and Uday Hussein came screaming up behind you, drunk in his Lamborghini, you got the hell out of the way, and you did not complain about it. And you didn't complain about it because Uday's dad ran the place and you did not want to make him mad. You might wind up like the members of his personal soccer team who dared to miss penalty kicks.

That's what third world countries are like. All citizens are not equal in countries like that. Power derives from proximity to power, and that means the second most powerful people in a country like that are the children of the president. And very often they don't have jobs and are addicted to something. That's the way it works in places like that. And for a long time, that system seemed very foreign to most Americans. They were used to living in a democracy. They could barely even imagine it.

But then, during the last presidential campaign, Joe Biden's daughter abandoned her diary, somehow, in a house she was staying at in Florida after she got out of rehab. And in that diary, Ashley Biden recounted how her father had taken showers with her when she was young, and she attributed her later sexual compulsions to that experience with her father.

So by any standard, that seemed like clear evidence of abuse and yet no law enforcement agency, so far as we know, ever asked Joe Biden about it. Instead, once Joe Biden became president, his FBI raided the home of journalist James O'Keefe and seized the evidence. Ashley Biden's diary was taken by force and has never been seen again.

RATCLIFFE: HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP WAS A PARTISAN DOMESTIC ‘DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN’

So the message was unmistakable. When Uday Hussein blows by in his Lamborghini, get the hell out of the way, peasant. Princelings have power, you do not. By the way, Hunter Biden's whole life has been a monument to that message. Despite a decades-long drug problem and no record of legitimate achievement of any kind, Hunter Biden has managed to accumulate the highest possible academic credentials: Georgetown and Yale Law. Don't try that at home. As well as what appears to be millions and millions and millions of dollars.

How did he do that? You couldn't do it. But then you're not Joe Biden's son and that's how he did it. He cut business deals with the corrupt countries that his father was conducting diplomacy in as vice president of the United States. And then, we know from evidence, that he apparently planned to kick back some of that money to his father as part of the deal – 10% for ""The Big Guy."" Now, that's completely illegal. And yet neither Hunter Biden nor his father, Joe Biden, have ever been indicted for doing that. Instead, and here's the best part: the real criminals, we learned yesterday, are the people who dared to talk about it.

Yesterday, Hunter Biden's legal team released a letter demanding that Joe Biden's friends imprison anyone who criticizes Joe Biden's son. So these letters call in the Department of Justice, which Joe Biden controls, and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings from Joe Biden's state to file criminal charges against Republicans who dare to possess and share the contents of his son's now famous laptop. And that list would include, among others, John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of the Mac repair shop where Hunter Biden abandoned said laptop. According to Hunter Biden's high-paid lawyers, John Paul Mac Isaac should be in prison for doing this. Quote, ""Mr. Mac Isaac chose to work with Donald Trump's personal lawyer to weaponize Mr. Biden's personal computer data against his father, Joseph R. Biden.""

In other words, John Paul Mac Isaac didn't want Joe Biden to become president, and apparently that's now a federal crime. But wait a second. Back up a second. Does that mean we can now say with certainty the laptop is real? If we can say that, that means that Adam Schiff, who's now running for Senate in California, had better issue a statement, pronto, correcting his previous categorical claims about the laptop. Here was Adam Schiff in October of 2020 when he chaired the House Intelligence Committee:

WOLF BLITZER: Does it surprise you at all that this information Rudy Giuliani is peddling very well could be connected to some sort of Russian government disinformation campaign?

ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin. That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the vice president and his son.

""We know this comes from the Kremlin,"" Adam Schiff said. And of course, Adam Schiff would know since he, unlike you, had access to top secret information. You weren't allowed to see it. He did see it and on the basis of that knowledge, told you it was from the Kremlin. And it's exactly what dozens of former intel officials told you. They saw the evidence and this was from Russia.

So now it looks like they were all lying. According to Hunter Biden's lawyers, quote, ""Mr. Mac Isaac unlawfully shared Mr. Biden's property with third parties."" His property? He owned it. It was his. Yes, the laptop, according to Hunter Biden's lawyers, belonged to Hunter. It did not come from the Kremlin. That's settled.

Except wait. No, it's not settled because today, we got yet another statement from Hunter Biden's lawyers and they seem to revise the first statement. Here's today's statement and we're quoting: ""These letters do not confirm Mac Isaac's or others' versions of a so-called laptop. They addressed their conduct of seeking, manipulating and disseminating what they allege to be Mr. Biden's personal data wherever they claim to have gotten it.""

So, in other words, we believe the government should send these people to jail for possessing stolen property that belonged to Hunter Biden. But that so-called property may not actually exist and may not even belong to Hunter Biden. That's their argument.

It's a novel legal theory, actually. In fact, it's so novel, it's totally incoherent. It's like prosecuting somebody for stealing your imaginary car. But even if we can agree that the laptop is real and not a deep fake produced by some diabolical Russian AI program, and again, neither Hunter Biden or his lawyers have conceded that yet, maybe they will tomorrow.

But even if we could all agree on that, there is another more fundamental problem. And it's this: Hunter Biden signed an agreement acknowledging that if he left his device in John Paul Mac Isaac's repair shop in Delaware for more than 90 days, if he didn't pick it up, he would forfeit ownership of it. He wrote that. No one disputes that he did.

TUCKER CARLSON: WILL WE SEE A WHOLE LOT MORE OF MICHELLE OBAMA IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS?

And then Hunter Biden violated the contract that he signed, and he violated it because he was a crackhead who was having an affair with his sister-in-law, at least three of his employees, and countless strippers and hookers, while at the same time trying to execute illicit business deals with the Chinese. So he just didn't have time to return for his laptops. That makes sense. He was very busy.

John Paul Mac Isaac, meanwhile, being the small business owner, called Hunter Biden again and again and tried to give the laptop back. But Hunter Biden was so busy, he ignored John Paul Mac Isaac. Watch.

WILL CAIN: He sort of disappears on you, so he disappears and never comes for that external hard drive that now maintains the data?

JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC: So now I'm in possession of his laptop, a backup of his laptop's home folder on an external drive that he provided, and no sign of Hunter. I think I called them again the following weekend or right before the end of the month. I always call customers at the end of the month to collect on out-of-delinquent bills. And then I think I called them a couple more times over the next month after that. So, just no response.

Kept calling him, kept calling him. He was smoking too much crack with too many hookers. He didn't call me back. That was John Paul Mac Isaac's explanation. So it's kind of hard to blame John Paul Mac Isaac for this. He tried his best to return the laptop. And yet they are blaming him. In fact, Hunter Biden is demanding that Delaware Attorney General, Kathy Jennings, put that guy, John Paul Mac Isaac, in jail for what he did. On what grounds?

Hunter Biden is the president's son. If he smokes too much crack to follow the terms of the contract he signed, that's not his problem. It's yours.

Now, in a normal country, a normal prosecutor would laugh at an argument like that. But Hunter Biden is betting that Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings will take that argument very seriously, and he has reason to believe that she will. Because Kathy Jennings is not just the attorney general. She is a long-time party hack ideologue who can be counted on to faithfully do the bidding of Democratic leaders and donors. And even better, even better than that, Kathy Jennings is a longtime friend of the Biden family. In fact, she once worked for Hunter Biden's brother, Beau Biden, and she worships his father, Joe.

We're not guessing. Here's a Facebook post from the now attorney general of Delaware, Kathy Jennings, dated April 25, 2019. We're quoting: ""I've known Joe, Jill and the Biden family for most of my life. Joe is one of the kindest, most genuine people I've ever known. Democrats are blessed with many excellent candidates this year, and I am proud of those choices and what they say about our party. I'm choosing Joe because nobody understands more what it means to heal. And right now, that's what America needs.""

Well, right now, the Biden family needs something very different. And Kathy Jennings may be willing to provide it. Again, this is the person that Hunter Biden's lawyers are calling on to send John Paul Mac Isaac to jail. And she very well may send him there.

Doesn't seem like a fair fight, really. So here you have John Paul Mac Isaac, a small business owner who lives in a small, corrupt state controlled by the Biden family. He's the peasant in this scenario. And then you have Hunter Biden. He's the princeling. So with no obvious means of support, Hunter Biden has been living in a $20,000 a month spread in Malibu and can somehow - can someone tell us how - afford a team of the most expensive attorneys in the United States of America.

Analysis: 'Fair share' in taxes? Not by the numbers,"As Americans sit down to file their federal tax returns, a simple question comes to mind -- what's a ""fair share"" to give the federal government in taxes?

For half the working population, fair means paying almost no income taxes at all.

""The top 10 percent income earners pay about 70 percent of federal income taxes,"" says Will McBride of the Tax Foundation. ""The bottom 50 percent of tax filers have, they pay almost no federal income tax. They pay about 3 percent of federal income taxes.""

President Obama’s phrase that everyone should “pay our fair share of taxes” has become something of a political mantra. He has used the expression in dozens of speeches, beginning back in his State of Union address in January. More recently, he told University students in Virginia, ""we do expect everyone to do their fair share.”

But for many of the people who pay no taxes, the government also allows tax credits, which end up providing refunds.

""Close to a hundred billion in checks sent out by the IRS (go) to folks who have no tax liability,"" McBride said. ""So the IRS is becoming a spending agency.""

Arthur Brooks, head of the American Enterprise Institute, put it this way: ""Half of the people who don’t pay anything in federal income taxes -- about half of them pay less than zero.""

But Brooks says the system is tilted even more toward those in the middle class and below because they also get services from the federal government. As a result the per capita value of government spending exceeds what those individuals pay in federal taxes.

""Right now about 70 percent of Americans take more out of the tax system than they put into it, according to the Tax Foundation,"" Brooks said.""That's something that should really alarm a lot of Americans.""

The policies that left so many people paying no income taxes have been supported by presidents of both parties, and despite what Americans tell pollsters they believe is fair, that’s not how it shakes out.

""The interesting thing is that about two-thirds of Americans think that everybody should pay something,” Brooks said, ""so they remember that our government isn't free.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/analysis-fair-share-in-taxes-not-by-the-numbers,N/A
"Beto O'Rourke 'Vanity Fair' profile mocked for stories about ex-girlfriends, bookshelves and his 'near-mythical experience'","Beto O’Rourke is officially in the 2020 presidential race, but early polling suggests his Vanity Fair profile isn’t going over well.

O’Rourke, who announced to his supporters Thursday morning he was tossing his hat in the ring for the Democratic nomination, was the star of a fawning, 8,600-word opus published by the prestigious magazine on Wednesday.

The wide-ranging interview is the cover story of the latest edition of the magazine, with the 46-year-old boldly declaring he was ""just born to do this"".

BETO O'ROURKE MAKES 2020 WHITE HOUSE BID OFFICIAL WITH WEE-HOURS ANNOUNCEMENT

The Vanity Fair piece, written by Joe Hagan, seemed to echo the fawning tone of much of the media coverage that followed his failed bid to unseat Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz last fall.

Hagan, who previously penned a similarly photographed and written profile of another Democrat, former presidential candidate John Edwards, wrote in the new piece: ""For O’Rourke, what followed was a near-mystical experience,"" referring to his entry into politics.

Some of the other parts of the profile include the writer speaking to some of O’Rourke’s ex-girlfriends, and one glowing piece of prose describing the Democrat as an “endurance-athlete campaigner.”

“Former girlfriends describe O’Rourke as curious, wry, bookish but adventurous. He usually carried a novel in his pocket, whether Captain Corelli’s Mandolin or The Sun Also Rises,” the profile reads.

2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS TO TAKE STAGE AT SXSW; BETO O'ROURKE TO ATTEND FILM PREMIERE ABOUT FAILED SENATE BID

“Maggie Asfahani, an El Paso native who dated O’Rourke while he was at prep school and college, said he was somewhat difficult to know. “That’s kind of the mystique of Beto, is that he seems to be accessible,” she says, “but there’s just this layer of protection. I don’t think it’s because he’s hiding anything. I think it’s because he’s keeping a part of it to himself.”

Reaction to the piece was divided, with some celebrating the detailed look at the Democratic darling, while others mocked it.

“Like all scrappy salt-of-the-earth, organic campaigns with their pulse on the base Beto's is launched with a Vanity Fair cover spread,” one reader tweeted.

“The Vanity Fair profile of Beto makes him sound like if he were born 40 years earlier he'd be barefoot on a beach surrounded by a group of hippie devotees looking like Chris Hemsworth in ‘Bad Times at the El Royale’,” another wrote.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 2020 CANDIDATES

“I mean I guess “Vanity Fair cover boy” is Beto’s unique lane but not sure the people are looking for that,” another reader said.

“My sense is that Beto O’Rourke doesn’t want to be president as much as he wants to be an indie movie about a guy running for president,” Chicago Tribune columnist Rex Huppke added.

O’Rourke announced his candidacy in a video Thursday morning, appearing alongside his wife, Amy.

""Amy and I are happy to share with you that I’m running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America,"" O'Rourke said. ""This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us. The challenges we face right now, the interconnected crises in our democracy and our climate, have never been greater.”

Republicans scoffed at his campaign launch, however, with RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens saying in a statement: “It’s telling that the Democrats’ biggest star is someone whose biggest accomplishment is losing. Beto O’Rourke failed to get anything done in Congress, and with extreme policies like government-run health care and tearing down border barriers, his 2020 bid won’t be successful either.”

The congressman from El Paso grabbed national attention last summer and autumn, as he challenged Republican Cruz in the 2018 midterm elections. O’Rourke raked in an eye-popping $80 million during his campaign, thanks in part to his uplifting message and his mastery of social media.

O’Rourke narrowly lost to Cruz -- by just more than 200,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast.

Blackburn slams S.1 as 'assault' on 'free and fair elections' as Senate moves toward vote,"Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn slammed the Democrats’ sweeping election reform bill, saying the left ""has launched an assault on having free and fair elections,"" warning ahead of the vote Tuesday that it will be ""difficult"" for Republicans to get on board.

""They are advocating policies that are going to result in removing the ability of state and counties to manage their own elections,"" Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Tuesday.

LIBERAL DARK MONEY GROUP LAUNCHES ADS TARGETING SINEMA, MANCHIN TO SUPPORT S1 ELECTION BILL

""One of the issues we have is the way local election officials have responded to this,"" Blackburn explained. ""The bill is taking away their ability to run those elections.""

Blackburn told Fox News that prior to being elected to the Senate, and the Tennessee State Senate, she served on Williamson County's election commission.

""That is something you take as a very, very serious opportunity because it is your responsibility to be certain those rolls are cleaned up, be certain volunteers and poll workers and properly trained, that everyone knows the rules, and that ballots are counted and resulted and made available, and that it is all done in a transparent manner,"" Blackburn said.

She added: ""One person, one vote. Every legal vote to be counted. Those are the foundation for our electoral process.""

Blackburn noted that ""the more people know about this bill, the less they like it.""

The For the People Act, also known as S.1, is the largest overhaul of U.S. election law in at least a generation and covers many aspects of the voting process, including requiring states to automatically register eligible voters and offer same-day voter registration.

The bill would massively expand the role of the federal government in how states run their elections. It also requires states to offer 15 days of early voting and allows no-excuse absentee balloting, which 14 states would have to implement. The states that already allow it would have to conform to S.1’s standards.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a moderate Democrat, said over the weekend he would vote against his colleagues on the legislation, calling the measure too partisan.

""It's the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I'm not supporting that because I think it would divide us more. I don't want to be in a country that's divided any further,"" Manchin said on "" Fox News Sunday .""

Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., another moderate Democrat, are facing pressure to support the voting reform bill.

Herd of 2020 presidential hopefuls to stampede the annual Iowa State Fair,"More than 20 candidates running for president are heading to the Hawkeye State this week for the Iowa State Fair – the annual event that features a famous “Butter Cow” and has long attracted White House aspirants dating back to Dwight Eisenhower’s visit in the 1950s.

Ever since then, candidates have eyed the fair for a chance to butter up caucus-goers and give them their best pitch on the so-called “political soapbox.”

MARY ANNE MARSH: DEMOCRATS, 2020 AND THE IOWA STATE FAIR -- IT'S NOT JUST THE FOOD THAT WILL BE FRIED

Candidates are given 20 minutes each on the soapbox. But the Iowa State Fair is not all about politics: it’s about the people and it’s about the food.

The fair has 69 entrees on a stick this year and a roster of new fried foods for candidates to sink their teeth into. And new this year: a beer perfect for pairing with an Iowa Corn dog. Corn Dog Ale – is brewed with 150 pounds of hot dog buns and cornbread.

This year, nearly every Democratic candidate running for president will make an appearance and many are first-timers.

But it will be a return to the fair for former Vice President Joe Biden, who campaigned for president at the event in 2007 and said, “if you ever wanted to be president of the United States, now is the time to run for president.”

Biden hopes this time is his time to be on the top of the ticket. A new Quinnipiac poll shows Biden still leading the pack of candidates with 32 percent support among Democrats and Independents. Biden is scheduled to speak on the soapbox on Thursday afternoon.

"House Republicans to vote on bill abolishing IRS, eliminating income tax","FIRST ON FOX: Republicans in the House of Representatives will vote on a bill that would abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), eliminate the national income tax and replace it with a national consumption tax.

Fox News Digital has learned that the House will be voting on Georgia Republican Rep. Buddy Carter's reintroduced Fair Tax Act that aims to reel in the IRS and remove the national income tax, as well as other taxes, and replace them with a single consumption tax.

The vote on the bill was made as part of the deal between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and members of the House Freedom Caucus and was pushed forward in his quest for the gavel last week.

IRS TARGETED POOREST TAXPAYERS WHILE MILLIONAIRES WENT MOSTLY UNSCATHED IN 2022: REPORT

""Cosponsoring this Georgia-made legislation was my first act as a Member of Congress and is, fittingly, the first bill I am introducing in the 118th Congress,"" Carter said in a press release exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Instead of adding 87,000 new agents to weaponize the IRS against small business owners and middle America, this bill will eliminate the need for the department entirely by simplifying the tax code with provisions that work for the American people and encourage growth and innovation,"" Carter continued.

""Armed, unelected bureaucrats should not have more power over your paycheck than you do,"" he added.

""As a former small business owner, I understand the unnecessary burden our failing income tax system has on Americans,"" said Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., in a statement. ""The Fair Tax Act eliminates the tax code, replaces the income tax with a sales tax, and abolishes the abusive Internal Revenue Service. If enacted, this will invigorate the American taxpayer and help more Americans achieve the American Dream.""

""I support the Fair Tax because it simplifies our tax code,"" said Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., in a statement. ""This transforms the U.S. tax code from a mandatory, progressive, and convoluted system to a fully transparent and unbiased system which does away with the IRS as we know it. It is good for our economy because it encourages work, savings, and investment. Thank you to my colleague Rep. Buddy Carter for leading this effort to simplify the system for American taxpayers.""

""I’m very proud to once again co-sponsor the FairTax (sic) Act,"" said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., in a statement. ""We’ve seen a continued growth of the IRS and a persistent punishment of hardworking Americans via the tax code. What we’re calling for is a simplified and fair code that works for all, not just some.""

""I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that fights back against the weaponization of the IRS and stops punishing those who work hard to succeed,"" she added.

Specifically, the bill gets rid of the national personal and corporate income taxes and abolishes the IRS — which is slated to hire 87,000 new agents unless congressional Republicans can stop it — as well as implements a national sales tax.

Additionally, the bill gets rid of the death, gift and payroll taxes, and it would replace the current tax code with a national consumption tax.

Eleven co-signers signed onto the bill, including Cammack, Duncan, Good, Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.

"Iowa state fair attendees say Biden 'too old' to run in 2024, motivated to vote by high inflation","DES MOINES, Iowa — Voters at the Iowa State Fair tell Fox News Digital that President Biden is ""too old"" to run, regardless of whether they support the sitting president or not, and that rising inflation is the top issue that will drive them to vote in the November midterms.

David told Fox News Digital he wants to vote based on politicians who will help Iowans, and took issue with the Biden administration's policies, particularly during the pandemic.

""I think the Biden administration has messed up a lot of policies, especially coming out of COVID. We've seen more deaths under Biden than with Trump, even though Trump had the beginnings of COVID when it was first hitting,"" explained David.

When asked about whether he thinks Biden should run in 2024, David said he is getting ""far too old.""

""Even if people like his policies, I think he's getting far too old for it. I think a lot of Democrats would be better off putting in someone who has better policies and is capable of filling that position,"" David continued.

Another Iowan said ""the economy"" is the number one motivating issue for him to vote in the midterms.

Another voter, Greg, cited ""lower fuel prices"" as the top motivating factor if he ends up voting in the midterms, and he said he felt better off under the Trump administration than under the Biden administration.

When asked about whether Biden should run for re-election in 2024, Greg said ""no.""

""I can't really tell ya, I don't know if anybody would do any better really,"" he said. ""But the way things have turned out, it's looking like he's not doing enough or the right things.""

""We're so messed up right now,"" Dave told Fox News Digital, saying the main issue is ""inflation and how we're just making it worse. We've got to stop.""

RON KLAIN SAYS BIDEN NOT 'CREATING A S--TSTORM EVERY DAY' LIKE TRUMP

Mary said she felt better off under Trump, while Dave said ""we'll be better off under the next president, definitely not Biden.""

""I don't think he'll be able to [run for re-election],"" Mary said of Biden. ""He won't make it.""

Dave questioned whether Biden is actually running the country, saying: ""I don't think he's running it right now.""

Iowans Phillip and Mallory, despite saying they were better off under Biden, said they do not want him to run in 2024.

""No [because of] his age. He needs to just step down and endorse someone else,"" they told Fox News Digital.

Jim Jordan fires back at White House in Biden document fight: Republicans want 'fair' treatment,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Monday dismissed White House criticism of how Republicans are investigating the classified documents in President Joe Biden's home and former office, and he accused the Biden White House of a double standard when it comes to oversight.

""Why was President Trump’s home raided but not President Biden’s?"" Jordan asked in a statement given to Fox News Digital. ""Why did the FBI take pictures of President Trump’s so-called classified documents but not President Biden’s? Republicans just want fair and equal treatment under the law.""

Jordan last week notified the Justice Department that he is launching an investigation into the president’s ""mishandling"" of classified records and the Justice Department’s probe into the matter.

On Monday, White House spokesperson Ian Sams told Fox News Digital that House Republicans have ""no credibility"" to complain about Biden because they were soft on former President Donald Trump after classified documents were found at his home in Florida last summer.

""Their demands should be met with skepticism, and they should face questions themselves about why they are politicizing this issue and admitting they actually do not care about the underlying classified material,"" Sams said.

COMER WILL 'CONTINUE TO PRESS' FOR INFO ON BIDEN DOCS SCANDAL AFTER WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO VISITOR LOGS IN DE

The White House has been facing scrutiny from both parities after it was revealed that classified records were found inside the Washington, D.C., offices of the Penn Biden Center think tank on Nov. 2, 2022, but only revealed to the public last week.

A second stash of classified documents was found last week inside the garage of the president’s Wilmington, Delaware, home where he keeps his corvette, prompting Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. And late last week, a third tranche of classified documents was discovered.

Former CBP chief Mark Morgan joins Federation for American Immigration Reform,"EXCLUSIVE: Mark Morgan, a former head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and one of the most vocal defenders of the Trump administration’s border policies, is joining the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR).

FAIR, a hawkish immigration group that advocates for border security and lower levels of immigration overall, said Morgan will serve as a senior fellow and additional spokesman for the group.

""I’m honored to serve as a senior fellow with FAIR, which is dedicated to engaging in meaningful dialogue to influence, formulate and promote responsible immigration policies for the 21st Century and beyond,"" Morgan said in a statement. ""I am delighted to be part of the effort to seek out solutions to mitigate the tremendous burden and negative impact of uncontrolled immigration on our country’s national security and economic prosperity.""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS WARN BIDEN OF ESCALATING MIGRATION CRISIS AMID SURGE IN BORDER NUMBERS

Morgan served as both acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and as acting commissioner of CBP during the Trump administration. He had served as head of the U.S. Border Patrol under the Obama administration.

He played a prominent role as a top immigration official during an administration where cracking down on illegal immigration at the southern border was a top priority, and that saw significant pushback from Democrats and liberal activist groups.

Morgan was vocal and passionate of his support for top administration policies -- including the construction of the wall at the southern border and policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). He has also been warning for months that reversing those policies, as President Biden has started to do, would lead to a disaster at the border.

BIDEN SIGNS THREE IMMIGRATION ORDERS IN LATEST MOVE TO REVERSE KEY TRUMP POLICIES

""We've been sounding this alarm during the entire Biden campaign that if he did what he promised he was going to do, we would see a crisis that would make 2019 pale in comparison,"" he said on ""Fox News @ Night"" last week.

Biden has moved quickly on immigration, ending construction of the wall, halting Trump-era travel bans, proposing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, moving to increase refugee caps and ordering a review of MPP.

FAIR, which has been supportive of many of Trump’s policies -- and frequently urged him to go further to reform U.S. immigration law, particularly on issues related to legal immigration -- has been similarly critical of Biden’s immigration policies since he took office.

""There are very few people with as much front-line knowledge of immigration policy as Mark,"" FAIR President Dan Stein said in a statement. ""As we reckon with an administration that appears to be bent on dismantling immigration enforcement and exercising executive power to maximize immigration even during a period of crisis and high unemployment, and efforts in Congress to grant mass amnesty to tens of millions of illegal aliens, Mark is uniquely qualified to assess the impact of those policies.""

The move to FAIR comes after Morgan, along with former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and former deputy acting Secretary Ken Cuccinelli joined the Heritage Foundation as fellows in the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy -- although Morgan’s role at FAIR is expected to be more extensive.

He joins FAIR just as Republicans have been warning already of a rising immigration crisis. A letter to Biden from 51 Republicans on Tuesday said sources on the ground have told them that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have seen the average daily flow of migrants at the border surge to more than 3,500 a day from 2,000 last month.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mark-morgan-joins-federation-for-american-immigration-reform,N/A
NHL backtracks after Florida Gov. Ron Desantis' office blasts league for 'discriminatory' job fair,"After Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' office blasted the National Hockey League for hosting a ""discriminatory"" job fair that only allows certain groups of people to attend, the league backtracked and said the event is open to all individuals over 18-years-old.

The event, titled ""Pathway to Hockey Summit"" is scheduled for on Feb. 2 during the 2023 All Star Festivities in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and seeks to help ""diverse job seekers who are pursuing careers in hockey.""

According to a now-deleted post by the NHL promoting the event on LinkedIn, the event is only open to certain groups of people.

""Participants must be 18 years of age or older, based in the U.S., and identify as female, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, LGBTQIA+, and/or a person with a disability. Veterans are also welcome and encouraged to attend,"" the event description states.

NHL COACH BANS IPADS FROM BENCH: 'IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM'

In a statement, Bryan Griffin, press secretary for DeSantis, said that the event is discriminatory.

""Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida, and we do not abide by the woke notion that discrimination should be overlooked if applied in a politically popular manner or against a politically unpopular demographic. We are fighting all discrimination in our schools and our workplaces, and we will fight it in publicly accessible places of meeting or activity,"" Griffin said.

DAMAR HAMLIN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS SINCE CARDIAC ARREST: 'THE LOVE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING'

Griffin also said that the NHL should ""immediately remove and denounce the discriminatory prohibitions it has imposed on attendance to the 2023 ‘Pathway to Hockey’ summit.""

""The Pathway to Hockey Summit is an informational and networking event designed to encourage all individuals to consider a career in our game – and, in particular, alert those who might not be familiar with hockey to the opportunities it offers,"" the NHL spokesperson said.

The NHL deleted the event posting from its LinkedIn account on Friday night.

In a further clarification, the spokesperson said the event is open to anyone ages 18 and older.

The Thursday outing included First Lady Casey DeSantis, DeSantis' 2-year-old daughter Mamie, and 4-year-old son Mason — who sported a Tom Brady Tampa Bay Buccaneers jersey. His 6-year-old daughter Madison did not attend.

""The Florida State Fair brings Floridians together and gives us an opportunity to thank farmers for their hard work. I was glad to be able to kick it off this year!"" DeSantis posted on Twitter after attending the event.

BALANCE OF POWER: GOP HOLDS BIG ADVANTAGE IN STATE LEGISLATURES NATIONWIDE DESPITE HISTORIC DEMOCRAT WIN

DeSantis frequently drops in on local small businesses, and was especially known for doing so after reopening the state following the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic while touting the state's economic success.

The rumored 2024 presidential candidate maintains high popularity in the state that has trended further towards Republicans in recent years, and has become increasingly popular with Republicans across the country.

Stacey Abrams' group funnels thousands to director's family and friends with no political experience,"A group launched by Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams is doling out thousands in payments to its director's family and friends who do not appear to have political experience and maintain other full-time jobs, records reviewed by Fox News Digital show.

The Abrams-founded Fair Fight PAC is funneling the cash to individuals close to her longtime aide Andre Fields, who acts as the PAC's political director. When reached for comment, a Fair Fight spokesperson said they are launching an internal investigation into the matter.

""Fair Fight strives to operate with the utmost integrity, as is core to our values,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""We take these matters very seriously and have initiated a comprehensive investigation. Personnel will remain on leave pending the outcome.""

Fields' sister, Darius Faulk, is one of the cash recipients. The Fair Fight PAC has disbursed more than $120,000 to her for training consultant services since August 2021, Federal Election Commission records show.

STACEY ABRAMS' CAMPAIGN HAS SPENT OVER $1.2M ON PRIVATE SECURITY SINCE DECEMBER

Faulk appears to have practically no political experience. She's worked for Hofstra University's women's basketball program since 2017, serving as its director of operations before landing a promotion to assistant coach, according to the school's athletic website.

The Fair Fight PAC has also paid Fields' close friends. In a 2019 interview with Voyage Atlanta, Fields named Asa Fludd and Cruz Alvarado among his close confidants, and both have hauled in tens of thousands of dollars from Abrams' PAC.

Fludd has collected $29,800 in training consulting payments from the committee since 2021, its filings show. Her LinkedIn indicates that she also does not have experience in the political world and works in computer systems training. Alvarado, meanwhile, has also pocketed around $29,000 for training consulting in 2021 and 2022 while working in the event industry, according to her LinkedIn profile.

While the three combined to receive more than $178,000 from the Fair Fight PAC for training consulting services, a search of records shows that they have not received consulting payments from other federal political committees.

Abrams founded Fair Fight Action — a 501(c)4 nonprofit — in 2018 to address voter suppression in the wake of her loss to now-Governor Brian Kemp. Fair Fight Action's operation expanded in 2019 to include a political arm in the form of Fair Fight PAC.

GEORGE SOROS PROVIDES ANOTHER $1M BOOST TO STACEY ABRAMS' CANDIDACY

Since 2018, the Fair Fight network has helped Abrams lay the groundwork for her second run against Kemp for the governor's mansion.

The Fair Fight PAC paid Atlanta-based private security company Executive Protection Agencies (EPA Security) over $550,000 between July 2021 and November 2021 and more than $1.2 million over the course of the year, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

Abrams faced some fire over the private security payments, with critics citing her opposition to the ""privatization of justice"" and past support for gun control and the defund-the-police movement.

The campaign has been an uphill battle for Abrams as she trails behind Kemp in the polls, and the national attitude toward Democrats is sour.

STACEY ABRAMS RECEIVED SIX-FIGURE INCOME FROM MYSTERIOUS CORPORATE ENTITY

A September Fox News poll showed Kemp leading Abrams by seven points, with independent voters breaking for the Republican incumbent by 12 points.

The Georgia Democrat refused to concede the race to Kemp and accused him of engaging in voter suppression while overseeing the election as secretary of state. However, Abrams has admitted she has ""no empirical evidence"" to prove the allegations.

"Supreme Court and artistic expression: Justices debate celebrities, photographs and 'transformative' fair use","Celebrity figures and contested copyrights combined for a spirited oral argument at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case that is testing the meaning and message behind ""transformative art.""

The justices debated for nearly two hours in a public session over an image of late music superstar Prince created by equally famous late artist Andy Warhol. Photographer Lynn Goldsmith took an iconic 1981 photograph of the singer, which Warhol later used to create a series of silkscreen images that illustrated magazine profiles.

At issue is whether a work of art is transformative if it conveys a different meaning or message from its source material or instead whether courts cannot consider the meaning if it ""recognizably derives from"" its source material.

The outcome will have enormous financial and artistic implications in a range of media — including photography, computer-generated graphic art, movie adaptions, television sequels, even news and documentaries.

SUPREME COURT DENIES APPEAL OF DYLANN ROOF, SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR MURDERS AT SC BLACK CHURCH

The court gave no clear signal how it would rule, and tough questions were posed from the bench by all the justices.

Warhol ""was a transformative artist because he took a bunch of photographs, and he made them mean something completely different. And that's why he's hanging up on those museums,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""That's why it's hard to look at it and not say ... that's 'transformation.'""

But Justice Amy Coney Barrett criticized the lawyer arguing for the Andy Warhol Foundation, saying his interpretation of copyright law ""risks stretching the concept of transformation so broadly that it kind of eviscerates"" the current legal tests for determining a violation.

The court reached no consensus over an admittedly subjective inquiry – just when derivative art crosses a line into a copyright violation. Under the ""fair use"" doctrine, an artist's copyrighted work can be appropriated under certain conditions — a legal standard designed to foster further creativity and freedom of expression. Such ""transformative"" works can be used in commentary, criticism, even parody. It allows an artist like Warhol to license his images without Goldsmith's permission and without paying her.

That standard has long been debated in the courts, and here the justices are being asked to clarify the standard in the digital age, when artificial intelligence and digital technology makes transforming art easier and more pervasive.

Several justices openly pondered whether their role was to be an art critic, divining the meaning of disputed works.

‘GENIUS OF PRINCE’ ARTWORK THE FOCUS OF SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTS IN COPYRIGHT CASE

Goldsmith has worked in several artistic mediums but is best known for her photographs of rock music artists gracing the covers of magazines and album covers. She captured Prince on assignment for Newsweek magazine when his career was gaining traction, and she describes her studio portrait as capturing the musician's ""vulnerable"" side. That particular photo was not used by the news magazine, and Goldsmith held onto it and other images.

Three years later, when Prince's ""Purple Rain"" album and movie made him a superstar, ""Vanity Fair"" magazine commissioned Warhol to illustrate a profile article.

Warhol was well known for putting unique artistic twists on existing pop-culture subjects, from actress Marilyn Monroe to Campbell's Soup cans. The Warhol Foundation, which was sued by Goldsmith for copyright infringement, describes him as an ""avant-garde artist and a philanthropic visionary."" The foundation itself says, ""We value risk-taking; we stand behind work that is challenging in nature, and encourage others to do the same.""

Warhol was asked by the magazine to use Goldsmith's photo as an ""artist's reference"" when creating his interpretive collage. Goldsmith was paid a $400 licensing fee by Conde Nast, the ""Vanity Fair"" publisher of the 16 silkscreens that use the same headshot of Prince, with varying shades and color derivations and hand-drawn outlines. The work has been sold and reproduced in various forms over the years.

In 2016, following the singer's death, ""Vanity Fair"" published a special tribute issue called, ""The Genius of Prince,"" which included a different Warhol image – the ""Orange Prince"" – on the commemorative cover. The Warhol Foundation was paid a $10,250 licensing fee. Goldsmith was not paid or given a published credit.

It was that second use that prompted Goldsmith to sue.

The Warhol Foundation says the Warhol work of art was ""transformative"" because it was thematically different from the original photo and presented a new artistic aesthetic that the average audience would distinguish. The group's lawyer told the court that the Goldsmith photo was merely a foundational reference and that Warhol's work gave an entirely new meaning of how Prince should be viewed within his celebrity status, now ""a flat, impersonal, disembodied, mask-like appearance.""

But a federal appeals court in New York concluded that Warhol's work was ""substantially similar"" to the original photo and ruled for Goldsmith.

In the Supreme Court, the justices worried about the implications for both sides.

""If you put them side by side, the message is not the same. The one is Prince's hair is like this. His expression is like that. The other one's entirely different,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""That's a [Goldsmith] picture of Prince, and this is a [Warhol] work of art sending a message about modern society.""

ENOUGH ALREADY — BIDEN, DEMS AND REPUBLICANS SHOULD STOP TEARING DOWN THE SUPREME COURT

""Very often, a popular song will be originally performed by one artist and then other artists come along and perform it in a very different way. Presumably, they think that they are conveying a different meaning or message when they alter the way it's performed,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""Is it possible that any of them would not be infringing the original copyright?""

Among the creative hypotheticals raised by the lawyers and justices in the argument were the ""Mona Lisa"" painting, actress Elizabeth Taylor and the ""Mork & Mindy"" TV spinoff show.

Several members of the court suggested throwing the case back to the lower courts without fully resolving the larger legal questions presented. The justices in 1994 ruled that a version of Roy Orbison's classic song ""Pretty Woman"" by the hip-hop group 2 Live Crew amounted to parody and was protected by fair use.

The current case has attracted a wide variety of amicus – or supporting – briefs from a range of interest groups, including libraries, museums, digital licensing firms, the motion picture industry, even Dr. Seuss Enterprises.

As for Prince, count at least one justice an admirer.

""Let's say that I'm both a Prince fan, which I was in the '80s …"" said Justice Clarence Thomas, introducing a hypothetical.

Justice Kagan playfully jumped in, asking, ""No longer?""

Thomas paused and suppressed a giggle. ""Well – so only on Thursday night."" His colleagues and the courtroom burst into laughter.

He continued, ""But let's say that I'm also a Syracuse [University] fan and I decide to make one of those big blowup posters of ‘Orange Prince’ and change the colors a little bit around the edges and put 'Go Orange' underneath"" for the school's colors. Would you sue me for infringement?"" he asked one of the attorneys, who said that was a real possibility.

""I think my colleague, Justice Thomas, needs a lawyer,"" added Justice Sonia Sotomayor a few minutes to even louder courtroom laughter. ""And I'm going to provide it.""

"Trump: ‘New and fair’ NAFTA pact only way to stop steel, aluminum tariffs","President Trump signaled Monday that the only way he won’t slap new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is if a “new and fair” North American Free Trade Agreement is signed.

“Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed,” Trump tweeted.

Said Trump: “We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs.”

Trump announced Thursday he plans to institute tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum this week, arguing it will level the playing field for American companies and help them expand after plant closings in recent years. The president said he decided on tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum.

AS TARIFF BATTLE HEATS UP, TRUMP SAYS US STEEL, ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES 'DEAD'

Amid criticism from usual Republican allies, Trump has also rebuffed U.S. allies who have pushed to be exempted from the stiff duties. While his rhetoric has been focused on China, the duties will also cover significant imports from Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union.

The stock market dipped 600 points in the hours following Trump’s announcement, and businesses -- including auto and boat manufacturers, the beer industry and machinery companies -- were quick to denounce the move.

“Business Roundtable strongly disagrees with today’s announcement because it will hurt the U.S. economy and American companies, workers and consumers by raising prices and resulting in foreign retaliation against U.S. exporters,"" Joshua Bolten, president of the influential Business Roundtable, said in a statement.

“Also, Canada must treat our farmers much better,” Trump tweeted Monday. “Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.”

Trump’s protectionist policy will be made official in the next two weeks, White House officials said Sunday, as the administration defended the decision from critics in Washington and overseas.

Trump appeared unbowed Sunday, as he tweeted that American ""Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it's time for a change!""

During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, saying it has killed jobs in the United States.

Representatives from the United States, Canada and Mexico are meeting Monday for more NAFTA negotiations.

White House admits 'fair amount' of US equipment in Afghanistan in Taliban hands,"National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that a ""fair amount"" of U.S. weaponry had fallen into the hands of the Taliban since the hard-line Islamic militant group's rapid takeover Afghanistan in recent days.

During a White House press briefing, Sullivan was ask what will happen with the billions of dollars in equipment, including guns, ammunition and helicopters given to the Afghanistan government in the two decades before its collapse.

TOP BIDEN OFFICIAL ADMITS FALL OF AFGHANISTAN 'UNFOLDED AT UNEXPECTED SPEED'

""We don't have a complete picture, obviously, of where every article of defense materials has gone,"" the Biden adviser answered briefly. ""But certainly, a fair amount of it has fallen into the hands of the Taliban, and, obviously, we don’t have a sense that they are going to readily hand it over to us at the airport.""

Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., told Fox News in an interview Sunday night that the situation in Afghanistan is worse than it was before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and that the Taliban now ""have access to massive caches of heavy weaponry, artillery, armored vehicles, ammunition,"" given how rapidly insurgents were able to sweep the country with little resistance by Afghan forces.

Sullivan admitted in an interview Monday that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan ""unfolded at unexpected speed"" but defended President Biden's handling of the withdrawal.

""The president did not think it was inevitable that the Taliban were going to take control of Afghanistan,"" Sullivan said. ""He thought the Afghan national security forces could step up and fight because we spent 20 years, tens of billions of dollars, training them, giving them the best equipment, giving them support of U.S. forces for 20 years.""

""When push came to shove, they decided not to step up and fight for their country,"" Sullivan said, adding that the president was faced with the question of whether U.S. men and women should be ""put in the middle of another country’s civil war when their own army won’t fight to defend them?""

Girl Power! Three Young Women Crowned Winners of Google Science Fair,"Yesterday three young women beat out some of the country’s smartest youngsters to be crowned winners of Google’s inaugural science fair.

In all, 15 science-fair finalists put their projects on display in Google headquarters for more than 1,000 onlookers as well as an esteemed panel of judges including a Nobel Laureate, National Geographic Explorers, and some of Google’s own.

The tech giant searched through more than 7,500 entries from more than 10,000 students in 91 countries. In the end, the judges picked just three winners – all of whom were girls.

""This year was all about girl power,"" Google declared.

In the 13-to-14 age group, Lauren Hodge won for her project studying varying carcinogen levels in grilled chicken -- depending on sauce type.

In the 15-to-16 age range, Naomi Shah tried to prove that tweaking the environment indoors can improve air quality and lessen people's reliance on asthma medication.

The Grand Prize winner (and winner in the 17-to-18 age group) was Shree Bose, who found a way to improve ovarian cancer treatment for patients when they have built up a resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs.

“Our judges said the unifying elements of all three young women were their intellectual curiosity, their tenaciousness and their ambition to use science to find solutions to big problems,” Google explained in a blog post announcing the winners. “They examined complex problems and found both simple solutions that can be implemented by the general public ... as well as more complex solutions that can be addressed in labs by doctors.”

For the girls, it was the experience of a lifetime.

""When you first walk in there's this table with all the judges -- the room is full of these judges who are incredible scientists, experts in their field -- and you just stand in front of them and spend 5 minutes, just explaining your project -- just like they're normal people. And then they ask you questions and you're like, 'I'm being asked questions by a Nobel Laureate!'"" said Shree Bose, who won the Google grand prize.

""I feel way way beyond excited!"" she gushed. Right now in my mind, it's a mixture of disbelief, excitement, and shock! It's the biggest opportunity of my life.""

For her efforts, Bose won a $50,000 scholarship, a trip to the Galapagos Islands and an internship at the European Organization for Nuclear Research.",https://www.foxnews.com/science/girl-power-three-young-women-crowned-winners-of-google-science-fair,N/A
Young genius: Winners of 2012 Google Science Fair announced,"They are some of the best ideas in the world -- and the inventors have yet to graduate from high school.

Google announced the winners of the 2012 Google Science Fair Tuesday morning, highlighting the work of 21 students, some as young as 13, and the innovative projects they developed -- from cancer research to vertical farming to 3D electronics to dementia research.

Grand prize winner Brittany Wenger, a 17-year-old high school junior from Lakewood Ranch, Fla., built a cloud-based tool to help doctors accurately diagnose breast cancer. The software compares individual test results to an extensive dataset stored online, allowing doctors to assess tumors using a minimally-invasive procedure.

“My enthusiasm for science continues to blossom,” Wenger said in a recent interview. “I expect to major in computer science when I attend college and continue to medical school.”

[pullquote]

Jonah Kohn, a 14-year-old from San Diego, Calif., won in his age group for creating a device that converts sound into tactile vibrations. It aims to make music for the hearing impaired.

“I’m passionate about music and have been playing the guitar for five years,” Kohn explained. “The goal of my device is to improve the quality of life for people with hearing loss, especially severe hearing loss.”

A trio of 15- and 16-year-olds won in the final age group for a project to study the hidden microscopic life in a drop of fresh water. Iván Hervías Rodríguez, Marcos Ochoa and Sergio Pascual sought to explain how those organisms influence our environment.

""The judges were impressed with the quality of all the projects this year -- and by the ingenuity, dedication and passion of the young scientists who created them,"" wrote Google's Cristin Frodella in a blog post announcing the winners.

We applaud every contestant who submitted a project to the 2012 Google Science Fair and look forward to seeing the innovations, inventions and discoveries of young scientists in the years to come.""

In the 2011 inaugural event, three young women beat out some of the country’s smartest youngsters with projects studying carcinogen levels in grilled chicken (depending on sauce type), studying the effect of the environment indoors on reliance on asthma medication, and improving ovarian cancer treatment.

""This year was all about girl power,"" Google said at the time.

"Bud Grant: NFL should toughen up, reduce fair catches and kneeldowns","Bud Grant, 95, is practically older than the NFL itself. So when the former Minnesota Vikings coach and Hall of Famer speaks, it’s worth a listen.

And Grant did in fact speak — specifically about the rules as they relate to quarterback kneeldowns and the kicking game. Basically, he thinks it’s all gotten too soft. So he would like to see the league find a way to reduce kneeldowns and touchbacks, and yes, even fair catches.

""I would complain to people about the idea that when the trailing team was out of timeouts, the quarterback starts kneeling down and the fans are leaving,"" Grant told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, adding that the answer was always, ‘There’s nothing that can be done about it.’ I kept thinking about it and decided, ‘Yes, there is. The team on offense has to make a yard — 1 yard — or the clock stops. A few things can happen when trying to make a yard. You can get stuffed. You can fumble. You can get a penalty. And you keep the fans interested.""

Prior to coaching the Vikings, Grant was the main man on the sideline with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League, winning four Grey Cups. In the CFL, there’s no such thing as a fair catch.

""I attended enough meetings to know the NFL wants to avoid admitting Canadian football has a better idea about anything. Yet, they should follow Canada and take away the fair catch,"" Grant said. ""There’s no fair catch in Canada, but the coverage also has to give the returner 5 yards. NFL people hear this and they’ll say, ‘It will increase injuries.’ The 5-yard cushion makes all the difference. My opinion is there won’t be a real increase in injuries, and the punt would become an interesting play.""

And don’t even get him started on players kneeling in the end zone on kickoffs.

""Why bother, if your goal is to make the kickoff the most-nothing play in football? They say it’s about safety. Injuries happen on every play,"" Grant said. ""They have made several changes on the way you can block on the kickoff. They can keep those. But you wait three minutes through a timeout, they come back, kick off, walk the ball out to 25.""

""It’s ridiculous,"" he added. ""Move the kickoff back 5 yards [to the 30], and if you don’t bring it out, you don’t get rewarded with the 25. You get the ball at the 15.""

Career fair helps former NFL players find new careers,"The premise that every NFL player leaves the sport a rich man is as accurate as believing a football is round.

Yes, there are hundreds of players who earn millions upon millions of dollars — the guys at the top of the profession whose careers last far longer than the average.

Then there are the thousands of men who in their 20s or early 30s leave the game with a nice enough nest egg, but must find a way to support themselves and their families for the rest of their lives.

The NFL Player Care Foundation, established in 2007 with the mission of helping former players improve their quality of life, has created the Super Bowl Career Fair. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the third edition this year was conducted remotely through a career portal that allows employers to post potential employment opportunities directly to those former players. More than 40 national businesses took part in February, including PepsiCo, where Cleo Lemon, a quarterback with three NFL teams has been employed since last September, and Tony Dixon, a four-year defensive back with the Cowboys, has been on staff since 2009.

In his current role as director of customer management, Dixon helps recruit ex-NFLers to his company at the career fair. For years, he noticed a reluctance on the part of Fortune 500 corporations to go after athletes.

""It has taken the athletes who have had a successful career in these organizations to get the organizations to recognize the value they can bring, and they are adding tremendous value to these organizations,"" Dixon says. ""As many skills as we are taught through sports, they are very transferable to any organization. How to persevere. How to deal with pressure. How to have a short memory. How to be a good teammate.

""That is the gap that we have. The NFL is a wonderful experience to have, but if you are not in the top percentage of most teams, you do not have facial recognition and might not have name recognition.""

And those former players have had to fight against preconceived notions that they are nothing more than athletes. That they aren't intelligent enough. That they don't possess those transferable abilities.

""I span the gap as a person who has been there and done that and can relate to their experience,"" Dixon adds. ""I don’t care how many years they played, they wanted to play more. I don't care how much money they made, they wanted to make more. Let’s talk about transferable skills that you have. Most people have no clue how to bring it out.""

The career fair helps on both levels. The ex-players get a chance to present their talents that are applicable in the business world. Companies such as Microsoft, SiriusXM, Lowe's, and FedEx Ground — plus the NFL itself and nine teams — have organized opportunities to interview and recruit in a large scope.

Lemon held some NFL coaching internships and was a quarterbacks coach at Jacksonville State from 2017-2020. The work commitments took him away from too much family time, so he attended last year's career fair in Miami.

""I went with an open mind and with my resumes, and really the idea of what I was looking for, but I didn’t know what would be offered or what the opportunities would be,"" Lemon says. ""The career fair was very informative.

""For me, what it has represented is a chance to put myself out there for companies who are looking for young and talented individuals trying to expand outside their comfort zone ... and get to know people from different organizations and see that what they were doing aligned with my principles. The fair was a tool that helped me take advantage of my opportunities.""

He was hired by PepsiCo out of the Miami fair.

Tony Simmons, a receiver in the NFL, CFL and Arena Football as well as a former college track star, wouldn't seem to have needed the career fair after building his own successful business, 6 Point Athletics. But the pandemic has played havoc on the fitness training industry, and with this year's fair held remotely, Simmons signed up.

He already has a Masters degree in Project Management and has worked on six continents. Yet Simmons prospered from attending.

""Sometimes you need to see yourself on a corporate level,"" Simmons says. ""As players we have not worked on a corporate level, and I have been away from that corporate world for years. Maybe it's something I might have to switch over to.""

Simmons talked to PepsiCo, Microsoft, SiriusXM and EA Sports among others. He believes the vigor of a former pro athlete is advantageous in any interviews — and on the job.

""It's nice to have people see you as Tony, as something different and with something that you are interested in, not as a football player,"" he says. ""They loved the mentality of the athlete. Our energy levels are really high, we can learn anything. We learned a 150-page playbook in a week, so if we can learn highly complex plays, we can learn code and all this stuff.""

A total of 153 former players had at least one conversation with a potential employer. None of those might have happened without the NFL Player Care Foundation Super Bowl Career Fair.

""I looked at the NFL as a head start on life, to do something I love, something I trained my entire life to play in the NFL,"" Lemon says. ""I made lifelong friends, but it is a small portion of your life.

""Job shadowing and internships and setting them up, the transition can be hard and finding out what you really want to do. I think the NFL is doing a great job of preparing guys for life after football.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/career-fair-helps-former-nfl-players-find-new-careers,N/A

"Kentucky boy, 10, wins science fair project after 'proving' New England Patriots QB Tom Brady is a ‘cheater’","Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is a cheater -- it's science.

So says Millcreek Elementary School, in Lexington, Ky., which named 10-year-old Ace Davis the winner of the school's science fair for his project 'proving' Brady cheated during the 2015 AFC Championship game.

Davis, who also plays quarterback for the school's football team, titled his project: “Is Tom Brady a cheater?” It focused on the Patriots star's use of under-inflated footballs during the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots beat the Colts, 45-7, in that matchup, advancing to (another) Super Bowl and winning it (again). The next season, however, the star quarterback received a four-game suspension and the Patriots were fined $1 million for the scandal known as “Deflategate.” That penalty barely fazed the Pats, however. New England again won the Super Bowl that season, completing an all-time comeback against the Atlanta Falcons to capture Brady's fifth title with the team.

LASER MAY HAVE BEEN POINTED AT TOM BRADY DURING AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME

But Davis decided he would succeed where the NFL had barely made a dent. Why?

“Because I hate Tom Brady,” Davis told NFL Draft Diamonds. “He’s been accused of cheating before. I want him to be caught.""

Davis -- and the league -- believed the deflated footballs helped give Brady an advantage during the 2015 game. To test his theory, the boy threw footballs with different amount of air in them to see which would go the farthest. He determined the football with the least amount of air went the farthest.

Davis’s conclusion read: “The Patriots were found guilty of doctoring footballs, thus losing $1,000,000.00 and future draft picks. Tom Brady is indeed a cheater.” Davis' school apparently agreed.

NCAA tells California governor college athlete 'fair pay' bill is 'unconstitutional',"The NCAA warned California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday that allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness would be ""unconstitutional"" and would upend the balance of college sports. In a letter, the athlete association asked him to reject the passage of a bill that would make it easier for players to make money.

The state Assembly on Monday voted 72-0 to pass the bill, which is championed by many athletes in the collegiate and professional ranks, such as Lebron James. The state Senate passed the measure Wednesday 39-0.

California is home to 58 NCAA-member schools, the NCAA said, including powerhouse programs at USC, Stanford and UCLA. Newsom has 30 days to sign or veto the legislation. If he does nothing, the bill becomes law.

NCAA SHOULD PAY COLLEGE ATHLETES, KENTUCKY GOVERNOR SAYS

The NCAA is the top governing body for college sports. Membership is voluntary. Athletes can get valuable scholarships, but the NCAA has long banned paying athletes to preserve the academic missions of colleges and universities.

""It would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics,"" the NCAA Board Of Governors said in a letter to the Democratic governor. ""These outcomes are untenable and would negatively impact more than 24,000 California student-athletes across three divisions.""

Ohio State President Michael Drake, who chairs the board of governors, told USA Today that the association would consider legal action if the bill becomes law.

The bill would allow college athletes to hire agents and be paid for their image, likeness and names.

""Let's be real. College sports is a multibillion-dollar industry,"" said Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat who authored the bill. ""Perhaps some athletes would finish their college degree before they went pro if we allowed this.""

NCAA SAYS IT MAY BAN CALIFORNIA COLLEGES FROM CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES OVER ATHLETE PAY BILL

California universities and the NCAA would also be barred from prohibiting athletes from taking money. The law would take effect in 2023.

The Pac-12 conference, which includes USC, UCLA and Stanford, sided with the NCAA and asked the state legislature to delay debate on the bill.

""We all want to protect and support our student-athletes, and the Pac-12 has played a leadership role in national reforms for student-athletes over the past years,” the NCAA said. “The question is what’s the best way to continue to support our student-athletes. We think having more information and informed views will be helpful.”

The debate over paying college athletes has raged in recent years as some schools rake in millions from their athletic programs -- mostly from football and basketball. Many college basketball athletes have left school early to sign lucrative NBA contracts.

The league now requires players to be at least one year removed from high school before entering the draft.

The NCAA has a history of coming down hard on players for receiving compensation or gifts of any kind.

Donald De La Haye, a former University of Central Florida kicker, had his football scholarship taken away by the school in 2017 because of the revenue he was generating from his YouTube channel. The NCAA determined his videos were a violation of eligibility rules, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel got into trouble with the NCAA for allegedly signing autographs for money. He was suspended for the first half of the first game of the 2013 season for violating an NCAA bylaw about athletes' use of names and images, but it was later made clear Manziel didn’t receive money for the autographs.

‘Not fair’: World cycling bronze medalist cries foul after transgender woman wins gold,"The American bronze medalist who lost a world-championship cycling race to a transgender woman from Canada has criticized the results as unfair.

""First transgender woman world champion...ever,"" Rachel McKinnon, an assistant professor of philosophy at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, bragged Sunday in a tweet that set off a massive debate.

McKinnon gave a talk at the College of Charleston earlier this year asking: “Is it fair for transwomen athletes to compete in women’s categories?”

While McKinnon argues it is, given the rules and regulations adopted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the bronze medalist felt another way at the finish of the world championships.

“It’s definitely NOT fair,” Jennifer Wagner, the third-place finisher from Houston, said in response to a tweet from British conservative Katie Hopkins.

Hopkins tweeted an image of the three cyclists on the podium with this caption: “For clarity – this was the WOMENS world championships. I repeat. Women’s. Congratulations to the brave faces of silver & bronze. The world is gripped by a febrile madness.”

Carolien van Herrikhuyzen, the silver medalist representing the Netherlands and a friend of McKinnon, disagreed.

“No one is a transgender to steal anyone’s medal,” van Herrikhuyzen wrote. “We had an honest race under UCI rules. If you compete you accept the rules, otherwise, don’t compete. I can only imagine what she had to go through in her life to be where she is now, how hard it is to fit in.”

Wagner snapped back: “Just because it’s a CURRENT UCI rule doesn’t mean it[‘s] fair or right. And rules can be changed.”

Four days later, after a firestorm of controversy, Wagner apologized to McKinnon, adding that she will work to get the rules changed offline to avoid more controversy.

“After having some time to reflect, I realize my twitter comments earlier this week unintentionally fanned the flames on a controversial situation, and that I regret,” Wagner wrote. “I made the comments out of a feeling of frustration, but they weren't productive or positive.”

Wagner added: “While I may not agree with the rules when I pin on a number I agree to race by them.”

And she ended: “I apologize, @rachelvmckinnon , for not properly congratulating you on race day. I hope you accept it a few days late. Congratulations and enjoy your off-season. Thanks, everyone, for reading.”

But McKinnon refused to accept her apology: “She merely apologizes for being caught saying it publicly. She wants to ban trans women from competing. They will fail…”

McKinnon labeled critics as “transphobic bigots” and pointed out that Wagner could face sanctions for allegedly violating the USA Cycling’s policy against harassment for “creating hostile environments or disparaging remarks against people on the basis of gender identity.”

As of 2015, IOC guidelines require biologically born men who identify as transgender to block certain amounts of natural testosterone, but no longer require gender reassignment surgery. McKinnon argues testing is against human rights because there is no way to measure if testosterone provides an advantage, instead pointing to civil rights.

“By catering to cisgender people’s views, that furthers transgender people’s oppression. When it comes to extending rights to a minority population, why would we ask the majority?” McKinnon told USA Today. “I bet a lot of white people were pissed off when we desegregated sports racially and allowed black people. But they had to deal with it.”",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/not-fair-world-cycling-bronze-medalist-cries-foul-after-transgender-woman-wins-gold,N/A
Rockets’ James Harden calls for ‘fair chance’ after no foul on slide-under,"The Houston Rockets’ James Harden blamed his team’s Sunday night loss against the Golden State Warriors-- at least in part-- on uncalled fouls, which he cautioned could lead to series-altering injuries.

Harden said he would have scored more but Warriors defenders kept sliding underneath him when he attempted three-pointers.

“I just want a fair chance, man,” Harden told reporters after the game. “We all know what happened a couple years back with Kawhi. Call the game how it’s supposed to be called, and that’s it. I’ll live with the results.”

With 11 seconds left on the fourth quarter, Harden attempted a game-tying three-pointer when the Warriors’ Draymond Green slid under him, but no foul was called. Per NBA rules, fouls can be called on defensive players for not giving enough room to shooters to safely land.

Asked to comment on Harden’s complaints, Green said, “I’ve been fouled by James on a James three-pointer before. I ain’t trying to hear that one. Nah, I ain’t going with that.”

8-Year-Old Dies After 'Fireball' Ride at Michigan County Fair,"An 8-year-old boy stopped breathing and died shortly after being on a ride at the Ionia Free Fair, according to the Ionia County sheriff's office.

Deputies were dispatched to the fair's midway about 10:20 p.m. Saturday to assist Blake Miller after he lost consciousness and collapsed.

Emergency personnel administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the Greenville child before taking him to Ionia County Memorial Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, the sheriff's office said in a news release.

An autopsy was performed but the results were incomplete. More forensic tests were planned.

The boy had ridden a swirling and swinging ride called ""Fireball"" shortly before he stopped breathing. The ride was later examined by an inspector from the state who determined it had no defects, deputies said.

Doug Clark, the fair's director, said Monday he was not aware of any previous ride-related deaths happening there, going back at least 30 years. The annual fair was first held in 1915.",https://www.foxnews.com/story/8-year-old-dies-after-fireball-ride-at-michigan-county-fair,N/A
Australian Slang 'Fair Dinkum' Gets Airline Passenger Into Trouble,"It's a phrase that's been uttered by both President George W. Bush and actor Paul Hogan, but Delta Air Lines apparently still doesn't like it said on its flights.

The term in question is the benign Australian phrase “fair dinkum,” which as an adjective means “real” and as an expression means “Seriously?” or “For real?”

Aussie Sophie Reynolds muttered the idiom this week on her Delta connection flight on SkyWest Airlines when she rejected the snack crackers offered, asked for pretzels instead and was told there weren’t any.

One person’s trash is another person’s treasure — and in this case, one person’s slang was another person’s swear word. The flight attendant misunderstood what Reynolds said and thought she was cursing at her.

The crew asked for her passport and told her swearing at attendants was against the law.

When Reynolds, 41, emerged from the plane in Pittsburgh, Pa., there were three uniformed police officers waiting for her to tell her about the federal rules prohibiting cursing at the flight crew.

But after chatting with authorities, Reynolds was allowed to go — and no charges were filed against her.

One linguist confirmed the definition of the common Australian phrase.

“It means real, authentic — the real McCoy,” offered University of Pennsylvania linguistics professor Anthony Kroch. “If you say it with a question intonation, it means ‘For real?’”

If it were actually an expletive, President Bush most likely wouldn't have uttered it in front of the Australian Parliament, the way he did in 2003 when he recalled a prior meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard.

""I called him a 'man of steel,'"" Bush told the Parliament. ""That's Texan for 'fair dinkum.'""

Similarly, Aussie ""Crocodile Dundee"" star Hogan probably wouldn't have cursed in a TV commercial trying to lure Americans to his homeland.

""America, you look like you need a holiday — a fair dinkum holiday,"" Hogan says in the 1980s-era tourism ad.

Kroch said miscommunications are common even when two people essentially speak the same language, since slang and dialect can vary so widely.

“Misunderstandings due to dialect differences are very common,” he said. “But I don’t think most people hearing something they don’t understand would assume it’s offensive.”

Reynolds told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she said “fair dinkum” out of frustration. The newspaper quoted the airline on Thursday as saying that SkyWest was still investigating the incident but Reynolds had exhibited other aggressive behavior during the flight.

Ordinary Aussies were surprised to hear the “fair dinkum” tale.

“I can’t see how it can be misconstrued,” said Penny Mapp, 37, an Australian who lives in New York. “It seems somewhat extreme.”

Mapp said “fair dinkum” is often used sarcastically, but never as cursing.

Swearing in and of itself is a special case anyway, according to Kroch.

“There’s no way to tell whether people are swearing just by their inflection,” he said. “If you use a swear word that the other person doesn’t know, it doesn’t count as swearing. Swearing is the use of taboo words. A word that you don’t know can’t be taboo.”

"At Ohio State Fair, butter brings Apollo 11's moonmen to life","For over a century, the Ohio State Fair has featured its signature sculpture of a cow and calf.

But this year? Someone had a butter idea.

Scott Higgins, CEO of the American Dairy Association Mideast, on Tuesday unveiled a group of themed sculptures celebrating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.

NASA REVEALS ITS VISION FOR THE ARTEMIS MOON LANDER THAT WILL RETURN US ASTRONAUTS TO THE LUNAR SURFACE

The Dairy Products Building at the state fairgrounds houses a life-size depiction of Neil Armstrong, a native of Wapakoneta, saluting the American flag he planted on the moon. Also on hand: the other Apollo 11 moonmen: Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, sitting next to a butter cow (it had a cattle ID tag with an embossed ""11"") and a calf (with Apollo ear tag).

“Those who remember the moon landing often recall exactly where they were and how they felt, and the 50th anniversary is the perfect time to pay tribute to this amazing event and share that excitement with a new generation,” Jenny Hubble, senior vice president of communications for the American Dairy Association Mideast, said in a statement. “Ohio also has a special connection to that day, as one of our own took the first-ever steps on the surface of the moon.”

Five artists ""churned out"" the statues through 500 hours of craftsmanship. The creamy smooth works will debut on Wednesday at the fair's opening.

Artists wear nitrate gloves to prevent the butter from breaking down, and use sculpting tools similar to those used for clay pottery, including metal chisels and scrapers, to mold the sculptures.

Most of the work is done by hand, using 2,200 pounds of spoiled butter that is donated by the Dairy Farmers of America and recycled after use to make biodiesel, animal feed, tires and cosmetics, according to a press release by the American Dairy Association Mideast. It began adding themed sculptures to accompany the cow and calf in the 1960s.

"Derek Chauvin appeals conviction in George Floyd murder, arguing trial wasn't fair","An attorney for Derek Chauvin appeared before an appeals court in Minnesota Wednesday to ask for the former Minneapolis police officer's convictions in the murder of George Floyd to be thrown out, arguing that legal and procedural errors hindered him from having a fair trial.

Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill had sentenced Chauvin to 22 1/2 years after jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25, 2020, death of Floyd, whom he pinned to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck.

Chauvin later pleaded guilty to a separate federal civil rights charge and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison. He is now serving that sentence in Arizona concurrent with his state sentence.

Chauvin's attorney for the appeal, William Mohrman, argued in his brief to the Minnesota Court of Appeals that the pretrial publicity was more extensive than that of any other trial in Minnesota history, and that the judge should have moved the trial elsewhere and sequestered the jury for the duration.

GEORGE FLOYD’S FAMILY READY TO TAKE APPLICATIONS FOR BUSINESS GRANTS

Mohrman wrote that the publicity, combined with riots, the city's $27 million settlement with Floyd's family announced during jury selection, the unrest over a police killing in a Minneapolis suburb during jury selection, and the unprecedented courthouse security were just some of the factors prejudicing Chauvin's chance of a fair trial.

He also argued that Cahill improperly excluded evidence that could have been favorable to Chauvin, and accused prosecutors of misconduct.

The prosecutors, which include state Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank and Neal Katyal, who was acting U.S. solicitor general during the Obama administration, are arguing that Chauvin's rights were not prejudiced.

They said in their brief that pretrial publicity had blanketed the state, making a change of venue for the trial pointless, and that Cahill took extensive steps to ensure the selection of impartial jurors. They also said he took sufficient steps to shield the jurors from outside influences so there was no need to sequester them before deliberations.

"Five Killed, Dozens Injured as Stage Collapses at Indiana State Fair","The summer evening at the Indiana State Fair turned strangely cold. The wind blew hard, then harder still, tearing the fabric from the roof of the wobbling grandstand stage.

The crowd, waiting under a thunderous sky for the country duo Sugarland to perform Saturday, had just been told over the loudspeakers that severe weather was possible. They were told where to seek shelter if an evacuation was necessary, but none was ordered. The show, it seemed, was to go on.

None of the phone calls workers had made to the National Weather Service prepared them for the 60 to 70 mph gust that blew a punishing cloud of dirt, dust and rain down the fairground's main thoroughfare. The massive rigging and lighting system covering the stage tilted forward, then plummeted onto the front of the crowd in a sickening thump.

Five people were killed, four of them at the scene, where dozens ran forward to help the injured while others ran for shelter out of fear that the devastation had only begun. Dozens of people -- including several children -- remained hospitalized Sunday, some with life-threatening injuries.

""Women were crying. Children were crying. Men were crying,"" fairgoer Mike Zent said.

More On This...

The fair canceled all activities Sunday as officials began the long process of determining what happened and fielded difficult questions about whether the tragedy could have been prevented.

""We're all very much in mourning,"" Cindy Hoye, the fair's executive director, said during a news conference Sunday. ""It's a very sad day at the state fair.""

Gov. Mitch Daniels called the accident an ""unthinkable tragedy"" and said the wind burst was a ""fluke"" that no one could have foreseen. Dan McCarthy, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Indiana, said the burst of wind was far stronger than gusts in other areas of the fairgrounds.

The seemingly capricious nature of the gust was evident Sunday at the fair, where crews placed a blue drape around the grandstand to block the view of the wreckage. A striped tent nearby appeared unscathed, as did an aluminum trailer about 50 yards away. The Ferris wheel on the midway also escaped damage.

First Sgt. Dave Bursten of the Indiana State Police said the lack of damage to structures on the fair's midway or elsewhere supported the weather service's belief that an isolated, significant wind gust caused the rigging to topple.

""All of us know without exception in Indiana the weather can change from one report to another report, and that was the case here,"" he said.

The stage toppled at 8:49 p.m. A timeline released by Indiana State Police shows that fair staff contacted the weather service four times between 5:30 and 8 p.m. At 8 p.m., the weather service said a storm with hail and 40 mph winds was expected to hit the fairgrounds at 9:15 p.m.

Bursten said fair officials had begun preparing in case they needed to evacuate visitors for the impending storm. At 8:30, additional state troopers moved to the grandstand to help in the event of an evacuation, according to the timeline.

Meteorologist John Hendrickson said it's not unusual for strong winds to precede a thunderstorm, and that Saturday's gust might have been channeled through the stage area by buildings on either side of the dirt track where the stage fell, at the bottom of the grandstand.

Fair officials said the Indiana Occupational Health and Safety Administration and state fire marshal's office were investigating. Bursten said the investigation could take months.

The owner of Mid-America Sound Corp., which installed the rigging, expressed sympathy for the families of those killed or injured. Kerry Darrenkamp also said the Greenfield, Ind.-based company had begun ""an independent internal investigation to understand, to the best of our ability, what happened.""

Zent, of Los Angeles, said the storm instantly transformed what had been a hot, sunny day.

""Just everything turned black. ... It was really cold, it was like winter, because I had been sweating all day. Wind blew over the ATM machine,"" Zent said.

He and his girlfriend, Jess Bates, were behind the grandstand when the heard a noise -- the stage collapse. They began running as the wind buffeted them.

Bates said a woman who had been in the second row of the concert with her teenage daughter grabbed her and sobbed as she recounted pulling her daughter to safety while others rushed forward to try to help those pinned beneath the scaffolding.

""She was gripping me very tight, and I could just feel her shaking,"" Bates said. ""She said, `My daughter is all I have in this world and I almost lost her tonight,""' Bates said.

Dr. Dean Silas, a gastroenterologist from Deerfield, Ill., said it took about five minutes to work his way from the grandstands to the track after the collapse. He saw three bodies covered with plastic when he arrived.

He said it took about 25 minutes for volunteers and emergency workers to remove victims from beneath the rigging and load them onto makeshift stretchers.

""There had to be 75 to 100 people there helping out,"" he said.

Bursten identified those killed as Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah; and two Indianapolis residents: 49-year-old Glenn Goodrich and 51-year-old Nathan Byrd. Byrd, a stagehand who was atop the rigging when it fell, died overnight.

Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland sent a statement to The Associated Press through her marketing manager, saying she watched video of the collapse on the news ""in horror.""

""I am so moved,"" she said. ""Moved by the grief of those families who lost loved ones. Moved by the pain of those who were injured and the fear of their families. Moved by the great heroism as I watched so many brave Indianapolis fans actually run toward the stage to try and help lift and rescue those injured. Moved by the quickness and organization of the emergency workers who set up the triage and tended to the injured.""

Jason Owen, who manages marketing, press and creative for the band, said Sugarland was in a prayer circle before their performance. The band members were held off stage by the tour manager because of the weather before the stage collapsed.

Sugarland -- Nettles and Kristian Bush -- canceled their Sunday show at the Iowa State Fair.

Concert-goers and other witnesses said an announcer warned them of impending bad weather but gave conflicting accounts of whether emergency sirens at the fair sounded. Some fair workers said they never heard any warnings.

""It's pathetic. It makes me mad,"" said groundskeeper Roger Smith. ""Those lives could have been saved yesterday.""

Fair spokesman Andy Klotz said the damage was so sudden and isolated that he wasn't sure sirens would have done any good.

Indiana is prone to volatile changes in weather. In April 2006, tornado-force winds hit Indianapolis just after thousands of people left a free outdoor concert by John Mellencamp held as part of the NCAA men's Final Four basketball tournament. And in May 2004, a tornado touched down south of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, delaying the start of the Indianapolis 500 and forcing a nearly two-hour interruption in the race.

Daniels stood by the fair and its officials as they prepared to reopen Monday with a public memorial service to honor the victims.

""This is the finest event of its kind in America, this is the finest one we've ever had, and this desperately sad ... fluke event doesn't change that,"" he said.

Florida mother arrested after leaving child in car while at job fair: police,"A 25-year-old Florida mother was arrested on Monday after she left her young child in a locked car while at a job fair, police said.

The woman, Amber Collier of Miami Gardens, has been charged with neglect of a child.

On Monday about 11:40 a.m., police said, they were called to a Sam’s Club about 25 minutes from Collier’s home “in reference to a child locked inside a vehicle” for more than an hour. Police said the store's staff notified officers.

When officers arrived, they saw the child inside the back seat and said she was “visibly upset,” according to a probable cause statement. Officers told the child to unlock the car.

Collier told police that she left her daughter in the car so she could participate in a job fair, according to court documents. She reportedly told police she gave her daughter her cellphone in case of emergency.

Police said Sam’s Club surveillance cameras showed Collier entering the store at 10:30 a.m. and not coming back out for more than an hour.

The car was left on and the air-conditioner was cooling the vehicle while Collier attended the job fair, according to police. The child was not seriously hurt, according to court documents.

Georgetown professor who wished death to GOP senators supporting Kavanaugh on leave,"An anti-Trump professor, Dr. Carol Christine Fair, is no longer teaching classes at Georgetown University following calls for the outspoken liberal educator to be fired.

Fair stirred up controversy on Twitter when she wished miserable deaths upon Republican senators supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

“Look at [this] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement,” she wrote. “All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”

Her account was de-verified and temporarily suspended Tuesday for violating Twitter’s rules, but until Friday, the university had taken no action against the controversial professor.

A Georgetown spokesperson told Fox News Fair is no longer teaching students, but will be traveling internationally for university research.

Joel Hellman, dean of the School of Foreign Services (SFS) where Fair is a distinguished associate professor, made the statement Friday afternoon pointing to the importance of a bias-free classroom where students can learn.

“To prevent further disruption to her students and out of an abundance of caution for the security of our community, we have mutually agreed for Professor Fair to go on research leave effective immediately,” Hellman wrote in a statement to the SFS community. “Professor Fair will accelerate previously scheduled international research travel.”

GEORGETOWN PROFESSOR SUSPENDED BY TWITTER AFTER CALL FOR ‘DEATHS’ OF GOP SENATORS, KAVANAUGH

While the university had previously supported Fair and said her comments were made in a private capacity, Hellman noted the legitimate concerns of the Georgetown community

“We can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery, profanity, and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse,” Hellman said.

Fair wrote on Twitter earlier this week that she does not and never has condoned violence.

‘LEFTIST MOB’ RIPS UP SIGNS, HURL EXPLETIVES AT CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS SUPPORTING KAVANAUGH

“My tweet, as I have explained, was an attempt to make YOU as UNCOMFORTABLE as I am using the language of the abuse I receive by the hundreds,” she said.

Days before, Fair went on a Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh, calling the embattled nominee a “rapist” and “perjurer.” She described the GOP as a “f---ing death cult” and “filthy swine.”",https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgetown-professor-who-wished-death-to-gop-senators-supporting-kavanaugh-on-leave,N/A

Hundreds Rampage Through Neighborhoods Surrounding Wisconsin State Fair,"Milwaukee police officers are investigating a string of mob-like actions involving a very large and unruly crowd near the Wisconsin State Fair Thursday night, where several people were badly injured and cars and homes were rampaged, Fox6 News reported.

Twenty-four people were arrested inside the fairgrounds after fights broke out, State Fair officials said. The violence continued after closing time outside the park.

State Fair Park CEO Rick Frenette said seven park police officers were injured, including two who were taken to the hospital.

Milwaukee Police said just after 11 p.m. they responded to complaints of an unruly mob attacking cars, people and leaving damage in its path.

Hundreds of young people left the fairgrounds and made their way down to the surrounding neighborhoods, smashing car windows, throwing rocks and beating people who were leaving the fair.

Several people were punched in the face, a child was pushed to the ground, one woman required stitches and another will need surgery for her injuries.

Police are continuing to search for suspects involved in the incident.

One witness said he saw a group of 20-30 young men attack someone walking by.

""A group came through and the guy was kind of not really looking and was making his way through the crowd like anybody else would, and just wound up on his knees and they wound up punching him,"" the witness said.

""I had one kid you know asking me to sit on my porch until it cleared up because he was afraid to walk by himself.""

Witnesses described the mobs as young African American teens. Milwaukee Aldermen Bob Donovan and Joe Dudzik released a bold statement on Friday about what they called a ""deteriorating African American culture in our city,"" Fox 6 News reported.

Frenette said there will be an increased police presence following disturbances at the fair and surrounding neighborhood. Frenette added that all of those under 18 attending the fair will have to be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian after 5 p.m.

"Indiana State Fair Honors 5 Dead, 40 Injured By Stage Collapse","Hundreds of friends and relatives gathered at the Indiana State Fairgrounds Monday for a memorial service to honor the five people who died when a strong gust of wind caused a stage to collapse on top of them.

Tearful mourners sobbed as they took their seats for the memorial at the fairground's Free Stage, surrounded by flags fluttering at half-staff. Gov. Mitch Daniels was scheduled to attend the ceremony at the fairground, which was closed for a day following the tragedy.

Wind gusts between 60 and 70 mph toppled the stage where an estimated 12,000 people were waiting to see the country band Sugarland on Saturday night. About four dozen people, some critically injured, were taken to hospitals.

Four of the victims died at the scene: Alina Bigjohny, 23, of Fort Wayne; Christina Santiago, 29, of Chicago; Tammy Vandam, 42, of Wanatah; and 49-year-old Glenn Goodrich of Indianapolis. Nathan Byrd, a 51-year-old stagehand from Indianapolis who was atop the rigging when it fell, died overnight.

Santiago managed programming for the Lesbian Community Care Project at Howard Brown Health Center in Chicago and was named to the Windy City Times' ""30 Under 30"" list in 2007.

Jamal M. Edwards, the center's president and CEO, said she was one of the organization's ""brightest stars"" and worked to improve the lives of women, especially those who were lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Santiago attended the concert with her partner, Alisha Brennon, who was severely injured, Edwards said.

Bigjohny had been recently hired to teach seventh grade in Muncie, The Journal Gazette of Fort Wayne reported.

""She was funny, spontaneous. She was just amazing,"" said Danielle Stoy, who attended Manchester College with Bigjohny. She said Bigjohny attended the concert with another friend, Jennifer Haskell, who also was critically injured.

The fair canceled all activities Sunday as officials began the long process of sorting out what happened and fielded difficult questions about whether the tragedy could have been prevented.

Daniels called the accident an ""unthinkable tragedy"" and said the wind burst was a ""fluke"" that no one could have foreseen. Dan McCarthy, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Indiana, said the gust was far stronger than those in other areas of the fairgrounds.

The seemingly capricious nature of the gust was evident Sunday at the fair, where crews placed a blue drape around the grandstand to block the view of the wreckage. A striped tent near the grandstand appeared unscathed, as did an aluminum trailer about 50 yards across from the grandstand. The Ferris wheel on the midway also escaped damage.

First Sgt. Dave Bursten of the Indiana State Police said the lack of damage to structures on the fair's midway or elsewhere supported the weather service's belief that an isolated, significant wind gust caused the rigging to topple.

""All of us know without exception in Indiana the weather can change from one report to another report, and that was the case here,"" he said.

The stage toppled at 8:49 p.m. Saturday. A timeline released by Indiana State Police shows that fair staff contacted the weather service four times between 5:30 and 8 p.m. At 8 p.m., the weather service said a storm with hail and 40 mph winds was expected to hit the fairgrounds at 9:15 p.m.

Bursten said fair officials had begun preparing in case they needed to evacuate visitors for the impending storm. At 8:30, additional state troopers moved to the grandstand to help in the event of an evacuation, according to the timeline.

Meteorologist John Hendrickson said it's not unusual for strong winds to precede a thunderstorm, and that Saturday's gust might have been channeled through the stage area by buildings on either side of the dirt track where the stage fell, at the bottom of the grandstand.

Fair officials said the Indiana Occupational Health and Safety Administration and state fire marshal's office were investigating. Bursten said the investigation could take months.

The owner of Mid-America Sound Corp., which installed the rigging, expressed sympathy for the families of those killed or injured. Kerry Darrenkamp also said the Greenfield, Ind.-based company had begun ""an independent internal investigation to understand, to the best of our ability, what happened.""

Mike Zent, of Los Angeles, said the storm instantly transformed what had been a hot, sunny day.

""Just everything turned black. ... It was really cold, it was like winter, because I had been sweating all day. Wind blew over the ATM machine,"" Zent said.

He and his girlfriend were behind the grandstand when the heard a noise -- the stage collapse. They began running as the wind buffeted them.

""Women were crying. Children were crying. Men were crying,"" he said.

Dr. Dean Silas, a gastroenterologist from Deerfield, Ill., said it took about five minutes to work his way from the grandstands to the track after the collapse. He saw three bodies covered with plastic when he arrived.

He said it took about 25 minutes for volunteers and emergency workers to remove victims from beneath the rigging and load them onto makeshift stretchers.

""There had to be 75 to 100 people there helping out,"" he said.

Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland sent a statement to The Associated Press through her marketing manager, saying she watched video of the collapse on the news ""in horror.""

""I am so moved,"" she said. ""Moved by the grief of those families who lost loved ones. Moved by the pain of those who were injured and the fear of their families. Moved by the great heroism as I watched so many brave Indianapolis fans actually run toward the stage to try and help lift and rescue those injured. Moved by the quickness and organization of the emergency workers who set up the triage and tended to the injured.""

Sugarland -- Nettles and Kristian Bush -- canceled their Sunday show at the Iowa State Fair.

Concert-goers and other witnesses said an announcer warned them of impending bad weather but gave conflicting accounts of whether emergency sirens at the fair sounded. Some fair workers said they never heard any warnings.

""It's pathetic. It makes me mad,"" said groundskeeper Roger Smith. ""Those lives could have been saved yesterday.""

Fair spokesman Andy Klotz said the damage was so sudden and isolated that he wasn't sure sirens would have done any good.

Indiana is prone to volatile changes in weather. In April 2006, tornado-force winds hit Indianapolis just after thousands of people left a free outdoor concert by John Mellencamp held as part of the NCAA men's Final Four basketball tournament. And in May 2004, a tornado touched down south of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, delaying the start of the Indianapolis 500 and forcing a nearly two-hour interruption in the race.

Daniels stood by the fair and its officials Sunday.

""This is the finest event of its kind in America, this is the finest one we've ever had, and this desperately sad ... fluke event doesn't change that,"" he said.

Lori Vallow Daybell's defense argues for 'fair trial' as so-called 'cult mom' smiles in court,"Lori Vallow Daybell's defense team on Tuesday said they ""just want a fair trial"" while making the case to split two conspiracy charges against Vallow in an Idaho district courtroom.

The so-called ""cult mom,"" who is accused of killing her children in 2019 and collecting social security benefits in her son's name after their deaths, smiled in and outside the Fremont County courtroom as her counsel argued to split up her conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit theft charges.

""I have issue with the state saying, ‘Hey, we can lump all these things into one conspiracy charge,’ and as long as they find one of these conspiracies, then the conspiracy is met,"" attorney John Thomas said during Tuesday's hearing. ""… It just jumbles it up. It doesn't make a lot of sense that way.""

ALLEGED ‘CULT MOM’ LORI VALLOW MENTALLY COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL, IDAHO JUDGE SAYS

Thomas added that he does not ""think it's fair for the jury to have to"" determine whether Vallow Daybell, 49, is guilty or not guilty of both conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit theft in the same case and that the two charges should be completely separated.

The attorney argued that Vallow Daybell's children, 7-year-old Joshua ""J.J."" Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, were killed in September 2019 while the alleged grand theft involving the collection of social security benefits with their information occurred between Oct. 1, 2019, and Jan. 22, 2020.

LORI VALLOW MURDER CASE PROCEEDINGS SUSPENDED AS COURT SAYS SHE 'LACKS FITNESS TO PROCEED'

Vallow Daybell and her husband, Chad Daybell, were indicted in late May 2021 on multiple counts each of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception, first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder related to the deaths of Tylee, J.J. and Chad Daybell's ex-wife, 49-year-old Tammy Daybell, officials announced at the time.

The pair is at the center of a tangled case that involves a bizarre apocalyptic religious belief that prosecutors claim the couple designed to justify the murders.

LORI VALLOW, CHAD DAYBELL 'DOOMSDAY' MURDERS: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS

The children were missing for several months — when police say the couple lied about the children’s whereabouts and then slipped away to Hawaii — before their bodies were found buried on Chad Daybell's property in rural Idaho.

""A person's life is on the line,"" Thomas said Tuesday regarding a potential life sentence for Vallow Daybell. ""The conspiracy to commit murder and grand theft are two separate conspiracies.""

The state is seeking the death penalty in Vallow Daybell's case due to the ""aggravating circumstances"" leading to her alleged crimes. Vallow Daybell's counsel is asking for a probable cause hearing to discuss the alleged ""aggravating circumstances"" as well as the conspiracy charges.

Meanwhile, the prosecution disagreed that the two conspiracy charges are confusing to the jury and unfair, adding that multiple cases have held that conspiracy is one crime that can contain multiple different facets.

""I don't believe this is fundamentally unfair. I think these are charges based on the evidence provided to the grand jury. They didn't have a problem with it. They found it,"" prosecutor Rob Wood said.

Wood argued that the conspiracies are combined: first, Vallow Daybell allegedly murdered Tylee and stole her social security number. She is also accused of killing her son and stealing the social security funds allotted to him.

""We believe they are linked and not completely separate,"" Wood said. ""We believe that the jury will find … they agreed to commit these two crimes.""

After Tuesday's hearing, Vallow Daybell left the courtroom without handcuffs, shackles or any other kind of restraints. She was escorted out by her counsel rather than by court police.

Judge Steven Boyce will release a written decision regarding Vallow Daybell's defense team's efforts to get a probable cause hearing later on Tuesday.

Vallow Daybell reportedly believed she was ""a god assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ’s second coming in July 2020,"" according to divorce documents Charles Vallow filed before his death.

Chad Daybell has written several apocalyptic novels based loosely on Mormon theology. Both were involved in a group that promotes preparedness for the biblical end times.

"Shooting at Minnesota State Fair leads to mass panic, early closure","A person was shot during a brawl that broke out at the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday, leading to a mass crowd panic and exodus, as well as an early closure of the fairgrounds.

Minnesota State Fair Police responded to gunshots in the Midway section of the fairgrounds near the intersection of Carnes Avenue and Liggett Street shortly after 10 p.m., according to FOX 9. The area was heavily populated with guests and law enforcement when the shooting occurred.

State Fair Police Chief Ron Knafla said during a press conference Sunday that the shooting took place within 15 to 20 feet of officers.

A victim with a non-life threatening gunshot wound to the leg was found by emergency responders, and paramedics transported the individual to the hospital. Police chased the gunman but were unable to make an arrest as the suspect slipped into the crowd.

Ohio State Fair ride victim recently enlisted in Marines,"The 18-year-old man killed Wednesday when a thrill ride broke apart at the Ohio State Fair had joined the Marines less than a week before the tragedy.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol identified the lone person who was killed Thursday as Tyler Jarrell of Columbus. Seven others, who ranged in age from 14 to 42 years old, were injured when the Fire Ball ride malfunctioned and sent riders flying into the air.

The Marine Corps said in a statement that Jarrell, 18, enlisted on July 21 and wanted to be in the infantry or serve as a combat engineer. He was scheduled to attend basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, S.C. in June 2018.

""Our heartfelt condolences go out to Poolee Tyler Jarrell's family and all of those affected by his loss,"" the statement said. ""The Marines here are greatly saddened by this tragedy. We are truly proud to have known him as one of the brave few willing to step up and serve his country in the United States Marine Corps.""

On Saturday, Jarrell's local Marine Corps recruitment station posted to Facebook that he was the first senior from his high school to enlist into the Marine Corps this year.

""Give him one! Tyler Jarrell is the first senior from Franklin Heights high school to enlist into the United States Marine Corps this year. I'm proud to call him my brother,"" the post read.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Thursday promised a thorough investigation into what caused the thrill ride to send riders suddenly tumbling through the air.

Kasich said he didn't want to speculate about whether inspectors may have missed something or if there was a mechanical failure.

“That’s a nightmare, a terrible situation,” Kasich told reporters, adding that state officials will do everything they can to make sure the fair is safe.

“I don’t have a message other than we’re going to do the best we can,” Kasich said.

The fair opened Thursday, but all the rides were shut down and will go through another inspection.

The Dutch manufacturer of the fairground ride involved in the accident, KMG, told The Associated Press in an email that the ride was built in 1998 in the Netherlands and that there are 43 such rides around the world, including 11 in the United States.

State Fair of Texas icon Big Tex burns up in fire; metal frame mostly all that remains,"The man who provides the voice for Big Tex, the giant cowboy at the State Fair of Texas, was greeting people with his usual ""Howdy, folks!"" in a slow drawl Friday when someone rushed into his trailer to tell him the towering fair icon was on fire.

""It moved quickly,"" Bill Bragg said of the fire that engulfed the 52-foot-tall structure, leaving not much more than its charred metal frame behind. ""It was a quick end.""

This year's fair was supposed to be a celebration for Big Tex, marking his 60th birthday. Instead, the beloved cowboy was hauled from the grounds on a flatbed truck two days before the end of the fair in a procession resembling a funeral.

""It's sad to see this happen, but it's lucky no one was injured or killed,"" said Mike Blucher of Dallas, who was at the fair with his wife, Linda.

The fire brought a temporary end to a piece of Texas culture.

The cowboy with the 75-gallon hat and 50-pound belt buckle always was easy to spot and served as a popular meeting place for people coming to the fair or attending the annual Texas-Oklahoma football game at the nearby Cotton Bowl. But all that remained by noon Friday were hands and shirt leaves on a burned skeleton.

""Big Tex is a symbol of everything the state fair stands for,"" fair spokeswoman Sue Gooding said. ""Big Tex is where my parents told me, 'If you get lost, meet at Big Tex.'""

Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Joel Lavender said Friday afternoon that the cause of the blaze had not been determined.

Some dispatchers took a playful approach to reporting the blaze. ""Got a rather tall cowboy with all his clothes burned off,"" one said. ""Howdy, folks, it's hot,"" another said.

Fair officials and city leaders quickly called for the return of Big Tex, vowing to rebuild the structure. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings tweeted that the cowboy would become ""bigger and better for the 21st Century.""

Big Tex's hands, boots and face were made of Fiberglas, Gooding said. The clothing that burned had been provided last year by a Fort Worth company, she said.

Gooding speculated that the fire could have started in mechanical workings at the base of the structure and that the metal skeleton ""served as a chimney."" The skeleton will be evaluated, and a new one will be built if necessary, she said.

Stanley Hill, who supervises a food stand that has been located near the structure for 18 years, said he noticed smoke coming from Big Tex's neck area. That quickly turned into a blaze that engulfed the structure's fabric covering.

""Once it started burning, it was gone,"" Hill said.

The structure was removed Friday in essentially the same way workers put it up every year — with a crane that slowly lowers it. Only this time, the steel skeleton was covered with a tarp.

Big Tex was actually built in 1949 as a giant Santa Claus for a Christmas celebration in Kerens, 60 miles south of Dallas. Intrigued by the idea of a towering cowboy, the State Fair paid $750 for the structure, which debuted as Big Tex in 1952.

Big Tex is inextricably linked to the State Fair. The State Fair website is www.bigtex.com, and visitors to the site see their cursor turn into an image of Big Tex's head, clad in a cowboy hat. The fair's Twitter account features the cowboy's image as well.

""You know somebody's a true Texan if you say 'Big Tex' and they don't look at you like you're weird,"" Gooding said.

Perhaps no one is closer to the giant cowboy than Bragg, who has served as the voice of Big Tex the last 11 years. Working inside a trailer a few yards from the base of the structure, the 65-year-old radio engineer reads from a script while his voice makes Big Tex's mouth move automatically.

As the crane moved into position to remove his old friend, Bragg was philosophical, saying he'd already been told he would be welcoming people to the fair in the same fashion next year.

""My job is safe and secure,"" he said. ""They're telling me, 'Take the rest of the day off and we'll see you next year.'""

Swine flu found at Ohio county fair; hogs to be slaughtered,"A hog barn at an Ohio county fair was quarantined and the animals sent there to compete will be slaughtered, after swine flu was detected.

One of the hogs at the fair had a fever and tests came back positive for swine flu, Clinton County Fair officials told WLWT. On Thursday, a fairground official confirmed that more than one case of H3N2 swine flu was reported at the barn.

Nearly 280 hogs sent to the fair to compete had been removed from the fairgrounds by Friday morning. They will be slaughtered, WLWT reported.

Officials also will disinfect the barn to make sure the virus doesn’t spread.

The building was wrapped in red tape, and only breeders and exhibitors were allowed in.

VACCINE SPRAY MAY NOT WORK FOR SWINE FLU IN KIDS

“It's been a hard day, got a lot of kids that have (a) gilt or barrow or whatever that we were going to retain and now they've got to be slaughtered. It's very unfortunate,” hog breeder Joey Johnson told WLWT.

The rest of the fairgrounds remained open to visitors, but fairgoers experiencing flu-like symptoms were advised to see a doctor.

Teen shot dead at fair in Florida county famous for state's oldest rodeo,"A teenager was fatally shot at a county fair in a rural part of Florida known for its annual rodeos, authorities said Sunday.

The Arcadia Police Department said in a statement that the shooting of the 17-year-old boy at the DeSoto County Fair on Saturday appeared to be an isolated incident and there was no further threat to the public. The gunman had not been caught by midday Sunday.

Police released two stills from video of the scene circulating on social media, asking the public for assistance in identifying who recorded the video and the three individuals depicted.

""We are aware that there is a video that has been circulating social media, and many of you have already seen it. We are looking for the person who initially recorded that video, and would like to speak to them,"" the police department said in a statement shared to its Facebook page. ""We are also attempting to identify three subjects in the video. A young Hispanic female wearing a black jacket and light jeans, male subject wearing a light shirt and shorts, and an adult male standing in the back that appears to have a beard. These subjects may have valuable information and need to be spoken to. Thank you all in advance. This investigation is active and has been ongoing since it occurred.""

Texas cyclist slaying suspect Kaitlin Armstrong: 'Biased publicity' makes fair trial 'virtually' impossible,"FIRST ON FOX: An attorney for Kaitlin Armstrong, the Texas woman accused of gunning down a pro cyclist who had gone on a date with her boyfriend the evening of her death, is hitting back at prosecutors’ attempts to limit the communications with the media.

In a court filing Monday, Armstrong’s defense attorney Rick Cofer countered the prosecution’s motion for a gag order on the case by asking Judge Brenda Kennedy to ""prohibit prejudicial comment"" to the media as the narrative of the case has already been well established by prosecutors and law enforcement, whose actions he has criticized as flawed in other court filings.

""The misogynistic and fictitious theme of most relevant articles is that Ms. Armstrong is a ‘possessive’ woman who ‘gunned down’ her ‘romantic rival’ in a ‘fit of jealousy,’"" the court filing reads. ""The case has garnered sensationalized headlines in media outlets across the English-speaking world.""

Those headlines have almost entirely been driven by ""government actors"" and subsequent discussion of the state’s narrative on social media, according to the filing, as well as a ""carnival-like media storm.""

KAITLIN ARMSTRONG TRIAL: AUSTIN PROSECUTORS SEEK GAG ORDER AS DEFENSE BLASTS ‘BIASED AND FLAWED INVESTIGATION’

Armstrong, 34, is accused of fatally shooting Anna Moriah ""Mo"" Wilson on May 11 after the victim, a 25-year-old pro cycling star, went out for dinner, drinks and a swim with Colin Strickland, Armstrong’s 35-year-old boyfriend and also a professional cyclist.

In particular, Armstrong’s defense has taken issue with Detective Richard Spitler’s affidavit in support of a warrant for her arrest, which her lawyers have separately alleged is full of ""factual errors,"" ""misattributions,"" and ""incorrect assertions.""

TEXAS MURDER SUSPECT KAITLIN ARMSTRONG'S LAWYERS ACCUSE POLICE OF USING INVALID ARREST WARRANT

The new filing also blasts law enforcement for holding a news briefing after Armstrong’s arrest in Costa Rica.

""While standing at the courthouse doors, defense counsel for Ms. Armstrong requested admission to observe the press conference but was denied access by the U.S. Marshal’s Office,"" the filing reads. ""Afterwards, defense counsel advised U.S. District Court Judges Yeakel and Pitman about the exclusion of defense counsel from the press conference.""

According to the filing, the Marshals were ""admonished for their conduct"" and later apologized.

""Deputy [Marshal Brandon] Filla portrayed Ms. Armstrong’s lawful travel to New York as ‘fleeing’ from justice; speculated about changes to Ms. Armstrong’s face and hair color as evidence of flight; and painted an association of Ms. Armstrong with the most ‘violent’ and ‘worst of the worst’ criminals who ‘wreak havoc’ on the community,"" the filing continues. ""Deputy Filla did not mention the ’43-day manhunt’ for Ms. Armstrong was a direct result of law enforcement incompetence.""

Shortly after Wilson's death, Austin police arrested Armstrong on an unrelated warrant, questioned her without reading her Miranda rights and accidentally let her go due to a clerical error, according to court filings. Then she flew to New York, was spotted at another airport and New Jersey and turned up weeks later on a beach in Costa Rica, where local police arrested her on an immigration violation.

Authorities there deported her to the U.S., where she is being held on $3 million bail in Austin.

""The result of this widespread, biased publicity is that there is virtually nowhere in the English-speaking world where Ms. Armstrong could receive a fair trial today,"" the filing reads.

Previously undisclosed information revealed in court filings last week also shows Strickland, Armstrong’s boyfriend, repeatedly told detectives he did not believe she would have shot Wilson and that he did not think she was the jealous or violent type.

TEXAS MURDER SUSPECT KAITLIN ARMSTRONG HAD ACCESS TO $450K, PRACTICED SHOOTING WITH SISTER, WARRANTS REVEAL

""She’s an incredibly kind, caring, sweet person who has helped me take care of my aging mother,"" Strickland told Spitler, according to the transcript, made public in court filings last week. ""She helped her secure like $20,000 in unemployment just by going, being on the phone, for five days. Like she is, has only shown shining examples…Has only shown absolute, above and beyond examples of human compassion and thoughtfulness and care and going far out of her way for ridiculous things.""

During the interview, he also accused Spitler of ""leading a narrative"" and ""manipulating"" him.

Strickland has declined numerous Fox News Digital requests for comment, other than to say, ""Please f--- off.""

His statements only came to light through court filings – and shortly after they did, the Travis County District Attorney’s Office asked the court for a gag order that would prevent both sides from discussing the case with the media.

But because the government’s narrative has been so publicly exposed, according to Armstrong’s defense team, the gag order would effectively only silence their side.

""[The district attorney’s office] waited 94 days from the issuance of Ms. Armstrong’s arrest warrant before raising their concern for fairness,"" her defense wrote Monday. ""During that time, the government actively participated in media events, and otherwise supplied media with prejudicial images of Ms. Armstrong. The State has waived any standing in seeking a media blackout.""

In separate filings last week, Armstrong's defense also asked the judge to suppress evidence obtained during a police interview in which the detective allegedly failed to mirandize the suspect and to respect her right to a speedy trial.

Armstrong's next hearing is set for Wednesday morning, and the jury docket call is scheduled for Oct. 19.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-cyclist-slaying-suspect-kaitlin-armstrong-biased-publicity-makes-fair-trial-virtually-impossible,N/A
Texas school shooting suspect's grandmother upgraded to 'fair condition',"The grandmother of Texas school shooting suspect Salvador Ramos was upgraded to ""fair condition"" on Sunday afternoon, the University Health system in San Antonio said.

"Church fair stampede in Nigeria leaves 31 dead, police say","A stampede Saturday at a church charity event in southern Nigeria left 31 people dead and seven injured, police told The Associated Press, a shocking development at a program that aimed to offer hope to the needy. One witness said the dead included a pregnant woman and many children.

The stampede at the event organized by the Kings Assembly Pentecostal church in Rivers state involved people who came to the church’s annual ""Shop for Free"" charity program, according to Grace Iringe-Koko, a police spokeswoman.

Such events are common in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, where more than 80 million people live in poverty, according to government statistics.

Saturday’s charity program was supposed to begin at 9 a.m. but dozens arrived as early as 5 a.m. to secure their place in line, Iringe-Koko said. Somehow the locked gate was broken open, creating a stampede, she said.

Godwin Tepikor from Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency said first responders were able to evacuate the bodies of those trampled to death and bring them to the morgue. Security forces cordoned off the area.

Dozens of residents later thronged the scene, mourning the dead and offering any assistance they could to emergency workers. Doctors and emergency workers treated some of the injured as they lay in the open field. Videos from the scene showed the clothing, shoes and other items meant for the beneficiaries.

One witness who only identified himself as Daniel said ""there were so many children"" among the dead. Five of the dead children were from one mother, he told the AP, adding that a pregnant woman also lost her life.

Some church members were attacked and injured by relatives of the victims after the stampede, according to witness Christopher Eze. The church declined to comment on the situation.

The ""Shop for Free"" event was suspended while authorities investigated how the stampede occurred.

"India carnival ride plummets 50 feet, injuring multiple people – including children – in horrifying video","Multiple people, including at least five children, were injured after a high-rise swing at a fair in northern India malfunctioned and plummeted to the ground.

The horrific moment, caught on camera, occurred Sunday around 9:15 p.m. on the Dussehra fairgrounds in the city of Mohali.

A video of the accident shows the high-rise spinning ride slowly ascending a column. The swing remains at the top for a moment before free-falling about 50 feet. The swing slams into the ground, causing several people to fly out of their seats. Screams are audible as the scene unfolds in front of horrified fair attendees.

Good Samaritans helped load the injured riders into police vans as there were no ambulances on the fairgrounds, local outlet NDTV reported. At least 16 people were injured and taken to a civil hospital in Mohali, according to the outlet.

Russia offers weapons for sale at arms fair in Abu Dhabi as war continues with Ukraine,"Russia offered weapons for sale on Monday at a biennial arms fair in the United Arab Emirates, ranging from Kalashnikov assault rifles to missile systems — despite facing sanctions from the West over its war on Ukraine.

The event, known as the International Defense Exhibition and Conference and held in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, underscores how the Gulf Arab federation has sought to embrace Moscow while balancing its ties to the West.

As Russia's war on Ukraine approaches its first anniversary on Friday, Russian money continues to flood into Dubai's red-hot real estate market.

Daily flights between the Emirates and Moscow continue as the war grinds on, providing a rare lifeline for both those fleeing conscription and the Russian elite. The U.S. Treasury has already expressed concerns about the amount of Russian cash flowing into the Arabian Peninsula country.

The arms fair typically sees the Emiratis host individuals that could be seen as problematic in the West. Former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir came to the 2017 edition. Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov, himself now deeply involved in the Ukraine war, came in both 2019 and 2021.

This year's event drew Libya's Khalifa Hifter, the commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army who faces a U.S. lawsuit accusing him of orchestrating indiscriminate attacks on civilians and torturing and killing political opponents.

US WARNED RUSSIA OF BIDEN'S VISIT TO UKRAINE 'HOURS' BEFORE DEPARTURE

But while not directly acknowledged at this year's show, the tendrils of Russia's war on Ukraine could be seen everywhere at the fair Monday.

To reach Russia's exhibition tent, those attending the fair had to leave Abu Dhabi's cavernous National Exhibition Center and cross along a skybridge to an outdoor area.

Russian officials delayed Associated Press journalists from going inside their tent as an event was going on, initially without explanation. About an hour later, AP journalists saw Denis Manturov, Russia's minister of trade and industry, come out of the tent.

Manturov is sanctioned by both the United States and the United Kingdom, with London describing him as being ""responsible for overseeing the Russian weapons industry and responsible for equipping mobilized troops"" in the war on Ukraine. Yet Manturov described the ongoing war as providing advertising for Russian weaponry.

""Any military action is further accompanied by interest in those products, those weapons that are in demand in a given military conflict,"" he said, according to the Tass news agency. ""Therefore, certainly, interest is now high in air defense systems — short-, medium-, and long-range ones.""

He added: ""Each transaction is subject to close scrutiny from our Western colleagues — they are trying to create obstacles; we ensure the security of such deals so that they are as effective as possible and implemented privately.""

Emirati officials did not directly acknowledge Manturov's presence. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment about Russia's presence at the arms show in a country that hosts thousands of American troops. Manturov visited the Emirates as U.S. President Joe Biden was in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Inside the Russian tent, a video screen proclaimed the power of Moscow's surface-to-air missile systems, like those now being used to strike cities in Ukraine. Salesmen showed off Kalashnikov assault rifles to Emirati troops. Other model missiles sat on display.

Just outside of the tent, Russian Helicopters displayed several of its civilian aircraft, flanked by attractive young women in silver flight caps.

UKRAINE WARNS OF MASSIVE RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON ANNIVERSARY OF PUTIN’S INVASION: ‘WE HAVE TO BE READY’

UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was not seen at the opening, which was attended by his brother, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. However, one Russian magazine at the arms fair printed an English edition that carried photos of Sheikh Mohammed smiling and shaking Russian President Vladimir Putin's hand during an earlier visit to Moscow.

In contrast, a giant armed drone by Baykar was parked next to the Russian tent. The Turkish drone company's Bayraktar drones have played such a key role in Kyiv campaign against Russia there's even a song in Ukrainian about the aircraft.

A short walk away, U.S. Army troops showed off a model of a Javelin anti-tank missile, allowing the curious to fire it in a computer simulation.

U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Evan Williams of the 2-116th Cavalry Regiment said he and his soldiers had talked to Russian visitors at the fair and others curious about the weapon, which Ukraine has used to deadly effect against Russian armored vehicles.

""You've seen people walk by and kind of do a double-take about it,"" said Williams of Boise, Idaho. ""They come talk to us, ask us questions about it.""

The U.S. Army also had a Patriot missile battery on display at the fair. American forces used the battery in combat for the first time in decades in 2022 to help defend Abu Dhabi against an attack by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

Meanwhile, Israel as well had its first full contingent of weapons companies on display, for the first time since the UAE diplomatically recognized the country in 2020.

""America – and the world – has seen the many horrific images and read the heart-wrenching accounts of brutality and death that have resulted from Russia’s unjust invasion of Ukraine.""

Garland said the Department of Justice (DOJ) will create a War Crimes Accountability Team to investigate and hold accountable those who have committed war crimes and human rights violations.

Zelenskyy championed U.S. efforts to independently investigate Russian war crimes and said the probe will be ""one of the largest contributions to the protection of international law and order of our time.""
