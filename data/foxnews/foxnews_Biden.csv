Sean Penn urges Biden to send modern fighter jets to Ukraine: 'Blood will be on our hands',"Sean Penn is doubling down on his call for the United States to supply Ukraine with modern fighter jets amid the country's war against Russia.

The 62-year-old actor, who first pressed the White House on Ukraine's need for jets last March, said President Joe Biden's surprise trip to Kyiv this week to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion was ""extremely encouraging."" However, he stressed that the U.S. continue sending military aid, including modern aircraft, to the war-torn nation.

""There’s no scenario where Ukraine loses this battle,"" the two-time Academy Award winner said told Politico in an interview that was published on Friday.

He continued, ""There’s a scenario where territory is taken, and Putin buys his way into fighting insurgents throughout a broken infrastructure of a broken country.""

SEAN PENN SPEAKS OUT ABOUT TIME IN UKRAINE, SAYS ZELENSKYY ‘WILL WIN, BUT AT WHAT COST’

""But the Ukrainians are going to fight till the last drop of blood. And that drop of blood will be on our hands if we don’t faithfully equip them.""

Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the ""Milk"" star took to Twitter to urge the U.S. and Polish governments to provide Ukraine with fighter jets.

""I JUST got off a call with President Zelensky’s Chief of staff, Andriy Yermak,"" he wrote on Mar. 9. ""Somewhere in the bureaucratic chain between our White House & the Polish Gov., the desperately NEEDED jets are not yet delivered to Ukraine. Public outcry may find the bottleneck.""

Poland had offered to give its entire fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. in exchange for a chance to buy American F-16s as part of a deal to bolster the Ukrainian air force while upgrading their own with NATO aircraft.

However, the Pentagon announced later that it would not support Poland's proposal, referring to the move as ""high-risk"" for escalating tensions with Russia.

The following month, Penn called for buyers from the private sector to spend $300 million to buy two squadrons of U.S.-made F-15 or F-16 fighter jets, adding, ""12 aircraft with better tech than Russian MiGs or SU’s [Sukhoi].""

""One billionaire could end this war in Ukraine,"" he wrote. ""Of course there are add-ons in arming & maintaining creative runways, etc, but seems worth a think.""

The actor has since deleted his Twitter account.

Penn has reiterated his calls for Ukraine to be supplied with more advanced aircraft during media interviews and in private conversations with members of Congress, Politico reported.

The ""Mystic River"" actor explained the fighter jets that the Ukrainians are currently using are insufficient to combat Russia's more advanced aircraft.

""The Ukrainians are flying without guided missile systems,"" he told Politico. ""So, they actually have to get a visual on the Russian MiGs to shoot them down.""

He continued, ""Whereas the Russian fighter jets can lock in, fire a guided missile from 100 kilometers out, then duck into safe airspace.""

The Biden administration has faced mounting pressure to provide Ukraine with modern fighter jets from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers as well as Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Last month, Biden told a White House reporter ""No"" when asked if he planned to send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets.

During his interview with Politico, Penn recalled being in Kyiv when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. He had a meeting with Zelenskyy the night before the invasion in which the president agreed to participate in Penn's documentary about the conflict, ""Superpower.""

""We went back to our hotel and closed our eyes for about two hours, and all of a sudden, the missiles and rockets were coming in,"" Penn remembered.

The actor remained in Ukraine for a few days to continue filming after Russia's invasion. According to Politico, he has returned to the country six times, including a November visit when he gave his Oscar statuette to Zelenskyy. His most recent visit took place last week when he screened ""Superpower,"" which premiered on Feb. 17, for Zelenskyy.

Penn told Politico that Zelenskyy was""clearly realistic"" about the likelihood that Russia would invade Ukraine during his first meeting with the president on Feb. 23.

However, Penn said that Zelenskyy ""could not possibly have known that he would so completely rise to the occasion of the actuality.""

""It was immediately clear when he walked into the room on February 24th that we were witnessing the newfound embodiment of an historic courage and leadership,"" Penn told the outlet. ""The resolve was in his eyes; Zelenskyy wasn’t going anywhere.""

Biden admin to limit telehealth prescriptions for some controlled drugs,"The Biden administration is moving to require patients to be evaluated by a physician in person before receiving prescriptions for some controlled medications, including Adderall and OxyContin.

The proposal would reverse a policy enacted during the coronavirus pandemic that allowed doctors to prescribe these medications through telehealth appointments. The move will make it more difficult for Americans to access some drugs used for treating pain and mental health disorders.

The Drug Enforcement Administration announced the proposed rules on Friday, which state that telehealth flexibilities will be extended for common, non-controlled medications but schedule II medications and narcotics will be prohibited without an in-person appointment.

Patients must visit a doctor in person at least once to receive an initial prescription for drugs the federal government believes have the highest potential for abuse, including Vicodin, OxyContin, Adderall and Ritalin. Refills for these medications could still be prescribed over telehealth appointments.

NEW YORK NURSE ACCUSED OF SLAMMING BABY ONTO BASSINET FIRED, UNDER INVESTIGATION

Doctors will only be able to prescribe controlled medications like Ambien and Xanaxas, as well as medications used to treat opioid addiction, for 30 days. Any refills for these drugs will require an in-person evaluation.

The rules aim to maintain expanded access to telehealth, which has been crucial for millions of patients, particularly those living in rural areas, while also balancing safety.

""DEA is committed to ensuring that all Americans can access needed medications,"" DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement. ""The permanent expansion of telemedicine flexibilities would continue greater access to care for patients across the country while ensuring the safety of patients. DEA is committed to the expansion of telemedicine with guardrails that prevent the online overprescribing of controlled medications that can cause harm.""

The move comes amid an ongoing opioid crisis and a growing number of overdose deaths from controlled medications such as fentanyl.

The DEA said the proposed telemedicine rules will advance its goal of expanding access to medication for opioid use disorder to anyone in the country who needs it.

""Medication for opioid use disorder helps those who are fighting to overcome substance use disorder by helping people achieve and sustain recovery and also prevent drug poisonings,"" Milgram said. ""The telemedicine regulations would continue to expand access to buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder.""

U.S. overdose deaths reached a record in 2021, and about three-quarters of those were from opioids. But the death toll from synthetic opioids like fentanyl far exceeded those related to prescription drugs that same year, according to Centers for Disease Control data. Fentanyl is increasingly present in the black market, as the pills are often pressed into fake prescription pills or mixed into other drugs.

Several states have already moved to restore limitations for telehealth care. As of October, nearly 40 states and Washington, D.C., had ended emergency pandemic declarations making it easier for doctors to see patients in other states.

The proposed rules come after startups in the telehealth industry launched in recent years to treat and prescribe medications for mental health or attention deficit disorders. The industry and people with difficulty accessing in-person care have largely benefitted from the pandemic-era policy.

The new rules are expected to be in place before the COVID-19 public health emergency expires on May 11.",https://www.foxnews.com/health/biden-admin-to-limit-telehealth-prescriptions-some-controlled-drugs,N/A
2022: The year the Hunter Biden laptop was finally verified by the media,"2022 was a jam-packed year for news, yet one of the most covered stories wasn't really new at all.

During the 2020 presidential election, the big ""October surprise"" came in the form of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, which shed a light on the shady foreign business dealings of the son of then-candidate Joe Biden. But the legacy media rejected the damning revelations first reported by the New York Post, either pushing a false Russian disinformation narrative or not even mentioning it at all.

That all changed this year.

Following Hunter Biden's own disclosure that he was being federally investigated over his ""tax affairs,"" news organizations appeared to be more eager to give the laptop a look.

These are the media outlets that finally verified the Hunter Biden laptop throughout the year:

The New York Times (March 16, 2022)

In March, The New York Times published a report about the federal investigations into alleged tax offenses Hunter Biden is facing. The Times wrote that emails cited in the story ""were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop,"" adding, ""The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation.""

FROM 'SMEAR CAMPAIGN' TO 'RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,' LIBERAL MEDIA TEAMED UP TO DISMISS HUNTER BIDEN STORY

At the time, however, the Times ran a report sounding the alarm about ""Russian disinformation,"" claiming that then-President Trump was warned that Russians were ""using"" his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was given the laptop before providing its contents to the press, to spread false claims about the Bidens.

""The intelligence agencies warned the White House late last year that Russian intelligence officers were using President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani as a conduit for disinformation aimed at undermining Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential run, according to four current and former American officials,"" the Times reported in Oct. 2020.

The Washington Post (March 30, 2022)

Just days after the Times verified Hunter Biden's laptop, The Washington Post followed suit in its report about Hunter Biden's ""multimillion-dollar"" financial ties to the Chinese energy company CEFC China Energy.

""The Post review draws in part on an analysis of a copy said to be of the hard drive of a laptop computer that Hunter Biden purportedly dropped off at a Delaware repair shop and never came to collect. The laptop was turned over to the FBI in December 2019, according to documents reviewed by The Post, and a copy of the drive was obtained by Rudy Giuliani and other advisers to then-President Donald Trump a few months before the 2020 election,"" the Post reported. ""After the New York Post began publishing reports on the contents of the laptop in October 2020, The Washington Post repeatedly asked Giuliani and Republican strategist Stephen K. Bannon for a copy of the data to review before the election, but the requests were rebuffed or ignored.""

CBS VERIFIES HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP, BECOMING LATEST NEWS OUTLET TO PIVOT AFTER DISMISSING SCANDAL IN 2020

In a separate report explaining how The Washington Post analyzed Hunter Biden's laptop, the Post wrote, ‘Thousands of emails purportedly from the laptop computer of Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, are authentic communications that can be verified through cryptographic signatures from Google and other technology companies,"" according to two security experts.

During the 2020 presidential election, the Post used a variation of the ""Republicans pounce"" trope to frame the story, running the headline, ""Three weeks before Election Day, Trump allies go after Hunter — and Joe — Biden.""

Right out of the gate, the report expressed heavy skepticism towards the legitimacy of Hunter Biden's emails and sowed doubt in the GOP sources who first obtained the laptop.

""President Trump’s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and his former top adviser Stephen K. Bannon, who have attracted the scrutiny of U.S. authorities for their political dealings in recent months, helped make public private materials purported to belong to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son in an attempt to swing support to the struggling incumbent,"" the Post wrote. ""The Washington Post was unable to verify the authenticity of the alleged emails and other correspondence that the New York Post published Wednesday and said had come from the younger Biden’s computer and hard drive.""

JAKE TAPPER DECLARES HUNTER BIDEN CLAIMS ‘TOO DISGUSTING' TO REPEAT ON CNN: ‘THE RIGHTWING IS GOING CRAZY’

The report attempted to tie the New York Post's reporting to Russia by highlighting Giuliani's past interactions with Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, who the U.S Treasury had sanctioned for being an ""active Russian agent interfering in the 2020 campaign, which Derkach has denied.""

It went on to claim the story ""did not markedly advance what is already known about Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, other than to suggest that at one point he gave Vadym Pozharskyi, a Ukrainian business colleague, ‘an opportunity’ to meet his father. The Biden campaign said the vice president’s schedule indicated no such meeting.""

Meanwhile, the paper published multiple opinion pieces urging readers to dismiss the controversy altogether. Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent penned a piece declaring the scandal ""fake"" and ""laughably weak,"" claiming, ""While Trump and his propagandists would surely prefer to have a more compelling scandal to tout, the thinness of this new gruel is largely secondary."" Fellow Post columnist David Ignatius penned a piece titled, ""The truth behind the Hunter Biden non-scandal,"" arguing Hunter Biden’s ties to the Ukrainian gas company Burisma ""isn’t a scandal about his father, as the Trump campaign claims, but part of a personal tragedy for the vice president’s son, compounded by this week’s dissemination of what looks like disinformation about Joe Biden’s role.""

NBC News (May 19, 2022)

NBC News went through a similar reversal in May with its report about Hunter Biden's lavish spending, saying at the time ""NBC News obtained a copy of Biden’s laptop hard drive from a representative of Rudy Giuliani and examined Biden’s business dealings from 2013 to 2018 based on the information available on the hard drive and the scope of the documents released by the Senate.""

Ahead of the final presidential debate on Oct. 22, 2020, where then-President Trump hammered opponent Joe Biden on his son's business dealings, NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson previewed Trump's attack lines as perhaps part of a ""foreign disinformation campaign.""

HUNTER BIDEN'S LEGAL WOES WILL BE ‘DECIDING FACTOR’ IN FATHER'S 2024 DECISION, PUCK NEWS REPORTER SAYS

""The president's also expected to bring up Hunter Biden and unverified emails of his business dealings, described by many intelligence experts as having hallmarks of a foreign disinformation campaign,"" Jackson reported at the time. ""The Biden campaign says they're ready for the attack, hoping to flip the script to argue the president's more obsessed with Biden's family than American families.""

Jackson also made an effort to degrade President Trump's debate guest, former Hunter Biden associate Tony Bobulinski, who claimed the former vice president was directly involved with his son's business dealings.

""While President Trump is expected to bring a former business associate of Hunter Biden's, Joe Biden is expected to bring small business owners struggling in this pandemic,"" Jackson told NBC's Lester Holt.

The coverage on MSNBC, known for its unabashed liberal commentary, was far less restrained in dismissing the New York Post's reporting.

Right out of the gate, ""Morning Joe"" co-host Joe Scarborough declared the story ""false"" and later claimed it was ""so obviously"" Russian disinformation, asking, ""Why are we spreading the lies here?""

Co-host Mika Brzezinski cited multiple reports about intelligence agencies investigating Giuliani's dealings with ""alleged Russian agents,"" as well as whether emails from Hunter Biden's laptop are ""linked to a foreign intel operation.""

""Deadline: White House"" host Nicolle Wallace was more confident in dismissing Hunter Biden's laptop, telling viewers, ""We shouldn't look at it as anything other than a Russian disinformation operation."" MSNBC anchor Katy Tur mocked the Post's story, saying it ""dropped like a bomb,"" but to ""wither under scrutiny, not really dropping like a bomb.""

CNN BOSS, POLITICAL DIRECTOR SPIKED HUNTER BIDEN CONTROVERSY, AUDIOTAPES REVEAL: ‘WE’RE NOT GOING WITH' STORY

MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle attacked those who were covering the Hunter Biden controversy, referring to it as a ""so-called story"" with ""unverified claims.""

""We are now four days away from the election and the truth is more important than ever,"" Ruhle told her viewers at the time. ""The truth is that we're in the middle of a pandemic. The truth is that millions of Americans are out of work. The truth is we have to listen to science. And in these final days, instead of debating crowd size or unverified claims or conspiracy theories, we should be talking about policy, values and ideas.""

CNN (July 27, 2022)

CNN revealed it, too, had authenticated emails from the laptop in a report about Hunter Biden's finances.

""CNN hired a cyber forensics expert to help authenticate a cache of emails related to Hunter Biden’s finances that were posted on the internet by a former Trump White House aide and allegedly traced back to a laptop that turned up at a Delaware repair shop,"" CNN wrote in July. ""Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency operative, who analyzed the emails for CNN, said he was able to authenticate a subset of the emails because they contained verified signatures within their metadata that showed they had not been modified. Only emails he authenticated are cited in this report.""

DAILY BEAST ISSUES APOLOGY TO LAPTOP REPAIRMAN AMID LAWSUIT AFTER CLAIMING HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP WAS 'STOLEN'

But that was long after CNN was caught spiking the laptop story when it first broke, according to recordings obtained by Project Veritas that were released in December 2020.

""Obviously, we're not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,"" CNN political director David Chalian said during a conference call on Oct. 14, the same day the Post published its first story on Hunter Biden's emails. Chalian later insisted the report was ""giving its marching orders"" to the ""right-wing echo chamber about what to talk about today.""

""The Trump media, you know, moves immediately from – OK, well, never mind – the [Michael Flynn] unmasking was, you know, found to be completely nonsensical to the latest alleged scandal and expects everybody to just follow suit,"" then-CNN president Jeff Zucker told his staff on Oct. 16. ""So, I don't think that we should be repeating unsubstantiated smears just because the right-wing media suggests that we should.""

""There's a lot about this story that does not add up,"" CNN's Brian Stelter told his viewers at the time. ""And, I mean, for all we know, these emails were made up, or maybe some are real and some are fakes, we don't know. But we do know that this is a classic example of the right-wing media machine.""

MSNBC BURIES NBC NEWS REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP, OFFERS LESS THAN 4 MINUTES OF COVERAGE

After complaining about the coverage of the emerging scandal that was virtually ignored by the liberal media, Stelter went on to call the Post's reporting of Hunter Biden's laptop a ""manufactured scandal,"" a ""so-called scandal"" and suggested the newspaper is not a ""fully reliable source.""

Just days before his August firing from CNN, Stelter acknowledged the Hunter Biden scandal is ""not just a right-wing media story"" and constituted a ""real problem for the Bidens.""

CBS News (November 21, 2022)

CBS News was late to the party, do a complete 180 on its coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop.

A report that aired on ""CBS Mornings"" offered a deep dive into the network's efforts to authenticate the device purportedly belonging to President Biden's son.

""As Republicans take control of the House, Hunter Biden, the president’s son will be a target for investigations and that means data from a laptop purported to belong to Biden could be crucial to the investigatory process. CBS News has obtained its data, not through a third party or political operative, but directly from the source who told us they provided it to the FBI under subpoena. We commissioned an independent forensic review to determine its authenticity,"" CBS host Tony Dokoupil told viewers in November.

However, like the other outlets, CBS News didn't always take the controversy seriously.

JAKE TAPPER'S SOFT HUNTER BIDEN QUESTION DURING BIDEN INTERVIEW FOLLOWS MEDIA'S WEAK COVERAGE OF SCANDAL

In October 2020, just days after the New York Post published its bombshell reporting about the laptop that shed light on Hunter Biden's shady business dealings overseas, then-President Trump had a contentious exchange with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl.

Stahl pushed back on Trump's assertion that then-candidate Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal.""

""He's not,"" Stahl replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, come oon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

In a separate exchange where Trump hammered CBS News for not covering the controversy, Stahl repeatedly insisted that the laptop ""can't be verified.""

At one point on the campaign trail, CBS News correspondent Bo Erickson faced hostile pushback by other journalists, including one of his own colleagues, just for asking about the laptop.

""My @CBSEveningNews report clearly lays out warnings about Giuliani & Russian disinformation,"" then-CBS News White House correspondent Paula Reid tweeted, attempting to undercut the legitimacy of Erickson's question to Biden.

Honorable Mention: Politico (September 21, 2021)

Way ahead of The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC News, CNN and CBS News, Politico confirmed the authenticity of Hunter Biden's emails in September 2021 when publishing reporting from correspondent Ben Schreckinger's book ""The Bidens.""

""A person who had independent access to Hunter Biden’s emails confirmed he did receive a 2015 email from a Ukrainian businessman thanking him for the chance to meet Joe Biden. The same goes for a 2017 email in which a proposed equity breakdown of a venture with Chinese energy executives includes the line, ‘10 held by H for the big guy?’"" Politico Playbook wrote. ""Emails released by a Swedish government agency also match emails in the leaked cache, and two people who corresponded with Hunter Biden confirmed emails from the cache were genuine.""

During the 2020 election, Politico famously ran the headline, ""Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say.""

The report authored by Natasha Bertrand, now a CNN reporter who was one of the mainstream media's most enthusiastic Russiagate boosters, highlighted an open letter signed by ""more than 50 former senior intelligence officials"" who insisted that the published emails from the laptop had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

The letter, which was parroted by much of the media, baselessly suggested the emails were hacked and could have been tampered with by the Kremlin in order to make its contents look incriminating.

Signatories of that letter included outspoken Trump critics John Brennan, James Clapper, Michael Hayden, Leon Panetta, and Jeremy Bash, many of whom can be often found on MSNBC and CNN.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/2022-year-the-hunter-biden-laptop-finally-verified-media,N/A
"America under Biden 'eerily similar' to time before Republican victories 100 years ago, says historian","During the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, the nation has grappled with crippling inflation, social unrest, and a growing divide between the political parties over the role of government.

One filmmaker argued the Biden presidency is ""eerily similar"" to the environment in which President Calvin Coolidge entered.

""It was very similar to today, almost eerily similar,"" Fox Nation filmmaker Amity Shlaes said on ""Fox & Friends,"" discussing the Fox Nation special ""Coolidge: Rediscovering an American President.""

Shlaes outlined the three specific similarities between now and the 1920s.

""For example, we were coming out of a pandemic, influenza,"" she said. ""Two, we had recession… or the prospect of recession. Three, we had hidden inflation. The government wasn't acknowledging to people that prices were up 40%. There was a sense of radicalism in the country and people were talking socialism and there it was. Income Harding first, then Coolidge for common sense America, what they called normalcy. They were elected with strong number of votes.""

PRESIDENTS DAYS 2023: FASCINATING FACTS TO KNOW ABOUT AMERICA'S GREATEST LEADERS

Coolidge, then the vice president, was sworn into office in 1923 after the death of President Warren G. Harding and won re-election in 1924. He was succeeded in 1929 by Republican Herbert Hoover.

Shlaes referred to Coolidge as the ""bridge to the founders"" for his understanding of America's fundamental principles and his dedication to fighting back against the rise in socialist thought in America and a trend toward increased government involvement.

""Coolidge said some astounding things which are true, but which we don't even dare say today. For example, he said personal rights and property rights are the same thing. He said,… the man who builds a factory, builds a temple. But he believed in work, hard work, and he believed also that people would advance in that situation,"" she said.

""He vetoed spending, including spending in areas such as disaster relief. He was an anti-crisis-spending because he said very often localities can take care of themselves or should. He was not inhumane, but he saw a restrained role for Washington.""

Fox Nation's ""Coolidge: Rediscovering an American President"" dissects how one of America's presidents fought to preserve the nation's core beliefs and defend the founder's vision.

Also on Fox Nation, ""American Presidents"" – hosted by Brit Hume – explores the presidencies of leaders from George Washington to Donald Trump.

Similarly to Coolidge, President Ronald Reagan was also a proponent of limited government. He faced his own challenges, coming into power following an international crisis and economic recession, but believed more government was not a solution.

""In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem,"" Reagan famously said.

Biden chides ABC's David Muir as he's grilled about classified documents scandal: 'You're a good lawyer',"President Biden got a bit combative with ABC's David Muir over the classified documents scandal that has been plaguing his presidency.

During an interview that aired on Friday's ""World News Tonight,"" Muir began the exchange by quoting Biden's own comments knocking former President Trump last year following the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago retrieving presidential records he refused to turn over to the National Archives.

At the time, Biden expressed concern that the classified documents Trump held may have revealed ""sources and methods.""

""Can you assure the American people that none of the documents discovered in your garage or your old office compromised sources or methods or U.S. intelligence?"" Muir asked.

""I've been advised by the counsel - let the Justice Department make that decision to not try to alter the case in any way,"" Biden responded. ""There have been very few documents that have been confiscated, found in my possession… meaning in my home, all the stuff that was moved out of my Senate office over the years, I'm told are a couple of things that were from 1973 or 74, documents were marked classified. I don't know of anything, maybe, I don't know if anything that is marked like it was top secret, highly classified, etc. But I am told not to comment on that because I don't even know what they confiscated.""

BIDEN SCOFFS AT EAST PALESTINE MAYOR WHO CLAIMED HE ‘DOESN’T CARE' ABOUT TOWN AMID TRIP TO UKRAINE

""There are many who will understand why you can't comment, why your lawyers are saying not to comment,"" Muir said. ""They also saw you, though, comment on former President Trump. And so at the very least -""

""Because, look, here's what they were showing - you guys were showing on television things lying on the ground that said ‘top secret,’ national, you know, 'code word,'"" Biden interjected, referring to the widely-seen classified documents laid out on the floor by the FBI during the Mar-a-Lago raid.

The president continued, ""And the difference is every single solitary thing I've been asked to do I've done voluntarily. I've invited the Justice Department to come in to every aspect of any place that I had any control of. There was no need for search warrants, were no need - well what do you need? Just come, whatever you want. Whatever you want, wherever you want to go, you can go. That was totally different.""

The ABC News anchor then pressed Biden over his use of the word ""irresponsible"" to describe Trump's handling of classified documents.

""When you hear about boxes in your garage or in your old office, you call the Trump discovery ‘Irresponsible.’ Is there something irresponsible here though, too?"" Muir asked.

BIDEN TELLS PBS HE'S 'NOT AT LIBERTY' TO DISCUSS CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS SCANDAL, SUGGESTS HIS STAFF IS TO BLAME

""You know, you're a good lawyer,"" Biden chided the anchor. ""But you're trying to make a comparison. There's degrees of irresponsibility that are - they can be significant degrees of responsibility. The way in which the boxes were packed up from my office, apparently, not everything was gone through as meticulously as it should have. But there was no intention.""

""I opened up my home, all my homes… the home at the beach and the home that- my permanent home. And they spent hours and hours going through everything, personal, everything I had. And that's a fundamentally different thing. There's nothing for me to hide,"" Biden added.

In another recent interview, Biden suggested his staff was to blame for him possession classified documents.

""But one of the things that happened is that what was not done well is as they packed up my offices to move them, they didn't do the kind of job that should have been done to go thoroughly through every single piece of literature that's there,"" Biden told PBS' Judy Woodruff earlier this month.

BILL MAHER ADMITS BIDEN WAS ‘VERY SHADY’ WITH DOCUMENTS, BUT SAYS HIS SCANDAL WAS ‘DIFFERENT’ THAN TRUMP'S

Last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, which were discovered in both his Wilmington home and at the Penn Biden Center. The appointment came after he tapped as separate special counsel to investigate Trump last fall.

Biden raised eyebrows when he admitted that the classified documents were kept in his garage next to his \Corvette.

The president's Republican critics have speculated whether Hunter Biden had access to his father's classified documents, which reportedly involve countries like Ukraine where his embattled son has had business ties.

In addition to Biden and Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence also revealed that he had found classified documents in his Indiana home shortly after ordering a search of his records. Pence said he takes ""full responsibility"" for his possession of classified documents.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-chides-abcs-david-muir-grilled-classified-documents-scandal-good-lawyer,N/A
Biden executive order for 'woke' artificial intelligence called 'social cancer',"President Biden signed an executive order on Thursday that critics warn will allow for the creation of woke artificial intelligence (AI) that ""promotes racial division and discrimination.""

The order directs all federal agencies to establish a yearly ""equity action plan"" aimed at helping ""underserved communities.""

In one section under ""Embedding Equity into Government-wide Processes,"" the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is instructed ""to support equitable decision-making, promote equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance, and assist agencies in advancing equity, as appropriate and wherever possible.""

The section gives further instructions regarding AI, ""When designing, developing, acquiring, and using artificial intelligence and automated systems in the Federal Government, agencies shall do so, consistent with applicable law, in a manner that advances equity.""

Political influencers and tech experts on Twitter all condemned such an initiative as a moral hazard.

Christopher Rufo, the journalist who helped draw public attention to ""critical race theory,"" warned, ""Biden's new executive order creating a national DEI bureaucracy has a special mandate for woke AI. The order instructs the federal government to ‘[protect] the public from algorithmic discrimination’ and to deploy AI systems ‘in a manner that advances equity.’""

Manhattan Institute fellow Colin Wright claimed that such a technology could be fatal for our society.

""Biden is not a moderate. This is a legal sprint to inject as much radical ideology as broadly and as deeply as possible in our government. This cannot be allowed,"" he wrote. ""If Republicans take office, they must fully root out all of this ideological and social cancer.""

""The worst possible scenario imaginable for our future. Our children and their children will be suffering the consequences of this mandate,"" software developer Jon Schlinkert tweeted. ""AI is about to change the world in unprecedented ways, the last thing we need is an AI that promotes racial division and discrimination.""

""Nothing to see here-- just a new Biden executive order that threatens any social media or artificial intelligence company that isn't completely woke,"" senior fellow of the Claremont Institute Jeremy Carl wrote.

During an interview with ABC News, Biden visibly scoffed at East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway's assertion that the president ""doesn't care"" about his town as Biden flew to war-torn Ukraine to show solidarity in its battle against Russia.

""Do you have any plan to travel to Ohio and have you talked with the mayor yet?"" ABC's David Muir asked.

""Let's put this in perspective,"" Biden responded. ""Within two hours of that derailment, the EPA was in there. Within two hours. Every major agency in the United States government that had anything to do with rail and or cleanup was there and is there. In addition to that, I've spoken at length to the congresspersons, the governors, the senators from both states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. And I've made it clear to them anything they need is available or we'll make it available to them.""

FALLOUT FROM TOXIC OHIO TRAIN CRASH COULD BE A PREVIEW OF 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

""Whatever happens here, we got to understand this the responsibility of the railroad company who's made, by the way, tens of billions of dollars in profits. Tens of billions of dollars of profits lately,"" Biden added.

""Do you plan to travel there and have you talked with the mayor?"" Muir asked again.

""I can't recall that - I don't think I've talked to the mayor,"" Biden responded. ""I've talked to everyone else there and, in multiple times, talked about the senators, but both governors, I've talked to everyone that there is to talk to. And we made it clear that everything is available.""

The Biden administration has faced intense backlash for what critics say has been a slow response to the ongoing disaster in the rural Ohio town.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in particular was slammed for delaying his first visit to East Palestine to Thursday, which was one day after former President Trump paid a visit.

Brian Stelter defends 2020 media coverage of Hunter Biden laptop story: We never labeled it 'disinformation',"Former CNN host Brian Stelter defended the media's coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop story that was suppressed in the final weeks of the 2020 presidential election.

Appearing on Friday's installment of the Fourth Watch podcast, Stelter filled in as guest host as he interviewed Fourth Watch media critic Steve Krakauer, the podcast's actual host and author of the new book ""Uncovered: How the Media Got Cozy With Power, Abandoned Its Principles, and Lost the People.""

The discussion largely focused on the current state of the media and the distrust it has fueled in recent years. As an example of when the media messed up, Krakauer pointed to the lack of coverage news organizations gave the New York Post's bombshell reporting about Hunter Biden, which he noted was famously suppressed by Twitter at the time.

Krakauer surmised that the media was largely hesitant to put a spotlight on the laptop because of the ""scars"" from 2016 when so much coverage was dedicated to Hillary Clinton's email scandal, which played a major role in her ultimate defeat against Donald Trump.

MEDIA CENSORSHIP OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS HORRIBLE AND THEN IT GOT EVEN WORSE

""It's one thing to try to tiptoe into the story and it's another to treat it as if it's this toxic material that completely spins the public in a really wrong direction,"" Krakauer said.

Stelter conceded that if Twitter ""screwed up"" in censoring the laptop story, ""we should go after Twitter."" But he offered a full-throated defense on how CNN and other media organizations handled the Biden scandal at the time.

""I think newsrooms just looked around and said, 'We don't have the laptop. We don't have evidence. We don't have evidence it's real. And we know that there are reasons to wonder if it's disinformation,'"" Stelter said.

""A lot of the lies that happen now about what happened in 2020 go like this - they say, 'All these a--h---s, they all called it a disinformation!' That's not true,"" Stelter continued. ""A lot of us just wondered, we said out loud, ‘could this be?’ We said things like ‘some former US officials think it might be,' it was always cushioned - it was not always, it was often cushioned that way. And now in retrospect, two years later, three years later, people like partisans like to pretend that it was labeled disinformation, which it wasn't. There was concern. There was reason to be concerned not because of the Hillary emails, but because of the Russian attempt in 2016.""

OUTRAGE AS JAMES CLAPPER, OTHER HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP SKEPTICS SUDDENLY SPEAK OUT AGAINST MEDIA: 'WHAT A FRAUD'

Krakauer pushed back, citing the infamous letter from former intel officials who claimed the Hunter Biden emails shared by the Post had the ""classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,"" something he stressed was ""essentially"" telling Americans that it was disinformation. He also called out the double standard the media had with its approach to the Russia investigation and how one anonymously-sourced story about the Mueller probe from The New York Times or The Washington Post would fuel ""an entire news cycle"" but not the New York Post's Hunter Biden story.

The former ""Reliable Sources"" host attempted to separate the comparison, claiming there were ""a lot of problems"" regarding the various circumstances behind the New York Post's reporting and the ""Uncovered"" author acknowledged there were some ""red flags.""

What was left unmentioned in the exchange between Stelter and Krakauer was the fact that CNN's top brass was caught spiking the laptop story in leaked recordings of the network's editorial calls shortly after the New York Post first published its bombshell reporting.

CNN REPORTS ON BIDEN FAMILY'S SHADY BUSINESS DEALINGS OVER TWO YEARS AFTER NY POST, GETS PANNED BY CRITICS

News organizations including CNN, Politico, The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC News and CBS News verified the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop long after his father Joe Biden won the presidency.

At the time, Stelter himself heavily suggested to his CNN audience that the controversy was a fake scandal being pushed by the far right.

""There's a lot about this story that does not add up,"" Stelter told his viewers in October 2020. ""And, I mean, for all we know, these emails were made up, or maybe some are real and some are fakes, we don't know. But we do know that this is a classic example of the right-wing media machine.""

Nearly two years later, Stelter completely flip-flopped.

""Hunter under federal investigation, charges can be coming at any time, this is not just a right-wing media story. This is a real problem for the Bidens,"" Stelter told a guest in August 2022.

Democrat wants more Biden challengers in the primaries: 'This is not a dictatorship',"CNN panelist and former Democratic state senator Nina Turner called on other Democrats to jump in the race on Sunday as President Biden has still not officially announced his re-election bid.

""I think the problem that Democrats are going to face is that Biden is not without risk,"" CNN political commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson said. ""He would be the oldest man elected president. There are moments when he seems feisty and ready to fight Republicans, and there are moments that do leave doubts in the minds of voters who are watching.""

She added that Democrats ""have to be a little nervous"" about if it isn't Biden.

""There's no need to be nervous, I mean, people should just jump in. Let's jump in,"" Turner said. She was also asked if Biden should be challenged in the Democratic primary.

GROWING SIGNS BIDEN COULD FACE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY NOMINATING STATE

""Absolutely he should be challenged,"" she said. CNN political commentator David Urban agreed.

""Voters deserve – this is democracy,"" he added. ""This is not a dictatorship. Voters deserve to have choice, period. And you know, I rock on the freedom fighting side of the ledger. I want to see a robust debate. One of the things that our campaign did in 2016 and in 2020, I’m talking about Senator Bernard Sanders is we lifted the debate in terms of what people really need and deserve in this country. And the only way to get that kind of robust debate is to have people on that stage. So on the Republican side, the more the merrier, and on the democratic side, the more the merrier.""

Former Biden speechwriter Jeff Nussbaum said that the argument for someone ""new"" isn't a ""winning argument.""

""When you look at Nikki Haley’s announcement video, when you listen to what Tim Scott is saying, a lot of the message is like ‘new, new, new.’ And I keep thinking like yeah, new Coke was new but it didn’t do very well. New alone is not necessarily a winning argument. And so you need to put forward something. And I’ve been paying attention to what’s going on the right, because I’m totally in it for Joe Biden. I think he’s got the record. And he’s done what he said he was going to do. And so I think that’s powerful,"" he said.

"East Palestine, Ohio mayor 'furious' with Biden's Ukraine visit: 'That was the biggest slap in the face'","Trent Conaway, mayor of East Palestine, Ohio, tore into President Biden on Monday, accusing him of neglecting domestic responsibilities while ""giving away millions of dollars"" during his surprise visit to Ukraine.

Conaway, who has been vocal about his concern for residents after a train derailed in his town and leaked dangerous chemicals into the air, had strong words for the president when asked about the federal handling of the toxic spill as news of the president's surprise visit to Kyiv circulated.

""That was the biggest slap in the face,"" Conaway said on ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" ""That tells you right now he doesn’t care about us. He can send every agency he wants to, but I found out this morning that he was in Ukraine giving millions of dollars away to people over there and not to us…on President's Day in our country, so I'm furious.""

HOW PRESIDENT BIDEN SECRETLY TRAVELED TO UKRAINE

Biden's administration has come under fire for how it handled the derailment after refusing to approve a FEMA disaster declaration, arguing that the crisis in East Palestine does not meet legal requirements for an official declaration, even though the agency has deployed resources to the city to aid in ongoing assessments as residents remain concerned about the air and water quality following the spill. Conaway and local residents have pleaded for more federal assistance, saying that resources on the ground have been insufficient.

Photos of ex-Biden official wearing dress designer alleges was stolen spotted in Vanity Fair 'style' feature,"Vanity Fair was found to have featured images of Sam Brinton, a non-binary former Biden administration senior Department of Energy official, wearing dresses a female designer says were stolen from her.

This latest controversy emerged after Asya Khamsin, a Tanzanian fashion designer, accused Brinton of stealing her luggage full of custom-made dresses in an airport in 2018.

Brinton, facing various theft charges for stealing luggage in airports across America, was released without bail last week. He was removed from the Biden administration over the incidents last year.

In the wake of the designer's allegation, an eagle-eyed Twitter user spotted an old Vanity Fair article featuring Brinton in one of Khamsin's dress.

NONBINARY BIDEN NUCLEAR OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH STEALING WOMAN'S LUGGAGE AT AIRPORT’

After Gov. Ron DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw posted Khamsin's photos of her dresses and Brinton wearing them (tweeting, ""'Cultural appropriation' … is stunning and brave as long as you are ~non binary~""), one Twitter user responded with a screenshot of the Vanity Fair article.

""OMG. Vanity Fair did a fashion article on Sam Brinton featuring him in one of the stolen dresses. [laughing emojis],"" the account tweeted.

The Vanity Fair article, published in the Italian version of the magazine on February 21, 2022, was titled ""All the style of Sam Brinton."" It showed the bureaucrat wearing Khamsin's dresses at a Trevor Project event in 2018, the same year she said her dresses were taken.

Khamsin told Fox News Digital Wednesday she recently saw a report that Brinton had been charged with stealing multiple pieces of luggage across the country and noticed that the former official appeared to be wearing her clothes in several photos.

Biden's latest whack at the suburbs will change your neighborhood for the worse,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

The goal of ""fair housing"" would seem to be quite straightforward. As spelled out in the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — and found in realtors’ offices across the country — it precludes ""discrimination in the sale, rental and financing of dwellings … based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), familial status, and disability."" In other words, those who can afford to rent or buy should not be precluded from doing so for reasons having nothing to do with the ability to pay.

But for the Biden administration’s Department of Housing and Urban Development, fair housing is more — much more. In proposed regulations that would touch any jurisdiction that accepts any sort of HUD funding, fair housing must mean a plan to ""promote equity in their communities, decrease segregation, and increase access to opportunity and community assets for people of color and other underserved communities.""

Translated that means that the route to upward mobility for disadvantaged minorities lies through their relocation to more affluent communities, where they will no longer be ""underserved.""

IRS ACCUSED OF USING 'RACIAL EQUITY' FOR AUDITS TARGETING WHITE, ASIAN TAXPAYERS

The details as to how this should be done run more than 200 pages. Those required to comply will include more than 1,200 cities and counties receiving HUD funding. All will be required to develop ""equity plans.""

Such equity could mean anything from building low-income housing to redrawing school district lines for racial or socio-economic integration, all as assessed by the HUD bureaucracy.

Both those concerned about the best routes to upward mobility for the poor and those concerned about administrative state overreach have reasons to be dubious.

Opposition to the ""affirmatively furthering fair housing"" (AFFH) regulations will undoubtedly be labeled as racist defense of White suburbs. That is certainly how Donald Trump’s 2020 decision to suspend a previous Obama-era version of the rules was characterized. As CNN Business put it then, Trump was merely protecting neighborhoods with ""higher-than-average shares of white households"" from low-income housing.

It has of late been a liberal mantra that children’s future should not be determined by the ZIP Code where they grow up — and the HUD plan is meant to disperse low-income households where they are presumed to benefit from better schools and parks, which presumably city governments are inherently incapable of providing.

The underlying social science rationale, cited by HUD, is that of Harvard economists Raj Chetty and Lawrence Katz, who examined data in a 1990s HUD program called Moving to Opportunity — in which a small number of low-income households were relocated to higher-income areas.

As per HUD’s summary, ""Children who move to low-poverty neighborhoods have increased academic achievement, greater long-term chances of success, and less intergenerational poverty.""

Yet the actual Harvard study is far more nuanced, although it finds that ""every extra year of childhood spent in a low-poverty environment appears to be beneficial,"" it also notes that ""for older children (those between ages 13-18), we find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood has a statistically insignificant or slightly negative effect."" It is hard to imagine a government effort that would limit participation for households based on the age of their children.

More broadly, however, HUD fails to acknowledge that sustained upward mobility is based on the constructive life decisions made at the family level — including marriage and employment. These are the building blocks of the economic gains that enable moves to better neighborhoods. It is such moves that must be protected by enforcement of anti-discrimination law.

The details as to how this should be done run more than 200 pages. Those required to comply will include more than 1,200 cities and counties receiving HUD funding. All will be required to develop ""equity plans.""

Historically, it was the federal government, specifically the Federal Housing Administration, which engaged in racial discrimination by refusing to guarantee mortgages in racially changing neighborhoods.

HUD would bring us to a new era of color consciousness in housing policy, in the name of ""equity"" — comparable life outcomes for those making distinct life choices.

Don’t be surprised if those objecting include the suburban African-American middle class, which has worked hard and played by the rules. Their concern was captured in a recent New York Times article about ""black flight"" from racially integrated Shaker Heights, Ohio. It quoted a Black library staffer who said, ""There’s a group of African Americans that have achieved and have it together. And then there’s the group that’s still caught in not having achieved. … And I come from the mind-set: Separate yourselves at all costs from the ones who might still be struggling.""

Suburbs do need a great variety of non-single family housing types. But they should not be coerced by Washington to build new low-income housing projects.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Then there’s what can be seen as the constitutional question raised by the AFFH regulations. HUD’s lengthy proposal is based on the thinnest of reeds in the 1968 Fair Housing Law, which, following its main anti-discrimination language, goes on direct other Federal agencies ""to administer their programs … relating to housing and urban development … in a manner affirmatively to further"" the policies of the act.

It is into that small lane that HUD drives its big, regulatory truck, with communities across the country in its path. HUD defines equity as ""access to high quality schools, equitable employment opportunities, reliable transportation services, parks and recreation facilities, community centers, community-based supportive services, law enforcement and emergency services, healthcare services, grocery stores, retail establishments, infrastructure and municipal services, libraries, and banking and financial institutions.""

As those aware of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the EPA’s Clean Power plan know well, the court is increasingly aware of regulatory requirements that go beyond legislative intent.

Local jurisdictions receiving HUD funds would seem to have grounds to sue to block the proposed rule, which would impose new requirements to receive previously accepted funds continent and new requirements. In 2012, the court overturned the portion of the Affordable Care Act requiring states to expand Medicaid for that reason. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer concurred.

"Biden’s weakness emboldened Putin’s Ukraine invasion. One year later, we’re more at risk","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his bloody invasion of Ukraine. While Putin clearly expected the war to be over in a matter of months, the bravery and fortitude of the Ukrainian people continue to frustrate and deny the Russian dictator even today. As we mark this auspicious anniversary and prepare for the second year of war, it is essential that we assess how this conflict began, its impact on the American people, and what it will take to end it.

Sadly, the Biden administration doesn’t seem serious about achieving a real victory and deterring America’s adversaries as it has been too slow in delivering the means necessary to deter or defeat them.

This war was far from inevitable. We cannot say for certain that it would not have happened had the Trump administration been in office, but I can say this: It didn’t happen on our watch.

UKRAINE WINNERS AND LOSERS: CHINA MAKES GAINS, BUT WHERE DO OTHER COUNTRIES STAND?

We knew it was Putin’s aim to establish Russian dominance over all the old Soviet bloc countries, including in Ukraine (as well as all of Eastern Europe). We prevented invasion by establishing deterrence: we kept the Nord Stream II pipeline from being completed, we withheld talks on a new START treaty, and we worked with our partners in NATO to increase defense spending and present a greater potential response to any act of Russian aggression.

We also supplied Ukraine with the tools it needed to deter an invasion and counter the Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine. We knew Putin’s objectives, and we took the steps necessary to deny him any room to achieve them.

We also were consistent – just as we deterred Putin, we imposed costs on anyone who threatened to harm or undermine our interests. Putin saw how we approached Iran, North Korea and China, and knew that threatening our interests was met with a real and costly response.

What changed? It certainly was not Putin. We should remember that the same man who ordered the invasion of Ukraine one year ago also ‘annexed’ Crimea during the Obama administration.

Then as now, Putin saw weakness in President Joe Biden’s leadership. He watched Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that cost 13 brave Americans their lives, with no reprisal or costs imposed on those responsible. He took note when Biden said that a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine would be permissible even as Russian forces massed on Ukraine’s border, as well as Biden’s failure to impose costs on Russia following the hacking of American pipelines.

The deterrence we created during the Trump administration was lost due to Biden’s weakness. And Biden’s failure to protect American sovereignty at our southern border sent a signal that no border is to be respected. Putin didn’t change; American leadership changed, and that opened the door to the invasion of Ukraine.

Biden’s weakness and this war have had real consequences for the American people. Energy prices were pushed higher once the invasion began after Biden had already driven them up by killing America’s energy dominance, leading to the persistent inflation that continues to crush American families. Global supply chains and food markets have also been upset by the war, which has greatly affected American businesses and farmers.

Failing to defeat the Russians in Ukraine may only lead to a growing conflict in Europe and further harm our deterrence in Asia or the Middle East. The Ukrainians are fighting this war without U.S. troops, but that would not be the case should the Russians achieve victory in Ukraine and move on to a NATO country. Biden’s failure to put the American people first economically and in preserving our security has cost us here at home and around the globe.

Sadly, Biden continues to allow the war to proceed on Putin’s terms, choosing to ""lead from behind"" rather than leading a response that will bring the war to an end. Even having passed massive defense spending packages centered around military aid to Ukraine, this administration continues to send our aid piecemeal.

That is not to say that the rest of Europe shouldn’t do more – they should. And Ukraine hasn’t asked for our men and women in uniform to fight for them, nor should we provide such assistance. They are only asking for the equipment to fight their own battle, but Biden isn’t responding nearly fast enough to force Putin to reconsider his objectives.

His recent pledge to send American Abrams tanks is a clear example: Rather than be taken from the tanks already stationed in Europe, we are going to build 30 new tanks and ship them there. This process will take months, if not an entire year.

It will do nothing to actually deter Putin – it will only assure him that our aid will not be rapid or concentrated enough to give the Ukrainian military a decisive advantage. This timidity and weakness encourages Putin that America and its NATO allies are not serious about deterring him.

It is essential that the Biden administration change its approach, not just to achieve a favorable outcome in Ukraine, but to establish our deterrence with adversaries beyond Russia. This weakness will only embolden the bad guys.

Vladimir Putin was watching Biden’s botched withdrawal in Afghanistan, but so was Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping. Xi is now contemplating assisting the Russians with lethal aid, a move that will only intensify the conflict and inflict further death and destruction on the Ukrainian people.

The CCP spy balloon that was allowed to traverse the entire United States for a week is evidence enough that Xi feels more emboldened than ever, and respects U.S. leadership as little as ever. Xi is now watching how we approach Ukraine with an eye towards Taiwan, and a slow, weak, and feckless response in Ukraine greatly increases the risk that Xi will feel emboldened to move against the island nation. The consequences of such a move for the American people would dwarf those of the war in Ukraine.

Biden visited Kyiv this week and proclaimed that ""Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you, and the world stands with you."" This is all well and good, but we should never forget that warm words and triumphant photo-ops are not a replacement for real deterrence and assistance.

If we do not back up our words with action, we will do little to convince our adversaries that there are costs for attacking U.S. interests. Indeed, we will only reinforce the impression of American weakness held by the likes of Putin, Xi, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and North Korea’s Chairman Kim Jong Un.

Debunking Biden's 4 biggest lies about the economy,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden has a well-documented history of exaggerating his accomplishments while downplaying his failures. But in recent months, the president has taken this dishonest strategy to a whole new level, routinely misleading the American people to score political points, especially on topics related to economic growth.

The following are four of Biden’s biggest lies about the economy, as well as the data you need to prove to friends and family that the White House has not been nearly as successful as it has been claiming.

Lie 1: America’s inflation problem is improving.

When Biden entered the White House in January 2021, inflation was a miniscule 1.4%. Then, Biden signed into the law the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and a $1.1 trillion infrastructure package. Shortly thereafter, inflation skyrocketed.

Despite rising inflation, Biden and his Democratic colleagues for months inexplicably chose to ignore the data and instead push for more spending programs, in the process claiming that the sudden surge in inflation was merely ""transitory."" Many in the administration also said that inflation would subside by late 2021. They were wrong.

Today, two years into the Biden era, inflation remains stubbornly high. The 12-month increase in the consumer price index was 6.4% in January. But rather than acknowledge that his policies have failed, Biden has repeatedly claimed inflation is improving and prices are going down.

Although it’s accurate to say the rate of inflation has eased compared to the record numbers in the summer of 2022, inflation remains at historically high levels. What would have cost $100 in January 2020 costs nearly $116 today. The rate of increase in prices may have dropped in recent months, but overall, prices are still much higher.

Most importantly, there has been no sign that we’re headed toward price deflation anytime soon. And without deflation, prices will continue to be much greater than they were prior to Biden becoming president.

Lie 2: Biden ""created 12.7 million new jobs.""

Throughout his two years in the Oval Office, Biden has made exaggerated or outright dishonest claims about resurrecting America’s labor market. For example, in his recent State of the Union Address, Biden said that he has created ""12.7 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.""

BIDEN IS ALREADY SPENDING TOWARD $1 TRILLION IN STUDENT LOAN HANDOUTS

Although the figure is technically accurate, it’s wildly misleading without being put in its proper context. In March and April 2020, the U.S. economy lost more than 22 million jobs due to economic shutdowns issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to Biden entering the White House, many states had already started to reopen their economies. As a result, businesses were recovering jobs at a record-setting pace.

Biden did nothing to spur additional job creation during his first two years in office. The millions of jobs added during his first year as president were due almost entirely to state governments choosing to lift economic restrictions put into place at the start of the pandemic, as well as the development of vaccines that limited the number of coronavirus-related deaths.

If anything, Biden’s anti-energy policies, tax increases, huge spending bills, and overregulation hindered what could have been an even more vigorous job recovery.

Lie 3: Biden ""cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion.""

The White House has on numerous occasions claimed that Biden has made significant cuts to government spending. Most recently, it suggested Bident has reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion. Like Biden’s jobs claim, this assertion is incredibly misleading and dishonest.

In 2020, the deficit skyrocketed as Congress passed several multitrillion-dollar COVID-19 relief bills — all of which had received significant support from Democrats. By 2021, when Biden became president, some of the emergency spending started to come off the books, automatically reducing the deficit.

Over his first two years in office, Biden has consistently pressed for trillions more in additional government spending programs, including unnecessary handouts like ""canceling"" student loan debt.

Biden deserves absolutely no credit for deficit reduction. In fact, he has been the most fiscally irresponsible president in history. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the country is now on track to add an average of $1.6 trillion to the national debt every year for the next decade — adding far more to the national debt than in any other era of U.S. history, excluding the recent pandemic period.

Lie 4: Biden said he wouldn’t and hasn’t raised taxes on any American family earning less than $400,000 per year.

During his campaign for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden promised that he would not raise taxes on U.S. households earning less than $400,000 annually. This was a lie, one that he continues to repeat despite numerous evidence that earners who fall below the $400,000 threshold are paying more in taxes, directly or indirectly, because of Biden’s policies.

For example, Americans for Tax Reform, a nonpartisan think tank, reports that the Inflation Reduction Act alone ""raises taxes by more than $750 billion and includes a number of new energy taxes on natural gas production, crude oil and coal that will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices and energy bills."" These energy taxes, and many others too, will be one way or another by virtually all American families, including millions who are living paycheck to paycheck.

President Biden’s foolish policies have made the U.S. economy substantially weaker and driven the national debt to levels we’ve never seen before. And unless he changes direction on numerous policy positions soon, things are only going to get worse from here.

East Palestine residents suffer from Biden’s ‘America Last’ policies,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

President Joe Biden's ""Put Americans Last"" policy is on full display at the chemical spill disaster in Ohio.

Fearing for their lives, local residents of the small town of East Palestine, Ohio, have been forced to evacuate their homes, their eyes burning, their skin mottled with rashes, their drinking water suspect – yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency refused to help for two weeks. What a contrast to the immediate help FEMA provides when buses of illegal immigrants roll into Washington, D.C., or New York.

To assist illegals, charity workers funded by FEMA literally meet the buses and begin distributing food, hotel rooms, rental assistance, legal counsel and health care – the very things that the East Palestine victims also need. And the omnibus spending bill Biden signed in December gives FEMA a whopping $800 million expressly to pay for migrants' needs as they arrive in U.S. cities from the southern border.

WATER USED TO CLEAN EAST PALESTINE, OHIO, TRAIN DERAILMENT TO BE DISPOSED ELSEWHERE: HARRIS COUNTY OFFICIAL

Yet Biden is giving the people of this Ohio town – working-class, taxpaying citizens who are 98% White – the cold shoulder. Under Biden, FEMA apparently stands for First Embrace Migrants and Aliens. FEMA is the welcome wagon for illegals.

On Feb. 17, 14 days after the Norfolk Southern train derailed in this small Ohio town, spewing burning vinyl chloride into the air and water, the White House tried to produce a reason why FEMA was a no-show. ""FEMA is on the front lines when there is a hurricane or tornado. This situation is different."" That is a lame lie.

Under the Stafford Act of 1988, FEMA is empowered to respond to human-made disasters, such as fires and explosions, as well as natural disasters. FEMA was envisioned to help people like East Palestine residents Audrey DeSanzo and her two school-age children.

After the train accident on Feb. 3, Gov. Mike DeWine told families to evacuate immediately or face ""grave danger of death.""

The DeSanzos fled to a relative's empty apartment in Pennsylvania, where they slept on the floor and on a couch.

On Feb. 9, officials gave the clear for residents to return, but DeSanzo says her children quickly developed sore throats and coughs. A local doctor said many patients had these problems and advised calling poison control.

DeSanzo would like to get out of East Palestine, but she makes only $14 an hour. ""Where am I supposed to go?"" she asked. FEMA is footing the bill for migrants to stay in hotels, but not the DeSanzos.

Norfolk Southern is sending each family $1,000. That doesn't cover medical bills, housing, meals and lost wages during an evacuation. Small business owners wonder how they will recover from shutting down and losing inventory ruined by chemical odors.

With a disaster declaration, these costs could be covered by FEMA. But the Biden administration has withheld it.

Yet Biden is giving the people of this Ohio town – working-class, taxpaying citizens who are 98% White – the cold shoulder. Under Biden, FEMA apparently stands for First Embrace Migrants and Aliens. FEMA is the welcome wagon for illegals.

Meanwhile, FEMA's website urges illegals to apply for disaster relief, supplying an Undocumented Immigrants Disaster Assistance Flyer in a staggering 18 languages – but heartland Americans can take a hike.

The White House claimed on Friday that it's ""mobiliz(ing) a robust, multi-agency effort"" for the Ohioans, including help from the Department of Health and Human Services.

HHS says it will open a clinic Tuesday in cooperation with the Ohio Department of Health. It's too little too late. Since Feb. 4, residents have complained of burning eyes and gums, rashes and shortness of breath. Vinyl chloride is a carcinogen known to cause liver cancer and possibly brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia.

Yet Ohioans have been left to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile, HHS has been busy coddling illegals. HHS recently approved a waiver for Washington State to offer illegals free health insurance for the sake of ""equity."" And HHS is flying unaccompanied illegal minors from the border to their new homes under the cover of night.

Where's the concern for helping Ohio children being subjected to dangerous toxins?

Media censorship of Hunter Biden laptop story was horrible and then it got even worse,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Here we are, in February 2023, nearly two and a half full years after the Hunter Biden laptop suppression, and the Washington Post ""Fact Checker"" column publishes a new report titled, ""The Hunter Biden laptop and claims of ‘Russian disinfo.’""

Glenn Kessler notes that among his media colleagues in October 2020, ""few were willing to report information in the New York Post stories without their own due diligence, especially if Russia was once again seeking to meddle in the election.""

He then drills into the infamous former ""intel community members"" letter, which points to the laptop story as one that ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation."" He talks to James Clapper, former director of National Intelligence, one of the signers of the letter who gave it extra credibility.

CNN SILENT AS ANALYST JAMES CLAPPER ACCUSES COLLEAGUE OF ‘DELIBERATELY’ DISTORTING HIS HUNTER BIDEN LETTER

And then Kessler proceeds to remove all culpability for the misinformation and lack of accurate media coverage at the time. He allows Clapper to slam Politico, which picked up the letter’s clear implication, to say that now, more than two years later, Politico ""deliberately distorted what we said.""

Please. This revisionist history is embarrassing, serving to continue to cover the narrative-over-facts reality of that moment. As bad as so much of the Trump Era reporting was, what took place with the Hunter Biden laptop story and the New York Post censorship at the end of his presidency was perhaps the most egregious and obvious example of the elite censorship collusion racket between tech companies, government forces and the national media that we’ve ever seen.

We have seen now through the Twitter Files revelations that there was specific cooperation between Twitter and the FBI in the important months and weeks before the laptop story broke. But we must always remember how the media was a key cog in the racket – which allowed the censorship to take place, rather than jump to the defense of their New York Post colleagues.

""I tweeted a link to the NYP story right after it dropped yesterday morning. I immediately reached out to the Biden campaign to see if they had any answer. I wish i had given the story a closer read before tweeting it,"" tweeted reporter Jake Sherman, then of Politico, who continued his misspelling-laden apologetic tweet for daring to link to the story at the time: ""my goal was not to spread informatoin. my goal was to raise questions about the story—as i did in subsequent tweets—and see how the biden campaign was going to respond. They later did respond.""

It was utter panic. And why? The media wasn’t overly outraged about the egregious overreach from Twitter and other social platforms against a media outlet because it had journalistic PTSD from 2016.

In my new book ""Uncovered: How the Media Got Cozy With Power, Abandoned Its Principles, and Lost the People,"" I begin with the Hunter Laptop story, because it truly exemplifies the overly censorious era that was to come out of the Trump Era. The media was fine with the censorship, because it was a means to an end.

There were two factors at the core of the media’s relative silence on the matter: guilt and fear. The press truly believed they were partly responsible for Donald Trump’s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton four years earlier, thanks to their coverage of her emails, the early easier treatment they gave him during the primary, and more. They felt guilty – and were not going to make that same mistake again.

And then there was fear. The social media ostracization. The attacks from their colleagues. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times previously worked at the New York Post, and she dared to link to the story early on the 14th, even though she was questioning the sourcing of it. By the afternoon she was trending on Twitter as ""MAGA Haberman"" for her supposed crime.

In my new book ""Uncovered: How the Media Got Cozy With Power, Abandoned Its Principles, and Lost the People,"" I begin with the Hunter laptop story, because it truly exemplifies the overly censorious era that was to come out of the Trump Era. The media was fine with the censorship, because it was a means to an end.

For the book, I talked to dozens of media members, on-the-record. ""I think there’s a really, really worrying tendency on the left and the mainstream media and the Democratic Party to censor anything undesirable as if that would make it go away,"" Shawn McCreesh, who worked at the New York Times at the time the New York Post published its first Hunter Biden story in October 2020, and now works for New York magazine, told me. ""...Instead of either burying the story inside the paper, or just touching it lightly, the way they tried to wiggle out of covering it was by insinuating that it might not have even been real, which was a huge mistake, because of course everybody knew it was real. It was knowable. It was so obviously real.""

Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner told me the Post’s colleagues should have come to its defense: ""That’s the first thing that as a journalist, you should be concerned [about] is your profession, not as the team you work on, but your profession as a whole.""

Rich McHugh, a longtime investigative journalist previously at NBC News and other outlets, sees the tech suppression as a huge problem. ""It’s shameful. It shouldn’t be happening with Big Tech,"" he told me. ""...It’s this curious time where these major corporations are dictating what news we get. And I think there’s inherent problems in that. It shouldn’t be that way.""

""However you feel about Trump or Biden, I do think it further diminishes, further erodes, the trust in the media, when it looks like you’re hammering Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. Russia, on the Trump side, and then there’s one little hint of impropriety on the Biden side, and it’s like, ‘we can’t even talk about that. We can’t even acknowledge that, God forbid, because the other side is so bad.’ I think it’s dangerous,"" former New York Times reporter Amy Chozick, who previously covered the Hillary Clinton campaign, told me.

Ukraine war wouldn’t take so long if Biden would commit to victory,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

One year into Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, it is important to remember why the United States and our allies are supporting Ukraine.

If we had the opportunity to help Poland stop Adolf Hitler in 1939, imagine the horrors that could have been prevented and the blood and treasure that could have been saved. We have that opportunity now as the U.S. and its allies once again face strategic adversaries in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific.

Currently, Russia is engaged in a new offensive in the east. If successful, President Vladimir Putin’s invading forces could then attempt to occupy Ukraine’s entire southern coastline. The economic and humanitarian consequences of this would be significant.

FOX NEWS POLL: HALF SAY US SHOULD SUPPORT UKRAINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES

Reminiscent of Stalin’s genocide of Ukrainians, known as the Holodomor, Russia is using its stranglehold of the Black Sea and attacks on Ukraine’s farmland to not just starve Ukraine, but also exacerbate food insecurity worldwide. Ukraine’s economic self-sufficiency and future exploration of energy reserves in surrounding waters also will be impossible without control of its Black Sea coastline, leaving it dependent on Western aid.

Despite what is at stake, the administration is still too slow in getting critical weapon systems to Ukraine. Ukraine right now has only enough weapons to prevent an outright Russian takeover, but not to secure victory in driving Russian forces out of the country. This strategy of incrementalism and hesitation will only prolong this conflict and lead to more Russian war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities.

The administration has recently committed to provide M1 Abrams tanks, as well as longer range Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) – this is encouraging. Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.

For Ukraine’s offensive to reach its full potential, which will likely begin in the spring, they still need more air defense systems, longer-range artillery, armor, armed drones, fighter jets and most urgently, Ukraine needs the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can hit critical Russian targets currently out of range. These targets include the military bases, fuel and ammunition depots and staging areas for Iranian drones in Crimea.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration has consistently been a step behind throughout this war. They have repeatedly claimed sending certain advanced weapon systems – from Stingers, to HIMARS, to Patriot air defense systems, to Western main battle tanks – would somehow provoke Putin. Yet, when these provisions were eventually sent, months later, there was no Russian retribution.

We commend the United Kingdom for their generous support. They were the first to provide Western battle tanks to Ukraine, helping unlock German approval for the Leopard 2 tanks along with the U.S. decision to send the Abrams.

Additionally, the U.S. and allies should join the British in training Ukrainian pilots on NATO-standard fighter jets. Moreover, if smaller countries like the Baltics and Poland can provide such outsized support to Ukraine, larger ones have no excuse not to.

This is not only the morally right thing to do; it’s in the U.S. national security interest. With just over $30 billion just in U.S. security assistance, which is about 3% of the U.S. defense budget, Ukraine has crippled the military of America’s second-greatest adversary without placing a single U.S. servicemember in harm’s way.

Meanwhile, Congress will continue to conduct stringent oversight of U.S. funding to Ukraine, so the American people can rest assured their generous support is being used as intended in Ukraine.

The administration has recently committed to provide M1 Abrams tanks, as well as longer range Ground Launched Small Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) – this is encouraging. Unfortunately, these new systems were committed too late and won’t arrive for many months, missing the start of the Russian offensive.

Putin’s revisionist agenda does not stop at the Ukrainian border. If his dream of restoring the Soviet Empire turned its sights on a NATO ally next, then American boots on the ground would be required.

There is also a clear long-term, national security interest in destroying the Russian military now to prevent that scenario. And a Russian victory will only embolden China’s Chairman Xi to threaten the Indo-Pacific, to include Taiwan, and play into his propaganda that the West is in decline.

The administration was right to publicly warn the CCP against supplying Russia with arms and ammunition. If that occurs, it cannot be ignored. And that information must be declassified.

We must continue, and continue to enhance, our support. President Joe Biden has said we will support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes."" It doesn’t have to take that long. The delivery of the necessary weapon systems Ukraine needs will be essential to achieving victory as soon as possible, and it will be critical to the success of Ukraine’s future as an independent democracy.

"Biden calls 9mm ‘high-caliber weapons,’ suggests banning them","President Biden on Monday took aim at 9mm handguns, appearing to suggest that the ""high-caliber weapons"" ought to be banned.

The president made the remarks outside the White House after returning from a visit to the site of a mass shooting in Texas where 21 people, including 19 elementary school children, were killed last week.

Recounting a visit to a New York trauma hospital, Biden said doctors showed him X-rays of gunshot wounds.

""They said a .22-caliber bullet will lodge in the lung, and we can probably get it out — may be able to get it and save the life. A 9mm bullet blows the lung out of the body,"" Biden said.

""So, the idea of these high-caliber weapons is, uh, there’s simply no rational basis for it in terms of self-protection, hunting,"" Biden added. ""Remember, the Constitution was never absolute.""

""You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed,"" Biden said. ""You couldn’t go out and purchase a lot of weaponry.""

The president, however, ruled out the possibility of issuing an executive order on guns, saying: ""I can’t dictate this stuff.""

""I can do the things I’ve done and any executive action I can take, I’ll continue to take. But I can’t outlaw a weapon. I can’t change a background check. I can’t do that,"" he said.

BIDEN SAYS MCCONNELL IS A ‘RATIONAL REPUBLICAN’ TO WORK ON GUN CONTROL WITH, WARNS EXECUTIVE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED

Biden’s comments were in line with his tough stance on guns during the 2020 presidential campaign. Speaking during a fundraising event in Seattle in November 2019, Biden said he supported the Second Amendment but called absolutist arguments about gun-rights ""bizarre.""

""Why should we allow people to have military-style weapons including pistols with 9-mm bullets and can hold 10 or more rounds,"" he said.

The 9mm round is the most popular handgun caliber in the United States, accounting for well over half of all handguns produced in 2019, according to Shooting Industry magazine. The data showed that throughout the 2010s, 9mm pistols made up more than 40% of all pistols produced in the United States – or roughly four in every 10 pistols.

"Biden admin holding school lunch money 'hostage' to force transgender policies, activist parent says","The Biden administration is using lunch money to hold ‘school districts hostage,’ the head of a conservative advocacy group said in response to the Department of Agriculture's announcement that it would require certain schools to allow trans students to use the bathroom of their preferred gender.

Schools awarded money from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), an agency within USDA, must specify in their policies that discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation is prohibited, the department announced in May. It also said allegations of such discrimination must be investigated.

""What you're seeing here is really the Biden administration saying ‘you're going to do what I want or I'm going to take your lunch money,’"" Fight for Schools Executive Director Ian Prior told Fox News. ""For the federal government to come in and really tie school nutrition and school lunch programs to this radical ideology is terrifying, and it's appalling.""

FNS administers several nutrition-related programs, including WIC and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It also runs the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or low-cost lunches for children and on average fed nearly 30 million kids per day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The announcement ""essentially amounts to the Biden administration holding states and local school districts hostage with school lunch money that goes to underprivileged youth in order to pass transgender non-discrimination policies,"" Prior told Fox News.

The USDA said its announcement is part of President Biden's executive order extending Title IX to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

""Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,"" the order states.

Prior told Fox News: ""I honestly have no idea how providing food to children in schools is somehow connected to transgender policies. What we see here is the Biden administration using children as pawns in this social justice, gender ideology game that they are playing.""

""They discuss equity nonstop in the Biden administration,"" Prior told Fox News. ""But in reality, if you want to talk about equity or equal opportunity, the best way to do that is to make sure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.""

""One way to do that is to make sure that they are properly fed,"" he continued.

"Biden admin quietly approves construction of U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma, Arizona","""Not another foot.""

Those were the words Joe Biden used as a mantra throughout his 2020 presidential campaign regarding the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. But on Thursday, the Biden administration approved a plan to complete a section of the border wall near Yuma, Arizona.

The plan includes filling four major gaps in the wall that continue to allow the Yuma area to be one of the busiest corridors for illegal immigration crossings.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized the new plan, which was started by the Trump administration, in an effort to ""deploy modern, effective border measures"" and improve ""safety and security along the Southwest Border,"" the agency said.

BIDEN ADMIN FORMALLY TERMINATED KEY TRUMP-ERA MIGRATION AGREEMENTS AT HEIGHT OF BORDER CRISIS

The project will be funded under Homeland Security’s 2021 budget, though it was initially planned to be funded by the Defense Department.

Yuma’s border sector remains an unsolved issue for the Biden administration as border patrol agents have already stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the sector this year.

The figure is nearly quadruple the number of migrant stops from last year and the Yuma sector remains the busiest migrant sector in the state of Arizona.

TEXAS REP. ARRINGTON SAYS BIDEN ‘SURRENDERED CONTROL’ OF SOUTHERN BORDER: ‘IT IS AN INVASION’

Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in South Texas were the only other sectors with more traffic along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.

The Yuma sector was notably busy under former President Trump, who had portions of the border wall constructed or reinforced. There was also a plaque installed along the Yuma border in 2020, affirming Trump’s role in securing the wall.

Biden’s decision to secure the border wall comes after Sen. Mark Kelly, D-AZ, has called on the president to secure the border. Republican lawmakers have made similar calls.

The Biden administration’s quiet approval of the wall’s construction also comes after Biden often used it as a means of contrasting his policies with those of the Trump administration.

In the past, Biden was repeatedly critical of Trump, his border wall, and his immigration policies — which he referred to as ""xenophobic"" and ""racist.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RETURN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BORDER

In an op-ed published in the Miami Herald, Biden specifically wrote that the slogan ""build the wall"" was ""divorced from reality"" and a wall ""won’t stop the flow of illegal narcotics or human trafficking, both of which come primarily through legal ports of entry.""

""Nor will it stem the numbers of undocumented, most of whom over-stay legal visas,"" he added.

During an interview in August 2020, Biden told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro: ""There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1.""

""I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that's where all the bad stuff is happening,"" he added.

Biden also ceased all new border wall construction after he took office and has told Congress to cancel funding for border wall construction.

He has since ramped up border security measures. Biden also continues to use billions of dollars Congress appropriated for the wall’s construction. He cannot legally refuse to do so — he is only permitted to pause border construction projects.

Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn't qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.

Tierney noted, though, that the governor was able to secure some health assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services that will go towards helping local residents with any medical care costs that stem from the incident.

He added that Norfolk Southern Railroad, the operator of the derailed train, has been providing financial assistance to the community, but that the DeWine administration was prepared to hold the company's ""feet to the fire"" to ensure it continues to support the community. The Ohio attorney general's office was prepared to intervene if Norfolk Southern Railroad let up on its relief efforts.

""The people of East Palestine need to be made whole,"" Tierney told Fox News Digital.

On Feb. 3, about 50 cars on a Norfolk Southern Railroad train carrying vinyl chloride, a dangerous colorless gas, derailed in East Palestine, Ohio , a small community that is located along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.

The company opted to release the gas from the derailed cars, releasing potentially deadly fumes and other dangerous chemicals into the air, to prevent a disastrous explosion. Local residents were told to evacuate the area during the release, but were assured it was safe to return on Feb. 9.

Norfolk Southern has offered financial compensation to locals who were displaced and has worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and state officials to conduct air safety tests. Health officials have assured the public that tests have shown the area is safe.

However, experts have cast doubt on the safety of the air to breathe and have also suggested residents shouldn't accept the compensation offered by Norfolk Southern.

"Biden admin's regulations would ban 96% of gas stoves, Republican senator warns","Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., warned in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm this week that regulations recently proposed by her agency would ban up to 96% of the gas-powered stoves currently available to Americans.

Daines noted in the letter sent Wednesday that the Department of Energy (DOE) itself acknowledges that just 4% of the current gas stove market share would meet the stringent rules governing the efficiency levels of gas stoves, effectively banning the vast majority of products being sold. The DOE issued the proposed rule on Feb. 1, shortly after the Biden administration was slammed for appearing to move ahead with a gas stove ban.

""The Department clearly states in the Proposed Rule … that only 4% of the current market share meet the extremely high new proposed standard,"" Daines wrote to Granholm. ""This means that, according to the Department’s own analysis published in the Proposed Rule, that 96% of existing gas cooking tops would be banned from future manufacturing and sales.""

""Obviously, this contradicts President Biden’s position as stated in the hearing by an assistant secretary of the Department that issued the rule,"" he continued.

DEMOCRAT-LED CITIES ARE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD WITH GAS STOVE BANS THAT WILL AFFECT MILLIONS

On Feb. 16, Andrew Light, the DOE's assistant secretary of energy for international affairs, said President Biden was not in favor of banning gas stoves in response to questions from Daines during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. The Montana lawmaker wrote in his letter that Light's comments appeared to run counter to the agency's own proposal.

He also noted that, in a ""suspicious coincidence,"" the DOE issued different data that seemed to contradict information in the Feb. 1 proposed rule immediately after the hearing with Light.

INTERNAL BIDEN ADMIN MEMO SHOWS IT WAS SERIOUS ABOUT BANNING GAS STOVES BEFORE PUBLIC UPROAR

""This has led to greater confusion among lawmakers, manufacturers, and consumers. It is extremely important, as I stated during the hearing, that the public understands the effect of the Proposed Rule so they are both able to make official comments and prepare for what could be a substantial reduction in gas cooking appliances available to consumers,"" Daines continued.

""When there are differing and conflicting data points and when statements during multiple congressional hearings are not being answered effectively, then it is incumbent on the Department to clarify these issues for congressional members and alert consumers and manufacturers of the real impacts of a proposed rule.""

Daines concluded the letter by requesting the DOE brief lawmakers and staff members on the impacts of the gas stove rule before finalizing it.

Daines' concerns come after a Biden-appointed member of the little-known Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) made headlines when he told Bloomberg in early January that a gas stove ban was ""on the table"" given the product's purported impacts on health. The Bloomberg article highlighted a study partially funded by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) that linked gas stove usage to childhood asthma.

After widespread criticism from industry groups and Republican lawmakers, the White House eventually came out against a gas stove ban, saying it wouldn't support such a measure. Granholm called the idea of a ban ""ridiculous.""

However, Granholm tweeted a link to the RMI study on Jan. 4, saying ""we can and must FIX this"" and has privately met with RMI officials, according to her internal calendar.

And, despite Granholm's comments, the DOE pushed forward with the new restrictions on gas stove usage.

Biden announces millions more taxpayer dollars to assist Ukraine during surprise trip to Kyiv,"President Joe Biden announced during his surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday that the U.S. will be providing nearly $500 million in additional security assistance to the country amid its ongoing war with Russia.

The package includes additional rocket system ammunition, mortar and artillery rounds, radar equipment, anti-armor weaponry, four Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two tactical vehicles for equipment recovery, Claymore anti-personnel mines, demolition munitions, night-vision equipment, communications equipment, medical supplies, spare parts and other field equipment.

According to the Department of Defense, the package is valued at up to $460 million and will be the Biden administration's 32nd drawdown of equipment from DOD inventories for Ukraine.

US WARNED RUSSIA OF BIDEN'S VISIT TO UKRAINE ‘HOUSE’ BEFORE DEPARTURE

Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine sparked widespread criticism that he would visit the country before making a trip to the town of East Palestine, Ohio, which was rocked by a devastating toxic train derailment earlier this month and has upended the lives of those Ohioans living in the area.

That comes in addition to the criticism he's already faced for providing what some have called a blank check to Ukraine, arguing that there is no verification system in place to ensure equipment and money are being used properly and accusing the administration of putting the U.S. on the verge of war with Russia.

SEE IT: BIDEN'S MESSAGE TO ZELENSKYY WRITTEN IN UKRAINE ROYAL PALACE GUEST BOOK

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called Biden's approach to funding Ukraine ""unacceptable"" and told ""Fox & Friends"" after the news of Biden's trip broke that he opposes the policy because there is ""no clear strategic objective identified"" in the administration's funding of Ukraine. He added that it isn't in America's best interest to be ""getting into a proxy war with China, getting involved over things like the borderlands or over Crimea.""

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year but failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, before refocusing its operations on the Donbas region as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.

The one-year mark of the invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives on both sides, is on Friday.

According to the Ukrainian government, the U.S. leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between Jan. 24, 2022, through Nov. 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

Biden calls Black adviser 'boy' during FEMA briefing,"President Biden called a Black adviser ""boy"" during a Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) briefing on Monday.

The president used the term while introducing his senior adviser Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman.

""I'm here with my senior adviser and boy who knows Louisiana very, very well and New Orleans, Cedric Richmond,"" Biden said at a press briefing with FEMA after Hurricane Ida rocked Louisiana.

BIDEN ACCUSED OF MAKING RACIST COMMENT WITH ‘YOU AIN’T BLACK’ RETORT

""Boy"" is considered to be a racially derogatory term toward Black men.

The president was criticized for his use of the term during his 2020 presidential campaign, when he recalled how segregationist Democrat Sen. James O. Eastland called him ""son"" but never ""boy.""

Biden was also accused of making a racist remark during his presidential campaign when he infamously claimed that if a Black person did not vote Democrat, then they ""ain’t black.""

The president’s latest slip came as he was engaged in a press conference with FEMA after Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana.

GOP national spokesperson Paris Dennard blasted Biden for the slip, pointing out that Richmond is ""a 47 year old man.""

""While JaRon Smith was 38 years old when he was in a similar role for President Trump I can assure he was not called a ‘boy’ by President Trump,"" Dennard wrote on Twitter. ""Joe Biden just continues to insult Black men openly and in public because he doesn't care.""

"Biden calls for more gun control before GOP takes House, says 'sick' to allow semi-automatic weapon sales","President Biden said on Thursday that he would push Congress to enact new gun control laws before Republicans took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January.

Biden told reporters during a press event in Nantucket, Massachusetts that the recent shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Colorado had reinforced the need to pass an assault weapons ban.

""The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick,"" said Biden. ""It has no socially redeeming value… Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.""

Semi-automatic guns, including handguns and rifles, fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger.

Biden said he would push federal lawmakers to enact a new assault weapons ban before January when the next Congress took office and Republicans gained control of the House.

Biden said he would engage lawmakers to make a broader assessment of whether success is possible. At the moment, the odds appear long.

Democrats control the House by a narrow margin until January. The Senate, meanwhile, is split 50-50 between both parties. For a sweeping gun control package to pass, including a ban on assault weapons, at least 10 GOP supporters will be needed to break the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold.

Earlier this year, Biden's call for an assault weapons ban fell flat with Republicans, even as nearly two dozen GOP senators bucked the gun lobby to advance a bipartisan gun bill.

Biden campaign ramps up digital game as election goes virtual,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its digital operation as the 2020 presidential election goes virtual amid the coronavirus pandemic -- with new outreach on their app, streaming town halls with the presumptive Democratic nominee and more.

Campaigning styles have changed dramatically in the era of coronavirus, but the Biden team has sought to quickly adapt to the new landscape.

MEET THE PRESS SECRETARY: TOP BIDEN AIDE FACES DUAL 2020 BATTLES, SAYS CAMPAIGN 'HAS GIVEN ME PURPOSE'

In the last month, the campaign generated more than 54.9 million views across their social media platforms, including more than 17 million video views in the last week.

But where the Biden campaign is seeing some of their largest digital interest is on their “Team Joe” app, which has tripled user engagement in the last month.

“Since launching the Team Joe app in December, we have seen an incredible response from our supporters across the country and witnessed its impact as part of our digital organizing program,” Biden deputy national press secretary Matt Hill told Fox News.

The campaign has boosted outreach efforts on the app in recent weeks, sending 50 percent more messages to supporters and potential supporters than before the coronavirus crisis. The campaign has also seen a 91 percent increase in surveys answered in the month of April, compared with March and months earlier this year.

The app, which was created entirely in-house by the Biden campaign’s engineering team and is free to download on the App Store, launched in December. A Biden campaign official told Fox News that the app leverages existing relationships among supporters and allows them to identify and engage new supporters and potential persuadable supporters.

The campaign sends mass text messages from the app encouraging Get Out The Vote (GOVT), inviting and recruiting new volunteers for the campaign, and notifying of events. The app also sends push alert notifications for important updates.

The app also takes users to the Biden campaign’s donation page and “action center,” which a campaign official told Fox News is “another vehicle for fundraising.” The official told Fox News that the app is “strategic” on the campaign side because it allows them to build an online community.

“From recruiting volunteers to turning our voters Super Tuesday to checking in with supporters during the pandemic, tools like the Team Joe app have empowered our campaign to build a powerful online network that has helped propel Joe Biden to become the presumptive Democratic nominee,” Hill told Fox News.

During coronavirus, though, organizing looks a lot different than a typical election year. Some of the outreach the campaign is doing from the app is sending out simple text messages to “check in” on supporters.

One supporter who received a “check-in” posted about her experience on Reddit earlier this month. The supporter said she was told it was someone from the Biden campaign, and “immediately thought” it was time to donate.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES NEW APP

“But the guy immediately told me he’s not calling to solicit donations, and in fact, he told me he would not take my money even if I offered it,” the supporter posted. “He just wanted to make sure me and my family were doing okay, and asked if he can put me in touch with anyone about resources, unemployment, medical issues, etc.”

“When I said no, he wished me well and sent me on my way,” the supporter continued, noting that “it could be a gimmick,” but that she “appreciated the gesture.”

""No gimmick here, that’s just @TeamJoe meeting voters where they are and leading every interaction like @JoeBiden would - with compassion and their whole heart,"" Emma Riley, who works in communications for the Biden campaign, tweeted earlier this month.

As for virtual events, since March 14, the Biden campaign has hosted more than a dozen virtual town halls, tele town halls, events for frontline workers, families facing unemployment issues, and even what they call “#SOULSaturday,” which are virtual rallies featuring Biden and state and local officials who support him.

“We may be physically apart, but…join us in coming together!” the campaign says in inviting supporters to participate.

The virtual events have also included former 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Earlier this month, the campaign hosted an event with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and last week hosted an event with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Over the weekend, the campaign hosted a digital summit, with more than 800 participants who were trained in the basics of digital organizing and community content production.

On Monday afternoon, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., will host a virtual town hall for the Biden campaign with African American leaders, and on Monday evening, Dr. Jill Biden will host a virtual LGBTQ+ Social Hour.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign launched its own app last week, which allows supporters to ""engage with the campaign from their couch, or wherever they are,"" campaign manager Brad Parscale told Fox News.

According to the campaign, “rewards points” are given to users who convince contacts to download the app. Users accumulating the most points are eligible for a photograph with President Trump.

“Get a front row seat to our virtual events,” a Trump campaign digital advertisement promises.

Another reward for the most engaged users is expedited entry into events – although it’s unclear when public health concerns tied to COVID-19 will permit another one.

The Trump app had been in development for at least seven months and was originally primarily designed for use at rallies.

"Biden challenges Putin to 'end the war' in Ukraine, threatens to ramp up sanctions against Russia","President Biden on Tuesday challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""end the war"" against Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies around the world will continue to support Ukraine and push for new sanctions on the Kremlin.

Biden delivered that warning from Warsaw, Poland, nearly a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a day after making a surprise visit to Ukraine.

""One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv,"" Biden said. ""Well, I just came from Kyiv and I can report Kyiv stands strong. Kyiv stands proud. Kyiv stands tall. And most importantly, Kyiv stands free.""

""One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction; he doubts our staying power; he doubts our continued support for Ukraine; he doubts they can remain unified,"" Biden said. ""But there should be no doubt — our support for Ukraine will not waiver. NATO will not be divided and we will not tire.""

""Every day the war continues, this is his choice. He could end the war with a word,"" Biden said. ""It’s simple: If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war.""

Biden said that the United States and a ""worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations"" will continue to ensure that Ukraine stands able to defend itself.

""We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed in any country in history, and we're going to announce more sanctions this week, together with our partners, to hold accountable those who are responsible for this war.""

"Biden classified documents: 57% of Americans disapprove of White House handling, as stonewalling continues","A majority of Americans disapprove of the way the Biden White House has handled the president's classified documents controversy, according to a new national survey.

As the White House has refused to answer questions regarding President Biden's classified documents discoveries, nearly 6 in 10 (57%) Americans say they disapprove of how the president's team has handled the situation, according to a CNN poll published Tuesday.

The survey also found strong bipartisan support for Attorney General Merrick Garland's appointment of a special counsel to investigate Biden, with 88% of Republicans, 84% of independents, and 80% of Democrats saying they approve. Two-thirds of survey respondents said the documents found at Biden's Delaware residence and his old office at the Penn Biden Center present a problem for the president, with 67% saying it is a very or somewhat serious issue.

The White House press team has deflected questions on Biden's handling of classified documents since the special counsel appointment, referring reporters to either the White House Counsel's office or the Justice Department. Four batches of classified materials have been found in Biden's possession in total, dating from both his time as vice president and as a senator from Delaware.

TEXAS BORDER PATROL STOPS WRONG-WAY DRIVER DURING HUMAN SMUGGLING ATTEMPT; SUSPECT ESCAPES

TEXAS OFFICIALS STOP AIRPLANE HUMAN SMUGGLING ATTEMPT; ONE MIGRANT ALLEGEDLY PAID $11,000

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed Republican border visits as ""political stunts"" last month.

The U.S. has seen record levels of illegal immigration throughout the Biden administration. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported 230,000 border encounters in October alone, an all-time monthly record that broke the previous record set in September.

September data revealed that fiscal year 2022 ended with 2,378,944​ migrant encounters, the highest ever recorded in a fiscal year. That figure does not include the 599,000 ​known ""gotaways"" that CBP sources told Fox News evaded capture over the same period.

The Biden administration has repeatedly sought to dismiss border surges as a yearly pattern. While the southern border has seen a pattern of increases in migration each spring, the surges in both 2021 and 2022 far outpaced previous years, and that pace only escalated throughout the year.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden tapped to lead the administration's effort to address the border crisis, has argued the border is ""closed,"" telling migrants firmly, ""Do not come,"" last year.

Biden draws first Democratic challenger for 2024 as Marianne Williamson confirms plans to launch bid,"Spiritual adviser and bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson is making a second straight run for the White House and taking aim at President Biden.

Williamson, who called for reparations and a Department of Peace as part of her long-shot campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, declared she plans to launch her candidacy for president in 2024 in an exclusive interview with Medill News Service on Thursday.

""I wouldn’t be running for president if I didn’t believe I could contribute to harnessing the collective sensibility that I feel is our greatest hope at this time,"" Williamson said.

WILLIAMSON TELLS DEMOCRATS ‘IT’S TIME TO MOVE ON' FROM BIDEEN

With many leaders in the Democratic Party from both the establishment and progressive wings saying they will support Biden, who is expected in the coming weeks or months to announce his re-election campaign, Williamson becomes the first Democrat with a national following to primary challenge the 80-year-old president.

""Apparently Biden's going to run on a message that the economy is getting stronger. I think that speaks to the disconnect between the analysis of party elites versus the struggle of everyday Americans,"" Williamson said in a recent interview with Politico.

SPIRITUAL GURU MARIANNE WILLIAMSON CONSIDERS BIDEN CHALLENGE, SAYS DNC IS 'SPITTING IN THE FACE OF DEMOCRACY'

And in a press release a week ago, Williamson spotlighted that she was exploring ""the possibility of running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024.""

""As America gears up for the 2024 presidential election, I’m preparing for an important announcement on March 4th in Washington DC,"" she advertised.

An adviser in the White House contender’s political circle told Fox News earlier this week that Williamson will travel to South Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Nevada after March 4.

""You can appreciate what the president has done — defeating the Republicans in 2020 — and still feel it is time to move on,"" Williamson said Tuesday in an interview on a New Hampshire news-talk morning radio program.

Williamson told host Jack Heath on ""Good Morning New Hampshire"" that ""many of us, myself included, feel that in order for the Democrats to win in 2024, we’re going to have to be able to offer to the American people something much more than"" what she says Biden is offering.

During the 2020 cycle, Williamson was an unconventional candidate who preached the politics of love. She emphasized ""six pillars for a season of moral repair,"" including economic justice. She proposed creating a Department of Children and Youths and a Department of Peace, and she pushed for reparations for the descendants of African-American slaves. Among her unorthodox acts was holding a meditation session while campaigning in New Hampshire.

But Williamson struggled with fundraising and failed to qualify for most of the Democrat presidential debates. Days after laying off most of her small staff, she dropped out of the race in January 2020, just ahead of the start of the nomination primaries and caucuses.

""With caucuses and primaries now about to begin, however, we will not be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now,"" she said at the time. And pointing to what at that moment was a very competitive race for the Democratic nomination, Williamson added that she didn’t want to ""get in the way of a progressive candidate winning.""

Williamson traveled to New Hampshire a week ago, ahead of her 2024 announcement, and it's likely she'll spend plenty of her time campaigning there going forward. That comes as no surprise as political strategists have said that if there’s going to be a primary challenge against Biden, New Hampshire appears to be the state where the action will take place.

THE TIME MARIANNE WILLIAMSON LED A MEDITATION SESSION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

""Now you have everyone who wants to take a shot at Biden coming to New Hampshire to do it,"" a longtime Granite State-based progressive strategist recently told Fox News as he pointed toward the near certainty of the state holding an unsanctioned Democrat presidential primary next year. ""New Hampshire is the place where it’s happening.""

New Hampshire, which prides itself on its well-informed electorate and its emphasis on small-scale and grassroots retail politics, has for a century held the first primary in the race for the White House. While Republicans are making no changes to their presidential nominating calendar in the 2024 election cycle, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a new top of the calendar pushed by Biden that upends the traditional schedule.

New Hampshire will now vote second in the DNC’s calendar, along with Nevada, three days after South Carolina, under the new schedule.

But Granite State Democrats warn that New Hampshire will still go first — courtesy of a long-standing state law that mandates the leadoff primary position — and that a primary not sanctioned by the DNC, where Biden doesn’t take part, could invite trouble for the president.

GROWING SIGNS BIDEN COULD FACE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY NOMINATING STATE

""President Biden will not file for election in the New Hampshire primary, which will still go first,"" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley emphasized on the eve of the DNC calendar vote. And he warned that ""this will set him up, we believe, for an embarrassing situation where the first primary in the country will be won by someone other than the president. This will only fuel chatter of about Democrats divisions.""

Buckley’s prediction appears to be materializing with the arrival of Williamson.

Asked about the DNC’s nominating calendar move, she told Politico last month ""that is spitting in the face of democracy.""

Biden EPA issues slow-down on removal of toxic waste from Ohio train derailment,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a slow-down on Norfolk Southern's plans to dispose of waste from the site of the East Palestine, Ohio train derailment until it can review the process.

The EPA says Norfolk Southern had previously been responsible for plans to dispose of toxic waste related to the derailment, but the EPA has taken over that process. Officials in Michigan and Texas have complained after receiving shipments of toxic waste with little warning to local officials.

""EPA will ensure that all waste is disposed of in a safe and lawful manner at EPA-certified facilities to prevent further release of hazardous substances and impacts to communities,"" the agency said in a statement, according to the New York Post.

It added that plans ""will be subject to EPA review and approval moving forward.""

OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT: OPERATORS WARNED OF OVERHEATED AXLE MOMENTS BEFORE WRECK: NTSB

President Biden's administration has faced heavy criticism for its handling of the Ohio derailment in recent weeks, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg personally visiting the site last week. Many critics argued the visit came too late, however, with nearly three weeks passing since the Feb. 3 crash.

Buttigieg himself admitted he waited too long to respond publicly when speaking to reporters in Ohio last week.

""The answer to your question is yes,"" Buttigieg said, acknowledging that letting a week and a half go by before tweeting about the train derailment was too long. He told reporters he had tried to ""balance"" his desire to get involved with the ""norm of transportation secretaries"" — which is to permit the proper regulatory authorities to work without his interference.

""I felt strongly about this and could have expressed that sooner,"" the secretary continued.

Biden growls at the high costs of insulin for people not on Medicare,"President Biden, on Thursday, got angry about the price of drugs like insulin preventing some parents from being able to provide necessities for their children.

During his visit at the Steamfitters Union Hall in Springfield, Virginia on Thursday, Biden spoke about how great he believes the economy is, ""no joke,"" and the accomplishments of his administration during his first two years in office.

One of those accomplishments the president spoke about was putting a cap on the amount of money senior citizens will pay on prescription drugs at $2,000 per year.

BIDEN SAYS SOME PEOPLE THINK HE'S ‘STUPID’ JUST BEFORE GETTING CONGRESSMAN'S NAME WRONG

He said even if a senior citizen’s drugs cost $12,000 a year, like some cancer drugs, they will not pay any more than $2,000 in a year.

Biden also said his administration put a $35 per month cap on insulin for seniors on Medicare, instead of $400 per month. But that is for seniors on Medicare, but for a mother with two daughters with type two diabetes, the cost is still $400 per prescription, per month, the president explained.

Even though the consumer pays $400 per month for the drug, Biden explained, it costs the drug manufacturer $12 to make and package the insulin.

BIDEN SLAMS CRITICS WHO DON'T THINK U.S. CAN LEAD THE WORLD IN MANUFACTURING

""The guy who invented it didn’t even patent it because he wanted it available for everybody,"" he explained. ""But now look at what they’re charging, and they’re making billions of bucks doing it.""

Insulin was never invented because it is a hormone produced in the body.

As for the mom with two daughters with diabetes, she pays $800 a month for insulin, and without insurance, the president asked how someone could do that.

FBI RECORDS, EMAILS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS EXPOSED IN MASSIVE DATA LEAK, SECURITY EXPERTS SAY

""Talk about being deprived of your pride,"" Biden said. ""Look at your child. Your child, you know, needs it. And you can’t afford to do it.

""It’s wrong. It’s wrong. So, we gotta get it done for everybody this year. For everybody,"" he added.

The cap on insulin was part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which impacts those on Social Security and Medicare.

Broader inflation has abated somewhat in recent months but remains much higher than under Biden's predecessor.

The topic of drug costs was a key talking point as Biden made the rounds during the election season, and at one point he claimed to have met the man who invented insulin. It was discovered by a man named Frederick Banting, who died at the age of 49 on Feb. 21, 1941.

"Biden announces slate of gun control actions, claims 'public health crisis'","President Biden on Thursday announced a set of executive actions and legislative proposals on gun control, saying that gun violence is ""a public health crisis"" and the administration's actions do not contravene Second Amendment rights.

The administration aims to ""confront not just the gun crisis but what is actually a public health crisis,"" Biden said in his remarks in the Rose Garden. He was joined by Vice President Harris.

""Nothing I'm about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,"" Biden said. ""These are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we're talking about.""

Continuing, Biden said: ""But no amendment to the Constitution is absolute ... From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we're recommending are contrary to the Constitution.""

BIDEN TO TARGET 'GHOST GUNS,' STABILIZING BRACES IN NEW GUN CONTROL ACTIONS

In attendance were several high-profile gun control activists, including Brady United president Kris Brown, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and Fred Guttenberg.

An administration official detailed the actions to reporters on Wednesday. Among them, Biden is asking the Justice Department (DOJ) to propose within a month a rule to stop ""ghost guns,"" which are ""kits"" people can buy legally to assemble a functioning firearm that does not have a serial number.

Biden is also asking the DOJ to propose within 60 days a rule on braces used for handguns, which make them more accurate; to propose action on ""community violence intervention""; to publish suggestions for ""red flag"" legislation; and is asking his administration to issue a report on gun trafficking.

Biden also formally announced David Chipman as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

A senior administration official Wednesday said that Chipman will respect the Second Amendment while he enforces gun laws.

""I've seen with my own two eyes what a bullet can do to the human body ... and I've fought my entire career to fight this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety measures,"" Harris said as she introduced Biden.

""What are we waiting for? Cause we aren't waiting for a tragedy... We've had more tragedy than we can bear,"" she said. ""The solutions exist... people on both sides of the aisle want action, real people ... so all that is left is the will and the courage to act.""

The Biden administration is also expected to throw its weight behind gun control proposals in Congress.

""Enough prayers, time for some action,"" Biden said of Congress. ""I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases, purchasers, to bypass the background checks.""

BIDEN ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT: 'NO AMENDMENT IS ABSOLUTE'

He also pushed for two gun control laws that would go even further than that.

""We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country,"" Biden said. He said ""there's no reason"" a person would need a weapon that can hold ""100 rounds.""

""We should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from the Congress,"" Biden said, referring to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that prevents gunmakers from being sued for crimes committed with guns they sell legally.

""This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued,"" he continued. ""If I get one thing on my list... give me that one because I tell you what there would be a come to the Lord moment these folks would have real quickly.""

Some of Biden's claims during the press conference are regularly disputed by Republicans, including that gun manufacturers can't be sued and that background checks aren't required at gun shows.

Indeed, the PLCAA only protects against suits for ""harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products."" This does not count, for example, if a gun is defective or if a gun was knowingly given to a person who is banned from possessing one.

BIDEN TO NOMINATE GUN CONTROL BACKER DAVID CHIPMAN TO HEAD ATF: WH OFFICIAL

Further, the ""gun show loophole,"" as it is known, is not actually about gun shows. All federally licensed commercial dealers, at gun shows or not, must conduct background checks. But federal law permits some non-commercial sellers who don't need to be licensed to sell guns without conducting background checks. These sales sometimes happen at gun shows.

Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed their suspicion of Biden's agenda which goes even further than what he announced Thursday.

""By appointing the anti-gun Merrick Garland as attorney general and nominating David Chipman — formerly a senior staffer at the leading gun control lobby — to head ATF, Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe,"" the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement.

""Further, the proposals Biden announced tonight could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders. The NRA will fight this nomination and ill-conceived executive actions,"" the NRA also said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added: ""President Biden plans to announce his attempts to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat. He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens. I won’t stand for it. And neither will House Republicans. Follow the Constitution!""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, ""The answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, the answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks.""

Attorney General Merrick Garland also spoke at the event. He said that gun control is needed to prevent further ""tragedy"" from gun violence.

""We stand here today not at a moment of tragedy but in the midst of an enduring tragedy,"" Garland said.

Brady United, one of the highest-profile gun control groups in the U.S., billed Biden and Harris as ""the strongest gun safety ticket in history"" at an event last fall.

""President Biden’s actions are historic and they will have an immediate impact. These are tangible and powerful policies that will save lives,"" Brown said of the president's executive actions in a statement Wednesday.

Biden health evaluation missing mental status exam: medical expert,"President Biden was deemed to be ""healthy"" and ""vigorous"" in his latest physical conducted Thursday but medical experts pointed out his doctor didn't mention the president's mental status.

Speaking with Fox News Digital after examining the results of the exam, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a family and emergency medical professional and Fox News contributor, questioned how Biden performed on his ""mini mental status exam.""

""This physical exam is more significant for what it leaves out than what it actually tells us."" — Dr. Marc Siegel

""How did he do on that? What was his score? I would like to know,"" she said. ""Physical mental emotional health are all as equally important.

‘WHITE’ FEDERAL WORKERS WOULD NO LONGER INCLUDE MIDDLE EASTERN, NORTH AFRICAN HERITAGE UNDER NEW BIDEN PLAN

""The job of the presidency is a very demanding stressful job,"" she added. ""We must ensure our leader is physically mentally and emotionally capable, especially when it comes to, decisions, regarding life and death and the overall health, safety, and well-being of our nation.""

Since taking office, Biden has faced questions about his age and mental capacity. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took aim at the president Wednesday, saying that politicians over age 75 should have to take a mental cognitive test before assuming office.

""Biden will be our oldest sitting president,"" said Nesheiwat. ""We need a president who is sharp, shrewd, who has the cognitive stamina and the mental acumen to lead our great country.""

Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel asked Tucker Carlson on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Thursday how Biden's doctors arrived at those results without a complete battery of testing.

'THE FIVE': WHITE HOUSE EXPLODES OVER QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S DOCTOR

Dr. Siegel highlighted Biden's ""stiff gait"" saying ""it is sometimes a sign of cognitive problems."" The explanation for the stiff gait in the president's physical was attributed to ""peripheral neuropathy, meaning loss of sensation in his feet,"" however, Biden's doctors ""don't know where that's coming from,"" according to Dr. Siegel. ""They're basing that on a physical examination of multiple doctors but no MRI, I don't see anywhere in there about an MRI.""

""This physical exam is more significant for what it leaves out than what it actually tells us,"" Dr. Siegel said.

White House Dr. Kevin O'Conner assessed Biden and concluded he was a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.

Biden insists Russia sanctions never meant to deter Putin from invading Ukraine despite prior messaging,"President Biden suggested Thursday that sanctions were not meant to deter the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling reporters now that ""sanctions never deter.""

""Sir, deterrence didn’t work. What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you’ve taken today,"" Biden was asked by CBS reporter Christina Ruffini during a press conference at a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium.

""Let’s get something straight. You remember if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter,"" Biden responded.

Ruffini repeated the question, asking whether these actions could make Putin change course.

""That’s not what I said. You’re playing a game with me. The answer’s no,"" Biden snapped back.

""The maintenance of sanctions, increasing the pain and the demonstration [is] why I asked for this NATO meeting today, is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing, not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year,"" Biden said.

Biden said the ""single most important thing is for us to stay unified"" and for the world to ""continue to focus on what a brute [Putin] is, and all the innocent people's lives are being lost and ruined.""

""We have to stay fully, totally thoroughly united,"" he added.

Speaking with Fox News Digital just minutes after Biden's NATO speech, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said, ""Of course sanctions deter.""

""But they must be structured to be impactful in order to work,"" he added, saying Biden should have taken tougher action against Putin prior to his invasion of Ukraine.

Biden's remarks come after weeks of messaging from key Biden administration officials – including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken – who claimed the sanctions placed on Russia were meant to deter the actions of Putin.

Asked in February whether she believed sanctions would deter Putin, Harris said at the time, ""Absolut- — we strongly believe — and remember also that the sanctions are a product not only of our perspective as the United States but a shared perspective among our Allies. And the Allied relationship is such that we have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because – remember, also – we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment.""

Harris also said in February that the ""purpose of the sanctions has always been and continues to be deterrence.""

Prior to Russia's invasion, during an interview with CNN, Blinken insisted that the ""purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war.""

Similarly, in February, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said ""sanctions can be a powerful tool"" and that the overall goal of imposing sanctions on Russia was to ""have a deterrent effect.""

""Sanctions can be a powerful tool,"" Psaki said. ""They have been in a lot of moments throughout history. And what we view them as — or how we’re viewing them as we’re starting high, as Daleep just conveyed here, in terms of the significance and the severity of the sanctions that were announced today — yes, our intention is to have a deterrent effect.""

During that same briefing, Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for International Economics, said sanctions ""serve a higher purpose"" and that is to ""deter and prevent.""

""Sanctions are not an end to themselves. They serve a higher purpose. And that purpose is to deter and prevent,"" Singh said. ""They’re meant to prevent and deter a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that could involve the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv. They’re meant to prevent large-scale human suffering that could involve tens of thousands of casualties in a conflict.""

During an appearance on 'America's Newsroom' in February, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the administration wanted the sanctions ""to have a deterrent effect.""

""We want them to have a deterrent effect, clearly,"" Kirby said. ""And he hasn’t invaded yet. […] So look, if you punish somebody for something they haven’t done yet ... they might as well go ahead and do it.""

A Twitter account managed by the Republican National Committee highlighted remarks from officials in the Biden administration who, at one point, claimed that the sanctions were meant to deter Putin.

Also in February, Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said ""the president believes that sanctions are intended to deter.""

""And in order for them to work — to deter, they have to be set up in a way where if Putin moves, then the costs are imposed,"" Sullivan added. ""We believe that that is the right logic both on its own merits, but equally importantly, we believe that the most important fundamental for anything that unfolds in this crisis, whether through diplomacy or as a result of military action, is that the West be strong, be united, and be determined to operate with common purpose.""

""Two ‘Let’s go Brandons’ from the crowd as Biden gets out,"" reported Lexington Herald-Leader reporter Austin Horn.

It has since become a wildly popular anti-Biden rallying cry, breaking out at concerts, sporting events and even churches.

Biden is visiting Kentucky after at least 88 people were killed, including 74 in Kentucky, when severe storms hit parts of the Midwest and the South over the weekend.

The president spoke with Gov. Andy Beshear upon arriving at Fort Campbell, then he received a storm briefing at an airport in Mayfield.

Biden says 'MAGA Republicans' threaten democracy as he and Dems crank up anti-Trump rhetoric ahead of midterms,"President Biden Thursday aimed to frame the state of U.S. politics as a battle between ""equality and democracy"" and a GOP allegedly assaulting those principles in a campaign-style speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

The president's address continues a recent pattern of increasingly aggressive and divisive broadsides against his political opponents. Biden recently said Republicans are embracing ""semi-fascism.""

The speech comes as Democrats feel they have increasing momentum ahead of the November elections, owing, they say, to voters motivated by a revulsion to GOP policies on social issues like abortion, and to former President Donald Trump himself.

""These two documents, and the ideas they embody – equality and democracy – are the rock upon which this nation is built,"" Biden said of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, both written at Independence Hall.

MCCARTHY SAYS BIDEN ‘VILIFIED’ AMERICANS, HITS DEMS ON INFLATION, IMMIGRATION AND MORE IN CAMPAIGN SPEECH

""But as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,"" Biden added. ""We do ourselves no favors to pretend otherwise.""

The tone and setting of the speech underscored Biden's effort to portray the upcoming congressional elections as part of what a White House official said is ""the continued battle for the Soul of the Nation."" The president leaned on that sort of rhetoric regularly during his 2020 presidential campaign and appears poised to bring back some of those talking points ahead of the 2022 midterms.

With the elections coming up, Democrats more broadly appear to be moving to emphasize attacks on Trump and social issues like abortion, which has risen in importance for voters, according to a Fox News Poll last month. They say GOP actions on these sorts of issues represent fundamental threats to Americans' rights.

Biden hammered Republicans on those topics Thursday.

""MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,"" Biden said, referencing Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. ""Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.""

WASHINGTON POST COLUMN CHEERS DEMOCRATS ‘MOVING TOWARDS THE ATTACK,’ CALLS BIDEN HITS ON GOP ‘ROUSING’

Republicans, meanwhile, say soaring inflation and the economy are the key midterm issues. In the same Fox News Poll, inflation was still by far the top issue on voters' minds as prices have increased significantly under Biden's presidency.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., attacked Democrats on a litany of issues, including inflation, in an address ahead of Biden's Thursday speech.

""How many of you can afford to give up one month of your income? I bet not many,"" McCarthy said during an appearance north of Philadelphia in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""But if you had a constant salary for the past year, you've had more than one month of your income taken away.""

McCarthy added: ""Democrats have had total control in Washington… So let me ask you this. How have they done?""

The minority leader also took a shot at Biden for his ""semi-fascism"" comment. He said Biden should ""apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as ‘fascists.'""

Biden during his remarks slammed Trump, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, Republican efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and Trump's MAGA supporters.

""Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic,"" Biden said. ""MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of the law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election.""

The president said that he does not think ""every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans."" But, he said, the GOP overall is ""dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.""

OHIO TRAIN DERAILMENT: BUTTIGIEG ADMITS HE WAITED TOO LONG TO PUBLICLY RESPOND

Biden refuted allegations that his administration isn't doing enough in its response to the derailment, stating that his administration was on the scene of the derailment shortly after it happened.

""Wait, wait, wait, let me answer the question. The answer is that I've had a long meeting with my team and what they're doing. You know, we were there two hours after the train went down. Two hours. I've spoken with every single major figure in both Pennsylvania and in Ohio. And so the idea that we're not engaged is simply not there. And initially, there was not a request for me to go out before I was heading over to Kyiv. So, I'm keeping very close tabs on it. We're doing all we can,"" Biden added.

A train with 50 rail cars, 10 of which were carrying vinyl chloride, derailed in East Palestine on Feb. 3. The derailment caused hazardous chemicals to spill onto the ground and sent a plume of smoke into the air.

Officials conducted a controlled release of chemicals in the days after the derailment because of the risk of a major explosion.

Shortly after his comments to reporters, Biden tweeted that he spoke with administration officials earlier ""for the latest updates on our response to the train derailment in East Palestine.""

Biden's comments come after Pete Buttigieg visited East Palestine on Thursday, nearly three weeks after the derailment happened.

During the visit, Buttigieg was asked if he waited too long to speak out about the derailment.,

""The answer to your question is yes,"" he said. ""I felt strongly about this and could have expressed that sooner…""Again, I was taking pains to respect the role that I have and the role that I don't have, but that should not have stopped me from weighing in about how I felt about what was happening to this community.""

The report states that the crew of the freight train was notified to slow and stop by an alarm system on the train designed to detect overheated bearings.

""After the train stopped, the crew observed fire and smoke and notified the Cleveland East dispatcher of a possible derailment. With dispatcher authorization, the crew applied handbrakes to the two railcars at the head of the train, uncoupled the head-end locomotives, and moved the locomotives about 1 mile from the uncoupled railcars,"" the NTSB wrote.

Nonbinary Biden nuclear official charged with stealing woman's luggage at airport,"Sam Brinton, a senior Energy Department (DOE) official, was charged with stealing a traveler's luggage in the Minneapolis airport in September, shortly before quietly taking a leave of absence.

Brinton — who serves as the DOE's deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition — allegedly took a Vera Bradley suitcase worth $2,325 from the luggage carousel at the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport (MSP) on Sept. 16, according to a criminal complaint filed on Oct. 26 in Minnesota state court and obtained by Fox News Digital. Brinton had traveled from Washington, D.C., to MSP that day.

After the suitcase's owner alerted police, officers reviewed video surveillance of the carousel and identified Brinton taking the luggage before removing its tag identifying the owner, the court filings stated. Law enforcement observed Brinton using the luggage during at least two other trips to Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18 and Oct. 9.

Then, on Oct. 9, Brinton denied stealing anything when a police officer called to discuss the incident. Brinton confirmed still possessing the suitcase.

""If I had taken the wrong bag, I am happy to return it, but I don’t have any clothes for another individual,"" Brinton told the officer. ""That was my clothes when I opened the bag.""

Two hours after the phone call, Brinton called the officer back and apologized for not being ""completely honest."" But Brinton said it was a mistake and blamed being tired for taking the wrong bag at the carousel.

""DEFENDANT said when they opened the bag at the hotel, they realized it was not theirs,"" the court filings stated. ""DEFENDANT got nervous people would think they stole the bag and did not know what to do. DEFENDANT stated they left the clothes from the bag inside the drawers in the hotel room.""

Brinton was ultimately charged with felony theft of a movable property without consent, a charge that could result in a five-year sentence, $10,000 fine or both.

Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News first reported the charges against Brinton on Monday.

Brinton was placed on leave about a month ago and another official was named as a replacement in the interim earlier this month, according to the Exchange Monitor which tracks government hires. The DOE originally didn't explain why Brinton took leave at the time.

""Sam Brinton is on leave from DOE, and Dr. Kim Petry is performing the duties of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition,"" a DOE spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""There’s been a lot of people who are quite upset that don’t think that I am quite as qualified as others,"" Brinton told E&E News in October.

Biden orders Ohio door-to-door checks more than 3 weeks after toxic train derailment,"President Biden directed federal agencies on Friday to go door-to-door in Ohio more than three weeks after the toxic train derailment that has impacted the village of East Palestine.

Teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Emergency Management Agency will visit residents starting on Saturday, asking how they're doing and what they need, and to connect them with resources from federal and nonprofit organizations.

The ""walk teams"" are modeled on similar teams following natural disasters.

The president directed members of those teams to get to as many homes as possible, with officials saying the immediate goal was to visit at least 400.

BIDEN STUMBLES THROUGH ANSWER OVER EAST PALESTINE VISIT: 'WHO'S ZOOMING WHO?'

Biden currently has no plans to visit the community.

The order came as House Republicans have opened an investigation into the Feb. 3 derailment and response to the disaster.

On Friday, Biden also pushed back on claims that his administration hasn't been present in providing assistance.

""We were there two hours after the train went down. Two hours,″ he said ""I’ve spoken with every single major figure in both Pennsylvania and in Ohio. And so the idea that we’re not engaged is simply not there.""

BIDEN SCOFFS AT EAST PALESTINE MAYOR WHO CLAIMED HE 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TOWN AMID TRIP TO UKRAINE

The Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern derailment forced evacuations after an uncontrolled release and burn of vinyl chloride. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that nearly 44,000 aquatic animals were potentially killed as a result of the incident, and there were anecdotal reports of related illness in animals and humans. Officials have maintained that testing and monitoring have found the air and water to be largely safe.

During a Feb. 15 town hall following the incident, East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway said he had not ""heard anything from the White House"" until Feb. 14.

One resident asked the mayor where Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg was, before the secretary and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan visited the area. The Department of Transportation has noted that the Federal Railroad Administration and Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration were on the ground within hours of the derailment and that the agencies were supporting the investigation being led by the independent National Transportation Safety Board.

The GOP, including former President Trump, has heavily criticized the government's response, with some calling for Buttigieg's resignation.

A timeline given by the White House said the Department of Transportation had provided ""initial incident notification″ to members of the Ohio congressional delegation and relevant committees on Feb. 4 – when the EPA deployed real-time air-monitoring instruments around the wreck site and community – with staffers reaching out to Gov.

Biden predicts Putin will advance into Ukraine: 'He has to do something',"President Biden said Wednesday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin will advance into Ukraine, but he also tried to address Russia's main complaint, indicating that Ukraine would not join NATO in the near future.

""I'm not so sure he has, he's certain what he's going to do,"" Biden said. ""My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.""

Biden, who spoke during a nearly two-hour White House press conference, indicated there was disagreement within NATO about imposing strong sanctions on Russia because it would harm the economies of some European allies.

Biden vowed that ""Russia will be held accountable if it invades"" Ukraine and appeared to suggest a ""minor incursion"" by Russia would call for a different response from the United States.

""It depends on what it does,"" Biden said, anticipating action from Russia. ""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we have to end up having to fight about what to do and not do, etcetera.""

But Biden indicated a full-scale invasion would still have severe consequences, saying it would ""be a disaster for Russia.""

The White House later put out a statement by press secretary Jen Psaki clarifying that any kind Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be met with a ""severe"" response. She appeared to indicate that a lesser ""reciprocal"" response would greet more-limited actions, like ""cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics.""

""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,"" Psaki said. ""President Biden also knows from long experience that the Russians have an extensive playbook of aggression short of military action, including cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics. And he affirmed today that those acts of Russian aggression will be met with a decisive, reciprocal, and united response.""

""If they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine,"" he added. ""And that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe cost and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.""

Biden seemed to try to reassure Russia, downplaying the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO ""in the near term,"" saying it is ""not very likely"" because more work is needed.

Putin has described the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO and the alliance deploying weapons there as a ""red line"" for Moscow. The Kremlin demanded that Washington and its allies make a binding pledge excluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine, Georgia or any other ex-Soviet nation.

""The only thing I'm confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely a Putin decision,"" Biden said of a potential invasion. ""Nobody else is gonna make that decision and nobody else is gonna impact that decision. He's making that decision.""

Biden says Putin ‘cannot remain in power’ as he assures Ukraine: ‘We stand with you’,"President Biden on Saturday said that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" as he declared the Russian invasion of Ukraine a ""strategic failure"" while pledging continued support for the embattled Ukrainian people.

""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said during a speech in front of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.

BIDEN CALLS PUTIN A ‘BUTCHER’ AFTER MEETING WITH UKRAINIAN REFUGEES IN POLAND

It appeared to be the first time Biden has explicitly called for Putin’s removal and would mark a sharp contrast from prior statements from the White House, which have emphasized that regime change in Russia is not the policy of the United States.

Shortly after Biden's address however, the White House denied that Biden was calling for regime change.

""The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,"" a White House official told Fox News Digital shortly after the speech concluded.

The remark came at the end of an address in which he took a strong line against the Russian incursion into Ukraine -- calling the aggression ""nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War II.""

In the speech, in which he referenced Polish Pope St. John Paul II and former president Lech Walesa, he also gave a stark warning to Putin about any potential move into the territory of NATO allies, including Poland.

""Don't even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory,"" he said. ""We have a sacred obligation under Article five to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.""

In the speech he stressed the importance of collective action -- highlighting both U.S. and international aid to Ukraine, and sanctions on Moscow that have torpedoed the Russian economy and declared that the ruble had been reduced to ""rubble."" He also said that ""this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia,"" claiming that Putin thought the Ukrainian people ""would roll over and not fight.""

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

Biden cast the fight against Ukraine as one of a continuing battle for freedom that had been seen in Poland in the fight for freedom against the Soviet Union -- and called for the international community to stay united.

""We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,"" he said. ""It will not be easy. There will be cost, but it's a price we have to pay because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.""

He also had a message for the Ukrainian people: ""We stand with you. Period.""

He also attempted to speak directly to the Russian people who oppose Putin’s invasion of their neighbor.

""This is not who you are. This is not the future reserve you deserve for your families and your children. I'm telling you the truth. This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people,"" he said.

The crowd of about 1,000 included Ukrainian refugees who had fled for Poland. Earlier in the day he met with refugees in Poland’s capital. More than 3.7 million have fled Ukraine since the war began, with more than 2.2 million crossing into Poland.

Biden says some funding should 'absolutely' be redirected from police,"Joe Biden said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should “absolutely” be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to ""defund the police"" in the wake of the protests across the country.

Biden's campaign has said he does not support defunding the police. But in a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan, the presumptive Democratic nominee said that police forces don’t need surplus military equipment, saying this is what leads them to “become the enemy” in a community.

“But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden.

“Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president.

Biden went on to call for police reforms.

""One of the things that we also need to be doing is fundamentally changing way we deal with our prison system,"" he said. ""It should be a rehabilitation system, not a punishment system. We’re going to make sure you're qualified for every single right you had before you went to prison if you served your time.""

BIDEN COMES OUT AGAINST DEFUNDING POLICE

In early June, the Biden campaign said that Biden does not believe that police should be defunded.

“As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,” Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said at the time. “He hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain.”

Bates added that Biden supports “the urgent need for reform,” which he said includes “funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing — so that officers can focus on the job of policing.”

The Biden campaign has pointed to the former vice president’s criminal justice plan, which proposes an additional $300 million for community policing. Bates said that the funding would “improve relationships between officers and residents” and would “provide the training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths.”

“This funding would also go toward diversifying police departments so that they resemble the communities in which they serve,” Bates added, noting that there is need for “additional funding for body-worn cameras.”

In response to Biden's new comments, Trump 2020 campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark wrote on Twitter it looked like Biden had “changed his position” on defunding police, adding a clip from the Now This interview.

But Biden's campaign denied it signaled a change in his position.

“I'd like to thank Donald Trump - for hiring an illiterate comms staff. Biden is running on *more* COPS funding for community policing,” Bates, Biden’s director of rapid response, shot back. “The same sentiment you're taking out of context RE: local budgets is *in* the articles about him opposing defunding.”

Biden in the interview also said he believes it is the job of the federal government to ""go in"" and ""systemically change what's going on.""

He specifically called for banning no-knock warrants and improving police transparency.

""This whole idea of no-knock warrants in drug cases is bizarre, it just invites trouble,"" Biden said. ""There's a fundamental need for transparency and access to police records when they have misconduct charges against them.

Biden on the Second Amendment: 'No amendment is absolute',"President Biden on Thursday, in rolling out a set of executive orders on gun control, said ""no amendment is absolute,"" while maintaining that ""nothing"" he is recommending ""impinges"" on the Second Amendment.

""Today we're taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis,"" Biden said from the White House Thursday.

BIDEN ANNOUNCES SLATE OF GUN CONTROL ACTIONS, CLAIMS 'PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS'

""Nothing, nothing I am about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,"" the president said, calling arguments suggesting that those constitutional rights are at stake ""phony.""

""No amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute,"" he said. ""You can’t yell 'fire' in a crowded movie theater — recall a freedom of speech. From the very beginning, you couldn’t own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren’t allowed to have weapons.""

He added: ""So the idea is just bizarre, to suggest that some of the things we’re recommending are contrary to the Constitution.""

The president went on to call gun violence in the United States ""an epidemic.""

""Let me say it again, gun violence in this country is an epidemic,"" Biden said. ""And it’s an international embarrassment.""

Biden announced a set of executive actions and legislative proposals on gun control Thursday.

Biden is asking that the Justice Department, within a month, propose a rule to stop ""ghost guns,"" which are ""kits"" people can buy legally then fully assemble to create a functioning firearm that does not have a serial number.

Biden is also asking the DOJ within 60 days to propose a rule on braces used for handguns, which make them more accurate; proposing action on ""community violence intervention""; asking the DOJ to publish suggestions for ""red flag"" legislation; and having his administration issue a report on gun trafficking.

Biden also formally announced David Chipman as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

A senior administration official Wednesday said that Chipman will respect the Second Amendment while he enforces gun laws.

""I've seen with my own two lives what a bullet can do to the human body ... and I've fought my entire career to fight this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety"" measures,"" Vice President Harris said as she introduced Biden.

""What are we waiting for? Cause we aren't waiting or a tragedy... We've had more tragedy than we can bear,"" she said. ""The solutions exist... people on both sides of the aisle want action, real people ... so all that is left is the will and the courage to act.""

BIDEN TO NOMINATE GUN CONTROL BACKER DAVID CHIPMAN TO HEAD ATF: WH OFFICIAL

The Biden administration is also expected to throw its weight behind gun control proposals in Congress.

Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed their suspicion of Biden's agenda, which goes much further than the actions he is announcing Thursday. The president has said he supports an assault weapons ban, voluntary buybacks of assault weapons, wants to repeal a law that prevents gun manufacturers from being sued for crimes people commit with guns, and much more.

""By appointing the anti-gun Merrick Garland as attorney general and nominating David Chipman — formerly a senior staffer at the leading gun control lobby — to head ATF, Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe,"" the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement.

""Further, the proposals Biden announced tonight could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders. The NRA will fight this nomination and ill-conceived executive actions,"" the NRA also said.

Biden slammed after giving his 'word as a Biden' that America's future looks great: 'We’re screwed',"President Biden on Sunday was slammed on social media after using a frequent adage he uses while expressing his optimism about the future of the United States.

Biden, who has frequently used the phrase ""my word as a Biden"" before and after making a promise to his audience and voters to lend it credibility, said he has ""never been more optimistic"" about the United States, prompting Twitter users to mock the truthfulness of his comments and point out multiple crises during his administration.

The Republican National Committee's deputy communications director Nathan Brand and rapid response director Tommy Pigott both took aim at Biden for his tweet, noting multiple scandals on Biden's watch.

""The border is open, real wages are down, energy costs are outrageously high, the Taliban controls Afghanistan, & the cartels are making billions smuggling fentanyl,"" Pigott tweeted. ""There is reason to be ""optimistic"" though - we have a [House GOP] majority who is working to hold Biden accountable.""

In 2020 and 2021, Biden repeatedly gave his ""word as a Biden"" that Americans making under $400,000 per year would not pay another penny in higher taxes and that he was ""going to make those at the top start to pay their share in taxes.""

However, FOX Business reported last summer that the vast majority of Americans would pay more in taxes as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed by President Biden in August. A nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) at the time said in 2023, the year in which the legislation would increase tax revenue most, individuals making less than $10,000 per year would pay 3.1% more in taxes and those making between $20,000-30,000 per year would see a 1.1% tax increase.

""The more this bill is analyzed by impartial experts, the more we can see Democrats are trying to sell the American people a bill of goods,"" Senate Finance Committee ranking member Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a statement last year. ""Nonpartisan analysts are confirming this bill raises taxes on the middle class and produces no meaningful deficit reduction when gimmicks are removed and the full cost is accounted for.""

Biden recently tweeted out a similar message on the two-year anniversary of his inauguration about his optimism, saying, ""Two years in, and I've never been more optimistic about America's future,"" which also prompted backlash from Twitter users.

"Biden stumbles, falls while boarding Air Force One","President Biden appeared to trip and fall Wednesday while he was climbing the steps to board Air Force One in Warsaw, Poland, according to video of the incident.

The video shows Biden falling near the top of the staircase on the airport tarmac before catching himself, turning to wave and entering the aircraft. It remains unclear what might have caused Biden to trip on the steps.

The incident occurred shortly after the president wrapped up his trip to Eastern Europe to visit Ukraine and Poland. Biden is slated to return to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday evening aboard the plane.

WHITE HOUSE BLAMES WIND FOR BIDEN STUMBLES BOARDING AIR FORCE ONE

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Biden's apparent fall on the steps leading to Air Force One comes nearly two years after he similarly fell on the same steps at Joint Base Andrews.

Following the March 2019 fall in which Biden was filmed tripping on multiple steps, the White House said he was ""doing 100% fine"" and blamed the stumble on the gusty conditions.

The White House said that Biden ""is doing 100% fine"" after his fall.

From one camera angle, Biden's entire torso went out of view when he stumbled the second time, though his hand can be seen still holding onto the railing of the jet stairs. Biden then got up and made it the rest of the way up the jet stairs.

Another video angle shows that Biden was down on his knee for a moment, before getting up and pausing briefly with one hand on the railing and the other rubbing his knee.

White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield elaborated on Biden's condition.

""I know folks have seen that President Biden slipped on his way up the stairs to AF1, but I’m happy to report that he is just fine and did not even require any attention from the medical team who travels with him,"" she said. ""Nothing more than a misstep on the stairs.""

A White House spokesperson later blamed the wind for Biden's fall, according to the New York Post.

Biden in December fractured his foot while chasing his dog.

Top American leaders have a history of struggling with the stairs used to board the aircraft meant to carry them around the world and keep them safe from attack.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., reacted to Biden's comments in a Monday email to Fox News Digital by saying Biden ""finally admitted how widespread the Socialist-Democrats’ gun control agenda is when he calls for the banning of handguns that citizens use to keep their families safe from criminals.""

""Law-abiding Americans have a constitutional right to protection whether Joe Biden likes it or not,"" Scalise continued. ""Especially as crime rates soar in Democrat controlled cities across the country, now more than ever Americans are exercising their right to defend themselves from the violent criminals being released on the streets by ‘defund the police’ leftists.""

House Republican Conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik of New York had choice words for Biden, saying he has ""forgotten the constitutional right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to preserving our liberty as Americans.""

""As Joe Biden continues to double down on his anti-Second Amendment agenda and threaten the rights of law-abiding gun owners, he has forgotten the constitutional right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to preserving our liberty as Americans,"" the number three House Republican said in an email to Fox News Digital. ""I will continue to stand up for the Constitution and advocating for increased mental health resources across the country.""

Georgia Republican Rep. Austin Scott told Fox News Digital Monday that the president’s gaggle ""is proof that Biden has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about.""

Scott added, ""9mm handguns are one of the most common used for protection of American homes and families.""

Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital that Biden's comments were ""unfathomable.""

""It’s understandable that emotions are running high after the tragedy last week. However, taking away the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners won’t solve the problem,"" Murphy said. ""Millions of Americans know that the 9mm handgun is the most common round used for self-defense. It’s unfathomable that our commander in chief is this out of touch with the American people.""

Biden’s suggestion to ban the most popular pistol in America comes amid the fallout of the tragic Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that saw 19 students and two teachers murdered in cold blood.

Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds told Fox News Digital that the White House can ""try and downplay"" Biden's ""radical gun control policies,"" but he insisted that Americans ""should believe every word.""

""The reality is that Biden and his party are coming after your constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Biden's plan to ban the sale of 9mm firearms would effectively restrict the sale of a gun that represents more than 55% of all weapons manufactured in America,"" Donalds continued. ""This administration will use the horrific massacre in Texas to rejuvenate their deep desire to restrict law-abiding citizens' sale, ownership, and use of weapons.""

BIDEN SAYS MCCONNELL IS ‘RATIONAL REPUBLICAN’ TO WORK ON GUN CONTROL WITH, WARNS EXECUTIVE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED

During the same gaggle with reporters, Biden pointed to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John Cornyn as Republicans he believes he can work with on gun control.

Biden said there was a chance for compromise on gun control with ""rational Republicans"" such as McConnell, R-Ky., and Cornyn, R-Texas, though he warned that there is not much he can do on his own through executive action.

The president pointed to the possibility of expanding background checks and limiting the sale of certain weapons, noting that such proposals would have to come from legislative negotiation with the GOP and are not the kind of things he could do unilaterally.

But Biden expressed optimism that some Republicans may be willing to take his side on the issue after McConnell directed Cornyn to attempt to work with the White House on a potential compromise, arguing that some members of the GOP believe that the current rash of gun violence cannot go unchecked.

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

"Biden says 'you ain't black' if torn between him and Trump, in dustup with Charlamagne tha God","Joe Biden faced a swift backlash on Friday for suggesting during a contentious radio interview with host Charlamagne tha God that those having a hard time ""figuring out"" whether to support him or President Trump ""ain't black.""

The dustup occurred 17 minutes into the former vice president's interview on “The Breakfast Club” – a nationally broadcast morning talk show popular with black listeners – when a Biden aide tried to end the interview, prompting the host to charge, “You can’t do that to black media.”

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN MORE TRUSTED ON CORONAVIRUS

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee stressed that his wife had an upcoming engagement, and suggested he would have to go whether dealing with “white media” or “black media.”

“Uh, oh ... I’m in trouble,” he joked as he referred to making his wife late. Biden and his wife Jill Biden share the same studio in the basement of their home in Wilmington, Del.

After Charlamagne tha God, who is black, then asked Biden to come back on the program again and the former vice president agreed, the host added, “It’s a long way to November. We’ve got more questions.”

That’s when Biden dove into a rapid-fire defense of his record with the black community.

“I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” he said.

It's unclear whether Biden meant to refer only to the host or to the black community as a whole.

POOL REPORTER BOOTED FROM BIDEN FUNDRAISING CALL

Charlamagne tha God responded that ""it has nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact that I want something for my community.”

Biden fired back, “Take a look at my record. I extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP’s endorsed me every time I’ve run. Take a look at the record.”

After the friction, the interview – which was pre-taped on Thursday – ended on a mutually positive note with Biden again agreeing that he “will come back.""

But the ""You ain't black"" moment reverberated on social media, with the host retweeting a variety of listeners complaining about it. Biden ""should never say to a black man 'You aint black' under ANY circumstances,"" one wrote.

""The Breakfast Club"" put the question to listeners on whether they agree with Biden:

President Trump's campaign, meanwhile, quickly highlighted the clip, tweeting, “This is disgusting.”

Trump senior adviser Katrina Pierson called the remarks ""racist and dehumanizing,"" saying Biden believes black voters are ""incapable of being independent or free thinking.""

She added: ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how Black people should behave. Biden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of Black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes.""

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh spotlighted a quote from Kanye West, a prominent African-American supporter of the president, saying, “I will not be told who I’m gonna vote on because of my color.”

But Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders defended the comments, stressing Biden's record with the black community and saying: ""The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.""

Pierson, in a Trump campaign conference call with reporters, fired back that Biden's comment ""wasn’t in jest. He was serious.""

And Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina -- the only black GOP senator and a supporter of the president -- said ""I won’t even dignify that with a response"" when asked about Sanders' comment that Biden was joking.

Pierson, when asked by Fox News if Trump had ever been a guest on ""The Breakfast Club"" or if there were now plans to have the president do an interview on the program, said ""the president has not been on The Breakfast Club, I'm not sure that he's been invited.” She added that ""I'm not opposed to it you know, I think it's a place that we should go.""

Biden has enjoyed widespread support among black voters, not just in general election polls – Fox News polling shows black voters favor Biden over Trump by 76-12 percent – but during the primary battle. His victory in the South Carolina primary, boosted by black voters' support, helped revive his then-struggling campaign and catapult him toward a dominating performance on Super Tuesday.

Meanwhile, this is not the first time a 2020 contender has questioned the party affiliation of a particular race or religion. Last year, President Trump faced a backlash for saying American Jews who support Democrats show “either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.”

He was pointing to anyone supporting Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, both critics of Israel.

Biden vows to 'defend literally every inch of NATO' territory: 'Article 5 is a sacred commitment',"President Biden addressed the group of European nations known as the Bucharest Nine (B9) on Wednesday, stressing the need to stand up to Russian aggression and emphasizing the United States' commitment to NATO allies.

Biden's appearance at the B9 meeting in Warsaw came as part of a European tour that saw the president stop in Ukraine and meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before heading to Poland. The trip is taking place nearly one year to the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, kicking off a war that continues to rage on.

""As NATO’s eastern flank, you’re our front lines of our collective defense, and you know better than anyone what’s at stake in this conflict,"" Biden said to officials from the B9 countries of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

While pointing out the other nations' role in fending off a Russian threat, Biden made it perfectly clear that the U.S. will be there with them if any NATO member is attacked.

Article 5 of the NATO treaty says that ""an armed attack against one or more"" member countries ""shall be considered an attack against them all,"" and that each member ""will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith … such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.""

Biden says he will make 2024 re-election decision 'early next year',"President Biden on Wednesday said he estimates his decision on whether he will run for re-election in 2024 will be made by ""early next year.""

Biden told reporters during a post-election press conference that his ""intention is"" to run for re-election regardless of the final results of the midterm elections. The president said he is a ""great respecter of fate"" and emphasized the importance of his family, specifically first lady Jill Biden, in his decision.

""I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it,"" he said. ""I hope Jill and I get a little time to sneak away for a week between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and my guess is it will be early next year when we make that judgment.""

PRESIDENT BIDEN ADDRESSES THE NATION AS MIDTERM RESULTS CONTINUE POURING IN

The White House in recent months has emphasized Biden’s ""intentions"" to run for re-election, but has not committed either way. Biden, who turns 80 this month, is the oldest president in history.

The president's remarks come just days after former President Donald Trump teased a major announcement, which could be his decision on a 2024 presidential run.

""Two years ago we were a great nation, and we will be a great nation again. Not to detract from tomorrow's very important even critical election… I'm going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday Nov. 15 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach,"" Trump said of what will likely be a third presidential campaign.

Cruz responds after Biden allegedly authorized $200 million fighter jet to shoot down $12 science project,"Sen. Ted Cruz took to Twitter Thursday to criticize President Joe Biden for ordering an F-22 fighter jet to shoot down what may have been a hobby club’s science project off the coast of Alaska earlier last week.

Cruz, R-Texas, joked that Biden’s decision to authorize the $200 million fighter jet to use a $400,000 missile to shoot down what may have been a $12 balloon serves as a ""powerful deterrence"" to high school students interested in creating their own at-home science balloons.

The comment came after the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade’s (NIBBB), an Illinois-based hobbyist club, said their pico balloon that was floating off the west coast of Alaska went missing the same day a Lockheed Martin jet shot down an unidentified object matching its description.

""To be fair, Biden is providing is powerful deterrence for any high school science clubs that might try to invade America…."" Cruz wrote on Twitter.

US MILITARY'S FIRST SHOT AT UNKNOWN OCTAGONAL OBJECT OVER LAKE HURON MISSED, OFFICIALS SAY

""President Biden needs to tell the American people whether this is true,"" Cruz added in a separate tweet.

The club’s globe-trotting balloon, which was last reported to be hovering at 38,910 ft. on Feb. 10, may have been one of three unidentified aerial objects the U.S. Air Force shot out of the sky via the president’s authorization between Feb. 10-12.

The group said that its trajectory put it directly over the central Yukon Territory on Feb. 11, where an object was shot out of the sky.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said the objects shot down Feb. 10-12 may not have been from China or another foreign country but ""could just be balloons.""

""I can confirm that the Department of Defense was tracking a high-altitude object over Alaska airspace in the last 24 hours. The object was flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet and posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian flight. Out of an abundance of caution and the recommendation of the Pentagon, President Biden ordered the military to down the object. And they did. And it came in inside our territorial waters,"" Kirby added during Friday's White House press briefing.

ILLINOIS HOBBY CLUB FEARS ITS BALLOON WAS SHOT DOWN BY THE USAF; NORAD RESPONDS

On Wednesday, the Illinois-based hobbyist club claimed their balloon was ""missing in action"" but are not definitively blaming the USAF.

After a Chinese surveillance balloon coasted over the continental U.S., subsequent objects found floating over the country have put the Biden administration on edge.

Members of the pico balloon community have predicted, however, these may be educational pico balloons.

""I tried contacting our military and the FBI—and just got the runaround—to try to enlighten them on what a lot of these things probably are. And they’re going to look not too intelligent to be shooting them down,"" Ron Meadows, the founder of Scientific Balloon Solutions (SBS), told Aviation Week.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS CHINA'S CLAIMS THAT US FLEW BALLOONS OVER ITS AIRSPACE 10 TIMES IN LAST YEAR ARE ‘FALSE’

Tom Medlin, a retired FedEx engineer and co-host of the Amateur Radio Roundtable show, added: ""I’m guessing probably they were pico balloons.""

Small pico balloons typically range between $12 and $180. They often carry an 11-gram tracker, with HF and VHF/UHG antennas to update their positions as they travel around the world, according to Aviation Week.

The F-22 Raptor, which has been described as ""the best air dominance fighter in the world,"" is estimated to be around $200 million. According to Reuters, with research and development costs added, manufacturers need $350 million to construct an F-22.

President Biden is expected to ask Congress for the largest defense budget in U.S. history next month.

"Deadline for Hunter, James Biden, Eric Schwerin passes to provide documents to House Oversight Committee","The Wednesday deadline has passed for Hunter Biden, James Biden and business partner Eric Schwerin to hand over documents to the House Oversight Committee related to their foreign business dealings, which means House Republicans could resort to subpoena to obtain the information they seek.

A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told Fox News Digital Thursday that they had ""received correspondence"" from Hunter and James Biden's attorneys, but the committee still appears to be in discussions with them over the requested documents.

""Oversight Committee staff will be in communication with them about Chairman Comer’s request. We are also in contact with Eric Schwerin’s attorney and expect him to start producing documents to the Oversight Committee soon,"" the spokesperson said Thursday.

It is not clear if Republicans plan to issue subpoenas. Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas., who sits on the Oversight Committee, told Fox News Wednesday that a subpoena order would be a ""last resort,"" but said, ""I think we're really close to it, frankly.""

""If President Biden is compromised by deals with foreign adversaries and they are impacting his decision-making, this is a threat to national security,"" Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said in a statement at the time.

""The American people deserve transparency and accountability about the Biden family’s influence peddling.

Hunter Biden, James Biden and Eric Schwerin’s documents, records and communications are critical to this investigation,"" he added.

Hunter Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, initially fired back at the committee’s request by saying it ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

""As your Letter is a sweeping attempt to collect an expansive array of documents and communications from President Biden and his family, I write to explain that the Committee on Oversight and Accountability lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and oversight basis for requesting such records from Mr. Biden, who is a private citizen,"" Lowell wrote.

I hope that you will engage in this effort,"" the attorney said.

Comer is also investigating potential links between Hunter Biden and the Chinese Communist Party. On Tuesday, he sent a letter to a letter to former U.N. General Assembly President Vuk Jeremic on his connection to the Biden family’s business dealings involving Patrick Ho, who is linked to China and was convicted on international bribery charges by the Department of Justice during the Trump administration.

Democratic support for Biden in 2024 rises while Republicans grow skeptical of Trump: poll,"A new national poll suggests that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters are becoming more supportive of the idea of President Biden as their party’s nominee in 2024.

Half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents questioned in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday said their party has a better chance of winning the White House in 2024 with Biden as the nominee. Forty-five percent said another candidate would improve their chances of winning.

The poll also indicates that Trump's favorability rating among those who identify or lean towards the Republican Party dropped from 79% in November to 68% in February — his lowest level in Marist polling since before he won the 2016 presidential election.

The first three months of Trump’s latest White House bid have raised questions about his political durability, with pundits from both the left and the right criticizing his mid-November campaign launch as well as controversial actions and comments he has made since declaring his candidacy. In the wake of a lackluster performance by the GOP in the midterm elections — where the party underperformed in what many expected to be a red wave election — Trump has also been blamed for elevating polarizing Republican nominees who ended up losing in the general election.

Exclusive: Read the private email Obama sent his former doc after he questioned Biden's cognitive health,"Former President Barack Obama reprimanded his own former White House physician for criticizing Joe Biden's cognitive health on the 2020 presidential campaign trail, according to a forthcoming book.

In his memoir ""Holding the Line: A Lifetime of Defending Democracy and American Values,"" Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, writes about a stern email from Obama about then-presidential candidate Biden’s ""crazy statements and concerning mental gaffes"" — a criticism he was uniquely qualified to make having served as the White House physician to Presidents George W. Bush, Obama and Donald Trump.

""Biden was on TV again, making crazy statements and concerning mental gaffes; he didn’t know what state he was in or what office he was campaigning for,"" Jackson recalls of the 2020 campaign season. ""He apparently thought at one point that he was running for the Senate and later couldn’t remember what state he was campaigning in. This had been going on for months and was getting worse.""

For years, the media had accused Trump of being mentally unwell, and in 2018 many commentators mocked Jackson for saying that a cognitive evaluation Trump had taken showed he was in ""excellent"" mental shape and ""had absolutely no cognitive or mental issues whatsoever.""

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECY LAUGHS OFF QUESTION ABOUT BIDEN'S HEALTH: 'NOT A QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING'

""Trump never made crazy statements like the ones Biden was making almost every day,"" Jackson writes in his book, ""but these people were jumping up and down: ‘He’s not fit to be president; he needs a cognitive test!’""

In 2020, when Jackson himself was running for Congress, the media’s lack of attention to Biden’s cognitive frailty bothered him greatly. He retweeted a video of Biden’s ""latest cognitive misadventure"" with the message: ""Remember the cognitive test that I gave @realDonaldTrump? The one he aced! Sounds like somebody else might need some testing done!! Scary!!""

Within 20 minutes of that tweet, Jackson received a ""scathing"" email from President Obama.

""I have made a point of not commenting on your service in my successor’s administration and have always spoken highly of you both in public and in private. You always served me and my family well, and I have considered you not only a fine doctor and service member but also a friend,"" Obama wrote in the email.

REPUBLICANS URGE BIDEN TO TAKE COGNITIVE TEST, SAY HIS 'MENTAL DECLINE' HAS 'BECOME MORE APPARENT'

""That’s why I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter. It was unprofessional and beneath the office that you once held. It was also disrespectful to me and the many friends you had in our administration. You were the personal physician to the President of the United States as well as an admiral in the U.S. Navy. I expect better, and I hope upon reflection that you will expect more of yourself in the future,"" Obama told Jackson.

Surprised and flustered by the email, Jackson ultimately chose not to respond. Jackson recalls considering whether to call the former president, but a friend of his, radio host and conservative commentator Dan Bongino, reminded him that Obama did nothing while Jackson was in the midst of a Senate confirmation fight to be Trump's secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

""So, upon reflection, I thought, You know what? Screw that guy! I’m not doing it,"" Jackson wrote. ""I just walked away from it, which was the last time I had any contact with [Obama],"" Jackson wrote. Obama did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

""It’s awfully ironic now, considering [Biden’s mental fitness] is all anyone, including the liberal media, can talk about,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital.

""Let it be known, as the White House physician for the last three presidents, I was the first to say that we have a serious problem with this man’s cognitive demise, and he will not make it four years in office.

Flashback: Biden suggested Trump's coronavirus travel ban was 'xenophobic',"President Joe Biden has imposed travel restrictions into the United States due to coronavirus fears despite previously slamming former President Trump as xenophobic for doing the same thing in 2020.

""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus,"" Biden tweeted as a presidential candidate last year the day after Trump imposed travel restrictions from China into the United States in response to the spread of the coronavirus. ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""

TRUMP'S THANKSGIVING MESSAGE TEASES 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN

The day before, in addition to the travel restriction from China, Trump issued a proclamation extending his ""travel ban"" to six additional countries that included Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania.

Trump's initial travel ban, issued in 2017, set new criteria for visa applicants and refugees from six predominantly Muslim countries over concerns that individuals coming from those countries could not be properly vetted.

Biden later attempted to walk back the xenophobic comment and claimed during a debate that he was making a broad point about xenophobia and not directly referring to the travel ban.

""A wall will not stop the coronavirus,"" Biden tweeted in March of 2020. ""Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it.""

We've seen China, our number-one adversary, fly a spy balloon clear over the continental United States with impunity and basically humiliate our country in the process.""

Assailing the state of the border and Biden's ""reckless"" policies, the governor announced several new initiatives to strengthen immigration laws, including requiring that all state employers use E-Verify to confirm the legal status of their employees. He proposed that voters be required to attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are citizens of the United States while registering to vote.

""We want all citizens here that want to vote, to vote, but we don’t want anybody here voting illegally,"" DeSantis said. ""And if you’re not a citizen of this country, you should not be voting in our elections.""

DeSantis is also asking the Florida legislature to increase the penalties for human smuggling, making it a third-degree felony to transport migrants to Florida illegally. And he vowed to stop the practice of local governments funding nonprofit organizations to create ID cards for illegal immigrants, asserting that local officials were circumventing state law.

""We need to do everything in our power to protect the people of Florida from what's going on at the border and the border crisis,"" DeSantis said.

Offering sharp criticism for Biden's handling of the border, DeSantis said that federal and state governments must remove enticements for migrants to travel to the United States illegally. His remarks carried the unmistakable feel of messaging from a presidential candidate. Indeed, DeSantis stated that Florida — i.e., Florida under his leadership — has ""fought back"" against Biden ""more than any other state has fought back."" He even took credit for pressuring the Biden administration to roll back some of its lax immigration policies by calling attention to the illegal immigration problem with Florida's migrant flight program and a lawsuit challenging Biden's ""catch-and-release"" policies.

Biden's administration on Tuesday announced a new proposed rule that would restrict the ability of some illegally present migrants to claim asylum in the U.S.

The administration proposed the new rule ahead of the end of Title 42 — a public health order that has been used to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants due to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. The order is scheduled to end on May 11 along with the public health emergency and has renewed fears of a fresh migrant surge on top of the already historic number at the border.

To replace the order, Biden is proposing to make migrants automatically ineligible for asylum if they have crossed into the U.S. illegally and have not sought asylum in a country through which they have already traveled. The proposal is similar to the ""transit ban"" proposed by the Trump administration and ultimately blocked by the courts — though administration officials have repeatedly rejected comparisons to the transit ban, citing the existence and expansion of legal pathways available to migrants. They have argued that, unlike in the Trump administration, pathways remain open to claim asylum.

Reacting to the administration's proposal, DeSantis said it was ""sad"" that Biden has let in more than five million illegal aliens since becoming president and that he ""would like to see them take steps to stop that.""

""If he's going to run again, this is a massive problem for him, and I think that they — maybe they're wising up about that,"" DeSantis said. ""Because you can't defend the borders of your own country? That's kind of like your primary job.""

Former Obama economist says 'little if any progress' made on inflation under Biden,"A former Obama administration economist is warning that the economy is ""overheated"" and that there has been ‘little if any progress"" made on tackling inflation during the Biden administration.

Jason Furman, who served as chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, described the economy as ""very overheated.""

""We have made little if any progress on inflation. There is little if any reason to expect a large slowdown going forward,"" he said.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose 6.4% in January on an annual basis, hotter than expected, but remained steady compared to last month. While prices remain above 6%, they are down sharply from the 9.1% surge in June, which marked the highest inflation rate in almost 41 years.

REPUBLICANS BLAST BIDEN AFTER LATEST INFLATION REPORT, SAY PRESIDENT ‘LIVING IN AN ALTERNATE REALITY’

Inflation is expected to remain roughly three times higher than the pre-pandemic average on an annualized basis, underscoring the persistent financial burden placed on millions of U.S. households by high prices.

In a tweet thread, Furman noted that some analysts had predicted that supply chains unfreezing were supposed to bring down inflation, but didn’t.

INFLATION ROSE 6.4% IN JANUARY

""The economy looked like it was turning last summer/fall but that never materialized,"" he said.

He said there were some indicators of a possible fall in inflation, including the impact of monetary policy.

""So yes, more likely than not that inflation falls from its 4.7% pace. Maybe even into the 3's,"" he said.

""But there are still forces going in the direction of high inflation. In recent months goods prices have fallen, that likely won't continue. And the extremely tight labor market has lagged effects on inflation,"" he said.

""6% inflation is much more likely than 2% inflation.""

JANUARY RENTS HAD THE SMALLEST INCREASE SINCE MAY 2021

President Biden had said that inflation coming down was good news, but that there was still more to be done.

""There is still more work to do as we make this transition to more steady, stable growth, and there could be setbacks along the way,"" he said in a statement when the numbers were released. ""That is why my unwavering focus is on continuing to lower costs for families, rebuild our supply chains, and invest in America.""

He also took aim at Republicans for proposing repealing the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" and accused them of threatening to cut Medicare, Social Secu r ity and other programs.

""And some are threatening to default on the full faith and credit of the U.S., which would raise costs and create economic chaos. I will stand firmly against any effort to make inflation worse and increase costs for families,"" he said. ""Today’s data reinforces that we have made historic progress and are on the right track, and now we need to finish the job. ""

"Former WH doctor for Trump, Obama blasts 'alarming' Biden health report: 'The cover-up needs to end'","EXCLUSIVE: Texas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, is calling for an end to the ""cover-up"" of President Biden's health after the president's physical earlier this week claimed that he is healthy and fit to serve as commander in chief.

""The majority of Americans can see that Biden's mental health is in total decline, yet there is no transparency from the White House on what’s going on, if anything, to address this issue and his inability to do his job,"" Jackson told Fox News Digital. ""Yesterday's written physical exam report released by Biden’s physician, Kevin O'Connor, further confirms that this administration is still adamant about concealing the truth.""

Jackson also took issue with the fact that the report from Biden's physical, the second one he's taken since entering office, made no mention of the president undergoing a cognitive test amid his ""deteriorating mental health.""

""Nowhere in the report was there mention of Biden’s deteriorating mental health,"" Jackson said. ""This is alarming, considering I have already sent three letters to the White House demanding that Biden receive a cognitive test and that the results be made public, all of which have been ignored. Everyone can see something is wrong — the cover-up needs to end.""

EXCLUSIVE: READ THE PRIVATE EMAIL OBAMA SENT HIS FORMER DOC AFTER HE QUESTIONED BIDEN'S COGNITIVE HEALTH

Jackson, who previously served as the White House physician to former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, faced criticism from Obama for his critique of Biden's cognitive health on the 2020 campaign trail.

In his 2022 memoir, Jackson detailed a stern and ""scathing"" email he received from Obama about comments he had made on Twitter about then-presidential candidate Biden's mental state.

""I have made a point of not commenting on your service in my successor’s administration and have always spoken highly of you both in public and in private. You always served me and my family well, and I have considered you not only a fine doctor and service member but also a friend,"" Obama wrote in the email to Jackson.

""That’s why I have to express my disappointment at the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter. It was unprofessional and beneath the office that you once held. It was also disrespectful to me and the many friends you had in our administration. You were the personal physician to the President of the United States as well as an admiral in the U.S. Navy. I expect better, and I hope upon reflection that you will expect more of yourself in the future,"" Obama added in his message to Jackson.

WHITE HOUSE DOCTOR SAYS BIDEN 'FIT TO SERVE' AS PRESIDENT: 'HEALTHY, VIGOROUS, 80-YEAR-OLD'

In a memo released Thursday, White House physician Kevin O'Connor, a retired Army colonel who has served in the role since January 2021, wrote: ""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.""

One lesion was discovered on Biden's chest and removed, according to the report, and the president still experiences a stiff gait, but it hasn't worsened since last year.

Biden continues to experience symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, primarily having to clear his throat more often, mostly after meals, the report said. O'Connor said the reflux is the source of Biden's throat clearing and coughing.

O'Connor noted that the main medical event for Biden in the past year was his upper respiratory infection from COVID-19 last summer. He said that Biden's oxygen levels never fell below 97%.

The results come as the president faces questions about his age amid speculation that he will seek re-election in 2024, though he has not yet announced his official decision.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took aim at the president, as well as his predecessor, former President Trump, on Wednesday, saying that politicians over the age of 75 should have to take a mental cognitive test before assuming office.

In 2021, Biden was evaluated by O'Connor, who wrote at the time that the president ""remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-wh-doctor-trump-obama-blasts-alarming-biden-health-report-cover-needs-end,N/A
"GOP lawmakers slam Biden for Ukraine trip, neglecting East Palestine, southern border: 'They can keep him!'","Republican lawmakers from the House and Senate criticized President Biden's unannounced trip to Kiev, Ukraine, on Monday and said it shows Biden is more interested in Ukraine than the crisis at the border or the release of toxic chemicals into the air and water in East Palestine, Ohio.

""When our border is in crisis, Joe Biden goes home to nap in Delaware. When Ohio burns with toxic chemicals, Biden’s admin says everything is fine,"" Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""So on Presidents Day, I’m not surprised that Biden is ditching America for Ukraine. He ditched America’s interests since the start of his presidency. They can keep him!"" he said.

Freshman Senator Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., added to the mounting Republican criticism in a tweet Monday by saying, ""If you want to understand why so many Americans are frustrated right now: Biden is in Ukraine before Ohio.""

Senior Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, tweeted a similar message Monday: ""No time to visit East Palestine, Ohio but plenty of time for this,"" he said.

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

""This is incredibly insulting,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. tweeted on Monday. ""Today on our President’s Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war.""

US WARNED RUSSIA OF BIDEN'S VISIT TO UKRAINE 'HOURS' BEFORE DEPARTURE

In another tweet, Greene noted that the president has yet to visit Ohio following the train derailment earlier this month that led to a toxic chemical scare that still as residents worried about their health.

PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES SURPRISE VISIT TO KYIV, UKRAINE, MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY

""Biden didn’t go to East Palestine, Ohio on President’s Day,"" Greene stated. ""He went to Ukraine, a NON-NATO nation, whose leader is an actor and is apparently now commanding our United States military to world war.""

""We must impeach this America Last fool before it’s too late,"" she said.

Senator Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., stated on Twitter, ""#POTUS has now spent more time in Ukraine than he has at our southern border. @JoeBiden refuses to address the AMERICAN crisis that will impact generations and poses an immediate threat to our national security.""

"28 groups urge Biden admin to support women's sports, fight 'unlawful' Title IX reg","EXCLUSIVE: More than two dozen organizations are urging the Biden administration to ""abandon plans"" to allow biological males to compete in women's sports and use the same locker rooms.

In 2022, Biden's Education Department proposed regulations on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to expand the meaning of sex discrimination to include ""gender identity."" Another round of regulations will be released by the department this spring that will specifically address Title IX's application to transgender athletes participating in women's sports.

But in a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona Tuesday organized by the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a diverse coalition of lawyers, subject-matter experts, parents, civil rights groups and former education officials said the Biden administration's additional anticipated regulations will ""unfairly"" penalize female athletes.

""The Department does not have the legal authority to issue regulations that would subvert rather than fulfill the requirements of Title IX by permitting or requiring biological males who identify as females to compete in sex-separated women’s sports and to use the intimate facilities and shared spaces of female students … we anticipate that the coming rulemaking on athletics will similarly conflate gender identity with Title IX’s sex-based protections and degrade those very protections,"" the groups wrote in their letter.

SWIMMING STAR RILEY GAINES AND REP. LAMALFA WARN OF GROWING 'GENDER IDEOLOGY PROPAGANDA' RUINING WOMEN'S SPORTS

They argue that Title IX, which ""is limited to"" the prohibition of sex-based discrimination involving ""any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,"" does not include gender identity.

The letter was signed by the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action for America, Ethics and Public Policy Center, SAVE, Independent Women's Law Center, Child and Parental Rights Campaign, Texas Eagle Forum, Family Policy Alliance, No Left Turn in Education, Southeastern Legal Foundation, American Civil Rights Project, Parents Defending Education and others.

""The Department’s view that Title IX extends to gender identity is an extremist position not supported by the purpose, text, structure or legislative history of Title IX,"" said Bob Eitel, president of the Defense of Freedom Institute. ""More importantly, if the administration proceeds with its radical rewrite of Title IX, it will result in severe harm to biological women and girls and cause them to lose positions on athletic teams, awards, scholarships and prizes, as well as risk bodily harm in certain sports.""

Cardona has said that he supports allowing biological male transgender people to compete in women's sports. He said during his confirmation hearing that it is ""critically important"" that educators and school systems ""respect the rights of all students, including students who are transgender"" and that all students should be able to participate in activities.

CAITLYN JENNER OPPOSES BOYS WHO ARE TRANS PLAYING SPORTS ON GIRLS TEAMS IN SCHOOL

The Biden administrations' actions have come under scrutiny by current and former female athletes who feel they are at a disadvantage when competing against biological males.

Riley Gaines, an NCAA swimmer, All-American athlete and Independent Women's Forum spokeswoman, bashed President Joe Biden's advocacy of ""gender ideology propaganda"" in an interview with Fox News Digital this month.

Gaines was forced to compete against biological male Lia Thomas in a swimming competition in which the two tied for first place, a match she outspokenly believes was unfair due to biological differences.

House GOP votes next week to kill Biden’s ‘woke’ ESG investing rule,"House Republicans will vote on legislation next week to kill the Biden administration’s controversial rule that allows private retirement plan fiduciaries to consider environment, social and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions for their clients.

The Department of Labor’s controversial rule, which took effect in February, has been derided by Republicans and dozens of trade associations as an effort to impose a social agenda on the more than 140 million Americans whose retirement plans are governed by standards set by the federal government.

For decades, those standards have said investment decisions must be guided by the goal of maximizing the return on those investments. However, the rule from Biden’s Labor Department said investment plan fiduciaries can consider companies that prioritize climate change and other social issues as they invest.

OVER 100 GROUPS BACK MANCHIN, GOP PLAN TO BLOCK BIDEN'S ‘WOKE’ ESG INVESTING RULE

House Republicans will use the Congressional Review Act next week to try and stop Biden’s ESG rule. That law lets Congress reject any federal rule if the House and Senate can pass a resolution that says Congress disapproves of it.

Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., introduced a resolution to that effect in early February, and the House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to set that resolution up for a vote on the House floor as early as Tuesday.

""Retirement plans should be solely focused on delivering maximum returns, not advancing a political agenda,"" Barr said this month when he introduced the measure. ""If Congress doesn’t block the Department of Labor’s rule greenlighting ESG investing in retirement plans, retirees will suffer diminished returns on the investment of their hard-earned money.""

ALL GOP SENATORS, MANCHIN CHALLENGE BIDEN'S ESG CLIMATE INVESTMENT RULE 'POLITICIZING' AMERICANS' 401(K)s

In early February, more than 100 groups organized by Advancing American Freedom (AAF), former Vice President Mike Pence’s political advocacy group, called on Congress to roll back the ESG rule. Groups on the letter included Heritage Action, America First Policy Institute, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Climate Science Coalition of America, Club for Growth, Fair Energy Foundation, Faith & Freedom Coalition and the Foundation for Government Accountability.

""The woke capital agenda of the Biden administration needs to be cast aside for commonsense policies that protect American retirees,"" AAF founder Pence told Fox News Digital. ""The American people deserve accountability for their hard-earned savings and reassurance that the encroaching of ESG is overturned.""

The Labor Department has defended its decision to allow retirement plan managers to consider investing in companies that are ""committed to positive environmental, social and governance actions."" While the Labor Department acknowledges those goals are not aimed at maximizing returns, the department also insists that the rule change would help plan fiduciaries ""safeguard the savings of America's workers"" by allowing ESG-based investment decisions.

25 STATES HIT BIDEN ADMIN WITH LAWSUIT OVER CLIMATE ACTION TARGETING AMERICANS' RETIREMENT SAVINGS

House passage of the bill disapproving of the ESG is all but assured in the GOP-led House, and while it is not clear Democrat leaders in the Senate will take it up, the bill is supported by at least half of the upper chamber. In early February, all 49 Republican senators and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., proposed a Senate version of Barr’s legislation.

Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said when he introduced the bill that ""the last thing we should do is encourage fiduciaries to make decisions with a lower rate of return for purely ideological reasons.""

Hunter Biden emails under investigation by Senate Homeland Security Committee after hard drive report emerges,"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is investigating newly released emails that reveal that Hunter Biden introduced his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings in 2015 at Hunter's request.

Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Fox News on Wednesday that the committee has been in touch with the person who provided the emails and was in the process of validating the information.

The emails in question were obtained by the New York Post and revealed that Biden’s son introduced the then-vice president to a top executive at Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings less than a year before he pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the company.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN BLASTS BIDEN OVER NEW HUNTER BIDEN-UKRAINE STORY, CLAIMS IT SHOWS HE ‘LIED’

""We regularly speak with individuals who email the committee’s whistleblower account to determine whether we can validate their claims,"" Johnson told Fox News. ""Although we consider those communications to be confidential, because the individual in this instance spoke with the media about his contact with the committee, we can confirm receipt of his email complaint, have been in contact with the whistleblower, and are in the process of validating the information he provided.”

The Post report revealed that Biden, at Hunter’s request, met with Vadym Pozharskyi in April 2015 in Washington, D.C.

The meeting was mentioned in an email of appreciation, according to the Post, that Pozharskyi sent to Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015 — a year after Hunter took on his lucrative position on the board of Burisma.

“Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It’s realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,” the email read.

An earlier email from May 2014 also showed Pozharskyi, reportedly a top Burisma executive, asking Hunter for “advice on how you could use your influence” on the company’s behalf, the Post reported.

The meeting took place less than a year before the former vice president purportedly pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin.

Biden once famously boasted on camera that when he was vice president and spearheading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, who was the top prosecutor at the time. He had been investigating the founder of Burisma.

GIULIANI'S LAWYER SAYS HE HAS HARD DRIVE WITH HUNTER BIDEN TEXTS, EMAILS, VIDEOS OF 'COMPROMISING POSITIONS'

“I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,” Biden infamously said to the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.

“Well, son of a b---,” he continued. “He got fired.”

Biden and Biden allies have maintained, though, that his intervention prompting the firing of Shokin had nothing to do with his son, but rather was tied to corruption concerns.

Biden repeatedly has claimed he’s “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

In October 2019, Biden told the news-talk radio program “New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath” that he “never” discussed with his son ""or any family member what they’re doing because, in fact, what happens if you did that, then it’s, 'Well, are you engaged and in any way helping?’ I never had a discussion with my son about it.”

Biden added that Hunter “did say at one point that it came out that he was on the board, I said, ‘I sure hope the hell you know what you’re doing, period.’”

Johnson's committee has been investigating Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings since 2019, and last month released an interim report on their monthslong probe into Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma and his alleged “extensive and complex financial transactions.”

Johnson and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said their investigation has “faced many obstacles” from Democrats on their committees and that executive agencies “failed to comply with document requests.”

The chairmen added that “there remains much work to be done” in their probe. Hunter Biden is the son of the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. His work background played a starring role in the Trump impeachment efforts earlier this year. He and his father have denied any wrongdoing related to his work.

HUNTER BIDEN INTRODUCED BURISMA ADVISER TO VP DAD BEFORE UKRAINE PRESSURE, EMAIL SHOWS

The 87-page report stated that Obama administration officials “knew” that Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma was “problematic” and that it interfered “in the efficient execution of policy with respect to Ukraine.”

“This investigation has illustrated the extent to which officials within the Obama administration ignored the glaring warning signs when the vice president’s son joined the board of a company owned by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch,” the report’s executive summary stated.

Meanwhile, the Post reported Wednesday the emails were part of a trove of data recovered from a laptop which was dropped off at a repair shop in Delaware in April 2019.

The Post reported that other material turned up on the laptop, including a video, which they described as showing Hunter smoking crack while engaged in a sexual act with an unidentified woman, as well as other sexually explicit images.

The FBI reportedly seized the computer and hard drive in December 2019. The shop owner, though, said he made a copy of the hard drive and later gave it to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert Costello.

The Post reported that the FBI referred questions about the hard drive and laptop to the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office, where a spokesperson told the outlet that the office “can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.”

A lawyer for Hunter Biden did not comment on specifics, but instead told the Post that Giuliani “has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence.”

The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Biden’s role on the board of Burisma and his business dealings emerged during the Trump impeachment inquiry in 2019.

Trump, during his now-infamous July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressed for Kiev to look into the elder Biden's role pressing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been investigating the founder of Burisma.

Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine prompted a whistleblower complaint, and, in turn, the impeachment inquiry.

The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats cited as a quid pro quo arrangement.

Joe Biden met with at least 14 of Hunter’s business associates while vice president,"President Biden met with at least 14 of Hunter Biden’s business associates while he was vice president in the Obama White House, casting further doubt on the president’s repeated claims that he had no knowledge of his son’s foreign business dealings.

""I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,"" Biden said in 2019.

But the president met with at least 14 of Hunter’s business associates from the U.S., Mexico, Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan over the course of his vice presidency, a Fox News Digital review found.

Two of Hunter’s Mexican business associates, Miguel Aleman Velasco and Miguel Aleman Magnani visited the West Wing on Feb. 26, 2014, according to the Obama White House visitor logs, and Joe was later photographed with Hunter giving Velasco and Magnani a tour of the White House Brady Press Briefing room.

""Do you have pictures from the lunch I had in dad's office (I think on 2/26) with Miguel Alleman [sic] Sr. And Jr. And Jeff Cooper? If so let me know and I can send someone to pick them up. Thanks. How was Kiev?"" Hunter wrote in an April 2014 email to David Lienemann, Biden's official photographer during his 8 years as vice president.

Emails, which were reviewed by Fox News Digital, from more than a year later showed that Hunter arranged a video conference with his father and Carlos Slim, a Mexican billionaire with whom Hunter was seeking to do business with at the time, on Oct. 30, 2015.

Less than a month after the video conference, Slim, Velasco and Magnani attended a meeting with Joe, Hunter, and Hunter’s business partner and family friend Jeff Cooper at the vice presidential residence at Number One Observatory Circle, Washington D.C., according to photos dated Nov. 19, 2015 and published by The Daily Mail.

HUNTER BIDEN MAKES RARE PUBLIC OUTING AMID INVESTIGATION

At the time of that meeting, Hunter and Cooper were in talks with Slim, Velasco and Magnani about investing in a Mexican energy company, The Daily Mail reported, citing documents from Hunter’s infamous abandoned laptop. Emails showed the men also met Joe at the White House, the report said.

In February 2016, just months after the meeting at Joe’s private residence, the vice president reportedly flew Hunter and Cooper on Air Force 2 to Mexico City. Hunter wrote an email to Magnani informing him as much, saying he would be attending a meeting between Joe and then-Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto.

""We are arriving late tonight on Air Force 2 to MX City. We will be there for Thursday - I'm attending meeting w/ President N w/ Dad. Jeff [Cooper] is with me on lane [sic] and we will be with us all day,"" Hunter wrote to Magnani on February 24, 2016.

Hunter invited Magnani to greet the vice president upon landing, but in the same email, Hunter expressed indignation with Magnani, accusing him of going silent on their business partnership despite Hunter giving him access to his father.

""I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F'ing White House and the Vice President's house and the inauguration and then you go completely silent,"" Hunter wrote in the email.

""I don't know what it is that I did but I'd like to know why I've delivered on every single thing you've ever asked - and you make me feel like I've done something to offend you."" he continued.

More than two years later, Hunter confirmed in a text message to Cooper that he had spoken with his father about Slim, the New York Post reported.

""Spoke to my dad about ‘Slim ask,’"" Hunter wrote on July 24, 2018, to which Cooper responded, ""Oh that sounds SO F’ING GOOD.""

Joe also met with former Colombia President Andrés Pastrana Arango and Eric Schwerin, the former president of Hunter’s since-dissolved investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners, at Joe’s Naval Observatory residence on March 2, 2012, according to an entry in Hunter’s personal calendar obtained by the Post.

Later the same day, Hunter, whose Rosemont Seneca had entered a contract months earlier with OAS, a Brazilian construction company with Colombian interests, scheduled a lunch at Café Milano in Washington, D.C., with Arango and Juan Esteban Orduz, the president of Colombian Coffee Federation, the Post reported.

Joe also attended a dinner with Hunter’s business associates from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia at the same Café Milano in Washington, D.C., on April 16, 2015, records on Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop show.

The dinner’s guest list, according to an email from Hunter to his business partner Devon Archer, included Vadym Pozharskyi, an executive at Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter served as a board member. The guest list also included the late Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov and his wife, Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina, who was in business with Hunter’s Rosemont firm, though it is not clear whether they actually attended the dinner.

Rick Leach, who at the time was the president and chief executive of WFP USA, told The Washington Post in 2021 that Joe did show up at the dinner, but that he didn’t stay long and no politics or business were discussed.

The day after the dinner, Hunter received an email from Burisma’s Pozharskyi that read, ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.""

Former Kazakhstan Prime Minister Karim Massimov and Kazakh oligarch Kenes Rakishev also appeared posing alongside Joe and Hunter in an unverified photograph posted online. The Post said it appeared to be taken the same night as the dinner, though the date of the photo could not be determined.

Hunter’s guest list for the dinner included ""our KZ friends,"" which could presumably be Massimov and Rakishev. At the same time, Hunter was trying to broker an oil deal between Burisma and a Chinese energy company located in Kazakhstan, The Daily Mail reported, citing Hunter’s emails.

In December 2013, then-Vice President Biden traveled to Beijing due to a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Hunter expressed interest in joining his father on the trip and ended up going, where he admitted to the New Yorker that he introduced his father to his Chinese business partner, Jonathan Li, who ran the Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital. According to the report, Hunter arranged for a brief handshake in the lobby of the hotel where the U.S. delegation was staying and then Hunter met up with Li privately.

In June 2014, Hunter reportedly arranged for another business associate of his to meet with his father. The New York Post reported that two years earlier Hunter introduced Manuel Estrella, a Latin American business partner, to Cooper as a ""a good friend of mine"" and ""the perfect partner as you explore bringing online gaming to the Dominican Republic."" The report then mentioned that Hunter received an email in June 2014 from Estrella saying, ""Hunter, I just met your father! So exiting! Francis Person helped me! Thanks! Hope to see you soon!""

In addition to Hunter’s foreign business associates, Joe met with several of his son’s U.S.-based partners as well, including Schwerin, who made at least 27 visits to the White House during Joe’s vice presidency, Fox News Digital reported.

HUNTER BIDEN’S FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS: 4 COUNTRIES WITH FINANCIAL LINKS TO PRESIDENT’S SON

One of Schwerin's visits – on Nov.17, 2010 – was a sit-down with Joe in the West Wing and multiple other meetings included those with Joe and Jill Biden aides. On May 14, 2016, Joe attended a dinner party hosted by Schwerin at an Italian restaurant in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C

Hunter's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, recently released her memoir and noted that Schwerin ""managed almost every aspect of our financial life,"" including Joe Biden.

The vice president also met with Cooper at least once more after their meeting with Hunter, Slim, Velasco and Magnani in November 2015. According to a text message from Joe to his son on June 15, 2018, the vice president said he was currently ""with"" Cooper and that he ""wants to do some work with you,"" according to Miranda Devine’s book ""Laptop From Hell.""

Another business associate of Hunter that Biden met with was Francis Person, a top former adviser to Biden when he was a senator and the vice president. After leaving the White House in 2014, he became the president of the Harves Group. According to Person's Linkedin, which was recently deleted within the last couple weeks, he ""[h]elped guide the formation of the Harves Group headquartered in Washington DC, serving as the U.S. affiliate of Harves [Century Group],"" a ""top tier private chinese real estate development firm,"" according to an email Person sent to Hunter in July 2015.

In 2016, when Person was running Harves and emailing with Hunter and Schwerin regarding business deals, he was also running for Congress in South Carolina's 5th Congressional District. In September of that year, then-Vice President Biden traveled down to South Carolina for a fundraiser for Person. In addition to the visit, Hunter and Schwerin were recruiting their business associates behind the scenes to donate thousands of dollars to the campaign, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital. A 2014 Politico profile piece on Person quotes then-Second Lady Jill Biden saying, ""Fran has been like a son to Joe and me. For eight years, we traveled the country, shared holidays together … Fran may be leaving the office, but he will always be a part of our family.""

Fox News Digital reported in April that Person visited the Obama-Biden White House at least seven times between 2015 and 2016 after he left the White House to work for Harves, which does a lot of business in China. One of the visits was with Steve Ricchetti, who was Biden’s chief of staff from 2013 until 2017 and is currently Biden's White House counselor.

FOX Business previously reported that Hunter's private equity firm, Rosemont Seneca Advisors, held financial interests in multiple Harves affiliates, including a 5 percent stake with Harves Amusement Parks and ownership in Harves Sports and Entertainment, both of which fall under the Washington, D.C.-based Harves Group.

HUNTER BIDEN BUSINESS PARTNER MADE 8 ADDITIONAL WHITE HOUSE VISITS IN 2016, VISITOR LOGS SHOW



Devon Archer, Hunter’s former Burisma business partner who was sentenced to federal prison in February for his role in a scheme to defraud a Native American tribe, also visited with Joe in the West Wing of the White House on April 16, 2014, according to the visitor logs. Archer and Hunter joined Burisma’s board that same month.

Four months after the meeting with Archer, Archer was photographed golfing with Joe and Hunter in the Hamptons.

Another former business partner of Hunter’s, former Rosemont Seneca partner Chris Heinz, the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, met with Joe in the West Wing on April 11, 2011, according to the visitor logs.

Tony Bobulinski, the former CEO of SinoHawk Holdings, a Jim and Hunter Biden joint venture with a Chinese energy firm, also apparently met with Joe in May 2017. Text messages obtained by Fox News Digital indicated that a meeting took place, though it's unclear what the substance of the meeting may have been.

""Great to meet u and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony b,"" Bobulinski wrote in a text to Jim Biden, Joe brother, on May 2, 2017.

""I've seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business,"" Bobulinski told Fox News Digital in October 2020. ""I've seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn't just Hunter's business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""

Despite meeting with at least fourteen of Hunter’s business partners, Joe has repeatedly denied discussing any business ventures with his son, who is under federal investigation.

The investigation into Hunter’s tax affairs, which began in 2018, has reached a ""critical stage,"" a source previously told Fox News Digital. Officials are looking into whether to charge the first son with various tax violations and possible foreign lobbying violations.

A separate source told Fox News Digital that the federal grand jury looking into Hunter’s business dealings wrapped up its latest term late last month but said no charges have been filed. Hunter has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

The White House and Hunter Biden's attorney did not respond to Fox News Digital requests for comment.

Jordan questions Biden's hiring of Pete Buttigieg amid East Palestine fallout: 'no transportation experience',"Why did President Joe Biden ever choose Pete Buttigieg to lead the Department of Transportation? That’s exactly what Rep. Jim Jordan took to Twitter to ask on Friday as Buttigieg continues to face criticism for his handling — or lack of — a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

The Norfolk Southern derailment, which took place on Feb. 3, has prompted health and environmental concerns as many of the 38 involved cars spilled toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, isobutylene, and other harmful chemicals, into the nearby area.

Jordan, R-Ohio, suggested in a tweet that Buttigieg’s hiring ""wasn’t a good idea"" as he has ""no transportation experience.""

""Maybe hiring a guy with no transportation experience to be the Secretary of Transportation wasn’t a good idea?"" Jordan asked.

BUTTIGIEG DODGES QUESTIONS WHILE HIS PRESS SECRETARY REFUSES TO BE ON CAMERA IN EAST PALESTINE

Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, ran against Biden during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He dropped from the race, endorsed Biden, and was later chosen to join Biden’s administration.

He is also a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer.

""Secretary Pete’s response to East Palestine has been a total disaster,"" Jordan added in another tweet.

""But don’t worry, it was a ‘lesson learned,’"" the Republican continued, citing Buttigieg’s own comment during an interview with CBS News. ""Can you imagine the media’s reaction if a Republican tried that bogus excuse?""

Buttigieg visited Ohio on Thursday, nearly three weeks after the East Palestine train derailment, and was also mocked for appearing to wear dress shoes while surveying the affected areas. Other officials wore heavy work boots as they trolled the muddy site of the catastrophic train derailment.

Ohio Senate GOP spokesperson Tom Evans wrote on Twitter, ""Not shocked at all by Mayor Pete wearing dress shoes to East Palestine.""

In another tweet, Jordan said: ""The people of East Palestine have shown us once again that D.C. elites don’t get Real America.""

BUTTIGIEG MOCKED FOR APPEARING TO WEAR DRESS BOOTS WHILE ON THE GROUND IN EAST PALESTINE, OHIO

Buttigieg spoke during a news conference during his trip but did not answer the media, instead sending his press secretary, Kerry Arndt, to respond to reporters’ inquiries.

A Department of Transportation spokesperson told FOX News Digital after the incident that ""the secretary was wearing boots.""

""We do not have a record of what brand they are,"" the spokesperson added.

Buttigieg put out a three-pronged plan to increase rail safety and accountability and made several public comments before his visit.

BUTTIGIEG BLAMES TRUMP, RUBIO AMIDST EAST PALESTINE DERAILMENT BACKLASH: 'NOW THAT IT'S CAMPAIGN SEASON'

Buttigieg has been subject to almost constant criticism from Republican lawmakers and others as he struggled to clear the supply chain crisis that saw shipping prices skyrocket under the COVID pandemic, provide clear answers for flight disruptions and Federal Aviation Administration system outages, or promptly address the train derailment in Ohio and others across the country.

Amid the backlash, Buttigieg has defended his response and has blamed former President Donald Trump and Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

""You know, the sort of theatrics of Donald Trump being in Palestine were odd, but this is a community that voted overwhelmingly for him. The county that Palestine is in voted 71/29 for Donald Trump. I want you to reflect on the irony. In 2016, it was 68/26. This is a Trump county. What do you make of the fact he went there despite the fact the regulations he rolled back were partly responsible for this tragedy?"" MSNBC’s Joy Reid asked Buttigieg during a segment Thursday.

Buttigieg responded, ""It was definitely an ironic thing to do.""

""You take down regulations, you water down regulations, you weaken the power of the administration to deal with freight railroad companies, and then you show up wanting to be a great friend of the people who have been impacted by a rail disaster,"" he added.

The Biden official continued, ""You know, this is somebody who as far as I know never went to a derailment site when one of those happens on his watch. And there were thousands. Even ones with fatalities. Never even sent his Transportation Secretary to go. Now that it’s campaign season, I guess things are different. We were there to work. We were there to get things done.""

Rubio and other lawmakers have called for Buttigieg to resign.

"Matt Rosendale is furious with Biden's handling of border, Chinese balloon: 'Violation of the Constitution'","Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., President Joe Biden's handling of the crisis at the southern border, the Russia-Ukraine war, and believes the administration's decision to not immediately shoot down the Chinese spy balloon is ""problematic"" to our national security.

Rosendale told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview this week that he believes Biden should be impeached, as his administration keeps saying the southern border is secure when thousands of migrants continue to walk through each month.

""I was talking before Biden was even sworn into office that we were going to have a crisis on the southern border. I knew that he was going to ignore the policies that the Trump administration had put in place. And sure enough, when he put Alejandro Mayorkas in charge of Homeland Security, he kept telling us that he has a plan, he has a plan. Just wait for his plan to work out. And what we have recognize is that he does have a plan — it's to allow as many illegal immigrants to cross over into our country as possible while Biden is still president,"" Rosendale said during an interview.

""That is a violation of the Constitution, it's a violation of my caucus's oath of office. And I, quite frankly, would like to see the man impeached,"" he said.

US LEADS THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH $196 BILLION GIVEN TO UKRAINE AMID WAR WITH RUSSIA

After Biden took a surprise trip to Kyiv, Ukraine on Monday to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offer the country half a billion more dollars in aid, Rosendale said he was ""stunned.""

""I was actually caught off guard. I was stunned by the fact that he was there. And then while he was there to promise another $500 million before we've had any conversations with Congress, it's quite disappointing, quite frankly. We haven't even had an accounting of the first, it looks like $100 billion that has been sent there. And I have people all over the state of Montana that would like to see what is going on with the money and Ukraine, because we could spend about $10 billion and build a secure southern border for ourselves,"" he said.

CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT CALLS US RESPONSE TO BALLOON INCIDENT ‘HYSTERICAL’

The border crisis, however, is top of mind for Rosendale even as other aspects of Biden's administration bother him.

""This is all happening on the same day that now we're getting reports that the northern border has many more problems than anyone had realized. And the illegal crossings up there are up to about 100,000 a year, up from about 2,000 a year. So while it pales in comparison to what's happening on the southern border, it still is an indicator that we have a major problem,"" he said.

A Chinese spy balloon entered America airspace in the beginning of February, hovering over Montana for several hours and eventually traveling across nearly the entire continental U.S. Despite calls to shoot down the aircraft while it flew over open fields in Montana, the Biden administration waited several days until it passed off the coast of South Carolina, where U.S. fighter jets shot it down.

Rosendale said he ""can't fathom"" why they did not immediately shoot down the balloon.

""That is a big problem. The Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, is probing us to see what we're going to do, both militarily and economically. They want to be the world's power. And that balloon was spotted off the Aleutian Islands. I do not know why it wasn't taken down at that point,"" Rosendale said of the balloon that hovered over his state.

""It was allowed to drift over Alaska, Canada. And then as you know, it spent several days hovering over Malmstrom Air Force Base and very sensitive defensive systems, about 140 ICBM that were responsible for defending our nation and why it wasn't taken down at that point, I just don't know. I can't fathom it and to allow it to continue to collect data as it traveled across our country is problematic. It's not any one bit of information that the Chinese spy balloon picked up. It is an accumulative process of picking up information about our civilian infrastructure, our military infrastructure, our cellular data and what's going on. And it is all a very, very big problem,"" he stated.

"President Biden makes surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, meets with President Zelenskyy","President Biden arrived in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv early Monday morning in a surprise visit just ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the country.

Biden delivered remarks and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mariinsky Palace to announce an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance. The new assistance includes shells for howitzers, anti-tank missiles, air surveillance radars and other aid but no new advanced weaponry.

The trip is the first time Biden has traveled to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion one year ago.

Biden was expected to visit Poland on Monday to mark the one-year anniversary since the war began but instead embarked on a nearly 10-hour train ride from the Polish border to visit Ukraine's capital.

Biden said he visited Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy and ""reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.""

He noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""dead wrong"" in believing Ukraine was weak when he launched his invasion a year ago.

""I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia’s war machine.""

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" he continued.

Biden also said he is looking forward to meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda and the leaders of our Eastern Flank Allies as the U.S. looks to continue rallying the world to support Ukraine. He departed the Ukrainian capital in the early afternoon local time after spending roughly five hours in the city.

Sirens could be heard in war-torn Ukraine as Biden arrived in the country. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also announced $5.5 billion in aid for Ukraine as Biden visited with Zelenskyy.

Biden's visit comes just before Russia is expected to ramp up its offensive once again in its own acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Ukrainian officials warned of a massive barrage of missiles that Russia may launch on Friday, Feb. 24.

Biden to regulate travel from China after previously calling Trump xenophobic,"The White House announced Wednesday it will require travelers from China to test negative for COVID-19 prior to arrival in the U.S. — a policy that will come less than three years after candidate Joe Biden suggested then-President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from China were xenophobic.

A federal official said the test requirement will begin Jan. 5 and is necessary due to the lack of public data on China's effectiveness in monitoring COVID-19. Travelers from China, regardless of nationality, will need to show a negative test taken no more than two days prior to their flight. Japan and India have established similar restrictions as China has loosened its ""zero-Covid"" lockdown policies in recent weeks — and China requires travelers from the U.S. to test negative.

Trump in January 2020 announced a plan to restrict travel from China in response to the initial COVID-19 virus spread. Hours after the announcement, Biden, on the campaign trail in Iowa, said, ""This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysterical xenophobia and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science."" He used the same wording in a tweet the next day.

""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering,"" Biden tweeted.

Trump restricted travel from Europe in March 2020, to which Biden tweeted in response with a declaration that ""a wall will not stop the coronavirus."" In the following weeks, however, the Biden campaign shifted its public position on travel restrictions.

Biden’s team, weeks after the Europe restrictions, claimed his comments on Trump’s xenophobia were not about travel policies.

""This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,"" a campaign spokesman told The Washington Post at the time. ""Travel restrictions, when supported by science, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy can be warranted. Travel restrictions can buy time; but here, the time they bought for preparation was squandered when Trump used it to downplay, rather than ready the country for, the disease.""

Republicans accuse Hunter Biden art dealer of stonewalling GOP probe: 'a lot of very suspicious money',"FIRST ON FOX: House Oversight Committee Republicans accused Hunter Biden’s art dealer of stonewalling their investigation into the first son’s anonymous art buyers.

Several House Oversight Republicans sounded off after Georges Berges , Biden’s art dealer, told committee chairman James Comer, R-Ky., he would not produce the records of the anonymous buyers of the first son’s high-priced paintings.

""In light of these considerations, providing the documents and information requested in your letter seemingly would defeat the efforts of Mr. Biden and the White House to avoid the ‘serious ethical concerns’ that you raise,"" Berges’ attorney William Pittard told the House Oversight chairman.

""Mr. Berges hopes that you and Mr. Biden can resolve that tension,"" he added .

A House Oversight Committee spokesperson told Fox News Digital the committee has ""received the letter from Mr. Bergès’ attorney and have reviewed his objections to producing documents or sitting for questioning about who is buying Hunter Biden’s artwork.""

""We find the objections unconvincing and incoherent,"" the spokesperson said. ""Mr. Bergès should abandon these delay tactics and produce the documents and information.""

Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., who sits on the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Digital that Biden’s artwork isn’t good enough to adorn the walls of ""a foreclosed motel.""

""Hunter Biden’s artwork isn’t worthy of hanging on the walls of a foreclosed motel, so why would anyone buy it?"" McClain said. ""The answer is simple, to curry favor with the corrupt son of the President.""

""We need to know who purchased Hunter’s so-called ‘art’, and Georges Berges refusing to provide that information to Congress only adds fuel to the fire for our investigation,"" she continued.

Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert sounded off with her House Oversight Committee colleague, telling Fox News Digital that all ""Hunter’s attorney is doing is delaying the inevitable.""

""We will receive this evidence, one way or another,"" Boebert said.

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., another member of the House Oversight Committee, told FOX News Digital that nobody ""cares specifically about Hunter.""

""We’re investigating the Biden crime-family operations. They’ve moved a lot of very suspicious money,"" Higgins said. ""‘Selling’ Hunter Biden art is just a method they’ve employed.""

""We’ll have every ‘art buyer’ identified and every dollar tracked by the end of this summer,"" the reserve law enforcement officer said. ""We’re cracking open the whole Biden crime-family.""

Republicans demand answers from Biden officials on report China opened police arm in NYC,"FIRST ON FOX: Several Republican House lawmakers sent a letter to Biden Cabinet Secretaries Antony Blinken and Merrick Garland demanding answers on a reported Chinese police presence in New York City.

Republican Study Committee chairman Jim Banks of Indiana alongside Reps. Michael Waltz of Florida and Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin led the letter to Garland and Blinken demanding answers on why China’s Fuzhou police were reportedly able to open a U.S.-based police arm.

""The Department of Justice and State Department must explain why the Biden administration has allowed CCP police to set up an office on U.S. soil,"" Banks told Fox News Digital in a statement.

CHINA HAS OPENED OVERSEAS POLICE STATIONS IN US AND CANADA TO MONITOR CHINESE CITIZENS: REPORT

""When Republicans take back the House, we will hold the Biden administration accountable for their continued efforts to aid and abet the Chinese Communist Party,"" he added.

Waltz told Fox News Digital it is ""mind-boggling that we are allowing China’s Fuzhou police to operate on American soil.""

""The Chinese Communist Party uses these stations to go after political dissidents abroad, while also endangering the national security of the United States,"" Waltz said in a statement. ""We must protect the American people and Chinese freedom activists from the CCP’s gross abuse of the American justice system,"" he added.

Gallagher warned in a statement that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ""has used Fuzhou overseas police service stations to push propaganda and spy on Chinese citizens abroad.""

""The presence of one of these stations in New York City not only raises serious human rights concerns, but also raises concerns about whether the United States is allowing a hostile foreign adversary to conduct its own law enforcement activities within our borders,"" the Wisconsin Republican continued.

""The State Department must divulge the extent of their knowledge of this station, it’s actions against American-Chinese citizens and communities, and the threat it may pose to our national security,"" he added.

In the letter exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the lawmakers wrote of their ""grave concern over reports of the law enforcement presence"" from China in New York City, noting the ""Public Security (Police) Bureau of Fuzhou, China, announced in January 2022 that it has opened the ‘first batch’ of 30 overseas police service stations in 25 cities in 21 countries,"" with the U.S. branch hosted at the American ChangLe Association, a Chinese overseas hometown association founded in 1998 that ""shoulders the mission of uniting the villagers, fighting for their legitimate rights and interests, promoting the prosperity and stability of the overseas Chinese settlements, and acting as a bridge for the villagers to get rich through hard work,"" according to its website.

""According to a recent report by Safeguard Defenders , a human rights NGO based in Spain, overseas Chinese hometown associations have become overwhelmingly co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front organizations which seek increasing control over the Chinese diaspora (despite providing some genuine services to local Chinese communities),"" the lawmakers wrote.

""The report indicates that at least some of those Chinese hometown associations hosting the overseas police service stations are linked to the CCP’s United Front,"" they continued. ""It is deeply troubling that the Chinese government could use these service stations as its long arm policing abroad.""

The Republicans pointed to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2018 report detailing how the ""CCP’s United Front Work Department has worked to suppress the free speech rights of U.S. persons protesting against"" them.

They also warned about Beijing’s coercion and bullying activities to push the CCP’s narrative that sometimes verges into illegal actions.

""According to Peter Mattis, a research fellow at Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, CCP intimidation and efforts to promote Beijing’s narrative ‘sometimes crosses the line into criminal actions, such as conspiracy against rights,’"" the Republicans wrote.

""The U.S. Department of State has similarly found that the CCP’s United Front Work Department funds and supports overseas organizations to spread propaganda and coerces and bullies those who would oppose Beijing’s policies. In 2018, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and individuals active in United Front Work Department’s nefarious activities.""

Banks and his fellow Republicans warned that ""Fuzhou overseas police service stations (including their online form) are reportedly involved in fulfilling Chinese law enforcement functions at least in some countries"" and ""coerce purported Chinese fugitives abroad to return to China to face legal proceedings, which is euphemistically dubbed as ‘persuading to return’ in Chinese parlance.""

""There should be no room for the Chinese government to exercise extraterritorial law enforcement unilaterally on U.S. soil,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""In 2018 the U.S. government provided the Chinese government with specific requirements for contacting state and local law enforcement in the United States.""

""In 2020 the Chinese government’s campaign illegally targeting U.S. residents to force their return to China had become so severe that the FBI issued an internal memorandum on this issue. The Chinese overseas police service station established in New York City earlier this year appears to be a further step of China’s illicit long arm policing on U.S. soil that violates our sovereignty.""

The Republicans concluded their letter with several questions to Austin and Blinken, including whether ""the Department of State, Department of Justice, or any other agency of the federal government invite or approve China’s Fuzhou police to establish a presence in New York City.""

Joining Banks, Waltz and Gallagher on the letter are 18 of their fellow House Republicans, including Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Greg Murphy of North Carolina, and Clay Higgins of Louisiana.

China’s police presence in New York City is a symptom of the overall larger issue of the CCP’s growing influence abroad.

Republicans unveil effort to remove Biden admin's barriers blocking oil and gas drilling,"FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans introduced legislation Wednesday that they said would remove barriers slowing down oil and gas permitting on federal lands and, as a result, lead to lower gasoline prices for Americans.

The American Energy Act — which was introduced by Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and cosponsored by 12 fellow Republicans — is designed to give energy companies increased certainty in the federal permitting process for oil and gas drilling in an effort to boost production and lower energy prices. Boebert said her bill would counter efforts from the Biden administration to introduce red tape and stifle production.

""The Biden administration is colluding with Green New Deal extremists to slow down energy leasing, clog up the bureaucratic pipeline, and threaten American energy producers with frivolous lawsuits,"" Boebert said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""My American Energy Act cuts red tape to unleash American energy by extending the term of APDs from two years to four years to reduce unnecessary paperwork, ensuring agencies process permits under a valid existing lease regardless of any unrelated civil action, and by prohibiting activist judges from unilaterally vacating valid energy leases.""

FOSSIL FUEL PROFITS ARE VITAL FOR GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS DEMS ROUTINELY TOUT

The legislation mainly focuses on ensuring that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an Interior Department subagency tasked with managing federal lands, approves applications for permits to drill (APD) in a timely fashion. Oil and gas companies are required to file an APD once they identify a deposit on a lease that can be tapped for resources.

The Biden administration has been accused of purposely delaying APDs in an effort to prevent fossil fuel extraction. According to BLM data, there were 4,896 pending APDs on federal lands and another 179 on Indian property as of Jan. 31.

GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE

And, according to Boebert's office, permitting times have increased from an average of 94 days in June 2019 to 182 days under the Biden administration last year. During fiscal year 2022, the BLM an average of 233 drilling permits per month while it approved 400 drilling permits per month in fiscal year 2020.

""In short, H.R. 1067 will help reduce gas prices by providing certainty for responsible energy production and preventing baseless litigation,"" Boebert continued. ""With the price at the pump skyrocketing and the international energy market destabilizing, the world needs American energy now more than ever.""

While gasoline prices have fallen from their all-time high of more than $5 per gallon in June, they remain about 45% higher than when President Biden took office in January 2021.

Oil production on federal lands, meanwhile, fell to 12.28 million barrels per day in November, the latest month with data. Production peaked at 13 million barrels a day under the Trump administration.

""For over two years, the Biden administration has slow-walked oil and gas permits, ultimately driving up energy costs for the American people,"" said Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands. ""It doesn’t have to be this way, and I thank Congresswoman Boebert for leading legislation to speed up the permitting process from frivolous lawsuits.""

JOHN KERRY FRUSTRATED OIL COMPANIES AREN'T INTERESTED IN COSTLY RENEWABLE BUSINESS

The American Energy Act also increases the maximum length companies can drill under an APD from two years to four years. In addition, it requires courts to remand lease sale environmental reviews back to agencies to remedy problems when necessary, blocking federal judges from vacating entire lease sales.

Drilling permits are often held up in court as a result of litigation from environmental groups. The Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that represents 200 producers that operate in more than 10 western states, is currently defending thousands of leases in federal court.

""Western Energy Alliance strongly supports Rep. Boebert’s bill to add certainty to the federal oil and natural gas permitting process,"" Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma said in a statement. ""The West Slope of Colorado is held back economically because of uncertainty on federal lands, which make up the majority of production in her district.""

""The Biden Administration has been increasing that uncertainty by threatening to cancel permits after only two years,"" she continued. ""In addition, environmental groups litigate any leases sold in an attempt to convince judges to cancel them on the basis of incomplete NEPA.""

Heritage Action, Americans for Limited Government, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, New Mexico Business Coalition and OQ Resources also endorsed the legislation Wednesday.

"Republicans urge Biden to take cognitive test, say his 'mental decline' has 'become more apparent'","FIRST ON FOX: Nearly 40 Republican lawmakers are calling on President Biden , 79, to take a cognitive test, following the example set by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.

The Republican push for Biden to undergo cognitive testing comes as recent polls have shown Americans are unsure of the president's mental fitness for office.

Former physician to the president Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, led a letter with 37 of his GOP colleagues to Biden on Tuesday expressing their ""concern"" with Biden’s ""current cognitive state.""

""My colleagues and I are again asking President Biden to immediately undergo a formal cognitive screening exam, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA),"" Jackson told Fox News Digital in an email.

BIDEN SAYS HE HAS ‘NO IDEA’ WHY MANY AMERICANS DOUBT HIS MENTAL FITNESS

""As a former physician to three Presidents of the United States, I know what it takes mentally and physically to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,"" Jackson continued. ""Joe Biden has continually proven to me and to the world that something isn’t right. The American people deserve to have absolute confidence in their President’s cognitive ability.""

Jackson said Biden’s taking ""the cognitive test will be an important first step"" in reassuring Americans that the president is fit for office or ""in identifying and properly treating symptoms of impairment that are consistent with a variety of cognitive diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, Parkinson’s, or multiple sclerosis.""

""This is not a partisan issue. When I discussed taking a cognitive test with President Trump, he was eager to assure the American people and to put the fake news media’s stories to bed,"" the former presidential doctor wrote. ""Why won’t President Biden do the same?""

""We can only assume the worst if he doesn’t submit to the same standard that his own party demanded of the last Administration,"" he added. ""The precedent has been set.""

In the letter, the lawmakers wrote that they ""believe that, regardless of gender, age, or political party, all Presidents should follow the example set by former President Trump to document and demonstrate sound mental abilities.""

""While you underwent your annual physical exam on November 19, 2021, you either did not face a cognitive test or those results were withheld from the public,"" they continued, adding that while the current physician to the president cleared Biden physically, the lawmakers ""are worried about your mental abilities.""

""The Alzheimer’s Association lists ‘changes in mood and personality,’ including being more ‘easily upset’ as one of ten signs of mental decline,"" they wrote. ""You displayed this type of mood change during a cabinet meeting on January 24, 2022, when you apparently did not know your microphone was on after finishing your opening remarks, and you called a White House reporter a ‘stupid son of a b----’ in response to a question he asked on inflation.""

The lawmakers also pointed to Biden’s stumbling when trying to say how many Americans have received the COVID-19 booster shot and wrote that the slip-ups are ""not just a recent trend,"" saying the president’s ""mental decline and forgetfulness have become more apparent over the past two years.""

"Rubio puts hold on Biden nominee Eric Garcetti, citing sexual harassment scandal","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Friday announced he would place a hold on President Biden’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to India, former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, because Garcetti ""has ignored credible sexual assault accusations in his prior office"" and called the nomination ""absurd.""

""I will not turn a blind eye to these absurd nominations, which will hasten America's decline,"" Rubio said in a statement announcing holds on Garcetti and six other Biden nominees.

Rubio’s action is the latest speed bump to Garcetti’s nomination, which languished for months in the last Congress and eventually expired. Garcetti was renominated for the position again this year, despite a bombshell investigation report by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in which he concluded that Garcetti ""likely knew or should have known"" that his top adviser, Rick Jacobs, was allegedly sexually harassing city employees and made racist comments.

When a hold is placed on a nominee by a senator, it means the nominee cannot be approved quickly by unanimous consent, which delays the confirmation process.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS NOT A DETERRENT TO WH NOMINATION OF FORMER LA MAYOR GARCETTI

Jacobs is accused of sexual harassment in the form of inappropriate comments, unwanted kissing and touching and sexual advances against a male LAPD officer assigned to Garcetti’s security detail, as well as a male reporter, the fiancé of an office communications director and other whistleblowers. Grassley's report also describes how Jacobs made racist remarks at the office toward his Chinese assistant and Black and Indian employees.

""Investigators believe this allegation is credible because it fits the pattern of behavior described by several other senior staff members in Mayor Garcetti’s office, and because of its similarity to allegations"" in the lawsuit, Grassley’s report found.

LA MAYOR GARCETTI 'LIKELY KNEW' OF 'WIDESPREAD' SEXUAL HARASSMENT, RACIST REMARKS BY EX-ADVISER: SENATE REPORT

At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in December 2021, Garcetti told lawmakers considering his nomination that he never witnessed Jacobs sexually harass his police bodyguards, the allegations that are at the center of a lawsuit filed against his administration.

The lawsuit alleges Garcetti often witnessed the behavior and laughed it off.

The White House called Grassley’s report a partisan ""hit job,"" and has been unwavering in its support of the nomination. A White House official told Fox News Digital that Garcetti ""is well qualified to serve in this vital role. He was voted out of committee with strong bipartisan support and we’re hopeful that the full Senate will confirm him promptly.""

"Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson considers Biden challenge, says DNC is 'spitting in the face of democracy'","Former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson is reportedly considering challenging President Biden for the White House in 2024.

The spiritual self-help author is expected to make an announcement about her political future this weekend in New Hampshire, and, should she enter the race, will be the first declared Democratic candidate considering Biden has not yet officially announced he will run for re-election.

""Apparently Biden's going to run on a message that the economy is getting stronger. I think that speaks to the disconnect between the analysis of party elites versus the struggle of everyday Americans,"" Williamson told Politico this week about what was factoring into her decision-making process.

GROWING SIGNS THAT BIDEN COULD FACE A 2024 NOMINATION CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY EARLY PRIMARY STATE

""We're being asked to limit our political imaginations — to just accept the low unemployment and low inflation rate, that that is sort of the best that we can get,"" she added. ""But that is a hollow victory. The majority of Americans are still struggling to survive.""

Williamson ran for the White House in the 2020 Democratic primaries before ultimately dropping out in January ahead of the Iowa Caucuses and endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

She faced accusations of being an anti-vaxxer during her last run, but has sharply denied she is anti-science. She brought up the accusations when asked by Politico what the media got wrong about her as a candidate the last cycle.

""I’m certainly not anti-science. I'm not anti-vax. I'm not the crystal lady. I didn’t tell people they got sick because they didn’t pray enough. Basically, I’m not stupid,"" she told Politico.

The Democratic National Committee has shaken up its presidential nominating calendar to move New Hampshire, which has long held the first primary of the presidential nominating cycle, into third place. The move has upset many in New Hampshire and has led to speculation that Biden could face a primary challenger in that state.

""How can the Democratic Party present itself as a champion of democracy and do something as undemocratic as overtly engineering the primary schedule to make sure that their chosen candidate would win it?"" Williamson told Politico. ""That is spitting in the face of democracy.""

Supreme Court to hear GOP state challenge to pandemic-related Biden student loan debt relief plan,"President Biden was emphatic last September when declaring ""the pandemic is over,"" signaling his administration was prepared in coming months to pivot the nation from a public health crisis and phase out a range of emergency measures.

But executive officials want to keep one key COVID-19 response effort in place indefinitely: the student loan relief program that would cancel hundreds of billions of dollars in borrower debt. Now the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to intervene and will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a pair of expedited legal challenges.

A coalition of six GOP-led states — Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina — wants to block the federal debt forgiveness plan, calling it an executive branch overreach absent any clear congressional mandate. They are supported by 17 other states, more than 170 Republican members of Congress and a range of conservative advocacy groups.

But the Biden administration, with the backing of 21 Democrat-led states and the District of Columbia, says the upcoming end of emergency declarations does not change what it calls the ""legal justification"" for extending the student loan plan, arguing, without it, the financial pain for millions will extend far beyond COVID's demise.

GOP SENATORS PUSH BILL TO BLOCK BIDEN'S 'RECKLESS' STUDENT LOAN BAILOUT, PREVENT TAXPAYERS FROM COVERING COSTS

""From the perspective of most Americans, we're obviously nowhere near the place we were several years ago when this whole pandemic started,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Bush Justice Department official. ""And so the Supreme Court may say, 'Wait a minute. Even if that was a legitimate justification, does it really bear weight in the year 2023 when, by virtually everyone's assessment, the pandemic is over?' Has the Biden administration overstepped its bounds in authorizing this massive debt forgiveness program in a way that Congress never authorized?""

Payments and the pandemic

Biden this month announced he would stop classifying COVID as a national emergency May 11. These federal declarations have been in place since early 2020 in the Trump administration, waiving, pausing or modifying a range of areas, including Medicaid, Medicare, private health insurance, vaccines, telework and immigration.

And, like his predecessor, the current president relied on the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act), a law passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, that allows the federal government to make changes to student loan programs in response to national emergencies.

The program, if allowed to be fully implemented, could benefit about 40 million Americans, offering up to $20,000 of debt relief to qualified at-risk federal Pell Grant borrowers, and $10,000 for non-Pell Grant recipients. The Education Department has already announced a ""payment pause"" until mid-2023.

BIDEN MOVES FORWARD WITH 'STUDENT LOAN SAFETY NET' AS DEBT CANCELLATION PLAN AWAITS FATE BEFORE SUPREME COURT

Nearly $441 billion in outstanding student loans are eligible for forgiveness under the plan, and it is expected to wipe out balances for almost 40% of federal student loan borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

But new applications for relief were halted in November as the policy's future was held up in court.

The justices will hear two separate appeals, each with contrasting legal positions. The state parties cite policy objections and say they would be unfairly burdened by the Biden plan.

And two individual borrowers seek broader debt relief after claiming they were unfairly excluded from the full scope of government benefits because their debt is commercially or personally held.

The arguments

States opposing the plan say students struggling with paying off college loans predated the pandemic and that the administration is using the waning health crisis as a pretext power grab to bypass Congress and score political points.

STATES CHALLENGE BIDEN'S $400B STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT AT SUPREME COURT, CALLING IT 'UNLAWFUL'

When announcing the program last August, Biden said, ""When I campaigned for President [in 2020], I made a commitment that we’d provide student debt relief. And I’m honoring that commitment today.""

Officials call it part of a broader strategy to implement an affordable, income-driven repayment system.

""The Biden-Harris administration is proposing historic changes that would make student loan repayment more affordable and manageable than ever before,"" said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. ""We cannot return to the same broken system we had before the pandemic, when a million borrowers defaulted on their loans a year and snowballing interest left millions owing more than they initially borrowed.""

In a legal brief filed with the high court, state plaintiffs argued, ""Canceling hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans — through a decree that extends to nearly all borrowers — is a breathtaking assertion of power and a matter of great economic and political significance.""

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S STUDENT DEBT RELIEF IS 'COMFORTABLY WITHIN' LAW, DOJ ARGUES TO SCOTUS

The group representing the individual borrowers separately says giving the administration's open-ended authority to impose debt relief will only hurt a long-term solution through bipartisan legislative efforts.

""It’s true that students are drowning in debt and that this has become a crisis, but Biden’s bailout does nothing to actually solve it,"" said Elaine Parker, president of the Job Creators Network Foundation (JCNF). ""Colleges and universities, which keep raising tuitions while sitting on a $700 billion mountain of endowments, should own up to their own role in this crisis and work with lawmakers to devise a solution that does not leave taxpayers on the hook.""

But the Biden administration told the high court its debt relief efforts ""fall comfortably within the plain text of the [HEROES Act]"" and was a reasonable, targeted solution to confront the risk of default, based on lingering financial hardship caused by an unexpected public health crisis.

The GOP-led states cannot ""second-guess the [Education] Secretary’s considered evaluation of the evidence or his predictive judgment about the type and degree of relief required to ensure that borrowers are not placed in a worse financial position because of the pandemic,"" the Justice Department wrote.

WHITE HOUSE EXTENDS STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT PAUSE THROUGH JUNE 2023 DESPITE BIDEN PLEDGE

How the court may rule

The first hurdle for the Republican states will be standing, or justification to prove actual harm by the challenged policies. The states argue they will lose tax revenue as a result of the plan, in part from lost profits by companies servicing federal student loans.

One lower court rejected that claim, and the federal government said the states' positions are ""convoluted"" and ""assert standing based on injuries that are highly speculative, that they have inflicted upon themselves.""

Assuming the state and private plaintiffs can overcome that procedural barrier, the key questions could come down to how much discretion the executive branch enjoys to enact unilateral emergency policies in the guise of public health, when that authority ceases and who decides.

Expect opponents of the debt relief plan to use Biden's own words about the pandemic being ""over"" and his steps to make it formal this spring as a clear sign he can no longer link the two.

BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT WILL 'GO DOWN IN FLAMES' IF CASE REACHES SUPREME COURT, EXPERTS SAY

Two federal appeals courts have allowed the lawsuits to move through, and the high court's current 6-3 majority has been recently receptive to state challenges over a range of federal policies, including the environment and immigration.

The day after arguments in the student debt relief cases, the Supreme Court was scheduled to address another COVID-related administration policy: Title 42, restricting asylum requests for migrants at the border in the name of public health.

Here, the arguments on justifying a national emergency policy flip. The Biden administration wants to end the Trump-era immigration policy by saying it is no longer needed to stop the spread of the disease. But GOP-led states are suing to keep it in place, arguing in part that a companion national emergency exists — the worsening border crisis.

The Supreme Court last week canceled those arguments after the Justice Department said the May 11 end of COVID-driven federal restrictions would make the border dispute essentially moot. It is unclear whether the issue will be revisited anytime soon, or whether planned immigration changes would survive legal scrutiny.

Biden's new border asylum reform strategy unveiled Tuesday was slammed by members of his own party, with House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., saying he was ""deeply disappointed.""

STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT: NEW LAWSUIT SAYS BIDEN DIDN'T FOLLOW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

The irony in these high-profile policy debates and the arguments both sides have used to confront the future of both immigration and student loans will likely not be lost on the U.S. Supreme Court. How the nine justices choose to tackle the competing interests will be another test of balancing government power — state versus federal and executive versus legislative.

""The existence of the pandemic authorized the federal government to do certain things that it couldn't do in ordinary times — some things the Biden administration liked, some things the Trump administration liked,"" said attorney Dupree. ""Now that we're post-pandemic, the things that were authorized during the pandemic don't have the same justification they once did. And so that's why you see everyone in the one camp arguing a certain policy when the ball's in one court, but taking a different position when the ball is in the other court.""

Biden administration officials privately remain confident of prevailing in court on student loans and say they have no contingency plans in place.

But sources say student debt forgiveness advocates have quietly urged the Education Department to prepare for a Supreme Court loss, by replacing one policy for another: scrapping the HEROES Act for protections under the Higher Education Act of 1965.

For practical purposes, higher education experts expect the clock for federal loan repayments to start when the high court rules, which could happen anywhere between April and late June.

US warned Russia of Biden's visit to Ukraine 'hours' before departure,"U.S. officials warned Russia that President Biden was visiting the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv hours before he made the trip, the White House National Security Council revealed Monday.

National security officials provided more details about Biden's surprise trip to Ukraine on Monday, calling the trip unprecedented given the lack of U.S. military infrastructure in the war-torn region. Reporters pressed national security adviser Jake Sullivan on whether the U.S. had warned Moscow that Biden was headed to Kyiv, a city scarred with Russian missile strikes.

""We did notify the Russians that President Biden would be traveling to Kyiv,"" Sullivan told reporters Monday. ""We did so some hours before his departure for de-confliction purposes.""

Sullivan declined to elaborate on how the Russians were notified and whether they responded, however.

GAETZ INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO END MILITARY AND FINANCIAL AID TO UKRAINE, URGE PEACE DEAL

Sullivan went on to characterize the trip as an ""affirmation"" of the Biden administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine.

""This was not a celebration,"" he clarified, adding that there will likely be dark days ahead.

UKRAINE WARNS OF MASSIVE RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON ANNIVERSARY OF PUTIN’S INVASION: ‘WE HAVE TO BE READY’

Biden himself acknowledged the challenges facing Ukraine in comments during his visit. Large areas of Ukraine remain under Russian control even after months of successful ground offensives from Kyiv's forces.

""Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support – and that support will endure,"" Biden said in a Monday statement.

Sirens could be heard in war-torn Ukraine as Biden arrived in the country. The U.S. has already supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in financial aid and military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also announced $5.5 billion in aid for Ukraine as Biden visited with Zelenskyy.

Biden's visit comes just before Russia is expected to ramp up its offensive once again in its own acknowledgment of the one-year anniversary of the conflict. Ukrainian officials warned of a massive barrage of missiles that Russia may launch on Friday, Feb. 24.

A number of U.S. lawmakers have said supporting Ukraine should be a top priority, but some have criticized decisions to continue giving financial aid without proper oversight.

"Vladimir Putin gifted Biden a $12,000 pen months before invading Ukraine","Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted President Biden a $12,000 pen and writing set when the pair met for the first time since Biden gained office, according to a new State Department disclosure.

Putin made the gift in 2021 when both leaders met at a presidential summit in Geneva. The White House stated at the time that Biden had given Putin a pair of Aviators sunglasses, but it did not disclose Putin's lavish gift to the president.

State Department records say the gift was given to the National Archives for safekeeping, a common destination for presidential gifts. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital regarding why it hadn't previously disclosed Putin's gift.

The State Department release, first reported by Bloomberg News, describes the gift as a ""Kholuy lacquer miniature workshop desk writing set and pen"" and listed an estimated value of $12,000. Meanwhile, Biden's glasses had a value of a few hundred dollars.

GOP LAWMAKERS SLAM BIDEN FOR UKRAINE TRIP, NEGLECTING EAST PALESTINE, SOUTHERN BORDER: 'THEY CAN KEEP HIM!'

The pen set will likely end up in Biden's presidential library after he leaves office. Gifts granted to U.S. presidents are considered to be the property of the U.S. government, not the individual office-holder. Officials must purchase the items for the estimated price in order to own and use them after leaving office.

Gift-giving among world leaders is an extremely common practice, but Putin's writing set was by far the most expensive gift listed in the State Department's disclosure. For instance, French President Emmanuel Macron also gave Biden a pen, but it was worth just $430. The late Queen of England gave Biden a photo of herself in a silver frame, valued at $2,200.

"White House doctor says Biden 'fit to serve' as president: 'Healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old'","President Biden remains in tip-top shape, according to White House physician Kevin O'Connor.

""President Biden remains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,"" his physician, Kevin O'Connor, wrote in a Thursday memo request by Biden.

One lesion was discovered on his chest and removed. He still experiences a stiff gait, but it hasn't worsened since last year.

Biden continues to experience symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, primarily having to clear his throat more often, mostly after meals, the report said. O'Connor said the reflux is the source of Biden's throat clearing and coughing.

The results come as the president faces questions about his age as he has yet to formally declare whether he will seek re-election in 2024. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley took aim at the president Wednesday, saying that politicians over the age of 75 should have to take a mental cognitive test before assuming office.

O'Connor noted that the main event for Biden in the past year was his upper respiratory infection from COVID-19 last summer. He said Biden's oxygen levels never fell below 97%.

""The President has not experienced any residual symptoms which may be considered to be 'Long COVID,'"" he wrote.

The physical was Biden's second since taking office. In 2021, he was evaluated by O'Connor, who wrote the president ""remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.""",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-doctor-says-biden-fit-serve-president,N/A

""So today, as you all saw just an hour or so ago, President Obama announced that—Pardon me, President Biden!"" Jean-Pierre said as reporters shouted surprise. ""Whoa! Ahem, that is news. I know, we're going back not forwards. We've gotta go forwards.""

The slip-up comes as rumors continue to swirl regarding Biden's plans for 2024. While the White House insists he ""intends to run,"" many Democrats have expressed skepticism due to his age. Many expected Biden to make an announcement in the wake of his State of the Union speech earlier this month, but nothing ever came.

Obama has stood up for Biden's mental health in the past, however, blasting his own former White House physician when he criticized Biden's performance.

Biden admitted in October that questions about his age are ""totally legitimate.""

""I think it’s a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone’s age, including mine. That’s totally legitimate. But I think the best way to make the judgment is to, you know, watch me. Am I slowing up? Am I — don’t have the same pace?"" the president said in an interview with MSNBC at the time.

White House reaffirms that President Biden intends to run for re-election in 2024,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Sunday that President Joe Biden intends to run for re-election in 2024.

Asked by host Jonathan Capehart on MSNBC’s ""The Sunday Show"" whether an official announcement will be made soon on a Biden-Harris 2024 ticket, Jean-Pierre coyly replied that she can’t talk about politics because she’s limited by the HATCH Act, but ""what I can say is repeat what the president has said many times is that he intends to run. And I leave it there.""

At the start of the in-studio interview, Jean-Pierre was asked about the ""unidentified object"" shot down by a U.S. fighter jet over Canada.

The press secretary said that ""out of an abundance of caution, and by the recommendation by the militaries for President Biden and Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau, an unauthorized unmanned object,"" was taken down ""in airways in the North American airspace.""

MIKE PENCE'S FORMER ADVISER SAYS DOJ SUBPOENA ACTS AS ‘SECURITY BLANKET’ FOR EX-VP'S POSSIBLE 2024 RUN

She said the object had been monitored by NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] over the prior 24 hours or more, so Biden ""authorized the F-22, which is a fighter aircraft, to take it down."" ""We did it in conjunction with Canada,"" she told Capehart. ""The promise is we're always going to track. We're always going to detect, and we're always going to defend our airspace. And that's what the American people should expect.""

Capehart noted that multiple antennas have reportedly been collected in the debris from the Chinese surveillance balloon that traveled across the continental US before ultimately being shot down off the coast of South Carolina ""that may have been capable if collecting geolocating communications."" But Jean-Pierre declined to provide more details, saying the Department of Defense was conducting the analysis, and she did not want to get ahead of the military or intelligence community on its capabilities.

""The president wanted to make sure that first that we would do it where it was safe and that the American civilians were safe, but also in a way that we would be able to collect,"" she said.

When asked about the FBI searching the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence last week, Jean-Pierre declined to comment, insisting the Biden administration is for an ""independent"" DOJ. Though she did not reference it, Pence was issued a Department of Justice subpoena last week from special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Classified documents were also found at Biden’s home in Delaware.

Williamson tells Democrats it’s ‘time to move on’ from Biden as she plans trips to NH and early primary states,"Spiritual adviser and bestselling self-help author Marianne Williamson will travel to the early voting states in the Democratic presidential nominating calendar following her expected launch early next month of a primary challenge against President Biden, Fox News has learned.

Williamson, who called for reparations and a Department of Peace as part of her long-shot and unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, declared in a press release last week that she was exploring ""the possibility of running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024.""

""As America gears up for the 2024 presidential election, I’m preparing for an important announcement on March 4th in Washington DC,"" Williamson advertised.

An adviser in the likely White House contender’s political circle told Fox News that Williamson will travel to South Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Nevada after March 4.

GROWING SIGNS BIDEN COULD FACE A PRIMARY CHALLENGE IN THIS KEY NOMINATING STATE

With many leaders in the Democratic Party from both the establishment and progressive wings saying they will support Biden, who is expected in the coming weeks or months to announce his re-election campaign, Williamson would likely become the first Democrat with a national following to primary challenge the 80-year-old president.

""You can appreciate what the president has done — defeating the Republicans in 2020 — and still feel it is time to move on,"" Williamson said Tuesday in an interview on a New Hampshire news-talk morning radio program.

Williamson told host Jack Heath on ""Good Morning New Hampshire"" that ""many of us, myself included, feel that in order for the Democrats to win in 2024, we’re going to have to be able to offer to the American people something much more than"" what she says Biden is offering.

TRUMP, DESANTIS, PENCE SPOTLIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AS GOP 2024 RACE HEATS UP

During the 2020 cycle, Williamson was an unconventional candidate who preached a politics of love. She emphasized ""six pillars for a season of moral repair,"" including economic justice. She proposed creating a Department of Children and Youths and a Department of Peace, and she pushed for reparations for the descendants of African American slaves. Among her unorthodox acts was holding a meditation session while campaigning in New Hampshire.

However, she struggled with fundraising and failed to qualify for most of the Democrat presidential debates. Days after laying off most of her small staff, Williamson dropped out of the race in January 2020, just ahead of the start of the nomination primaries and caucuses. In late February 2020, she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, who at the time was the front-runner for the nomination. However, the progressive champion from Vermont, who was making his second White House run, was decisively defeated by Biden in South Carolina’s primary at the end of February and in the March contests, and later ended his bid and backed the then-former vice president.

In her Tuesday interview, Williamson pushed for universal health care and a livable wage, free childcare, free college and called for ""a fundamental reform of the economic landscape in this country""

MARIANNE WILLIAMSON TEASES ‘IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT’

Williamson said ""what’s important is that we have a candidate who can win in 2024 and that is by offering the kind of fundamental reform that Bernie Sanders"" has championed throughout his career.

Sources close to Williamson tell Fox News that she has traveled to New Hampshire a handful of times over the past year, and she returned late last week for meetings with progressive leaders and activists in the state.

Her trips to New Hampshire come as no surprise as political strategists have said that if there is going to be a primary challenge against Biden, the Granite State appears to be the state where the action will take place.

New Hampshire, which prides itself on its well-informed electorate and its emphasis on small-scale and grassroots retail politics, has for a century held the first primary in the race for the White House. While Republicans are making no changes to their presidential nominating calendar in the 2024 election cycle, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a new top of the calendar pushed by Biden that upends the traditional schedule.

THE TIME MARIANNE WILLIAMSON LED A MEDITATION SESSION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

New Hampshire will now vote second in the DNC’s calendar, along with Nevada, three days after South Carolina, under the new schedule.

However, Granite State Democrats warn that New Hampshire will still go first — courtesy of a longstanding state law that mandates the leadoff primary position — and that a primary not sanctioned by the DNC, where Biden does not take part, could invite trouble for the president.

""Absolutely you will see me in New Hampshire because what matters is democracy, not just what the DNC decides,"" Williamson stressed on Tuesday. ""The voters should decide who should be the nominee in 2024….The people should be making that decision. Not the DNC.""

US Olympic rower Patricia Spratlen Etem calls Biden administration's proposed Title IX changes ‘awful threat',"Patricia Spratlen Etem, a former member of the U.S. Olympic Rowing team in 1980 and 1984, was not an athlete growing up. In fact, it was not until she attended the University of California, Berkeley in the mid-1970s, fresh off the implementation of Title IX, that her journey began.

Spratlen Etem, 66, spoke to Fox News Digital recently about her continued work in women’s sports, specifically surrounding the ongoing debate regarding the involvement of transgender athletes in women’s sports .

Spratlen Etem is just one of two African American women to ever make the U.S women’s Olympic rowing team, but in her first chance at gold, the United States announced it was boycotting the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

28 GROUPS URGE BIDEN ADMIN TO SUPPORT WOMEN'S SPORTS, FIGHT 'UNLAWFUL' TITLE IX REG

Spratlen Etem, who now serves as a Rowing Advisory Committee member for the Independent Council on Women’s Sports, likened that moment of being stripped of her ""gold medal opportunity"" to the ""same denial"" that she says young girls and women face in sports today because of transgender athlete participation.

""I worked tremendously hard, as did athletes all around the world, and [it was] completely out of our control. There was a boycott mandated by our government. We were not government employees. We were not in the military. And yet we were denied our opportunity. And for me, that was my gold medal opportunity. It truly was.""

She continued, ""So I think of these women, and it's the same denial. You don't have control. It's being levied on you and out of your control. So this is happening to young girls and it's just heartbreaking. It's really heartbreaking.""

Spratlen Etem’s comments follow those of Becky Sauerbrunn, a U.S. women’s soccer star who has won two FIFA World Cups and a gold medal in the 2012 Olympics, who wrote an op-ed earlier this month taking aim at Missouri lawmakers over a bill that would bar transgender girls from playing sports with biological females.

""I can assure you that playing with or against transgender women and girls is not a threat to women’s sports,"" Sauerbrunn wrote in her piece published in the Springfield News-Leader in Missouri.

However, Spratlen Etem disagreed.

""It's very much a threat. It's an existential threat. And it's a threat on many levels.""

Spratlen Etem named several examples including safety, specifically in contact sports, but argued that the biggest threat is to Title IX.

She specifically pointed to the Biden administration’s proposed changes to Title IX that will change the language of the law to include gender identity into its protections as opposed to solely sex-based.

""That's dangerous for women. That completely puts Title IX on its head. It undoes Title IX for women. It does that for recruitment, where now you have to say – they can practice affirmative action in recruiting to bring levels, now not based on sex, based on gender.""

The Biden administration proposed new regulations on the 50th anniversary of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools, to expand the protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity.

Spratlen Etem argued that the implications of the new changes will have a long-lasting effect on biological females, not just in athletics, but also in education.

""It is a definite, awful threat for women because then this impedes educational opportunity. And people who say, no, it really doesn't. Yes, it really does,"" she said, adding that there are more women on campuses now than before the implementation of Title IX.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""The very fact is that Title IX is a complete and important driver to higher education for women, when that gets changed to gender – It's just inarguable to say it's not a threat.""

""It's prejudicial to women to have to compete against biological men,"" she continued. ""So in the implementation for U.S. colleges and universities, that's going to be Title IX. And if Title IX language says everything will be superseded to gender, then women essentially don't count. That's really what they're saying. And that is the opposite – the antithesis of what Title IX’s objective originally was.""

The Biden administration will release another round of regulations in the spring that will specifically address Title IX's application to transgender athletes participating in women's sports – an idea furiously debated by current and former athletes on both sides.

However, for Spratlen Etem, the ""discrimination component"" of these changes is something she believes is something no one can deny – especially those who have benefited from Title IX.

""I don't understand how women or men aren't seeing the discrimination component of this and how it's negatively affecting and will affect girls,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Women have paved the way for these young women. Completely. They themselves have benefited from the original Title IX. That's been in their lifetime.""

Spratlen Etem said the idea is not to isolate anyone from athletics, but to ""create a category so that it is competitively fair.""",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/us-olympic-rower-patricia-spratlen-etem-calls-biden-administrations-proposed-title-ix-changes-awful-threat,N/A

On February 3, a freight train derailed on the outskirts of East Palestine, releasing hazardous materials in the air. Residents within a 1-mile radius were evacuated while officials burned the chemicals in an attempt to dispose of them.

Johnston, whose home is within the 1-mile radius, said that she does not trust officials who say the area is now safe.

"Biden’s speech rallying NATO was all for show, says retired lieutenant general. Here’s why","President Biden's speech rallying NATO members was all show since those nations don't provide enough military funding to defend each other, according to a national security adviser to former President Trump.

""If you're not putting 2% of your GDP into defense, then some of your systems may not be able to fight in defense of the alliance when called upon,"" retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. told Fox News.

In a Wednesday address to a group of eastern European nations, Biden stressed the importance of a strong and unified NATO. The message came soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his nation would no longer participate in a nuclear treaty with the U.S., days ahead of the anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine.

LT. GEN. KELLOGG: NATO’S ARTICLE 5 RELIES ON ALLIES FUNDING DEFENSE

Putin ""doubts our continued support of Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified,"" Biden said in his speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw. ""But there should be no doubt, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.""

""Article 5 is a sacred commitment the United States has made,"" Biden continued. ""We will defend literally every inch of NATO.""

Article 5 stipulates that an attack on any NATO member is treated as an attack on all, requiring a joint response.

""Everybody kind of understands what Article 5 is,"" Kellogg said. ""An attack on one is an attack on all.""

He said equally important is Article 3, which states that NATO countries must fund their defense well enough to defend themselves and the collective alliance against an attack.

""They go hand in glove,"" he said. ""They're both important. They both rely on each other.""

In 2014, NATO allies met in Wales and pledged to try to increase defense spending to 2% of their GDP, and 20% of that amount on modernizing their equipment over the next decade in order to fulfill Article 3.

""Most of the countries didn't do that,"" Kellogg told Fox News. ""So, they didn't really fulfill Article 3, which impacted on Article 5.""

FINLAND LOOKS AT JOINING NATO WITHOUT SWEDEN AMID PUSHBACK FROM TURKEY

Kellogg said Biden's message about a strong and unified NATO rings hollow since about 20 of the 30 allied countries are unprepared to fulfill a call for aid. He pointed to Germany, France, Spain and Italy as among the least prepared.

""If you don't get to 2% GDP, you will not have the military structure, the military forces to be able to support the rest of the alliance as they enforce Article 5,"" Kellogg said. ""They won't be able to do it because they don't have the forces.""

""It's so important we continue to, from the bully pulpit, talk about NATO, talk about their unfunded military establishment,"" he added. ""President Trump did it all the time, and they actually started to increase their defense budget.""

In addition to the U.S., which spends nearly 4% of its GDP on defense, the Baltic countries, Poland and Britain are the most prepared to act swiftly and effectively if Article 5 is invoked, Kellogg said.

Despite Biden’s remarks that fueled speculation over whether NATO will get involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Kellogg said he does not see that happening anytime soon.

""It was a diversion because he hasn't come up with a plan to help end this war,"" Kellogg told Fox News. ""I want to know what the policy is to end this war. How are you going to do it? Define that to the American people.""

""Instead, he uses rhetoric and talks about Article 5 and NATO but it doesn't impact the fight at all,"" he said. ""Russia's not going to go into NATO. They don't have the capacity to even get to the western part of Ukraine, let alone attack NATO, and they understand very well if Putin does that, it's the end of Russia.""

"M1 Abrams tanks Biden promised Ukraine may not be sent this year or next, defense official says","The M1 Abrams tanks that President Biden promised to send to Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia may not arrive by the end of this year or potentially the next, a U.S. Army official said Thursday.

Last month, President Biden announced the U.S. military would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine to increase its defensive capabilities against Russia. However, the military does not currently have the available inventory to supply the tanks and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said Thursday that transporting the vehicles to Ukraine ""is not going to be a matter of weeks,"" according to DefenseNews.

""We’re looking at what’s the fastest way we can get the tanks to the Ukrainians. It’s not going to be a matter of weeks,"" Wormuth told reporters Thursday.

There are longer timelines involved, but I think there are options that are less than two years, less than a year-and-a-half.""

On Friday, Feb. 24, the war between Russia and Ukraine reached its one-year anniversary. The Biden administration on Friday did announce $2 billion in additional aid to Ukraine, in the form of laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammo and more, along with new sanctions targeting Russia's economy.

Wormuth said the Army was still determining whether the tanks could be shipped by the end of the year. ""There’s a lot of details still that need to be worked out,"" she said, DefenseNews reported.

RUSSIA REACTS TO US, GERMANY TANK DELIVERIES TO UKRAINE: ‘DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONFLICT’

On Jan. 25, President Biden, joined by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Defense Secretary Antony Blinken, announced the promised vehicles were the ""most capable tanks in the world"" and said they ""will enhance Ukraine’s ability"" on the battlefield.

""This is about freedom, freedom for Ukraine, freedom everywhere,"" he added at the time.

BIDEN APPROVES SENDING 31 M1 ABRAMS TANKS TO UKRAINE, IN REVERSAL

The announcement came in tandem with German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz saying Berlin would send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine ahead of an expected Russian offensive this Spring.

The next day, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh revealed the U.S. does not have enough M1 Abrams tanks in its stockpile to send to Ukraine.

""We just don’t have these tanks available in excess in our US stocks, which is why it is going to take months to transfer these M1A2 Abrams to Ukraine,"" Singh told the New York Post.

Berlin initially denied Ukraine’s request for tanks but reached an agreement to send the military vehicles as Washington promised to do the same.

Germany suggested unilaterally sending the tank could raise concerns over escalating the war.

The U.S. has already supplied thousands of combat vehicles, including 1,700 Humvees, and pledged to send another 500 armored vehicles of several types to Ukraine earlier this month.

"Pope derides Biden's abortion views, Catholic self-identity as 'incoherence'","Pope Francis questioned President Biden's conscience on Tuesday in an interview during which he described the commander-in-chief's religious identity and views on abortion as incoherent.

""A month after conception, the DNA of the fetus is already there and the organs are aligned. There is human life,"" the pontiff said in the interview with Spanish-language outlet Univision.

Asked about Biden — a self-professed ""devout Catholic"" who supports blanket legalization of abortion on the federal level — the pope dismissed the president as incomprehensible.

""A month after conception, the DNA of the fetus is already there and the organs are aligned. There is human life,"" the pope said in the Univision interview. ""Is it just to eliminate a human life?""

UNITED NATIONS 'HAS NO POWER,' POPE FRANCIS SAYS

He added that Biden should instead question his own conscience and consult with his bishop.

""I leave it to [President Biden's] conscience and that he speaks to his bishop, his pastor, his parish priest about that incoherence,"" the pope remarked.

The pope has been hesitant to directly meddle in politics since the beginning of his papacy — afraid to devolve the Holy See into a normal, secular world power.

Instead, Pope Francis has taken a more pastoral role via his encyclicals and apostolic journeys — many historic in content.

The Holy Father is currently finishing preparations for a trip to Canada, after which he has committed to visiting the war-torn Ukraine. The first-ever apostolic journey to Moscow is also currently being discussed, should Russian authorities allow the visit.

DC ARCHDIOCESE SILENT ON PELOSI COMMUNION BAN, EMAIL SAYS MEDIA REQUESTS 'WILL BE IGNORED'

Pope Francis's resistance to handing down orders to leaders of other nations is not a new concept.

According to Catholic Canon Law, bishops are the final governing authority in their diocese unless the pope personally intervenes.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains, ""A diocesan bishop in the diocese entrusted to him has all ordinary, proper, and immediate power which is required for the exercise of his pastoral function except for cases which the law or a decree of the Supreme Pontiff reserves to the supreme authority or to another ecclesiastical authority.""

POPE CONFIRMS JOURNEY TO UKRAINE, POSSIBLY RUSSIA, BUT DETAILS YET UNKNOWN

While the Bishop of Rome is the final authority on contested religious doctrine, Pope Francis has made efforts to stay out of local or national deliberations on church governance whenever possible.

The office of bishop comes with extensive responsibilities and powers. Perhaps most prominent is the bishop's responsibility for the pastoral care of Catholics and ex-Catholics in his jurisdiction.

According to canon law, ""A diocesan bishop, frequently preaching in person, is bound to propose and explain to the faithful the truths of the faith which are to be believed and applied to morals.""

Canon law continues, ""He is also to take care that the prescripts of the canons on the ministry of the word, especially those on the homily and catechetical instruction, are carefully observed so that the whole Christian doctrine is handed on to all.""

POPE NAMES NUNS, LAY WOMEN AMONG NEW DICASTERY FOR BISHOPS

However, the pope may not see the canonical corrections he desires for Biden without intervening — Biden and his family attend Holy Spirit Church in the Archdiocese of Washington, DC.

The archdiocese is overseen by Cardinal Wilton Gregory, who has gone on record saying that he would not excommunicate a politician for defending abortion rights.

The cardinal has been so averse to addressing the issue further that his office accidentally let slip that they are ""ignoring"" questions from the media.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., mistakenly emailed a reporter seeking comment on its position regarding the San Francisco archbishop's decision to bar House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , from receiving Holy Communion due to her stance on abortion after Pelosi reportedly took Communion in D.C. on Sunday.

""Just sharing for you to know what comes in,"" the email stated. ""Email since Saturday, when I last checked the comms inbox has just been a couple of random people wanting to tell the Cardinal to bring down the hammer on Pelosi. Aside from Jack Jenkins at RNS, this is the only new media inquiry. It will be ignored, too.""

Speaking about the responsibility of running one of the world's oldest living institutions and the politics that come with it, the pontiff was open about his exhaustion.

""The Holy Spirit gives you many fruits, but no one ever talks about the things that make you numb,"" the pope lamented. ""And sometimes, you feel you are numb in the face of situations that should make you suffer greatly and make you move, without missing the opportunity"".",https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-criticizes-bidens-abortion-views-catholic-self-identity-incoherence,N/A
