"Ricky Martin accused of incest and domestic violence by nephew, lawyer disputes allegations","Ricky Martin is being accused of domestic violence and incest by his nephew, Dennis Yadiel Sanchez, and the singer’s attorney is denying all allegations.

Earlier this month, Martin, 50, was hit with a restraining order during an incident in Puerto Rico, but the accuser's name was originally withheld. According to the Spanish news site Marca, Martin’s brother, Eric Martin, revealed the identity of the accuser as his 21-year-old nephew.

Sanchez recently identified Martin, his uncle, as his alleged assailant.

""Unfortunately, the person who made this claim is struggling with deep mental health challenges,"" Marty Singer, Martin’s attorney told Fox News Digital.

RICKY MARTIN'S EX-MANAGER SUES STAR FOR $3 MILLION, CITING 'CAREER-ENDING ALLEGATION'

""Ricky Martin has, of course, never been - and would never be - involved in any kind of sexual or romantic relationship with his nephew. The idea is not only untrue, it is disgusting.""

Singer continued: ""We all hope that this man gets the help he so urgently needs. But, most of all, we look forward to this awful case being dismissed as soon as a judge gets to look at the facts.""

According to Sanchez, Martin ""exercised physical and psychological attacks"" against him. Marca reported that the family members were in a seven-month long relationship that ended two months ago. Sanchez is reportedly the son of Martin’s stepsister.

RICKY MARTIN REVEALS FEELING PTSD OVER PAST BARBARA WALTERS INTERVIEW WHERE SHE ASKED HIM TO COME OUT

Per Marca, Martin continued to reach out to Sanchez, which resulted in the restraining order being filed in Puerto Rico on July 1.

The outlet noted that incest laws in Puerto Rico could send Martin to prison for 50 years, if the allegations are proven true. The singer is expected to return to Puerto Rico on July 21 for his trial.

Martin appears to be resuming his life as he was seen on set of ""Mrs. American Pie"" in Los Angeles on Friday.

Domestic violence brain injuries likely outnumber head trauma from football players,"Domestic violence victims likely suffer a higher rate of brain trauma than football players and soldiers, but the exact number is unknown because many of these injuries, which overwhelmingly occur in women, are never diagnosed, according to the New York Times.

""People might think, someone smacked her in the head or pushed her, no big deal,"" says Dr. Eve M. Valera, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a leading expert on traumatic brain injuries among domestic violence survivors.

In 1990, Dr. Gareth Roberts evaluated the brain of a 76-year-old woman who died after years of abuse from her husband who was reported to have become ‘demented’ in her final years, according to the news outlet.

But he discovered on autopsy that her brain was similar to those patients with Alzheimer’s and compatible ""to a degree"" with boxers who suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and the case became the first connection in the literature between neurogenerative disease and abused women, according to the Times.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes physical, sexual or psychological abuse in a romantic relationship that approximately one in four women or one in 10 men have experienced as sexual or physical violence and/or stalking during their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Strangulation is defined as the external obstruction of blood vessels and/or airflow in the neck resulting in loss of oxygen, according to The Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention.

INFLATION, WAR, COVID PANDEMIC PUSHING US STRESS LEVELS THROUGH THE ROOF, POLL SAYS

Approximately 68% of IPV victims experience near-strangulation, but only half have visible signs of trauma with only 15% of those who do show evidence of injuries subsequently photographed to document the abuse, per the Institute.

But loss of consciousness can occur within seconds and death can follow within minutes during strangulation, with the Institute noting the odds increase by 750% for an IPV survivor of one strangulation to be killed compared to someone who has not been strangulated.

Common signs of strangulation include petechiae (small red spots caused by bleeding under the skin) on the face, eyeballs and eyelids, swelling, scratch marks and abrasions around the neck, according to a Strangulation in Intimate Partner Violence Fact Sheet.

The fact sheet also notes victims may complain of memory loss, dizziness, headaches, a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing or breathing.

Because of these symptoms, victims may have difficulty processing the event and often don’t report it to the police, so many domestic assaults largely go unnoticed, per the Times.

The frequency and severity of the symptoms makes it "" … difficult to think through or cope with the complex, often formidable organizational tasks required for battered women to stop the violence, disengage from violent partners and/or establish independent lives,"" said the authors of a domestic abuse 2002 study, where almost all participants had suffered head trauma with 40% losing consciousness.

Even though most of the research regarding concussions and neurogenerative disease comes from studying male brains, some of the research suggests women are more susceptible to concussions in part because males have more muscular necks to cushion a blow to the head and women have leaner nerve fibers, known as axons, that shear more easily during trauma, according to the Times.

But women also may be more vulnerable to post-concussive symptoms because of sex hormones differences with research pointing to a progesterone disruption that occurs possibly because of impact on the pituitary gland in the brain. Several studies suggest if a victim happens to be in her menstrual cycle during the traumatic event, she can suffer more anxiety and depression afterward compared to men, per the Times.

WHO SAYS GLOBAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION INCREASED 25% DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC

""So much money goes into investigating concussions in sports that those protocols and papers go on to shape the way concussions in general are thought about,"" said Stephen Casper, professor of history of Clarkson University.

""There’s no money to be made from studying intimate-partner abuse.""

The Government Accountability Office released a report in 2020 concluding that IPV affects over 30% of men and women in the United States, but acknowledged because the overall prevalence data on these injuries is unknown, this has caused a lack of understanding of the issue.

The Times compares severe brain injuries to powerful earthquakes, but instead of bridges and buildings crumbling, our bones fracture as hemorrhages later erupt with raw painful facial wounds.

""But mild brain injuries are smaller quakes: Books fall off shelves; vases are broken. It’s harder to survey the damage and easy to miss what’s broken, but something is clearly wrong,"" the paper said.

"Domestic violence increasing amid coronavirus pandemic, just as experts predicted: report","A new report concerning the pandemic’s impact on domestic violence suggests at least an 8.1% increase in incidents during stay-at-home orders.

The report, released on Wednesday by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice (CCJ), analyzed the results of 18 studies that examined the frequency of domestic violence reports both before and during the pandemic. Researchers used data collected by law enforcement agencies, health agencies, domestic violence hotlines, and ""other administrative documents,"" according to a press release.

The CCJ found that incidents of domestic violence increased 8.1% in the U.S. after lockdown orders were issued — though the actual percentage is likely higher, seeing as more incidents may be happening behind closed doors during stay-at-home orders. What’s more, any friends or family who may have otherwise reported such incidents were likely separated from the victims, or not around to witness them.

'HOME IMPROVEMENT' STAR PLEADS GUILTY TO TWO CHARGES IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE

""Our analysis confirms the initial fears we had at the outset of the pandemic,"" said Alex R. Piquero, the report’s lead author and chair of the University of Miami Department of Sociology, in a news release.

The report’s authors further believe the problem was exacerbated by increased unemployment, money issues, or alcohol abuse, among other stressors potentially caused by the pandemic.

""The pandemic has thrown many of the most vulnerable people in our society into especially challenging circumstances, so these findings should not surprise us,"" wrote CCJ Director Thomas Abt in the Wednesday’s news release. ""Policymakers and researchers should work to further understand the impacts of the pandemic and provide additional resources for domestic abuse prevention and victim services, particularly to those who are most isolated and at risk.""

It's not just a U.S. problem, either. The CCJ report found that while reports increased 8.1% in the United States, the average increase among all the countries studied in the report — Mexico, Italy, Sweden, Australia, Argentina, India and the U.S. — was barely lower, at 7.9%. But domestic violence has been a global problem all along, experts have said.

The United Nations had previously warned of the ""devastating impact"" that the pandemic might have on instances of sexual and domestic violence across the globe, particularly against women and girls, following preliminary studies in 2020. Calling this type of violence, a ""shadow pandemic"" of its own, the UN had already observed upticks in helpline and emergency calls within the first few months of the global pandemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO), too, had predicted increased instances of violence against women in multiple alerts dating back as far as March 2020, citing reports of spiking cases in the U.S., U.K. and China, including one from Jingzhou which recorded such cases tripling in February 2020 during the onset of health crisis.",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/domestic-violence-increasing-coronavirus-pandemic-report,N/A
Gabby Petito case triggers domestic violence survivors: 'The video was disturbing',"In wake of Gabby Petito's death, both experts and survivors of domestic violence are sounding off on the 911 call in Moab, Utah, and the highly publicized bodycam footage.

On Aug. 12, the Moab City Police Department released a video showing officers interacting with Petito, 22 and her fiancé Brian Laundrie, 23, roughly two weeks before Petito disappeared. Moab police were responding to a report of a ""possible domestic violence"" incident, Fox News Digital first reported.

The 911 caller was heard telling a dispatcher that ""the gentleman was slapping the girl"" and hitting her, Fox News confirmed Monday after exclusively obtaining audio of the call. In a subsequent police statement, a witness said, ""At one point, they were sort of fighting over a phone – I think the male took the female’s phone. It appeared that he didn’t want her in the white van.""

On Oct., 1, Fox News reported on newly released bodycam video from a second Moab officer who arrived at the scene. In the footage, Petito told a police officer that Laundrie grabbed her face during the argument on Aug. 12 – but she quickly backtracked and claimed she struck first.

The FBI later confirmed Petito’s remains were found in Wyoming, labeling it homicide. Laundrie has been named a person of interest in the case, not a suspect, and has also been reported missing.

Laundrie family attorney Steven Bertolino told Fox News in September, ""Brian has been missing for a week. The family is definitely concerned but we don’t want to speculate as to anything more."" After investigators confirmed Petito’s death, he told reporters, ""May Gabby rest in peace.""

GABBY PETITO: CASSIE LAUNDRIE BLASTS PARENTS OVER HANDLING OF BRIAN'S WHEREABOUTS: LIVE UPDATES

The case has been under public scrutiny since Petito’s reported disappearance on Sept. 11, and the police footage, which is still under investigation, has sparked conversation surrounding domestic violence.

""As a survivor myself, I can't tell you how many times I've been in that instance where I could tell something bad was going to happen"" — Ruth Glenn, domestic violence expert, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence

In the footage, Petito appears visibly distraught while a calm Laundrie describes his version of events to police, showing scratches on his body from Petito.

""The video was disturbing to us,"" Kathryn Jacob, president/CEO of SafeHaven of Tarrant County, a nonprofit agency which operates domestic violence shelters, told Fox News.

Petito blamed her ""OCD"" for the argument, according to the video. Officers decided Petito was ""the primary aggressor.""

Ruth Glenn, domestic violence expert and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence told Fox News that she saw roughly 15 minutes of the video and was too ""startling"" for her to finish.

""Her appearing disheveled and hysterical and really self-blaming, and him appearing flippant and blaming her as well,"" Glenn said.

Neither Petito nor Laundrie wanted to file a police report against the other.

In the video, police questioned Petito and Laundrie separately after pulling them over on the highway.

""She knows what she has to say to keep herself safe because chances are, she knows she’s going to be alone with him again after this moment, and she knows she will bear the consequences after she leaves PD,"" Jacob, who is also a licensed social worker in Tarrant County, Texas, said about the video.

It’s unknown if this was the first incident between Petito and Laundrie.

In the footage that was first released, one officer can be heard saying how he’s been ""married for over five years"" and ""I get it,"" while Laundrie smiles throughout the exchange.

Representatives for Moab police have not yet responded to Fox News’ request for comment on this story.

Jacob said the blame appears to be placed on Petito in the video. Blame is an element of The Power and Control wheel – a tool used in the domestic violence field to understand tactics abusers use to gain power and over victims and keep them in the relationship, Jacob added.

""The one tactic that you will see every offender use is minimize, deny and blame – making light of the abuse not taking abuse seriously – shifting responsibility of the abuse,"" Jacob said.

As Fox News previously reported, one of the responding officers said the incident can be ""more accurately categorized as a mental/emotional health ‘break’ than a domestic assault,"" and that ""no significant injuries"" were reported.

Laundrie was sent to a hotel for the night and Petito stayed with their van, which was converted into a camper.

""As a survivor myself, I can't tell you how many times I've been in that instance where I could tell something bad was going to happen,"" Glenn said.

Audria Maltsberger, a volunteer on SafeHaven’s prevention team said she too watched the bodycam footage – calling it ""triggering.""

Maltsberger, who is also a helpline coordinator for the national organization, Break the Silence, said she and fellow survivors have been following the Petito case.

""She’s downplaying and taking the blame. He’s putting it all on her,"" Maltsberger said, commenting on the video.

""We see it on all these stupid shows on TV and so we are desensitized, and so disconnected"" — Audria Maltsberger, domestic violence survivor, volunteer on SafeHaven’s prevention team

Maltsberger, also a survivor of domestic violence, went to SafeHaven 14 years ago with her three children after exiting an abusive marriage.

Now, Maltsberger helps women and men survivors by sharing her story and helping them get out.

""At the end, it was 12-and-a-half years and it took broken bones to finally be able to get me to leave,"" she said.

""We want to believe that they can change and it’s not going to happen again,"" Maltsberger said. ""Unless there’s an intervention it’s going to get more dangerous.""

One in three women has experienced intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and over half of female homicide victims in the U.S. are killed by a male intimate partner or former partner.

Maltsberger calls it an ""epidemic"" adding, ""We see it on all these stupid shows on TV and so we are desensitized, and so disconnected. But this is the perfect opportunity to push passed all of that.""

""If you have a 'sensationalized' case not only does the media and society in general become interested but there's also awareness that comes"" — -Glenn

Matsberger referenced the 2018 Colorado death of Shanann Watts , who was 15 weeks pregnant. Shanann’s husband Chris Watts was convicted of her murder as well as the murders of their two daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3. The case received national media attention.

In 1994, after the high-profile O. J. Simpson case and murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, calls to shelters, police and hotlines soared, the Associated Press reported. In diary entries, Brown Simpson had detailed the physical abuse she endured. Policy-makers sought new ways to address domestic violence beyond sending women to shelters and offering restraining orders which often did little to protect them.

HOW PARENTS SHOULD TALK TO KIDS ABOUT GABBY PETITO

Both the Simpson and Watts stories were retold as movies and documentaries.

""If you have a 'sensationalized' case not only does the media and society in general become interested but there's also awareness that comes…for victims and survivors of domestic violence,"" Glenn said.

""Unfortunately, what also happens is that [it] is short-lived,"" Glenn said, adding ""Public awareness goes way down. the conversation slowly but surely wanes, and that’s really unfortunate because domestic violence doesn’t.""

In February, Fox News reported on an 8.1% increase in domestic violence incidents during stay-at-home orders. The report was released by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice (CCJ) -- using data collected by law enforcement agencies, health agencies, domestic violence hotlines, and ""other administrative documents.""

In reference to the Petito 911 call, Jacob said police aren’t experts in every field, nor are they social workers.

""They’re public safety officers and we expect them to be trained at a bachelor or master level, in domestic violence, substance abuse psychosis or mental health… no one can be a jack of all trades in that way,"" she said.

Jacob said in some areas of the U.S., resources exist to address domestic violence and are available to police.

For example, in Arlington, Texas, police will have a licensed social worker accompany them to domestic violence calls, Jacob said. Police in Milwaukee have a similar strategy.

""It’s the system, not PD – the system was not established to deal with the dynamic of domestic violence"" — Jacob

Jacob collaborates with her community to identify the most vulnerable survivors in our community along with the offenders who are most likely to re-offend. ""We [work] with law enforcements and others to make sure they don’t turn into homicide,"" she said. ""When they feel safe to do so, there’s a warm hand-off between Arlington PD and SafeHaven.""

She went on, ""It’s the system, not PD – the system was not established to deal with the dynamic of domestic violence.""

Maltsberger is hoping for more tools and education for police, nurses, doctors and families.

""When I was in the shelter it wasn’t just poor women. They're all races, all professions. It does not discriminate,"" Maltsberger said.

Biden addresses Kenosha violence as media outlets suggest ongoing unrest boosts Trump,"Joe Biden's forceful condemnation of the ongoing violence stemming from civil unrest in cities across the country came amid a storm of headlines urging the Democratic candidate to address the issue.

In a video message shared on Wednesday, the former vice president disavowed the violence while still expressing his support for peaceful protest.

CNN'S DON LEMON SAYS KENOSHA VIOLENCE HURTS DEMOCRATS: 'THE RIOTING HAS TO STOP'

""You know, as I said after George Floyd's murder, protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary,"" Biden said. ""But burning down communities is not protest- it's needless violence, violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community. That's wrong.""

However, as speakers on the first two nights of Republican National Convention hammered Biden and Democrats for not addressing the violence earlier, notably at last week's Democratic National Convention, several outlets offered dire warnings to the Biden campaign that their candidate's perceived silence will benefit President Trump.

MSNBC MOCKED FOR HAVING SEATTLE MAYOR REFUTE KRISTI NOEM'S CLAIM ON VIOLENCE IN CITIES LED BY DEMOCRATS

CNN anchor Don Lemon made a direct plea to Biden amid a third night of violence in Kenosha, Wis. following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, stressing the political ramifications of the unrest.

""He's got to address it. He's got to come out to talk about it. He's got to do a speech like Barack Obama did about race,"" Lemon said late Tuesday. ""The rioting has to stop... it's showing up in the polling, it's showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking.""

Late Wednesday, The New York Times published a story headlined, ""How Chaos in Kenosha Is Already Swaying Some Voters in Wisconsin.""

""The politically calculated warnings of President Trump and the Republican Party about chaos enveloping America should Democrats win in November are reverberating among some people in Kenosha, a small city in the southeast corner of one of the most critical states in this election, where protests have raged for a number of increasingly combustible nights,"" the Times reported.

CNN PANNED FOR ON-AIR GRAPHIC READING 'FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTEST' IN FRONT OF KENOSHA FIRE

""In Kenosha County, where the president won by fewer than 250 votes in 2016, those who already supported Mr. Trump said in interviews that the events of the past few days have simply reinforced their conviction that he is the man for the job. But some voters who were less sure of their choice said the chaos in their city and the inability of elected leaders to stop it were currently nudging them toward the Republicans.""

""And some Democrats,"" the Times continued, ""nervous about condemning the looting because they said they understood the rage behind it, worried that what was happening in their town might backfire and aid the president’s re-election [sic] prospects.""

Also on Wednesday, Axios ran a report headlined, ""How Trump could pull off another upset,"" writing that ""the Black Lives Matter movement and calls for social justice and progressive changes are tugging Biden to the left"" were among the reasons that could lead the president to victory.

Despite addressing the violence directly on Wednesday, Biden may still not be out of the woods yet.

On Thursday, Politico ran the headline, ""‘It’s playing into Trump’s hands’: Dems fear swing-state damage from Kenosha unrest.""

""As this battleground state grapples with social unrest, some Democrats fear that the looting and rioting and clashes are feeding Trump’s argument that this is what life would be like under the so-called radical left,"" Politico wrote. ""The worry is that especially among suburban swing voters, the more upheaval and violence they witness, the more their sympathy for peaceful Black Lives Matters protesters will wane.""

Former Madison Mayor Paul Soglin told Politico, ""There’s no doubt it’s playing into Trump’s hands ... There’s a significant number of undecided voters who are not ideological ...

"Climate change increases 'domestic violence’ risks for women, Washington Post claims","The Washington Post used the suffering of abused women in Asia and Africa to argue that ""more frequent and intense extreme weather events have led to escalating threats against women and girls.""

""Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration,"" Terry McGovern, an expert on ""Population and Family Health,"" told The Post.

The Washington Post's tweet of the article soon received backlash on Twitter, with reporter Tatjana Pasalic responding to the article by tagging the CEO of The Babylon Bee, a conservative satire site. ""damnit @SethDillon,"" she wrote.

""For these and many other women around the world, the threat of violence could become more common as climate change makes extreme weather events more intense and frequent.""

The liberal media has taken flack in recent weeks for raising the stakes on climate rhetoric, with one New York Times columnist recommending that mating ""with shorter people"" could help save the planet from destruction.

The ""doomsday celebrity,"" as CBS host Scott Pelley called biologist Paul Ehrlich, took to Twitter to whine about the ""right-wing"" backlash against his ""60 Minutes"" appearance.

""If I'm always wrong so is science, since my work is always peer-reviewed, including the POPULATION BOMB and I've gotten virtually every scientific honor. Sure I've made some mistakes, but no basic ones.""

The tweet was soon eviscerated online by a collection of journalists and even YouTuber Hank Green.

Podcast host Noah Blum mocked Ehrlich’s tweet, summing up his argument. ""I’m not wrong. Source: me.""

The Washington Post later undermined its warnings of climate change fueling abuse because it wasn’t totally scientific.

CNN guest blasted for suggesting the word 'violent' doesn't describe Atlanta riots: 'What a joke',"CNN guest David Peisner caught flak Saturday for claiming that the only violence taking place in the fiery uproar underway in Atlanta is being instigated by police.

""I think that there’s a real blurring of the lines in the use of the word violence. Is property destruction violence? To some people it certainly is. But, you know, this idea that breaking windows or other acts of property destruction are the same as actual violence against humans, it’s kind of a dangerous and slippery concept,’"" he told CNN's Pamela Brown Saturday on ""CNN Newsroom.""

""You keep using these words ‘violent, violent, violent, violent'… The only acts of violence against people that I saw were actually police tackling protesters,"" he added.

Peisner further suggested the group of rioters was ""small"" and that people involved in the incident were acting apart from the ""Defend the Forest"" movement memorializing 26-year-old activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who was killed in a gunfire exchange Wednesday after allegedly firing at Georgia state troopers.

""As the chief himself said, this is a small group,"" he said. ""Also, within this ‘Defend the Forest’ movement, there are no leaders, so people kind of go off and do their own thing,"" he said.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, R., condemned the violence along with Atlanta city officials Saturday.

""While the state continues to respect peaceful protest, acts of violence against person or property will not be tolerated. Those committing such unlawful acts will be arrested and prosecuted fully,"" Kemp said.

CNN guest who defended Atlanta's violent protests promoted GoFundMe for alleged cop shooter,"Social media users discovered that David Peisner, the freelance journalist who suggested on CNN that Antifa wasn’t using violence during the Atlanta riots, supported the violent protester at the center of the uproar.

Peisner originally faced intense online backlash after claiming that the fiery uproar seen in Atlanta over the weekend does not necessarily prove that Antifa members are violent.

""You keep using these words ‘violent, violent, violent, violent'… The only acts of violence against people that I saw were actually police tackling protesters,"" Peisner said on ""CNN Newsroom"" Saturday.

Prior to his appearance, however, his Twitter account showed that he retweeted a GoFundMe page in support of Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who allegedly shot at Georgia state troopers.

CNN GUEST BLASTED FOR SUGGESTING THE WORD ‘VIOLENT’ DOESN’T DESCRIBE ATLANTA RIOTS: ‘WHAT A JOKE’

""Please donate to the family of Tortugita, murdered by GSP for defending the Weelaunee Forest and fighting to #StopCopCity,"" the tweet read with an image of Teran.

Protesters instigated a night of chaos upon the news that Teran was killed by the police after he allegedly refused to listen to demands from authorities and fired a shot against state troopers at the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. ""Totuguita"" (""little turtle"" in Spanish) referred to the name Teran went by with reports saying that Teran identified as a nonbinary person with they/it pronouns.

What began as a peaceful protest spiraled into several hours of destruction with protesters breaking several windows and setting a police car on fire. Atlanta police arrested at least six people.

Peisner also penned an article in memory of Teran titled ""Little Turtle’s War"" for The Bitter Southerner, casting doubt on the idea that Teran instigated the shooting.

ATLANTA POLICE ARREST 6 IN NIGHT OF CHAOS AFTER VIOLENT PROTESTERS LIT COP CAR ABLAZE, SMASHED WINDOWS

""At the moment, I have no real information about the series of events that morning that led to Teran’s death. It is certainly possible that it happened exactly as law enforcement has described it, though it’s worth noting that in past killings by police officers — including that of George Floyd — the initial narratives provided by officials have proved to be erroneous. Some may point to the origin of Teran’s forest name as evidence of their violent intent, and I suppose that that could be true, but it would not square with the person I got to know over the past six months,"" Peisner wrote.

He further defended Teran’s organization from allegations that members take part in violence.

""Some may consider property destruction in and of itself to be violent, but there’s been a real blurring of the lines between that looser definition of violence and the one that is aimed at actual people,"" Peisner wrote.

Peisner faced further backlash upon the discovery of his previous support for Teran.

""Not sure why @CNN would accept commentary from a ‘journalist’ whose social media @DavidPeisner is filled with support for the domestic terrorist gunman who tried to kill a Georgia state trooper. In addition, he knew him personally & is helping raise cash for the gunman's family,"" journalist Andy Ngo reported.

"‘Harry Potter’ actress defends JK Rowling’s views, warns about cancel culture: ‘Next step is violence’","""Harry Potter"" actress Evanna Lynch condemned cancel culture and defended J.K. Rowling’s political views during a recent interview with U.K. outlet, The Telegraph.

Lynch, who played character Luna Lovegood in several of the films in Rowling’s wizarding universe, spoke to the outlet about politics, including her perspective on the dangers of cancel culture and offered a defense of Rowling’s controversial views.

Lynch explained that she grew up near the border of Northern Ireland, an area heavily shaped by the conflict that occurred during the latter half of the 20th century. The actress noted that a recent experience learning about a cast mates’ different views on the ""Troubles"" –as those in the U.K. refer to the conflict – helped her to realize the true nature of cancel culture.

‘HARRY POTTER’ STAR TOM FELTON SUPPORTS J.K. ROWLING AS AUTHOR GETS CONTINUED CRITICISM FROM TRANS ACTIVISTS

She claimed that a similar kind of division that existed between those wanting Northern Ireland free and those wanting it to be with the U.K. is affecting society-at-large today.

She said, ""I’d had this nice chat with one of the cast – he was so friendly. And then when it got to his turn to share about himself, he said he was a unionist, Protestant, and that he would have seen some of the political figures on the republican side as the devil. I immediately had this sense of ‘Ahh! I thought you were one of us!’""

She added, ""I was sort of holding on to this righteous republican angle, but I live in London. I’m enjoying the benefits of the British Empire, I love my life here, so I think it was right that I’ve been challenged.""

Tying the experience to modern cancel culture, Lynch explained, ""During the height of the Troubles, the way of dealing with it was to kind of shut down people who disagree with you. And I do see a parallel in today’s whole cancel culture thing. I just don’t feel comfortable with this idea that if you don’t like what people are saying, you silence them.""

'HARRY POTTER' AUTHOR J.K. ROWLING ROASTED FOR SUPPORTING RESEARCHER WHO DEFENDED BIOLOGICAL SEX RECOGNITION

She then offered a chilling prediction of where cancel culture will go next, saying, ""I do think the next step is violence, really. I think it’s a similar mindset.""

The topic of cancel culture turned to talk of Rowling, who has been the victim of efforts to have her canceled for expressing that womanhood is tied to biological sex.

After ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe denounced Rowling, Lynch provided a somewhat more nuanced take on the author on social media, writing, ""I won’t be helping to marginalize trans women and men further. I think it’s irresponsible to discuss such a delicate topic over Twitter through fragmented thoughts and I wish Jo wouldn’t … That said, as a friend and admirer of Jo I can’t forget what a generous and loving person she is.""

The fact that Lynch maintained friendly feelings towards Rowling earned her backlash from activists determined to brand Rowling as a ""transphobe."" Meanwhile, the media had lumped her in with the actors admonishing the author. Lynch eventually deleted her Twitter account due to the social media fury over the Rowling tweets.

However, Lynch told The Telegraph that her past judgment of Rowling, though it was less condemning than her colleagues’ views, was still too one-sided.

She said, ""I was very naive when I was dragged into that conversation. I didn’t even know there were two sides. I had a view of, like, good and bad. I do have compassion for both sides of the argument. I know what it was like to be a teenager who hated my body so much I wanted to crawl out of my skin, so I have great compassion for trans people and I don’t want to add to their pain.""

Lynch defended Rowling’s views, saying, ""I do also think it’s important that JK Rowling has been amplifying the voices of detransitioners. I had this impulse to go, ‘Let’s all just stop talking about it’, and I think probably I’m a bit braver now about having uncomfortable conversations.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/harry-potter-actress-defends-jk-rowlings-views-warns-about-cancel-culture-next-step-violence,N/A
Media accused of downplaying violence again during Atlanta riots: 'It was a night of rage planned by Antifa',"Critics are outraged at some media commentators, accusing major outlets of downplaying violence in Atlanta after anti-police rioters set fire to a police car and smashed windows.

Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz joined ""The Faulkner Focus"" to discuss his reaction to one CNN guest who suggested ""violence"" may not accurately categorize the chaos that occurred over the weekend in Atlanta's streets.

""When they're throwing bricks and starting fires, and they are creating terrorism, essentially, which is what they're charged with there in that community, guess what? They're somebody's wife or somebody's husband, maybe a dad or a son or a daughter is going to have to go out there and protect the rest of the community to do it,"" Chaffetz told Harris Faulkner.

""So don't tell me that this is some innocent thing that… violence is the wrong word,"" he continued. ""Are you kidding? I'm glad they're prosecuting some of these people. They need to put some people in jail if they would do that in a strong way, if they're able to do that. Hopefully you can start to make a dent in this, but at least call it out. At least be one to say this is fundamentally wrong.""

David Peisner, a CNN guest, came under fire on Saturday for his remarks on the riots, suggesting the gravity of the act is much different than ""actual violence against humans.""

BOND GRANTED TO ‘COP CITY’ PROTESTERS CHARGED WITH DOMESTIC TERRORISM, REPORT SAYS

Six people were arrested in connection with the weekend's anti-police riots downtown, which evolved into mass chaos as businesses were trashed, and police officers were targeted.

The riots began over the death of 26-year-old Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who was killed by an officer last week after he allegedly shot an officer in the stomach and refused to comply with their requests.

Teran's death came as protesters lined the streets in what is referred to as ""Cop City"" to protest a new law enforcement training center. But after Teran's death, the chaos escalated.

Businesses were trashed, a police car was lit on fire, and windows were shattered as the city spiraled out of control.

ATLANTA TEENS DEAD AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA ARGUMENT LEADS TO SHOOTOUT: POLICE

""It doesn't have to be this way,"" Chaffetz said. ""You can protest. That's about as American as it gets, but when you start using violence, intimidation, and you start destroying things that are paid for by taxpayers, those the people need to be taken out, taken down, prosecuted and incarcerated.""

FOX Business host Dagen McDowell explained how the mischaracterization is actually ""insanity"" and an effort by the left to ""redefine"" the meaning of words.

""Highlighting the insanity is the leftist, fascist movement, the effort to control words is an effort to change their meaning,"" McDowell said during ""Outnumbered"" on Monday.

""So at every turn, you have to highlight what a guest on CNN says. And we also should point out it was CNN that had that banner in 2020 where a reporter in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was standing with a sit in front of a city on fire, and the banner said fiery but mostly peaceful protest, so they should know better.""

""And ABC has a tweet up,"" she continued. ""It says, ‘Six people arrested in Atlanta after a peaceful protest turned violent.’ No, it was a night of rage planned by Antifa, so don't call it peaceful protest. They know better. But this is an effort by the left to change the meaning of language.""

Mark Tepper, Strategic Wealth Partners CEO, accused the left of ""empowering"" the rioters, calling them out for the double standard during ""Outnumbered.""

""Democrats seem to be empowering these activist groups by giving them power so that they can go out and make their case,"" Tepper said Monday. ""But at the same point in time… they've got a lot of confusion over what is violent and what is not violent.""

""They continue to call these kinds of… protests, which I think are riots, they call these protests peaceful, but when you light someone's business on fire, when you light their car on fire, when you vandalize arson, all of these things are a full-on assault of people's personal belongings, their possessions, their businesses,"" he continued.

Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens (D) also rebuked those claiming that the anti-police riots were not violent, saying that the charges against the six protesters arrested will include ""domestic terrorism.""",https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-accused-downplaying-violence-atlanta-riots-night-rage-planned-antifa,N/A
"Media ignores violence in Seattle CHOP zone, 'pretends' it's only peaceful protests, says Dan Gainor","The mainstream media is ignoring the violence in Seattle’s police-free zone known as the ""Capitol Hill Organized Protest,"" or ""CHOP, ” Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center, told “Fox & Friends First” on Thursday.

Host Jillian Mele noted, citing research, that during prime time, CNN and MSNBC, “failed” to cover Seattle’s “CHOP” zone “after reporting it as peaceful protests for days.”

“They’re pretending that it’s peaceful,” Gainor said on Thursday. “One reporter even called it ‘chill.’”

“Meanwhile, they ignore the violence in a situation where it is supposed to be black lives mattering, they ignore that a young African-American was killed in the violence,” he continued. “The chief of police says that there’s rapes and robberies, and, meanwhile, the media are saying, ‘Oh it is cool.’”

Gainor pointed out “that’s standard media playbook, pretend the truth is not really happening.”

On Monday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced the city is moving to end the police-free zone following three shootings in the area since Saturday, one of which was fatal.

SEATTLE CHOP LEADERS URGE PROTESTERS TO GO HOME, THROW SUPPORT BEHIND BIDEN, DEMOCRATS

In a press conference alongside Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best, Durkan said officers would begin returning to the East Precinct, which police abandoned in early June following a week of clashes with protesters in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody.

Best said shootings, rape, assaults, burglary and property destruction have been reported in the days since her officers left the precinct building, KOMO News reported.

Gainor said the fact that the mainstream media is ignoring the violence is “flat out propaganda.”

“The networks want to relive the '60s and so anytime there’s leftist protests they want to really be out there on the firing line, waving the flags and protesting or rioting with the left. So, when it goes wrong, they are just completely unwilling to show it because they know it will make President Trump look good,” Gainor explained.

He added, “The press have to cover things in a more neutral way and they just refuse because they are in their election mode where anything that looks like it might aid Donald Trump won’t get covered.”

NYC parents pull kids from school over escalating violence among students: 'Very disturbing',"New York City parents expressed outrage Monday on ""Fox & Friends First"" after a series of escalating violent incidents among children at one middle school, saying administrators and city officials aren't doing enough to hold students accountable.

""Children are being pepper-sprayed, children are literally being beaten over the head and being videotaped at the same time and the Department of Education (DOE) does not have an answer for this,"" NYC parent Michael Duncan told co-host Todd Piro.

Duncan, who is also the founder of the Students Improvement Association, slammed one of the main middle schools in question, 75 Morton, as well the larger city school system for promoting and implementing ""restorative justice.""

The program focuses on mediation rather than punishment and urges offenders to accept responsibility and make restitution with victims of their own accord.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS CAUGHT MASKLESS DAYS AFTER DOUBLING DOWN ON MASK MANDATE FOR SCHOOLS

In New York City, some schools have implemented the program with the goal of mitigating discrepancies in school suspension rates based on race, gender, and disability. Most schools utilize punitive discipline systems, wherein you break a rule, and you are punished.

""Restorative justice enables the assailant and does not protect the victim, so expecting students to sit down with someone and listen to why that other student feels the need to attack them and assault them is unacceptable,"" said Mona Davids, a mother and member of the NYC School Safety Coalition.

Davids went on to say that a shortage of school safety agents and a hesitancy to enforce school suspensions has enabled students and caused violence to spiral ""out of control"" in NYC schools.

Meanwhile, a third parent, Olivia Ramos said she had requested a ""safety transfer"" and removed her son from 75 Morton after repeated instances of alleged physical and verbal abuse.

Ramos said her son experienced numerous forms of bullying, including verbal insults such as racist and misogynistic slurs, children punching and stomping on his feet, hitting him with a locker room door, and attempting to violently kick him in the groin. She also witnessed videos of students fighting each other on video in a Snapchat group dedicated to documenting brawls at the school.

""It was just very disturbing, it was really violent,"" said Ramos.

The NYC mother said she contacted the school repeatedly and was assured that action would be taken to hold the perpetrators accountable. Ramos claimed little action has been taken.

The DOE told the New York Post on Friday they would be placing additional aides, social workers, and other personnel at 75 Morton to address student safety concerns.

That same day, Principal Valerie Leak told parents in a note that ""while this is a tough moment for our community, know that we are Morton Strong and will get through this together.""

Rhode Island official shares 'extreme' view that using the wrong pronoun is an act of violence,"A Rhode Island elected official in a school district, who was previously accused of pushing a ""Marxist"" agenda, said that misgendering – using the wrong pronouns – was an act of ""violence"" and ""needs to be dealt with accordingly.""

Jennifer Lima is a school committee member for the North Kingstown school district and is involved in bringing ""antiracist"" policies into the district. In 2021, she faced a recall effort for pushing an alleged ""Marxist"" and pro-critical race theory agenda.

Lima is also involved in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the district.

On or about Nov. 12, Lima shared a post from an activist group which said that ""Purposefully misgendering students is an act of violence. Respond accordingly.""

RHODE ISLAND PARENTS ENRAGED AT SCHOOL BOARD FOR REMOVING HONORS CLASSES IN 'EQUITY OBSESSION'

Adding to this statement, Lima included the definition from the World Health Organization. She said, ""any act of violence in our schools which creates an unsafe environment (physically or emotionally by or for any member of the school community) needs to be dealt with accordingly.""

""I recognize that some may find the use of the word violence… extreme,"" Lima said.

Lima clarified in a statement to Fox News Digital that the post was speaking to ""psychological violence.""

""I also believe that purposely misgendering someone is an act of psychological violence when done deliberately and consistently and should be responded to accordingly."" She said appropriate responses included ""investigating and disciplining such occurrences in the same way as any other biased-based assault.""

Lima added, ""I absolutely believe in First Amendment speech protections, both as an elected official and an individual.""

""I do not believe that post suggests that using incorrect pronouns should be met with violence.""

Nicole Solas, a Senior Fellow with Independent Women's Forum, interpreted Lima's post differently, and accused Lima of trying to ""justify oppressive speech restrictions on vulnerable children.""

""If you believe you're under threat of violence then to ‘respond accordingly’ means you act in self-defense, which is a physical and often violent action taken to protect yourself,"" Solas, who is also from Rhode Island, said.

""Her public call for students to ‘respond accordingly’ to non-existent violence is her own tacit call to violence against those who oppose her radical ideology,"" Solas said.

""She creates a hostile, paranoid school environment where violence is now more likely to happen thanks to her hysterical message that danger lurks around every pronoun,"" Solas said.

""Children should not be casualties in her demented quest for gender ideology utopia in North Kingstown School District. She should resign for this irresponsible and disgraceful behavior before someone gets hurt.""

SEAN HANNITY: America is now suffering from a severe violence and murder crisis,"Fox News host Sean Hannity shed light on the spike in America's murder rate, arguing defunding and dismantling the police, releasing violent felons from prison and lax prosecutions are key factors.

SEAN HANNITY: We begin tonight with something really deadly serious. America is now suffering from what is a severe violence and murder crisis. Now, in fact, countrywide murder rate is now at the highest point in more than 20 years, and it's going higher, it seems, every day with another 4.3% increase in 2021 alone. Now, of course, you won't see any of these statistics on other networks because they hide. For example, in 2020, we had 574 riots and they refused to call riots, riots. We had thousands of injured cops, billions in property damage, and of course, we had dozens of dead Americans. But they weren't riots according to the left. You won't hear about it from Democrats. They love to politicize so-called gun violence only when it's politically convenient will they talk about it. And that's because these murders are devastating, and, by the way, often happening in Democratic run cities and towns because of Democratic policies and a Democratic narrative. Defunding, dismantling the police, vilifying the police, zero bail laws, releasing violent felons from prison, lax prosecution. And now, predictably, every night, city streets all around the country are lined with bodies. So the question is, how many more lives are Democrats willing to sacrifice for a narrative that is false? How long will they cling to, defund, dismantle the no bail laws?

…

For example, recently in New York City, the DEA dropped murder charges against the guy accused of stabbing a person to death over stolen shrimp and then immediately release this guy from prison. And now he's only being charged with first degree assault. Now, meanwhile, out in Los Angeles, it's not much better. The D.A. out there suspended a prosecutor for misgendering a child molester charged with murder who claims to now be a trans-woman. Why should that be a factor? If you commit murder, you should be charged with murder.",https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-america-now-suffering-severe-violence-murder-crisis,N/A
"Tyre Nichols protests: Cities, feds must have 'zero tolerance' for Antifa violence, former Detroit chief says","As the country gears up for potential violence in the wake of the Tyre Nichols incident in Memphis, one former police chief is speaking out, hoping to delineate true organic protesters from intentional, and often political, agitators.

Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Friday that in the wake of the police-involved killing of George Floyd, his city was one of few major cities that did not make headlines for protest-related violence, like Philadelphia, Portland, Washington and New York did.

Host Tucker Carlson asked how, given that observation, Memphis police officials should respond to any inorganic protest behavior of the sort.

""Zero tolerance,"" Craig said. ""Detroit was one of the few big cities that wasn't rioting. It wasn't burning. There were a few attacks on police officers, but we took a firm position: We don't tolerate violence.""

Craig criticized the Biden administration and Justice Department for what he called a weak stance toward Antifa in the wake of unrest following previous police-involved deaths.

""What is Biden's DOJ doing about Antifa? Absolutely nothing, and it's shameful,"" he said. ""Look, I get the [January 6] insurrection, but what are we doing about Antifa? They're threatening cities across this country, and then people, they lie and say things like, ‘Well, you know, it was peaceful protesting.'""

""It's not peaceful if you're looting, setting up autonomous zones, taking over police stations, attacking police officers. That's not peaceful, and so this madness needs to stop.""

Craig recounted how Biden once claimed proper police procedure for discharging a weapon at a threatening suspect is to ""shoot 'em in the leg"" instead of center mass.

""Are you kidding?"" Craig asked. ""When I last looked, Biden has never been a police officer. I've never been a president, but I do have a shred of common sense.""

Craig said anti-police activists like Antifa will use Nichols' death to demonize all police instead of focusing on the five now-former officers indicted in the case.

WaPo torched for 'nonsense' piece linking domestic violence to climate change,"The Washington Post took harsh criticism after a recent op-ed linked climate change to domestic violence. ""Outnumbered"" panelists sounded off on the liberal outlet’s ""nonsense"" conclusion, warning it diminishes the seriousness of abuse.

Terry McGovern, head of the Population and Family Health department at Columbia University, claimed in the op-ed that worsening climate conditions are to blame for increasing violence.

""Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration,"" McGovern wrote.

Martha MacCallum, anchor of ""The Story,"" noted that climate change is the top issue being discussed across the Americas, with former Pentagon officials even calling it a threat to national security.

LIBERAL MEDIA MADE SLEW OF DUBIOUS CLAIMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, YEAR-END REPORT FINDS

She said labeling issues as a result of climate change is a convenient way to bring people’s attention to the topic but argued it has unfortunate consequences for people who have been affected by real problems.

""It siphons off what their issue is, what they're suffering from,"" MacCallum said. She explained that increases in domestic violence are also seen during times of war or when people are suffering economically.

""It feels a bit disingenuous to say the least,"" she argued.

""Outnumbered"" co-host Emily Compagno argued the real cause of domestic violence is ineffective laws and enforcement, which receives less attention when the focus is on climate change.

""The travesty to me is that The Washington Post publishes this op ed, this nonsense, and takes that space away from actual arguments, from actual facts,"" she said.

"Democrats ignore threats against justices, churches, pregnancy centers and it's deeply disturbing","NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

It is hard to believe that only a month and a half has passed since the leak of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion for the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturning Roe v. Wade. With all the threats to Supreme Court justices, crisis pregnancy centers, and churches packed into the ensuing weeks, it feels like the operation of a years-long campaign of siege and bombardment by pro-Choice radicals who have gone largely unleashed.

Just days after the leak, the dark-money group ""Ruth Sent Us"" posted a map of the six Republican-appointed justices’ homes and offered to pay people to protest there. They urged protesters, ""Stand at or in a local Catholic Church"" on Mother’s Day and joined a broader, week-long ""Mother’s Day Strike"" with the stated mission: ""Break the economy. By abstaining from work, shopping, entertaining; and on the home front, running a household that would fall apart without your care.""

Another group, ShutDownDC, which conducts blockades of roads for a variety of left-wing causes, rallied their followers to the targeted justices’ homes as well as a blockade of the streets around the Court, with a ""jail support liaison"" on hand ""who can meet arrested folks"" upon their release. The Supreme Court Building now has eight-foot wire fencing around it for the first time in its history.

PRO-CHOICE PROTESTERS DESCEND ON CONEY BARRETT'S HOME WITH BLOOD AND DOLL PROPS

The demonstrations at the targeted justices’ private residences were inherently threatening, an attempt to pressure them into a judicial ruling that also happens to be illegal under 18 U.S.C. § 1507. But anyone expecting Attorney General Merrick Garland’s Justice Department to enforce the law would be mistaken. Contrast that with Garland’s focus on treating parents who are concerned about their children’s education like potential terrorists.

Perhaps this reflects that the White House has tacitly endorsed the protests. When asked about taking demonstrations to the homes of the justices and their families, White House press secretary Jen Psaki notoriously refused to object to it, let alone acknowledge its illegality. Psaki had once worked for the far-left dark-money group Demand Justice, which applauded the leak of the Dobbs opinion draft in the first place.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cheered on the protests, proclaiming that ""we have been moved by how so many have channeled their righteous anger into meaningful action: planning to march and mobilize to make their voices heard.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that he was comfortable with protests at the justices’ homes as long as they were peaceful.

RON JOHNSON RIPS MEDIA'S 'COMPLETE DOUBLE STANDARD' ON PROTESTS AT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES' HOMES

He added, ""The American way to peacefully protest is OK,"" and then joked as a call came to his cell phone from his wife, ""Maybe there’s a protest outside."" Schumer might have better appreciated the problem if he were sitting on the bench making judicial decisions instead of occupying elective office.

Who can be surprised that the protests against the justices have escalated? Ruth Sent Us targeted Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s church along with the school attended by her children.

The justices apparently now need armed guards just to go to church on Sunday. And on June 8, a man armed with weapons and burglary tools was arrested near the home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and charged with attempted murder.

SEN. KENNEDY RIPS 'WOKE' LEFT FOR INTIMIDATING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: 'WHAT YOU ALLOW IS WHAT WILL CONTINUE'

That evening, Ruth Sent Us still went ahead with its protest at the justice’s home. Protests at the justices’ homes continue on an almost nightly basis.

There is even more to this dark chapter of history. Since early May, dozens of crisis pregnancy centers and Catholic churches have been vandalized, often with the perpetrators scrawling threatening messages to the buildings’ occupants. Several of the crisis pregnancy centers were firebombed.

A number of those attacks appear linked to an extremist group called ""Jane’s Revenge,"" which has declared ""open season"" on pro-life pregnancy centers that refuse to shut down. Not only are such acts breaches of state laws against arson and other destruction of property. They also violate the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which covers facilities that provide reproductive health services as well as places of worship.

FOX NEWS POLL: MAJORITY DISLIKES PROTESTS OUTSIDE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES' HOMES

Sadly, we cannot expect much from this Justice Department, with a Civil Rights Division overseen by Kristen Clarke. Clarke has not hesitated to charge people with blocking the entrance of an abortion clinic. What about outright destruction of crisis pregnancy centers? Clarke has a history of calling such facilities ""harmful"" and ""predatory"" and using the hashtag ""ExposeFakeClinics.""

The Justice Department’s failure to act now may incur the gravest consequences. There is no reason to believe the violence is over. Jane’s Revenge has announced a ""Night of Rage,"" telling people to go out at 8 p.m. on the day the Dobbs decision comes out and to express their fury ""physically.""

If the last month and a half’s insanity and rank criminality feels like a years-long phenomenon, that is perhaps because in many ways it is. As I recently wrote here, unprecedented political attacks on the Court from the pro-Roe left go back 35 years, to the Robert Bork nomination.

And a benchmark in bringing us to the dangerous place we find ourselves today is undoubtedly Senator Schumer thundering in front of the Supreme Court in 2020, on the day of oral argument in another abortion case, ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch! I want to tell you, Kavanaugh! You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price! You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

Left’s political violence tied to dangerous Democrat rhetoric,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

This week, a man from California was arrested outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home and charged with attempted murder. He had a gun, a knife, pepper spray, and tools to break into the home — he freely admitted that he was there to kill Kavanaugh. Thanks to brave police officers, the threat was taken care of. But the situation never should have happened in the first place. Unfortunately, this attempted assassination can be traced directly to a longstanding pattern of violent rhetoric from Democrat officials.

Think back to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s incendiary comments about the Supreme Court in 2020. Speaking to a crowd of enraged activists, Schumer poured gasoline on the fire, shouting that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would ""pay the price"" for refusing to rule the way liberals wanted. ""You won’t know what hit you,"" Schumer raged, in a stunning example of a high-ranking political leader openly threatening members of another branch of government. Similarly, Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised left-wing activists for channeling ""their righteous anger into meaningful action."" Joe Biden condoned this rhetoric by refusing to condemn it, illustrating that he’s comfortable with calls to violence from his party’s leadership.

This week, a deranged left-winger came dangerously close to following Schumer’s orders. And it comes in the wake of House Democrats refusing to pass legislation to expand security protection for Supreme Court justices and their families. They know that violence may continue to occur, but don’t want to take tangible steps to stop it. Why? Elected Democrats may not be committing violence themselves, but they are creating an environment that makes it likely to occur.

This is a widespread pattern. Just a few weeks ago, when asked if he condoned protests at the homes of justices, Schumer answered ""yes."" When asked a similar question, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn the threatening protests, saying ""I know that there’s an outrage right now."" She was speaking for Joe Biden and refusing to defuse an obviously dangerous situation. Pelosi also dodged the question and refused to condemn the protests – but then again, this is the same person who suggested there should be ""uprisings all over the country"" in 2018 because she disagreed with President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.

PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTER CEO SLAMS DEM SILENCE AFTER ALLEGED FIREBOMBING, CALLS IT A 'HATE CRIME'

It’s stunning to write this, but let’s be very clear: showing up at someone’s private residence to harass and intimidate them into carrying out your political agenda is unacceptable. Violent rioting is unacceptable. Political violence is unacceptable.

Democrats’ comfort with violent rhetoric and conduct should disappoint you, but it shouldn’t surprise you. Think back further. Remember in 2019 when Rep. Maxine Waters instructed a crowd of angry activists to harass members of the Trump administration if they saw them in person? How about when a crowd of protestors attacked Senator Rand Paul and his wife as he walked the streets of Washington, DC in 2020? Or in 2017, when a Bernie Sanders devotee shot and almost killed Rep. Steve Scalise – along with four others – having been driven to commit unspeakable violence by angry, divisive far-left propaganda?

Violence spiked in our failing schools thanks to these policies,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Democrats are failing to educate our kids, and now they are putting their lives in danger, too.

As blue state and city legislators around the nation race to pass laws that lessen penalties faced by young people for committing criminal acts, they should beware of the surging violence in and around schools that has followed New York’s passage in 2017 of the Raise the Age Act.

New York’s deadly legislation raised the age of criminal responsibility to 18 years old; a sixteen or seventeen-year old offender would no longer be prosecuted as an adult, but rather referred to Family Court or to judges with ""special training"", as the New York City Office of Criminal Justice explains.

The change was meant to promote ""fairness""; ""Justice outcomes for 16- and 17-year-olds should improve following the implementation of Raise the Age, not worsen,"" declares the mayor’s office website.

That has not been the case. Raise the Age has led to more, not less, teen violence. That is the view of New York City Mayor Adams and also of New York’s Criminal Justice Agency. Not only have arrests of 15 and 16-year olds soared, but so has recidivism. Why? Because young criminals face minimal punishment, and so are more likely to misbehave again.

CHICAGO DEMOCRAT SOUNDS ALARM AS 55 SCHOOLS REPORT NO PROFICIENCY IN MATH OR READING

Criminal gangs took swift advantage of the new law, recruiting teens to help carry out their dirty work. If a kid is caught holding the gun used in a robbery, no one goes to jail.

So far this school year, three young people have died and at least 18 others have been shot or stabbed in gang-related incidents in and around city schools, an exponential rise from last year.

It’s not just at school that this mayhem is occurring. According to one police source quoted by the New York Post, ""some 10 percent of shooting victims in the city are now juveniles… and the number of gun arrests among those 18 and under has jumped to 448 in 2022, a 64 percent increase from 2017.""

The District Attorney of Staten Island recently blamed the ""chaos"" on ""bad laws and young people who are disconnected from responsible behavior."" Bingo.

New York is not unique. In Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts and many other states, legislators have moved to lessen penalties imposed on juvenile offenders, even as crime surges. In Chicago, in 2022, school violence rose and more than 60 school-aged children were fatally shot, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Illinois passed Raised the Age legislation in 2014; some violent offenses were omitted from the legislation, but the overall fallout was to restrict penalties for young criminals.

In Washington, D.C. authorities are poised to enact laws which would make it tougher to prosecute youths as adults, no matter the crime. Local cops, dealing with an explosion of gun violence, including 16 murders carried out by juveniles, oppose the proposed changes, for good reason.

It used to be that schools were ""safe spaces"" for children; these days, kids have no safe spaces.

A decades-long drop in juvenile crime reversed in 2020. As reported in the Wall Street Journal, ""In the U.S., homicides committed by juveniles acting alone rose 30 percent in 2020 from a year earlier, while those committed by multiple juveniles increased 66 percent. The number of killings committed by children under 14 was the highest in two decades...""

School groups and local officials were quick to blame the disruptions caused by COVID-19, but the increase in youth crime has continued even as the pandemic has abated. Another answer is that fewer cities and states are holding teens accountable for breaking the law.

That means schools are more dangerous. They are also inexcusably inadequate, penalizing, in particular, black and brown kids that fail to learn the tools necessary for them to climb the ladder of opportunity.

The recent headlines about Baltimore, where in 23 schools (including 10 high schools) not one child tested proficient in math, are disgusting but not shocking. I wrote a column in 2019 citing similar statistics about Maryland’s biggest city. Nobody cared. Nothing changed.

In 2021, parents in Queens, a minority neighborhood, protested: ""There are a lot of black middle-class homeowners here,"" said local activist Michael Duncan. ""These are successful people, successful families. The results in our schools are not reflective of the community. Something is wrong here.""

Something indeed is wrong, and it is not just in Baltimore and New York. American public education, for which taxpayers pay more per student than almost any other country, has suffered a steady decline for decades. The latest PISA tests (Program for International Student Assessment) which evaluate 15-year-old students globally, ranked the U.S. 30th in math; combined scores for reading, math and science put the U.S. 25th, behind Slovenia and Poland. China ranked number one.

"Yes, Super Bowl Sunday is a crisis for domestic violence -- just like every other day","You’ve probably heard it said that domestic violence spikes on Super Bowl Sunday. It’s the kind of sad statement that just sounds true. It’s a day of heavy drinking and machismo, and by the end of the day, half the people watching aren’t happy.

If you look at the research, though, you won’t find any data to suggest a Super Bowl spike. It’s a debunked myth that nevertheless persists. What the research shows is that the reality is even worse: Domestic violence is a crisis for millions every single day. Every minute, 20 people are victims of intimate partner violence. Every day, three women die from it. In their lifetimes, one out of every four women in the United States will be victims of physical violence by an intimate partner.

Here’s another horrifying truth: Even though we know that legal help is crucial for survivors to escape dangerous partners, gain independence, and rebuild their lives, you’re more likely to get a lawyer if you’re the abuser than if you’re the survivor of abuse. In the U.S., abusers have the right to a lawyer to defend against criminal prosecution, while survivors are often on their own to secure a protective order from an abuser or full custody of their children—matters handled in civil court. That’s because, in civil cases, there is no constitutional right to an attorney if you can’t afford one.

If we’re serious about fighting our domestic violence crisis, one solution is clear: We must invest in civil legal aid organizations to give all survivors the legal help they need to end the vicious cycle of abuse. Research shows that providing legal assistance to survivors dramatically reduces domestic violence—by as much as 21 percent, according to one study.

Last year, Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid helped a woman named Julie escape her husband’s abusive hold over her and her child by securing a name change for them and protecting Julie from her husband’s vindictive lawsuits against her. Half of all domestic violence survivors who got help through Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid’s program successfully left their abusers within one year.

But right now, we’re failing to invest in the one solution we know works. We simply don’t put enough resources into civil legal aid to support all survivors. Only 11 percent of domestic violence programs have the resources to offer legal representation to survivors, according to a recent survey by the National Network to End Domestic Violence.

Whether you’re rooting for the Panthers or the Broncos, we can all agree that millions of women shouldn’t have to face violence in their own homes—on Sunday or any other day of the year.

We can help put a stop to this crisis by increasing our investment in civil legal aid, so survivors can get the legal help they need to build a new life for themselves and their children.",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/yes-super-bowl-sunday-is-a-crisis-for-domestic-violence-just-like-every-other-day,N/A

Appeals court rules government can’t stop people with domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns,"People with domestic violence restraining orders have a constitutional right to own firearms, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.

The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals ruled Thursday that banning people under domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms ""embodies salutary policy goals meant to protect vulnerable people in our society.""

Police in Texas found a rifle and a pistol at the home of a man who was the subject of a civil protective order that banned him from harassing, stalking or threatening his ex-girlfriend and their child. The order also banned him from having guns.

A federal grand jury indicted the man, who pled guilty. He later challenged his indictment, arguing the law that prevented him from owning a gun was unconstitutional. At first, a federal appeals court ruled against him, saying that it was more important for society to keep guns out of the hands of people accused of domestic violence than it was to protect a person's individual right to own a gun.

OMAHA TARGET SHOOTING SUSPECT SEEN ON CAMERA WIELDING AR-15 STYLE RIFLE POLICE SAY HE PURCHASED 4 DAYS BEFORE

Bruen, set new standards for interpreting the Second Amendment by saying the government had to justify gun control laws by showing they are ""consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.""

The appeals court withdrew its original decision and on Thursday decided to vacate the man's conviction and ruled the federal law banning people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns was unconstitutional.

The decision came from a three-judge panel consisting of Judges Cory Wilson, James Ho and Edith Jones. Wilson and Ho were nominated by former Republican President Donald Trump, while Jones was nominated by former Republican President Ronald Reagan.

Following the decision, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department ""will seek further review of the Fifth Circuit's contrary decision.""

Among those critical of the judges was California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who suggested the judge’s ruling gives ""domestic abusers the right to carry firearms.

""These awards will support the kinds of crisis intervention programs that we know save lives and help protect children, families, and communities across the country from senseless acts of gun violence,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said.

Biden on Thursday also said that not all Republicans, ""not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans."" But, he said, the GOP overall is ""dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trum p and the MAGA Republicans.""

And the president returned to those attacks in Wisconsin again Monday, with a more specific target: vulnerable Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

In scathing remarks Biden labeled Johnson as one of the ""MAGA Republicans, the far right, the Trumpies,"" tying him to some Republicans' false claims the 2020 election was stolen and to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

""Extreme MAGA Republicans don't just threaten our personal rights and our economic security. They embrace political violence,"" Biden said.

""Sen. Johnson said it was a by and large a peaceful protest,"" Biden added of Jan. 6. ""Have you seen the video of what happened that day? Listened to the stories of the members from both parties of Congress and the jeopardy they were put in? Cops attacked and assaulted, speared with flag poles, sprayed with mace, stomped down, dragged, brutalized.""

Biden also attacked Johnson over a plan from National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott, R-Fla., which would sunset federal legislation after five years. The president said that would put programs like Medicare and Social Security at risk, and he accused Johnson of wanting to ""savage"" those programs.

""Read the Republican campaign plan, the Senate campaign they put out this year. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida heads up that committee,"" the president said. ""They want to require Congress to vote on the future of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid every five years.""

Biden's barbs come as Democrats believe their road to success in the midterms involves a dual emphasis on social issues, including red states' abortion laws and voters' revulsion to former President Donald Trump.

""MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,"" Biden said in his Thursday address, referencing Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. ""Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.""

Republicans, meanwhile, say soaring inflation and the economy are the key midterm issues. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., attacked Democrats on a litany of issues, including inflation, in an address ahead of Biden's Thursday speech.

"Biden condemns Antifa, violence 'across the board' amid riots","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he condemns violence ""across the board,"" including from Antifa, when he was asked about it during a local TV interview Monday.

""I've condemned it across the board,"" Biden told Pennsylvania's WGAL News 8 in an interview Monday, referring to violence during protests. ""The president still hasn't condemned the far-right folks coming out and protesting and using violence.""

BIDEN CONDEMNS RIOTING, BLASTS TRUMP'S RESPONSE IN FIERY POST-CONVENTION SPEECH

""Do you condemn Antifa?"" reporter Barbara Barr asked Biden.

""Yes, I do, violence no matter who it is,"" he replied.

The Trump campaign has called the former vice president out for not mentioning the anarchist group by name. Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders responded to those accusations during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" this week.

""The vice president has been very clear: he condemns all forms of violence,"" Sanders said. ""And, frankly, what you heard him say in the speech that he gave last week was: it doesn't matter what political party you belong to -- it doesn’t matter what your political beliefs are. Violence is wrong. And in the moment he is calling for calm.""

The Trump campaign went after Biden in August after the former vice president condemned violent protests but did not specifically call out Antifa by name in a speech in Pittsburgh.

Biden said most demonstrators are “peaceful protesters” who don’t require a response from the federal government. “Arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted,” Biden said, and “local law enforcement can do that.”

Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said that ""as predicted, Joe Biden today failed to condemn the left-wing mobs burning, looting, and terrorizing American cities. He failed to condemn Antifa. He failed to condemn people who called the police a 'cancer' or people on his campaign staff who called them 'pigs.'""

The nationwide unrest was sparked by the late May death of George Floyd while in the custody of police in Minnesota. Trump, who has denounced protesters as “thugs” while sharply defending the police, has throughout the summer cast American cities under liberal leadership as under siege by violent and lawless anarchy. While many of the demonstrations have been peaceful, rioting and looting has broken out in multiple cities.

"Biden’s condemnation of riot violence ‘too late,’ Trump says; what the record shows on Dem's response","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden this week issued a condemnation of riots in Kenosha, Wis. -- one of just a handful of occasions he's spoken out against the violence plaguing American cities for months, and a response that Republicans argue comes too late.

""Needless violence won’t heal us,"" Biden tweeted on Wednesday in response to the riots that erupted over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. ""We need to end the violence -- and peacefully come together to demand justice.""

BIDEN: TRUMP 'ROOTING FOR MORE VIOLENCE, NOT LESS'

In an interview with MSNBC Thursday, Biden said again that ""I condemn violence in any form, whether it's looting or whatever it is.""

But Republicans openly questioned the sincerity of the message, as their convention showed the party framing the election not just as a choice between President Trump and the ""radical left"" but as one between ""security"" and ""mayhem.""

Trump, in his GOP nomination address Thursday night, alleged Biden and his allies were “completely silent” on the riots – noting the issue was glossed over at their own convention a week earlier – and are only starting to mention it now for political reasons.

“It is too late, Joe,” Trump declared.

“Joe Biden’s lengthy delay in condemning the leftist mob in response to the rioting that is ravaging America’s communities is more proof he is beholden to the radical left,” Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News.

Protests initially broke out in cities across the country in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody at the end of May. While many daytime protests against racism and police brutality were peaceful, they escalated into violence and riots in cities including Minneapolis, where Floyd died, as well as New York, Chicago and elsewhere, often after dark, and sometimes involving different groups of demonstrators with different goals.

On May 31, Biden released a statement in which he said that “every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd.

“Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not,” he said.

BIDEN SAYS 'NEEDLESS VIOLENCE WON'T HEAL US' AFTER BLAKE SHOOTING

Days later he delivered a speech from Philadelphia, in which he described Floyd’s death as a “wake-up call” to the U.S. During that lengthy speech, he briefly touched on the rioting -- as he also grouped it in with “violence” by the police and Trump administration.

“There is no place for violence. No place for looting or destroying property or burning churches, or destroying businesses -- many of them built by people of color who for the first time were beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families,” he said. ""Nor is it acceptable for our police -- sworn to protect and serve all people -- to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.”

“We need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protest -- and opportunistic violent destruction,” he said. “And we must be vigilant about the violence that's being done by the incumbent president to our democracy and to the pursuit of justice.”

In that speech, and elsewhere, Biden spent considerably more time attacking police brutality and the response of the Trump administration -- particularly in Washington, D.C., where protesters were pushed back and sprayed with a tear gas-like irritant ahead of what critics said was a photo opportunity by President Trump at St. John’s Church.

Over the summer, as riots raged on near the Hatfield Courthouse in Portland, and the Trump administration sent law enforcement to deal with the unrest, much of Biden’s attention would focus on that instead, accusing the feds of attacking “peaceful protesters” -- with little mention of the riots that had triggered a federal response in the first place.

On July 21, Biden released a statement in which he accused Trump of ""egregious tactics"" and federal agents in Portland of “brutally attacking peaceful protestors, including a U.S. Navy veteran.”

""The Obama-Biden administration protected federal property across the country without resorting to these egregious tactics — and without trying to stoke the fires of division in this country,” he said.

The contrast with Trump, who along with his administration was highlighting violence in the city and elsewhere on a near-daily basis, was stark.

This week, when riots erupted after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., Biden’s initial response was to call for an investigation and for the police officers to be held “accountable.” He also talked about the need to “dismantle systemic racism.""

However, it was not until Wednesday that Biden himself condemned the violence that followed -- a day after his campaign had released a similar statement. A video statement begins with outrage about Blake's shooting. He then says that “protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary but burning down buildings is not protest -- it’s needless violence.”

“Violence that endangers lives. Violence that guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community,” he said. “That’s wrong.”

For their part, Democrats say Trump is using ""fear"" to boost his own reelection, while long accusing the president of doing little to address systemic racism and of even aligning with racists and white supremacists.

In reaction to Thursday's address, Biden aides and allies claimed that Trump glossed over racial injustice issues and reminded that the unrest is happening on his watch.

""Donald Trump just delivered a dark, angry speech to wrap up a dark, angry Republican Convention. As I’ve said many times, this campaign is a battle for the soul of America,"" Biden said in a fundraising message after the close of the GOP convention.

On Thursday, in the interview with MSNBC, Biden accused Trump of ""pouring fuel on the fire.""

Biden says ‘needless violence won’t heal us’ after Blake shooting,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in Kenosha, Wisconsin in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake Wednesday, saying “needless violence won’t heal us.”

The former vice president’s comments come amid days of unrest in Kenosha after 29-year-old Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot at close range by city police officers, leaving him partially paralyzed.

TRUMP SENDING FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, NATIONAL GUARD TO KENOSHA AFTER JACOB BLAKE SHOOTING

New footage emerged Tuesday of the moments before Blake was shot multiple times in the back by a White Wisconsin police officer, as Blake tried to get into his vehicle. The video reportedly captured Blake engaged in a struggle with at least two Kenosha police officers and shows an officer appearing to try to restrain him before he managed to get up and walked to the driver’s side door, the clip shows.

Viral video taken from another vantage point shows an officer fire several rounds into the apparently unarmed man’s back.

“What I saw in that video makes me sick,” Biden said. “Once again, a black man, Jacob Blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight with the whole world watching.”

Biden said he spoke with Blake’s family, and told them “justice must and will be done.”

“Put yourself in the shoes of every Black mother and Black father in this country and ask, is this what we want America to be? Is this the country we should be?” Biden said.

Biden recalled the unrest after the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd in police custody in May, and said at the time.

“Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary, but burning down communities is not protest,” he said about the unrest after Floyd's killing.

On Wednesday, he struck a similar tone.

“It is needless violence,” Biden said. “Violence that endangers lives and guts businesses and shutters businesses that serve the community. That's wrong.”

Biden said that the country needs to unite, heal, do justice, end violence and end systemic racism.

""Needless violence won’t heal us,"" Biden tweeted. ""We need to end the violence — and peacefully come together to demand justice.""

KENOSHA VIOLENCE: JUVENILE ARRESTED IN DEADLY SHOOTING AMID JACOB BLAKE UNREST, ILLINOIS POLICE SAY

Biden’s comments come after President Trump on Wednesday said he will send federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to restore “law and order” after days of unrest in the city.

“We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets,” the president tweeted Wednesday. “My team just got off the phone with Governor [Tony] Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance. (Portland should do the same!)”

The president said he will be sending federal law enforcement officers and the National Guard to Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, videos on social media showed a chaotic scene in Kenosha after nightfall Tuesday, as crowds seemed to chase a man carrying a rifle down the street, before eventually knocking him to the ground and trying to grab his weapon, Reuters reported. A bloodied man was seen with what appeared to be a serious arm wound. Another video showed a man with a head injury as crowds gathered around him to treat him.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, had called for calm earlier Tuesday, while also declaring a state of emergency under which he doubled the National Guard deployment in Kenosha from 125 to 250. The night before, crowds destroyed dozens of buildings and set more than 30 fires in the city’s downtown.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-needless-violence-wont-heal-us-after-blake-shooting,N/A
"China blames US gun policies for global violence, says America exports ‘woes and instability’","America’s ""loose management"" of firearms is creating a ""recurring nightmare"" of domestic gun violence that is now spilling into other countries as U.S.-made weapons and ammunition are increasingly finding their way into the wrong hands, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the ministry, lamented that at a United Nations meeting last week, the U.S. opposed a Chinese proposal to block transfers of ammunition to non-state actors. He then argued that America’s tolerance for guns is creating violence around the globe.

""Gun violence has become a recurring nightmare for the American people,"" Wang said. The U.S.’s loose management of small arms and light weapons and ammunition, massive weapons export and persistent transfer of military articles to non-state actors are equally worrying.""

CHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT TRAVELING TO MOSCOW AS US-CHINA TENSIONS BROIL

""A lot of the ammunition from the U.S. have become untraceable and even ended up in the hands of terrorist and extremist groups, posing a grave threat to regional and international peace and stability,"" he added.

Wang said gun violence is increasingly America’s main export to the world.

""The U.S. brings to other countries not democracy or progress of human rights but livelihood woes and instability,"" he said. ""The U.S. needs to know that the more it engages in such exports, the worse the backfire will be on the U.S. itself.""

CHINA FURIOUS AFTER US WARNS AGAINST ARMING RUSSIA: ‘THE US IS IN NO POSITION TO TELL CHINA WHAT TO DO'

Wang added that violent elements in Mexico, Pakistan and elsewhere have been ""found to use U.S. weapons"" and noted a Center for American Progress study said more than 50,000 guns originating in the U.S. were recovered in 15 criminal investigations between 2014 and 2016.

His remarks came several days after a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, at which China said it is worried that U.S. exports of arms to Ukraine are raising the risk of ""strategic miscalculation and escalation of hostilities"" because they might be misdirected to ""terrorists and armed groups.""

The U.S. rejected that assessment at the meeting and dismissed the ""victim-blaming notion that Ukraine’s self-defense is the obstacle to ending this war.""

US AIRPORT SECURITY INTERCEPTS RECORD 6,542 GUNS in 2022

"Climate activists embrace extreme tactics, violence as deadline to 'save the planet' draws near","Climate change activists in the U.S. and across the world are ramping up their actions in what they say is an attempt to save the planet.

In recent months, far-left activists have glued themselves to famous paintings, disrupted new pipeline construction, scaled buildings, blocked rush-hour traffic, lit themselves on fire, threatened to disrupt the Congressional Baseball Game and slashed tires of random sport utility vehicles (SUV) in cities around the world.

The activists have argued that world governments have failed citizens by not acting aggressively enough to enact policies curbing warming.

""We cannot continue to wait around for a bunch of corporate shills in Congress to do nothing while people are dying,"" Greenpeace USA senior climate campaigner Ashley Thomson said last week.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS KEEP PUSHING EXTREME MEASURES AMID GLOBAL ENERGY CRISIS

Greenpeace, one of the oldest environmental organizations of its kind in the world, and its international affiliates have staged multiple ""direct actions"" this year ranging from scaling a venue hosting a major conference in France to blocking a ship from departing a Dutch port to climbing a deep sea mining vessel in the North Sea. Such actions have seemingly become more common in the face of, what activists deem, an impending global disaster.

""Climate change is the only issue where, in the worst case, it really would affect the ability of our civilization to continue. The threat there is just much higher,"" climate activist Ken Ward told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""If you do a bad job on clean water, then you've got some polluted water — you can recoup that. With the worst case in climate change, that's not an option.""

""If you're on track to have the southern part of our nation unlivable and also dehydrated in 20 years or less, what do you do about that?"" Ward continued. ""If there was agreement that was a serious threat, then we would drop other things that we are doing and pay attention to that.""

DC-AREA CLIMATE PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN MARYLAND HIGHWAY; 14 ARRESTED

In October 2016, Ward closed the valve to a pipeline transporting crude oil from western Canada to Mount Vernon, Washington, as part of a coordinated action. That same day, fellow activists — who, along with Ward, were collectively known as the ""Valve Turners"" — shut off valves to similar pipelines in Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota.

Ward, who eventually pled guilty to trespassing following the incident, told Fox News Digital that such action is necessary if ""there's political gridlock and all the ordinary processes aren't working.""

Activists like Ward often cite United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and the so-called Climate Clock, an online tool developed in 2020 to highlight how long humanity has left to limit global warming, when highlighting the immediate need for action. Greenpeace, for example, said governments better act on climate change or they will be ""forced to do so"" following the latest IPCC report in April.

""For decades, fossil fuels corporations paid millions to confuse the public, contradict the science and falsely claim that climate change was a hoax,"" Climate Clock co-founder Gan Golan told Fox News Digital. ""That tactic isn’t working anymore because the results are plain for all of us to see. So, they have rolled out a new tactic: delay. Climate delay has become the new climate denial.""

""In a democracy, if citizens believe their leaders are putting corporate interests over their own lives, they’re going to exercise their first amendment rights,"" he added. ""Young people have been leading the way, and it’s time for everyone else who cares about their future to join them.""

UK CLIMATE PROTESTERS GLUE THEMSELVES TO CONSTABLE FRAME

The Climate Clock algorithm currently pegs the deadline for action limiting warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius at around July 2029. Friday marked the group's first ""Climate Emergency Day"" when the clock goes from seven years to six years.

""Because governments and politicians have failed to protect us from this danger, we must protect ourselves,"" says the website for the Tyre Extinguishers, a U.K. group whose members have deflated SUV tires in various cities in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

The Tyre Extinguishers have announced actions in New York City, San Francisco and Chicago in recent weeks and a spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital the group expects to ""expand massively"" in upcoming months.

CLIMATE ACTIVISTS EXPAND TIRE-SLASHING OPERATION BEYOND NYC. HERE ARE THE CITIES THEY'VE HIT

Just Stop Oil, another U.K.-based environmental action group, said that it was also planning further actions in light of government inaction. The group made headlines recently when its members glued themselves to famous paintings including a copy of The Last Supper at a museum in London.

""There are different kinds of actions that we're taking at the moment,"" a Just Stop Oil spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""We are basically calling for individuals and institutions to go into civil resistance against the U.K. government, stopping them from one of the biggest acts of criminality in this country's history, in terms of going ahead with fossil fuel, oil, gas, coal projects.""

""It's clear that new oil and gas is going to cause unimaginable suffering for the people of this country and, indeed, the people around the world who are suffering at the expense of climate change now,"" the Just Stop Oil spokesperson continued.

The spokesperson said the group was planning a campaign involving thousands of people for later in the year.

Activists have also repeatedly formed blockades on busy highways to call attention to climate change and urge elected officials to do more.

CLIMATE CHANGE 'DEADLINE' CROSSES OMINOUS THRESHOLD AS ACTIVISTS WARN WORLD IS NEARLY OUT OF TIME

""We have a brief and rapidly closing window to address the climate crisis,"" said a protester, who was part of a group calling upon President Biden to declare a climate emergency by blocking traffic on I-395 in Washington D.C. on April 14. ""The government isn’t listening.""

A man whose car was blocked during the April protest pleaded with the activists to let his car through, saying he had to travel to see his wife give birth. During a similar July 4 protest advocating for a climate emergency declaration, a driver begged activists blocking a Maryland highway to let him through since he was on parole and had to show up to work on time.

The White House said Tuesday that Biden is still considering declaring a climate emergency after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., effectively killed Democrats' hopes for sweeping climate legislation last week. However, Biden opted against making such a pronouncement this week, instead announcing a series of executive actions during a speech in Massachusetts on Wednesday.

Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the grassroots Sunrise Movement, said following the speech that Biden may forever be known as ""the president who condemned my generation to an unlivable world.""

""If we look at a world that has the number of people that we're going to see dying and the number of people who are going to be — population shifting around because parts of the world won't be livable anymore, we're just going to see a lot more wars and fighting and murder, because that will be what people think is an appropriate response to the collapse of the conditions that make their nation possible,"" Ward told Fox News Digital.

""So, I do think that opportunity to engage in this one tool of, not just direct action but also mass non-violent action as a means of change which we know is pretty effective — the window for doing something in that vein is getting shorter,"" he said.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-activists-embrace-extreme-tactics-violence-deadline-save-planet-draws-near,N/A

Anti-police protests broke out in Atlanta on Saturday resulting in explosions, damaged businesses and a burnt-out police vehicle. That evening, a CNN guest suggested property destruction didn't amount to violence.

""I would call that violence,"" another man in D.C., Severin, told Fox News. ""Violence doesn't have always to be physical. Violence can be loss of income, loss of money, loss of property to where people have to rebuild.""

Michael said: ""Property damage is violence. The only reason we will destroy the property is to try to lash out or rebel.""

An activist died in a gunfight last Wednesday after shooting a Georgia State Patrol trooper while protesting a new Atlanta police training facility, according to police.

"Democratic mayors under fire as crime, violence plagues Chicago, New York, Philadelphia","Democratic mayors are raising eyebrows with their responses to the rising crime plaguing major cities like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.

The U.S. murder rate rose 30% between 2019 and 2020, according to FBI data – the largest annual increase on record, with Chicago topping the list. At least 12 major cities, including New York, have already set historical murder records in 2021. Robberies and assaults are also on the rise, and retailers in major cities across the country are reporting an uptick in organized smash-and-grab crimes during the busy holiday shopping season.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot faced criticism last week after she responded to the recent flood of robberies in her city by blaming retailers for not better protecting their merchandise.

LEFT'S PHILOSOPHY ON CRIME IS ON FULL DISPLAY IN BLUE STATES AS DEMOCRATS PROMOTE 'CHAOS': PAVLICH

""We also got to push retailers,"" she said during a Dec. 6 event. ""I'm disappointed that they are not doing more to take safety and make it a priority. For example, we still have retailers that won't institute plans like having security officers in their stores, making sure that they've got cameras that are actually operational, locking up their merchandise at night. Chaining high-end bags, these purses seem to be something that is attracting a lot of attention on these organized retail theft units.""

Lightfoot's comments were blasted by retailers as misinformed.

In New York City, one of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s last acts as mayor before he hands over the reins to Mayor-elect Eric Adams is instituting a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses in the city, claiming it’s his ""job"" to ""protect"" New Yorkers.

The mandate gave businesses only three weeks to comply before it goes into effect on Dec. 27, just four days before de Blasio leaves office.

During an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday"" over the weekend, de Blasio defended the mandate and claimed the city is ""much safer"" now than it was when he took the reins eight years ago, despite the fact that murders in the city skyrocketed last year and have remained high so far in 2021.

""Eight years I’ve been mayor, index crimes, major crimes in New York City down 11% over eight years. And we did it bringing police and community closer together,"" the mayor said. ""The bottom line is that there is today in New York City, a much safer city than we were eight years ago.""

""I have confidence and the NYPD has confidence that we’re going to get back to the prepandemic levels soon, and then surpass, and become even safer,"" he added. ""And the statistics show it in most of the city; there are a few places where we’re struggling.""

BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING ON CRIME TANKS AMID RISE IN SMASH-AND-GRAB ROBBERIES

In Philadelphia, where police have reported a 13% increase in homicides compared to 2020, District Attorney Larry Krasner sparked a backlash this week after he claimed the city does not have a crime problem.

""We don’t have a crisis of lawlessness, we don’t have a crisis of crime, we don’t have a crisis of violence,"" the district attorney told reporters Monday. ""It’s important that we don’t let this become mushy and bleed into the notion that there is some kind of big spike in crime. There isn't. There is not a big spike in crime. … There is not a big spike in violent crime. Neither one of these things is true.""

Krasner later walked back his comments but fell short of making an apology or changing his remarks.

""I know that some inarticulate things I said earlier this week have offended people. The message conveyed through media sound bites is not at all what I meant,"" Krasner said Thursday. ""Complete answers based on data aimed at solutions to gun violence will be edited down to sound bites. It’s my job to make sure even those sound bites are careful. As someone whose strong support is owed in part to the fact that I don’t communicate or make decisions like a career politician, it is my obligation to do better.""

"Democrats largely silent on anti-police violence in Atlanta after night of chaos, smashed windows","Democrats have been noticeably silent on the anti-police violence that unraveled in Atlanta over the weekend after rioters set a police vehicle ablaze and smashed windows in response to the police-involved shooting of an armed activist days earlier.

Protesters had gathered Saturday in response to the death of 26-year-old Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who was killed by officers on Wednesday after he allegedly refused demands from authorities and shot a state trooper at the site of the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

The protests on Saturday began peacefully before spiraling into chaotic riots, resulting in at least six arrests.

Photos showed that the activists allegedly lit an Atlanta police vehicle on fire in addition to targeting the Atlanta Police Foundation building with rocks and fireworks.

Caution tape was also wrapped around several buildings, including a Wells Fargo location that suffered several broken windows, photos at the scene showed.

Fox News Digital reached out to multiple Democrats, many of whom had previously been vocal on defunding the police, about whether they condoned the violence and if these types of protests were considered a threat to democracy. However, inquiries sent to the White House, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Reps. Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, Summer Lee and Delia Ramirez went unreturned.

Georgia Democrats and Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon also did not return requests for comment.

However, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., released a statement Saturday evening, saying, ""Peaceful protest is a sacred Constitutional right but violence is unacceptable, cannot be permitted or tolerated, and must cease immediately.""

""Atlanta Police have arrested 6 people so far, some of whom were carrying explosives,"" Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Democrat, tweeted Saturday evening. ""These individuals meant violence and used the cover of peaceful protest to conceal their motives. Our law enforcement teams were prepared and resolved the situation swiftly.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, on Saturday slammed the destruction and said violence of any kind will not be tolerated.

"DHS bulletin warns of 'heightened threat environment,' violent months ahead","The Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin Tuesday warning of a ""heightened threat environment"" over the next several months as they monitor both risks of domestic terrorism and foreign adversaries looking to sow discord within the U.S. to promote acts of violence.

""The United States remains in a heightened threat environment, as noted in the previous Bulletin, and several recent attacks have highlighted the dynamic and complex nature of the threat environment,"" DHS said in a new bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System.

""In the coming months, we expect the threat environment to become more dynamic as several high-profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets,"" DHS said.

The bulletin listed potential targets to include ""public gatherings, faith-based institutions, schools, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, U.S. critical infrastructure, the media, and perceived ideological opponents.""

DHS CHIEF MAYORKAS APPROVES BORDER WALL PROJECT TO FILL GAPS, REPLACE GATES

""Threat actors have recently mobilized to violence due to factors such as personal grievances, reactions to current events, and adherence to violent extremist ideologies, including racially or ethnically motivated or anti-government/anti-authority violent extremism,"" DHS said.

The department stressed that ""foreign adversaries—including terrorist organizations and nation state adversaries—also remain intent on exploiting the threat environment to promote or inspire violence, sow discord, or undermine U.S. democratic institutions.""

""We continue to assess that the primary threat of mass casualty violence in the United States stems from lone offenders and small groups motivated by a range of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances,"" the bulletin said.

DHS pointed to several recent high-profile events including the mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where the suspect in the grocery store attack allegedly claimed that he was motivated by racist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. It also referred another May shooting attack in Laguna Woods, California, that targeted congregants of a church that serves the Taiwanese community.

The department said it is monitoring onling forums following the mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, that have been encouraging copycat attacks.

The bulletin noted how pro-al-Qa‘ida and ISIS users online have celebrated the April subway mass shooting in Brooklyn, New York, and the January hostage situation at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, carried out by a British national in an attempt to inspire U.S. based individuals to engage in violent activity.

The update from DHS Tuesday reiterated from its previous bulletin that individuals both for and against abortion online have advocated for violence against government, religious, and reproductive healthcare personnel, and facilities in response to the high-profile U.S. Supreme Court case.

""Chinese, Iranian, Russian, and other foreign malign influence actors have sought to contribute to U.S. internal discord and weaken its focus and position internationally,"" the DHS said. ""As the U.S. 2022 mid-term elections approach, malign foreign actors could bolster their messaging to sow discord and influence U.S. audiences in keeping with practices during previous election cycles.""

The bulletin noted how foreign actors have amplified narratives promoting societal division in the U.S., including since the onset of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-bulletin-heightened-threat-environment-violence,N/A
GOP renews push to arm federal judges amid rising threats of violence,"House Republicans are proposing a change to the law that would make it easier for federal judges to arm themselves as they enter and exit the courthouse, a change they say is needed because judges are seeing more threats to their safety.

Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., introduced the Firearm Lockbox Protection Act, which would allow judges who are licensed to carry a firearm in their state to securely store that firearm in the courthouse. It would set up a system that lets judges check these weapons into a secure facility as they arrive and check them out as they leave, which Cole said would help them defend themselves from threats.

FIREARM SALES EXPLODE AS OREGON AWAITS JUDGE'S DECISION ON GUN CONTROL LAW

""As federal judges have faced an increasing number of threats to their personal safety, the Firearm Lockbox Protection Act will make certain they can protect themselves if a physical threat or dangerous altercation were to occur,"" Cole told Fox News Digital. ""In fact, I first introduced this legislation at the request of a federal judge from my state, and I am proud to reintroduce it again at such a critical time.""

Cole’s bill was co-sponsored by a handful of other Republicans, and he is seeking wider support within the House.

ARMED SUSPECT ARRESTED NEAR JUSTICE KAVANAUGH'S HOME, CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER

""Often, federal judges are left in a vulnerable position while walking from their vehicles to the building,"" Cole told his House colleagues. ""Physical threats and altercations have cultivated a dangerous environment for judges commuting to the federal workplace.""

Cole chairs the House Rules Committee, which sets the terms of debate and voting on legislation — a position that could give him some leverage as he tries to advance the bill.

Cole’s bill was introduced in the context of growing calls to find better ways to protect judges from danger. In 2020, a gunman shot and killed the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas and wounded her husband in an attack that took place at their home.

NJ FEDERAL JUDGE ESTHER SALAS CONTINUES PUSH FOR MORE SECURITY AFTER ATTACK ON FAMILY

House votes to reauthorize Violence Against Women Act,"Coinciding with women's history month, the House passed legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and to remove the 1982 deadline for states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.

House Democratic women dressed in suffragette white to commemorate the occasion and to usher through what they say are landmark pieces of legislation to advance women's rights.

""It's wonderful to put our enthusiasm into action, into legislation to make a difference in the lives of the American people,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said at a news conference before the measures passed.

PELOSI JOINS BIDEN IN SAYING CUOMO SHOULD RESIGN IF ALLEGATIONS ARE PROVEN TRUE

But the female-focused legislation exposed stark differences between Democratic and Republican women who spoke out strongly on the House floor in opposition to the pair of bills designed to curb domestic violence and to support equal rights for women in the constitution.

The House has more GOP women than ever before at 30 members thanks to a history-making freshman class of conservative lawmakers, and several argued the Democrats' version of the Violence Against Women's Act bill was too partisan and ignored their concerns.

GOP LEADERSHIP URGING 'NO' VOTE ON DREAM ACT TO PROTECT YOUNG IMMIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION

""[Democrats] have denied new members opportunities to contribute to the bill, including a record number of new Republican women ... whose own lives and districts have been deeply affected by these issues,"" said Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who opposed the bill over new Second Amendment restrictions and more.

The House passed the extension to the Equal Rights Amendment deadline in a largely party-line vote of 222-204, with just four Republicans joining Democrats. House Democrats then ushered in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act Wednesday by a 244 to 172 vote, with the support of 29 Republicans.

President Biden introduced the original Violence Against Women Act in June 1990 when serving as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A subsequent version was eventually included in a sweeping crime bill that President Bill Clinton would sign into law four years later. Congress has reauthorized VAWA three times since.

The bill created the Office on Violence Against Women within the Justice Department, which has awarded more than $9 billion in grants to state and local governments, nonprofits and universities over the years. The grants fund crisis intervention programs, transitional housing and legal assistance to victims, among other programs. Supporters said the reauthorization would also boost spending for training law enforcement and the courts.

""This bill leaves no victim behind,"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.

NATIONAL GUARD, GUAM DELEGATE MARCH TO GREENE'S CAPITOL HILL OFFICE FOLLOWING CPAC COMMENT

But Republicans objected to new protections for transgendered individuals and a prohibition on people previously convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms, which the National Rifle Association opposes.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said the legislation violates religious liberty and promotes ""gender dysphoria.""

""This [legislation] is something that should protect women,"" Greene said. ""Unfortunately, the Violence Against Women Act has expanded its protection beyond women and girls into transgender or biological males who are calling them women. Democrats know this is a bad policy and agenda. They have to hide behind real abused women.""

Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., said Democrats turned the Violence Against Women Act into a ""highly partisan distortion"" of the original bill with their ""progressive wish list.""

""The bill extends the law’s protections to persons ‘of any gender,’ drives needed resources away from combatting crimes against women, promotes an unproven ‘restorative justice’ approach, and erodes religious liberties,"" said Fischbach, who led floor debate on the opposition.

The other measure the House approved Wednesday on the Equal Rights Amendment faced bitter opposition from conservatives, who say it could be used as a legal tool to fight state efforts to curb abortion.

"Will the issue of gun control, violence affect the 2022 midterm elections?","The discussion surrounding gun control in the United States is a core issue for some voters heading to the ballot box this November. At the center of this debate are various political and judicial interpretations regarding the Second Amendment's ""right to bear arms"" and whether legislation designed to curb mass shootings supersedes those constitutional guarantees.

Gun control generally refers to legislation seeking to provide greater restrictions on firearms, from the federal or state government, through background checks, firearm or bump stock bans, red flag laws, ammo limits, and waiting periods to purchase a firearm. In the upcoming midterm election, Republican candidates and incumbents are generally opponents of gun control measures, while Democrats typically support them.

Opponents of gun control laws believe the Second Amendment was designed to protect an individual's right to self-defense and, therefore, lawful gun ownership should not be limited. At the same time, proponents of gun control believe that the Second Amendment was written for organized militias and that in order to reduce gun violence, new limits must be put in place regarding the buying and selling of firearms.

Are any major candidates campaigning to repeal the Second Amendment?

Currently, no candidates from either political party in the battleground elections openly advocate for a full repeal of the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. However, some of the strongest supporters of strict gun control legislation are Democrats in the tightly contested elections that determine which party achieves a majority in the House or Senate as well as gubernatorial seats.

BLACK LA RESIDENTS LACK ACCESS TO GUNS AS WEALTHY RUSH TO BUY FIREARMS AMID CRIME WAVE: ACTIVISTS

Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is one of the most significant advocates of gun control in a battleground election against Republican Incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp. Abrams, a former delegate Georgia House of Representatives, is endorsed by Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona who was a victim of gun violence in January 2011 while serving in office. On her campaign website, Abrams advocates for universal background checks, prohibiting private sellers at gun shows from selling firearms without a federal background check, and requiring gun owners to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons in public.

Democratic Ohio Representative and senate candidate Tim Ryan is another major advocate of gun control running against Republican candidate JD Vance. In July 2022, The Human Rights Campaign endorsed Ryan in the election, citing ""his two bills to improve and expand background checks for gun purchases.""

Following the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 21 people, 19 of which were children, at Robb Elementary School shooting in May 2022, Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke renewed calls to ban ""assault weapons."" A day after the shooting, O'Rourke confronted his opponent, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, at a news conference, stating: ""This is on you… Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday,""

Is gun control a federal or state issue?

The debate surrounding gun control in the U.S. is happening at the federal and state level. Numerous states have gun control legislation that limits open carry, while other states, typically led by Republicans, have fewer gun control measures. However, at the national level, Democrats, alongside some Republicans, have passed significant gun control measures recently.

After the shooting in Uvalde, Texas, President Joe Biden signed into law the first major gun safety legislation passed by Congress in nearly three decades. The legislation provides incentives to states that choose to pass red flag laws, prevents individuals convicted of domestic abuse from owning a firearm, and expands background checks for individuals over 18 but under 21 trying to purchase a gun.

Which state has the strictest gun laws?

California is widely considered to have the strictest gun laws in the country, according to the Giffords Law Center. In the Golden State, you must be 21 years old to purchase a handgun, 18 to purchase a shotgun or rifle, and pass a background check, regardless of age or if it was purchased at a gun show. Moreover, California law makes it illegal for gun owners to have their firearms removed if they are facing domestic violence charges, or if an individual has a domestic abusive protective order filed against them.

Ammunition is also regulated in California after the passage of Proposition 63 by voters in 2016. California law requires individuals to acquire an ammunition vendor license in order to sell over 500 rounds of ammunition.

BEVERLY HILLS GUNS SEES BOOM IN BUSINESS AFTER FOLLOW-HOME MURDER

What does more strict gun control mean for gun owners?

Strict gun control measures for firearm owners can appear different depending on the state and the law. Typically, more restrictive states such as California may require gun owners to enact trigger locks or gun safes in their domicile where a firearm is present. Other states may require a license to carry a firearm in public or a background check to purchase a gun from a private seller.

Support for stricter gun laws has declined in recent years, according to the Pew Research Center. Approximately half of Americans, 53%, support strong gun laws, while 32% believe the laws are fine, and 14% believe laws should be less strict. In prior years, such as September 2019, roughly 60% of Americans reported they wanted stricter gun laws. The extensive poll and data released by the Pew Researcher Center came out in September 2021 before the Uvalde school shooting.

Has an amendment ever been repealed in history?

Only one amendment has ever been repealed in the history of the United States. The ratification of the Twenty-first on December 5, 1933, repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited the sale of alcohol. Any proposed amendment to the U.S. constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate. In addition, three fourths of the 50 states must then ratify the amendment.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/issue-gun-control-violence-affect-2022-midterm-elections,N/A
"Alleged Kavanaugh assassination attempt latest instance of violence, intimidation toward pro-lifers","An armed man who threatened to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was arrested outside the justice’s home in Maryland on Wednesday in the latest instance of violence and intimidation toward pro-lifers since the unprecedented Supreme Court draft opinion leak last month.

Nicholas John Roske, 26, of Simi Valley, California, was carrying a gun, ammunition, a knife, pepper spray, a screwdriver, zip ties, and other gear when he was arrested by Montgomery County Police Department officers in the early morning hours Wednesday, according to a criminal complaint.

Roske, who is charged with attempted murder of a federal judge, told police that he was upset about Kavanaugh’s positions on Roe v. Wade and the Second Amendment, the complaint said.

The arrest follows weeks of heated rhetoric from pro-choice advocates following the May 2 draft opinion leak that signaled the conservative majority Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Immediately after the leak, pro-choice protesters descended on the Supreme Court, Catholic churches, pro-life organizations, and the justices’ private residences.

AT LEAST 5 PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS VANDALIZED WITHIN A WEEK OF SCOTUS OPINION LEAK

Within a week of the leak, vandals targeted at least five pro-life, crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) across the country and at least one pro-life organization.

""More of this. May these people never know a moment of peace or safety until they rot in the ground,"" Caroline Reilly, a reporter for Rewire News Group, tweeted after vandals threw a Molotov cocktail into the headquarters of the Wisconsin pro-life organization Wisconsin Family Action.

Just Tuesday, another pro-life Christian pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, was allegedly targeted by vandals and lit on fire. Police in Amherst, New York, have since launched an investigation, treating the case as an act of arson.

After Roske’s arrest, the group Ruth Sent Us, a pro-abortion group that has coordinated many of the protests since the Supreme Court leak, vowed to protest again ""peacefully"" outside Kavanaugh’s home Wednesday night.

The group later shared a tweet containing Kavanaugh's home address.

Lawmakers Blast Administration For Calling Fort Hood Massacre 'Workplace Violence',"Sen. Susan Collins on Wednesday blasted the Defense Department for classifying the Fort Hood massacre as workplace violence and suggested political correctness is being placed above the security of the nation's Armed Forces at home.

During a joint session of the Senate and House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, the Maine Republican referenced a letter from the Defense Department depicting the Fort Hood shootings as workplace violence. She criticized the Obama administration for failing to identify the threat as radical Islam.

""The documents attached illustrate how the Department is dealing with the threat of violent Islamist extremism in the context of a broader threat of workplace violence,"" read the letter, which was obtained by Fox News.

Thirteen people were killed and dozens more wounded at Fort Hood in 2009, and the number of alleged plots targeting the military has grown significantly since then. Lawmakers said there have been 33 plots against the U.S. military since Sept. 11, 2001, and 70 percent of those threats have been since mid-2009. Major Nidal Hasan, a former Army psychiatrist, who is being held for the attacks, allegedly was inspired by radical U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in late September. The two men exchanged as many as 20 emails, according to U.S. officials, and Awlaki declared Hasan a hero.

The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Connecticut independent Sen. Joe Lieberman, said the military has become a ""direct target of violent Islamist extremism"" within the United States.

""The stark reality is that the American service member is increasingly in the terrorists' scope and not just overseas in a traditional war setting,"" Lieberman told Fox News before the start of Wednesday's hearing.

In June, two men allegedly plotted to attack a Seattle, Wash., military installation using guns and grenades. In July, Army Pvt. Naser Abdo was accused of planning a second attack on Fort Hood. And in November, New York police arrested Jose Pimentel, who alleged sought to kill service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

Both Pimentel and Abdo also allegedly drew inspiration from al-Awlaki and the online jihadist magazine Inspire, which includes a spread on how to ""Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.""

Rep. Peter King of New York, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said military service members are ""symbols of America's power, symbols of America's might.""

""And if they (military personnel) can be killed, then that is a great propaganda victory for al Qaeda,"" King told Fox News.

King said there is also evidence that extremists have joined the services.

""There is a serious threat within the military from people who have enlisted who are radical jihadists,"" King said. ""The Defense Department is very concerned about them. They feel they're a threat to the military both for what they can do within the military itself and also because of the weapons skills they acquire while they're in the military.""

The witnesses testifying before the joint session include Paul N. Stockton, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense; Jim Stuteville, U.S. Army senior adviser for counterintelligence operations and liaison to the FBI; Lt. Col. Reid L. Sawyer, director of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, and Darius Long, whose son, Army Pvt. William Andrew Long, was shot and killed at an Arkansas military recruitment center in 2009.

A second private was also injured in the Arkansas attack. Both victims had just finished basic training and had not been deployed. They were outside the Arkansas recruitment center when the shooter opened fire from a passing truck. The shooter, Carlos Bledsoe, pleaded guilty to the crime earlier this year.

In a letter to the court, Bledsoe said he carried out the attack on behalf of al Qaeda in Yemen -- the group that was behind the last two major plots targeting the U.S. airline industry.

""My faith in government is diminished. It invents euphemisms ... Little Rock is a drive by and Fort Hood is just workplace violence. The truth is denied,"" Long testified.

King said the web is the driver of the new digital jihad.

""It enables people -- rather than having to travel to Afghanistan to learn about jihad or to be trained, they can do it right over the Internet,"" he said. ""And this is a growing role.""

And while Awlaki and his colleague Samir Khan, who was behind the magazine Inspire, were killed in a CIA-led operation in September, King warned against overconfidence that al Qaeda in Yemen was done.

""This is a definite short-term victory for us. There's no doubt they are going to regroup, that there will be others who will be providing Internet data, inspiration to jihadists in this country, instructions on how to make bombs,"" he said.

While King was heavily criticized, in some quarters, for launching his hearings 10 months ago on homegrown terrorism, the congressman said the joint session shows the threat is legitimate, and recognized as such by other members of Congress.

""To me it's a validation of what I've been trying to do all year,"" King emphasized. ""There's a definite threat from Islamic radicalization in various parts of our society, including within the military, and we can't allow political correctness to keep us from exposing this threat for what it is.""

Major US cities brace for possible violence after Atlanta riots ahead of Tyre Nichols video,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency order Thursday ahead of potential protests in Atlanta over the weekend in an effort to prevent the unrest and chaos that occurred during last week's riots.

The order calls for 1,000 National Guard troops to be called up. It expires on Feb. 9.

""Georgians respect peaceful protests, but do not tolerate acts of violence against person or property,"" the order states.

ATLANTA ANTI-POLICE RIOTS HURT DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES, WORKERS' WALLETS, EMPLOYEES SAY

The order said the state of emergency was declared because of ""unlawful assemblage, violence, overt threats of violence, disruption of the peace and tranquility of this state and danger existing to persons and property.""

The move comes after demonstrators took to the streets in Atlanta last weekend to protest the death of 26-year-old environmental activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran. He was shot and killed by the Georgia State Patrol after authorities said Teran shot and wounded a state trooper who was trying to clear protesters from the construction site of a new public safety training center dubbed by activists as ""Cop City.""

That area is the planned site for the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center and has come under fierce opposition from demonstrators.

In Atlanta, some businesses were damaged as rioters threw rocks and bricks at windows. Masked activists dressed in all black threw rocks and lit fireworks in front of a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering large glass windows. Walls were also vandalized with anti-police graffiti as stunned tourists scattered.

Some of those arrested were found with explosives.

At least six people are charged with domestic terrorism related to the riots.

They were identified as Ivan Ferguson, 23, of Nevada, 20-year-old Graham Evatt of Decatur, Georgia, Nadja Geier, 24, of Nashville, Tennessee; Madeleine Feola, 22, of Spokane, Washington; Francis Carrol, 22, of Kennebunkport, Maine; and Emily Murphy, 37, of Grosse Isle, Michigan.

Meanwhile, police departments in major cities like Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, California and Washington, D.C., were preparing for possible unrest in anticipation of the Friday release of a video depicting a confrontation between five Memphis police officers and 29-year-old Tyre Nichols, who died three days later.

The Austin Police Department told Fox News Digital it was monitoring events in Memphis and its officers ""will be moving into tactical alert status beginning Friday morning."" A law enforcement source told Fox News Digital the Los Angeles Police Department has units on standby.

""The Metropolitan Police Department has been briefed from law enforcement partners regarding five officers who have been fired and charged in Memphis Tennessee.

Pro-life centers targeted by 70% of abortion-related violent threats since Dobbs decision: FBI,"Approximately 70% of abortion-related threats of violence in the US since the Dobbs decision have been against pro-life groups, according to the head of the FBI.

FBI Director Christopher Wray gave the statistic while speaking at a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee.

MAYORKAS MAINTAINS 'BORDER IS SECURE' DESPITE RECORD CROSSINGS; FBI SEES 'SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL THREATS'

Sen. Rick Scott of Florida questioned Wray during the hearing about recurring accusations that the FBI is not committing resources to combat an escalation in crimes committed against pregnancy centers, churches and other pro-life institutions.

""My view — plainly expressed to all of our people, including in the context of abortion-related violence — is that I don't care what side of the issue you're on, you don't get to engage in violence, and we are equal-opportunity when it comes to that,"" Wray replied to Scott.

FBI VOWS NOT TO USE PEGASUS SPYWARE AFTER GRILLING FROM CAPITOL HILL

The FBI director went on to address the rising rate of violent threats and attacks against pro-life groups — the most explicit confirmation of the trend from FBI leadership thus far.

""Now, we have quite a number of investigations — as we speak — into attacks or threats against pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations and other pro-life organizations,"" Wray continued. ""And you might be interested to know that since the Dobbs Act decision, probably in the neighborhood of 70% of our abortion-related violence cases or threats cases are cases of violence or threats against […] pro-life organizations. And we're going after that through our joint terrorism task forces, through our criminal authorities, FACE Act and things like that.""

""We have about 20 field offices involved in this. And so we take it very seriously. And again, I don't care you're motivated by pro-life views or pro-choice views. You don't get to use violence to express it,"" he added.

Scott, stating that he supported Wray's strong tone in explaining the situation, expressed confusion as to why the FBI has not been more vocal in its prosecution of those who threaten or attack pro-life organizations.

The senator stated that following the press and outside reporting, the public would be forgiven for thinking the FBI was more concerned about prosecuting pro-life advocates than those who threaten them.

""We don't have the time for me to tell how frustrated I sometimes get by some of the news reporting about our work and the misreporting of our work,"" Wray replied.

"Pro-life groups, churches see increased violence after Supreme Court abortion ruling","Churches and pro-life centers across the country are facing increased acts of violence, but messaging from the Biden administration and other officials isn't as strong as they would've hoped.

Sources tell Fox News the FBI has opened almost 200 threat assessments since the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked in early May.

The FBI acknowledged that a majority of the threats are against pro-life organizations. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also says it has recorded at least 45 incidents of violence at affiliated groups since the leak and fears more may be coming.

""I'm concerned that this is going to escalate, especially after that decision day when we had Maxine Waters, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others standing outside of the Supreme Court really egging on the most extreme elements of the pro-abortion movement,"" said Mallory Carroll, vice president of communications for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. ""We have seen this rise in vandalism and violence against pregnancy centers.""

POPE SAYS SOCIETY DOES NOT 'KNOW HOW TO LIVE' WITH THE RISING PROPORTION OF ELDERLY CITIZENS

The Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center in Lynchburg, Va., was vandalized with threatening graffiti messages from the group known as Jane's Revenge, which has also claimed credit for other acts of vandalism around the country. Similarly, Catholic churches are also on high alert after some have already been targets.

Billy Atwell, chief communications officer for the Diocese of Arlington, Va., said churches have been in constant communication with law enforcement to keep parishioners and their buildings safe.

""A lot of law enforcement did extra patrols to parishes, did extra assessments and so on to see we are in our best possible condition,"" Atwell said. ""And then, obviously, if we see something we reported to law enforcement immediately, and then they respond and help us.""

Parishioners at St. John Neumann Catholic Church in Reston, Va., about 30 minutes outside Washington, D.C., said they saw smoke near their church when they arrived for early mass last week. The building had also been vandalized with threatening messages. Fairfax County authorities are investigating.

Both groups said they would like to see stronger condemnation on the violence.

""There are times when it seems like some elected officials are a little quiet about acts of religious discrimination,"" Atwell said. ""And we would hope that everybody can appreciate that we live in a society where we're going to disagree on key moral issues, key political issues, but that everyone can agree violence is unacceptable. But we hope that all people can really appreciate the gravity of these situations.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking for a briefing about what the agency is doing to address the incidents. The Susan B. Anthony group also sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking if it is going to investigate these incidents but has not yet received a response.

Republicans to condemn pro-choice activist violence after Roe rollback with resolution,"A group of over 100 Republicans has co-sponsored a House resolution to condemn the violence, vandalism and intimidation by pro-choice groups following last year's unprecedented leak of the Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.

Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., joined by about 100 GOP co-sponsors, announced the resolution Tuesday morning. The congressman intends to bring the resolution to a vote on the floor Wednesday.

INTEL HEAD TURNER REQUESTS NATIONAL SECURITY 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT' AFTER CLASSIFIED DOCS FOUND AT BIDEN OFFICE

""Since there has been ZERO accountability for the leaked opinion and ensuing violence, we are making the position of Congress crystal clear: Violence, property damage, and threats MUST be condemned, and these clear violations of federal and state laws MUST be prosecuted,"" Johnson said in a statement on Twitter.

The legislation states that since the reversal of Roe there have been over 100 attacks by pro-choice groups on pro-life facilities, groups and churches.

In June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in their opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, ending the constitutional right to abortion and returning the right to ban, limit or allow abortion back to individual states.

Leading up to the overturn of Roe v. Wade, a Supreme Court draft opinion was leaked to Politico.

The origins of the leaked draft remain unknown.

Jane's Revenge, a left-wing pro-choice group, has claimed responsibility for more than 18 incidents of arson and vandalism since the draft opinion surfaced in May 2022. The attacks targeted crisis pregnancy centers and other faith-based organizations throughout the U.S.

The head of the FBI shared that since Roe was reversed, approximately 70% of abortion-related threats of violence were committed against pro-life groups, during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing in November 2022.

Though attacks against pro-choice groups persist, the number of attacks against pro-life groups appears to outsize the former significantly.

"Republicans, pro-lifers victimized by political violence since Biden called Trump supporters ‘threat’ to U.S.","Several instances of political violence, many with victims supporting conservative causes, have occurred since President Biden warned of the alleged threat that supporters of former President Trump pose to the country, including attacks on anti-abortion activists and political canvassers and the murder of an 18-year-old in North Dakota.

""Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,"" President Biden said during a September 1 speech in Philadelphia that earned widespread criticism from conservatives and even some on the left .

""They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country,"" Biden said of supporters of the MAGA agenda in his speech.

In the days leading up to the Philadelphia speech, Biden said that MAGA Republicans ""embrace political violence"" and their ""entire philosophy"" is ""almost like semi-fascism.""

HILLARY CLINTON PRAISES BIDEN'S 'MAGA REPUBLICANS' SPEECH AS ‘IMPORTANT SERVICE’ TO COUNTRY

In the weeks following those comments, several instances of political violence have taken place, including an elderly woman in her 80s being shot in Michigan as she canvassed in support of a right-to-life group last week.

Michigan State Police told Fox News Digital Saturday that the elderly woman was shot after a ""verbal altercation while she was passing out pamphlets.""

Another violent incident occurred last weekend in Texas when two volunteers on Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott’s re-election campaign were reportedly assaulted while knocking on doors in a Houston suburb.

BIDEN BELIEVES ‘EXTREME’ MAGA IDEOLOGY HAS ‘TAKEN OVER’ REPUBLICAN PARTY, JEAN-PIERRE SAYS

A suspect chased the two volunteers through a neighborhood in Humble, Texas, and ripped off the side-view mirrors of the car they were in while trying to pull them out of their vehicle.

""Political violence is never acceptable. Mark Miner, a spokesperson for Texans for Greg Abbott, said in a statement on Sunday. ""With just over a month until Election Day , the passion to win should never bubble over into something more dangerous. There is no place for this in Texas.""

Multiple reports of GOP offices being vandalized have also been reported this month, including the offices of the Larimer County Republican Party in Fort Collins, Colorado, and the Ottawa County Republican Party in Hudsonville, Michigan.

Weeks later, a Democratic office in Seminole County was also vandalized with the word ""Nazi"" written in graffiti .

Last week, WJBK-TV reported that a pregnancy center in Oakland County, Michigan was vandalized with the message ""'If abortion is not safe neither are you"" which represents the second time this year the building has been targeted with authorities investigating whether the leftist pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge is linked to the crimes.

Earlier this month, 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson was killed when a 41-year-old allegedly struck him with his vehicle and later told a 911 dispatcher that he believed Ellingson was part of a Republican ""extremist"" group that was coming after him.

Bates continued, ""Like he said in Philadelphia, ‘There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None. Ever.’ The President believes that leaders in both parties should uphold that same principle, including when violence and threats are targeted against women seeking health care, members of law enforcement like the Capitol Police and the FBI, or the previous Vice President.""

Schiff says Trump 'fanning the flames' of violence at protests following Portland shooting,"House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., blamed President Trump on Sunday for the clashes that have occurred between some of his supporters and protesters demonstrating against police brutality – saying the president is “willfully fanning the flames” of violence.

Schiff’s comments come less than 24 hours after one person was shot and killed in Portland, Ore., amid a series of altercations between a large caravan of Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters.

“The president is willfully fanning the flames of this fire,” Schiff said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “They believe this is helpful to him.”'

PORTLAND PROTESTERS STAGE SIT-IN AT MAYOR'S HOME -- AFTER HE AND TRUMP TRADE BARBS

Schiff added: “The president is only motivated by one thing: what is in it for him. He sees this violence and his ability to agitate more of it as useful to this campaign. What it does to the country, the loss of life, he doesn’t care.”'

Schiff, who was one of the lead Democrats in pursuing President Trumps’ removal from office during his impeachment trial earlier this year, has been one of the president’s most vocal critics and staunchest opponents over the last three and a half years.

Regarding Portland, it wasn’t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by counter-demonstrators in the city’s downtown.

Police said the caravan had left the area around 8:30 p.m., and officers heard gunshots at about 8:46 p.m., according to a statement. Officers arrived at the shooting scene “within a minute,” police said, but the man who was shot did not survive.

An Associated Press freelance photographer heard three gunshots and then observed police medics working on the body of the victim, who appeared to be a white man. The freelancer said the man was wearing a hat bearing the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with left-wing protesters in Portland in the past.

Police said the man was shot in the chest. He was not immediately identified. It’s unclear who shot him.

Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May.

Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the protesters and in his support of the caravan, tweeting on Sunday morning “GREAT PATRIOTS” alongside a video or the caravan.

“That is the sad and tragic truth about this and also of Trump’s presidency more generally,” Schiff said, adding that Trump “believes the violence helps him.”

"Stacey Abrams adviser said burning police car, smashing windows isn't 'violence' after anti-cop chaos","A top adviser for Stacey Abrams' voting rights nonprofit defended anti-cop activists who set a police car ablaze and smashed windows while protesting the death of an environmental activist this past weekend in Atlanta.

Marisa Pyle, a senior rapid response manager at Abrams' Fair Fight Action, who also worked as a senior manager for Abrams' One Georgia leadership committee during her most recent failed Georgia gubernatorial run, rushed to defend the anti-police protesters and the ensuing chaos.

""You cannot commit violence against a window or a car. Killing a human? Now that, that is violence,"" Pyle wrote on Twitter this past weekend. ""Shame on Atlanta's leaders who fall into the same tired path of protecting property while our people are murdered by their police.""

ATLANTA: PROTESTERS CALL FOR 'VIOLENCE' AGAINST POLICE AFTER SHOOTING LEAVES 1 DEAD, OFFICER INJURED

Pyle's tweet followed Saturday protests in Atlanta, which began peacefully but delved into riots that saw masked activists throw rocks and lit fireworks in front of a building that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation. The protesters shattered glass windows, lit a police car on fire, and vandalized walls with anti-police graffiti.

The police arrested six protesters and charged them with eight misdemeanor and felony charges, including domestic terrorism. Two suspects posted a $355,000 bond, while the four suspects were denied bond.

Activists were out to protest the death of Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, 26, who was killed by police last Wednesday after allegedly refusing demands and firing a gun at state troopers at the site of the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

Top House Dem addresses violence against police as nonbinary child pleads not guilty to assault on cops,"The second highest-ranking House Democrat, Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., condemned violence against police after her adult child was arraigned Monday for allegedly assaulting a Boston police officer and spraying the moniker ACAB, or ""All Cops Are B-------,"" on public property.

""I condemn violence against everyone, whether that is against police or against community members as a result of any person or government entity,"" Clark, the House Democratic whip, told reporters outside at an unrelated event in a Boston suburb Monday afternoon.

Her comments came after her child, Riley Dowell, 23, of Melrose, was arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on Monday on charges of assault and battery on a police officer, vandalizing property, tagging property, vandalizing a historic marker/monument, and resisting arrest.

HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER'S NON-BINARY CHILD ARRESTED IN ANTI-POLICE PROTEST HAD ‘CLIMATE CHANGE’ NIGHTMARES

""I am going to refer to my statements that I’ve already released on this,"" Clark added at the Watertown, Massachusetts event, where the congresswoman appeared with other state and local officials to announce a sizable federal grant for environmental efforts, including so-called ""tree trenches.""

""I love all my children and Riley dearly. But this is a difficult time in that cycle of joy and pain of being a parent,"" Clark added, according to The Herald. ""I have full trust in the legal system. This case is before it, and I have confidence that there will be an equitable and fair outcome.""

Prosecutors said Dowell flailed their arms and struck a police officer trying to arrest them for defacing a bandstand in Boston with anti-police slogans over the weekend. They also noted police allegedly found a spray paint can in their backpack and saw paint on their hands and jacket, The Associated Press reported.

Not guilty pleas were entered on Dowell’s behalf, and they were released on the $500 bail they posted after the Saturday arrest. Neither Dowell nor an attorney commented outside of court, according to the AP. Photos showed Dowell sitting in court next to father Rodney Dowell.

Dowell is due back in court on April 19.

Clark has spoken publicly previously about her concern for Dowell, who identifies as nonbinary, amid what the representative and mother decried as ""bigotry targeting transgender people.""

The House Democratic whip in December recalled Dowell ""waking up with nightmares"" over climate change.

The Herald reported that Dowell was identified in court documents with a given name, Jared.

After police officers eventually caught up with Nichols, officials said that another confrontation occurred.

""While attempting to take the suspect into custody, another confrontation occurred; however, the suspect was ultimately apprehended,"" MPD said. ""Afterward the suspect complained of having shortness of breath, at which point an ambulance was called to the scene.""

After the incident, Nichols was taken to St. Francis Hospital where he was described in critical condition and later died on Jan. 10, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said.

Hot under the collar: Study links climate change to rising tempers,"Feeling hot under the collar? It may not be all in your head.

A new study connects rising world temperatures with aggressive acts of violence and even war -- but experts in the causes of war gave the report a chilly reception.

For the paper, researchers analyzed 60 studies on historic empire collapses, recent wars, violent crime rates in the United States, lab simulations that tested police decisions on when to shoot and even cases where pitchers threw deliberately at batters in baseball. They found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather — very hot or dry — means more violence.

The authors say the results show strong evidence that climate can promote conflict.

[pullquote]

""When the weather gets bad we tend to be more willing to hurt other people,"" said economist Solomon Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley.

He is the lead author of the study, published online Thursday by the journal Science. Experts in the causes of war gave it a mixed reception.

Joshua Goldstein, a professor of international relations at American University and author of ""Winning the War on War,"" found faults with the way the study measured conflicts. He said the idea of connecting hotter tempers with hotter temperatures is only one factor in conflict, and that it runs counter to a long and large trend to less violence.

""To read this you get the impression, if climate change unfolds as we all fear it will, that the world will be beset by violent conflict and that's probably not true,"" Goldstein said.

In the paper, the team of economists came up with a formula that predicts how much the risk of different types of violence should increase with extreme weather. In war-torn parts of equatorial Africa, it says, every added degree Fahrenheit or so increases the chance of conflict between groups — rebellion, war, civil unrest — by 11 percent to 14 percent. For the United States, the formula says that for every increase of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, the likelihood of violent crime goes up 2 percent to 4 percent.

Temperatures in much of North America and Eurasia are likely to go up by that 5.4 degrees by about 2065 because of increases in carbon dioxide pollution, according to a separate paper published in Science on Thursday -- although many scientists take issue with that conclusion as well.

The same paper sees global averages increasing by about 3.6 degrees in the next half-century. So that implies essentially about 40 percent to 50 percent more chance for African wars than it would be without global warming, said Edward Miguel, another Berkeley economist and study co-author.

When the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) updates its report next year on the impacts of global warming, it will address the issue of impacts on war for the first time, said Carnegie Institution scientist Chris Field, who heads that worldwide study group. The new study is likely to play a big role, he said.

Hsiang said that whenever the analyzed studies looked at temperature and conflict, the link was clear, no matter where or when. His analysis examines about a dozen studies on collapses of empires or dynasties, about 15 studies on crime and aggression and more than 30 studies on wars, civil strife or intergroup conflicts.

Goldstein noted a wide array of factors beyond climate that lead to the growth of war -- or cause hot heads to cool down.

""Because of positive changes in technology, economics, politics and health"" conflict is likely to continue to drop, he said, although maybe not as much as it would without climate change.

There's a good reason why people get more aggressive in warmer weather, said Ohio State University psychology professor Brad Bushman, who wasn't part of the study but whose work on crime and heat was analyzed by Hsiang. Although people say they feel sluggish when they are hot, their heart rate and other physical responses are aroused and elevated. They think they are not agitated, when in fact they are, and ""that's a recipe for disaster,"" Bushman said.

Miguel acknowledges that many other factors play a role in conflict and said it's too soon to see whether conflict from warming will outweigh peace from prosperity: ""It's a race against time.""

Hornets' Miles Bridges pleads not guilty to felony domestic violence charges,"Charlotte Hornets star Miles Bridges pleaded not guilty to felony domestic violence charges on Wednesday after he was accused of assaulting his girlfriend in front of their children.

Bridges entered the plea at an arraignment, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office said. He was formally charged with one felony count of injuring a child’s parent and two felony counts of child abuse under circumstances or conditions likely to cause great bodily injury or death on Tuesday.

""Domestic violence creates physical, mental and emotional trauma that has a lasting impact on survivors,"" Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon said in a news release earlier this week. ""Children who witness family violence are especially vulnerable and the impact on them is immeasurable. Mr. Bridges will be held accountable for his actions and our Bureau of Victim Services will support the survivors through this difficult process.""

The Hornets released a statement to Fox News Digital late Tuesday night.

""We are aware of the charges that were filed today against Miles Bridges. These are very serious charges that we will continue to monitor. As this is a legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time,"" the team said.

The NBA added: ""We are aware of the charges filed today against Miles Bridges. The league is investigating the allegations.""

Mychelle Johnson, the mother of Bridges’ two children, addressed the incident on Instagram on July 1, posting several pictures of injuries and a medical report that read ""adult victim of physical abuse by male partner; Assault by strangulation, Brain concussion; Closed fracture of nasal bone; Contusion of rib; Multiple bruises; Strain of neck muscle.""

WARRIORS OWNER JOE LACOB FINED $500,000 FOR VIOLATING NBA POLICY AFTER CRITICIZING LUXURY TAX: REPORT

Johnson added in a separate Instagram post: ""I hate that it has come to this but I can’t be silent anymore. I’ve allowed someone to destroy my home, abuse me in every way possible and traumatize our kids for life. I have nothing to prove to the world, but I won’t allow anyone who could do something so horrible to have no remorse and paint a picture of something I’m not. I won’t allow the people around him to continue to silence me and continue to lie to protect this person.""

Bridges, 24, was initially arrested on July 1 for ""intimate partner violence with injury,"" the LAPD said on Twitter. He was released on $130,000 bond.

Authorities said the alleged assault on the defendant’s girlfriend happened on June 27 and 28 and occurred in front of their two children, according to a complaint.

"Rays, Yankees to use game coverage to spread awareness on 'gun violence'","Professional sports organizations are yet again cherry-picking tragedy to apparently promote their own political talking points.

The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees have partnered to use their home broadcasts for tonight’s contest to spread awareness on gun violence.

It's just the latest black square trend that likely won't accomplish anything. They just keep screaming louder.

""Every day, more than 110 Americans are killed with guns, and more than 200 are shot and injured,"" the Yankees tweeted. ""Firearms were the leading cause of death for American children and teens in 2020.""

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

""We all deserve to be safe — in schools, grocery stores, places of worship, out neighborhoods, houses and America,"" the Rays wrote on Twitter. ""The most recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde have shaken us to the core. The Tampa Bay Rays are mourning these heartbreaking tragedies that took the lives of innocent children and adults. This cannot become normal. We cannot become numb. We cannot look the other way. We all know, if nothing changes, nothing changes.""

And this is when the Rays explain how they plan to get involved.

""The Rays organization stands committed to actionable change and has made a $50,000 commitment to Everytown For Gun Safety’s Support Fund. Everytown is the largest gun violence prevention organization in America. Rather than our usual game coverage on social media tonight, we’ve partnered with Everytown to amplify facts about gun violence in America. We understand that no single organization can solve this crisis alone, but working together, we can make an impact. We invite you to join us and do what you can, when you can, where you can – because our lives depend on it.""

Yankees or Rays fans that had plans to watch baseball and escape reality are forced to listen to one side of this polarizing tragedy. Half the country thinks any trace of a weapon causes death, meanwhile the rest acknowledge America’s fight with mental illness.

It’s much more likely the solution is somewhere in between and pledges like these only create a further divide between the two sides.

"Texas fires Chris Beard amid domestic violence charge, despite fiancée retracting statement: reports","The University of Texas has fired men's head basketball coach Chris Beard while he faces a domestic violence charge, according to multiple reports.

The charge stems from an incident with his fiancée, Randi Trew, on Dec. 12. Trew initially said Beard strangled her, but she retracted her statement on Dec. 23.

""Chris did not strangle me, and I told that to law enforcement that evening,"" Trew said. ""Chris has stated that he was acting in self-defense, and I do not refute that. I do not believe Chris was trying to intentionally harm me in any way. It was never my intent to have him arrested or prosecuted.""

"White Sox's Mike Clevinger under investigation after alleged child abuse, domestic violence dispute: report","Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Mike Clevinger is reportedly under investigation by Major League Baseball following allegations of child abuse and domestic violence against the mother of their 10-month old daughter.

The alleged incidents occurred last summer while Clevinger was a member of the San Diego Padres.

Olivia Finestead, 24, said she has been in contact with MLB since the summer, when she reported physical, verbal and emotional abuse against her. She said the pitcher choked her and slapped her, while throwing used chewing tobacco on their child.

""I hope the @MLB does what they should and puts him in required therapy maybe even a small suspensions (sic) so he can take time out to really think about why he abuses his kids and their mothers,"" Finestead wrote on her Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

Clevinger signed a one-year deal with the White Sox in December, but the team says they were not made aware of the allegations when he signed.

""Major League Baseball and the Chicago White Sox take any and all allegations very seriously, and the White Sox are completely supportive of the Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse policy shared by MLB and the MLBPA,"" the team said in a statement to The Athletic. ""MLB opened an investigation after learning of these allegations. The White Sox were not aware of the allegations or the investigation at the time of his signing. The White Sox will refrain from comment until MLB’s investigative process has reached its conclusion.""

Added Clevinger's agent, Seth Levinson: ""We need to fairly and thoroughly protect our client and at the same time be respectful of the White Sox and MLB. We need time before responding.""

In August 2020, Clevinger broke COVID-19 protocols while playing with Cleveland and was placed on the team's restricted list. Later that month, he was traded to San Diego. He underwent Tommy John surgery after that season, and returned to appear in 23 games (22 starts) in 2022.

From 2017 to 2020, Clevinger pitched to a 2.96 ERA, striking out 10.2 batters per nine innings – however, this past season, his ERa shot up to 4.33 with a 7.2 K/9, both the worst marks since his rookie season in 2016.

Yankees pitcher's domestic violence incident details revealed as 2021 season nears start,"Domingo Germán has not pitched for the New York Yankees since the 2019 season as he was serving his punishment for violating MLB’s domestic violence policy.

The details surrounding Germán’s incident were initially scant until The Athletic’s report Sunday about what led to the pitcher’s sudden suspension. Germán reportedly slapped his girlfriend at a 2019 charity event hosted by his former Yankees teammate CC Sabathia but the league’s probe focused on what happened afterward.

Germán was ""intoxicated"" and was ""physically violent"" with his girlfriend at his home after Sabathia’s event, according to the report. The victim locked herself into a room and called the wife of another Yankees player to help, The Athletic reported. The couple drove to Germán’s home and separated the two, according to the report.

Germán was not arrested as police were not called and no incident report was filed, according to The Athletic. But the incident was reported to MLB by a different member of the Yankees’ organization, who was told of the incident by the pitcher’s girlfriend.

Germán is set to return to the Yankees for the 2021 season and could be a big part of the Yankees’ rotation. He wrote on Instagram last year that he was leaving baseball but in November was pitching in the Dominican Winter League.

He was placed on leave in 2019. He had a career-high 153 strikeouts and a 4.03 ERA in 27 appearances for the Yankees before he left the team. According to ESPN, Germán’s punishment is the longest for contravening the league’s domestic violence policy for a player who was not charged with a crime.

"Zac Stacy's ex-girlfriend, Kristin Evans, speaks out on alleged domestic violence incident","Kristin Evans, the ex-girlfriend of former NFL running back Zac Stacy and alleged victim of a horrific domestic violence incident, spoke out Thursday about the ordeal and what she’s been going through.

Evans appeared on ""America’s Newsroom"" alongside her attorney Thomas Feiter and told co-anchor Dana Perino she experienced incidents like the one captured on the released video before.

She also said that in that particular case she was trying to ""de-escalate the situation.""

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

A security video appeared to show Stacy, a 5-foot-9, 216-pound former NFL player, toss Evans into a television with their 5-month-old child strapped to a baby bouncy seat. The TV falls on Evans and nearly lands on the baby.

After he was arrested in Orlando, Stacy’s bond was set at $10,150. He was released from jail after posting bond and surrendering his passport.

Evans said she was unable to be at the initial hearing.

""I think I was more concerned for my safety rather than the bail set. It was more of the sanctions that were not in place that I felt I wasn’t safe,"" Evans told Perino of the initial hearing, adding that she also was fearful of possible retaliatory actions.

At the second hearing on Nov. 24, Stacy’s attorney Thomas Luka said the former running back planned to enter a mental health inpatient treatment center in Colorado starting Dec. 1 and that he planned to live at his mother’s home in Alabama between Thanksgiving and Dec. 1.

Orange County Circuit Judge Mark Blechman allowed Evans to be heard but said Stacy’s bond would not be increased. However, he did modify one condition and was barred from the state of Florida unless he has a court hearing there.

ALLEGED ZAC STACY ASSAULT VICTIM SAYS ABUSE BEGAN IN MAY, DIDN'T REPORT IT: 'I BELIEVED IT WAS MY FAULT’

Feiter said Thursday that Stacy was given a five-year restraining order.

""Yes, we did have that hearing yesterday and effectively Zac Stacy was adjudicated to be domestically violent toward Kristin Evans. So, that’s just an added layer of protection that we feel was beneficial for Kristin here as a victim, or survivor, of domestic violence,"" Feiter said.

When asked whether the law should be changed to help victims of domestic violence feel safer, Feiter said he believed the law has already changed and cited Marsy’s Law. According to Ballotpedia, Marsy’s Law ""provides crime victims, their families, and their lawful representatives with specific rights, including a right to due process and to be treated with fairness and respect; a right to be free from intimidation, harassment, and abuse; a right to have the victim's welfare considered when setting bail; a right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, among others.""

Feiter added it was important for victims to have their voices heard and to be believed.

""Kristin Evans was the victim of a horrific, violent attack at the hands of an ex-NFL player. And even with that caught on video, her voice was effectively silenced and she was not heard at the initial appearance,"" he said. ""He was even allowed to be released before she had her day in court. Fortunately, that was remedied by the presiding judge but we feel that’s a probably and that may be part of the systemic problem why women and victims and survivors of domestic violence don’t come forward. They need to know they will be respected and their voices will be heard.""

As Evans courageously shares her story, she’s also committed to helping others as well. She told Perino she is working on getting victims the help they need.

""I think victims need to know they will be respected. I think the word is getting out on Marsy’s Law. If they don’t feel like they’re getting the help and support they need from the law enforcement community, they can now reach out to private attorneys to file motions on their behalf. They do have standing in courts now in Florida to file those kinds of motions and we will ensure and fight to make sure they’re believed and their stories and voices are heard.""

"No link between video games and violence, studies say","NEW YORK (AP) — Do video games trigger violent behavior? Scientific studies have found no link. But the persistent theory is back in the headlines following Saturday's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.

An online manifesto thought to be authored by the gunman briefly mentioned the combat game Call of Duty. Then President Donald Trump weighed in, charging Monday that ""gruesome and grisly video games"" contribute to a ""glorification of violence.""

Trump's statements were more reserved compared with his last brush with the subject in 2018, when he called video games ""vicious"" and summoned game-industry executives to meet at the White House, to little lasting effect.

The Entertainment Software Association, the biggest video game trade group, reiterated its position that there is no causal connection between video games and violence.

""More than 165 million Americans enjoy video games, and billions of people play video games worldwide,"" the group said in a statement. ""Yet other societies, where video games are played as avidly, do not contend with the tragic levels of violence that occur in the U.S.""

Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Call of Duty.

WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SHOW?

""There are no longitudinal studies that show a link between violence and video games,"" said Benjamin Burroughs, a professor of emerging media at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ""Certainly, there is no linkage to gun violence.""

Burroughs said that some studies show a short-term increase in aggressive thoughts and feelings after playing video games, but nothing that rises to the level of violence.

""Plenty of gamers and get upset when they lose or feel the game was 'cheating,' but it doesn't lead to violent outputs,"" he said.

In 2006, a small study by Indiana University researchers found that teenagers who played violent video games showed higher levels of emotional arousal but less activity in the parts of the brain associated with the ability to plan, control and direct thoughts and behavior.

Patrick Markey, a psychology professor at Villanova University who focuses on video games, found in his research that men who commit severe acts of violence actually play violent video games less than the average male. About 20% were interested in violent video games, compared with 70% of the general population, he explained in his 2017 book ""Moral Combat: Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong.""

Another study by Markey and his colleagues showed that violence tends to dip when a new violent movie or video game comes out, possibility because people are at home playing the game or in theaters watching the movie.

""The general story is people who play video games right after might be a little hopped up and jerky but it doesn't fundamentally alter who they are,"" he said. ""It is like going to see a sad movie. It might make you cry but it doesn't make you clinically depressed.""

WHY DOES THIS THEORY PERSIST?

The theory persists in part because politicians on both sides of the aisle have taken it up as an easy target, since it lacks a powerful lobby like, say, the National Rifle Association.

In 2013, after the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newton, Connecticut, Vice President Joe Biden held three days of wide-ranging talks on gun violence prevention, including a meeting with video game industry executives. After the 2013 meetings wrapped, the White House called on research on the effect of media and video games on gun violence but nothing substantial came out of that.

""Politicians on both sides go after video games it is this weird unifying force,"" Markey said. ""It makes them look like they are doing something.""

Another reason, according to Markey, is that video games can look disturbing to people who aren't gamers.

""They look scary. But research just doesn't support that there's a link"" to violent behavior, he said.

DO VIDEO GAMES NEED A RATINGS SYSTEM?

Actually, they already have one dating back to the 1990s. That didn't stop Trump from calling for one in 2018.

Following an outcry over violent games such as 1992's Mortal Kombat, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association to give each game a rating based on five categories ranging from ""E? for ""Everyone"" to an ""Adults Only"" rating for those 18 and older.

The ratings suggest an age range and describe the possibly objectionable features of games. The ""mature"" rating, for example, indicates the content is ""generally suitable for ages 17 and up"" and that the game ""may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language.""

In 2011, the Supreme Court rejected a California law banning the sale of violent video games to children. The decision found that video games, like other media, are protected by the First Amendment.",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/no-theres-still-no-link-between-video-games-and-violence,N/A

"Atlanta: Protesters call for 'violence' against police after shooting leaves 1 dead, officer injured","Protesters in Atlanta are calling for violence against police officers and law enforcement entities following a police-involved shooting on Wednesday that left a state trooper wounded and one man dead.

The Twitter account Scenes from the Atlanta Forest calls for a ""Night of Rage"" on Friday to enact ""reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies,"" according to a post.

""Consider this a call for reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies. On Friday, January 20th, wherever you are, you are invited to participate in a night of rage in order to honor the memory of our fallen comrade,"" the group wrote on Twitter, in an apparent violation of the platform’s terms and conditions.

The account claims to be a part of Defend the Atlanta Forest, one of the multiple groups protesting in an area where the city is set to construct the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.

GEORGIA STATE TROOPER SHOT BY PROTESTER AT 'COP CITY' NEAR ATLANTA

Defend the Atlanta Forest said in a statement to Fox News Digital that it is ""a broad, diverse, decentralized movement to defend the Atlanta forest."" They went on to say they are only a ""news aggregator for the movement"" and ""not affiliated"" with Scenes from the Atlanta Forest.

In another Scenes from the Atlanta Forest tweet, posted several hours later, the group added: ""The police will kill you if given the chance. Now is the time for bravery. Take care of each other. Be dangerous together.""

The group appeared to acknowledge the post was against Twitter’s rule not to incite violence as it said in yet another tweet that its account ""is not long for this world.""

The upcoming event comes after a Georgia State Patrol trooper, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the abdomen Wednesday morning. It happened as police tried to clear an encampment near the site where the $90 million Atlanta Police Department (APD) facility will be constructed.

The sweep was conducted as ""an operation to identify people who are trespassing and committing other crimes on the property,"" the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said.

ATLANTA TEENS DEAD AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA ARGUMENT LEADS TO SHOOTOUT: POLICE

""At about 9:00 a.m. today, as law enforcement was moving through the property, officers located a man inside a tent in the woods. Officers gave verbal commands to the man who did not comply and shot a Georgia State Patrol Trooper,"" the GBI said in a statement. ""Other law enforcement officers returned fire, hitting the man.""

""Law enforcement evacuated the Trooper to a safe area. The man died on scene,"" it added.

The bureau continued: ""The injured Georgia State Patrol Trooper was taken to a local hospital where he underwent surgery. A handgun and shell casings were located at the scene. The GBI is working the officer-involved shooting and the investigation is still active and ongoing.""

The identities of the officer and the deceased have not yet been released. The officer was hospitalized and is in stable condition.

During a press conference, GBI director Michael Register confirmed that the shooting was in self-defense after the now-deceased individual opened fire ""without warning"" on the trooper.

""An individual, without warning, shot a Georgia State Patrol trooper,"" Register told reporters. ""Other law enforcement personnel returned fire in self-defense and evacuated the trooper to a safe area. The individual who fired upon law enforcement and shot the trooper was killed in the exchange of gunfire.""

Four others were arrested at the scene and taken to the DeKalb County Jail. Charges are pending.

""They're endangering the community and the citizens around this area,"" Register said of the encampment and the protesters, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also commented on the shooting and said he and his family were praying for law enforcement officers.

""Marty, the girls, and I are praying for this brave Trooper and public safety officers across all law enforcement agencies today,"" he tweeted Wednesday morning. ""As our thoughts remain with him and his family, our resolve also remains steadfast and strong to see criminals brought to justice.""

FBI RELEASES NEW DETAILS ON POLICE USE OF FORCE AS PUBLIC GRAPPLES WITH DISTRUST

The joint task force formed to combat ongoing criminal activity at the APD site includes the GBI, Atlanta Police Department, Georgia Attorney General’s Office, DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office, Georgia State Patrol, FBI, DeKalb County Police Department, Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.

Defend the Atlanta Forest held a vigil Wednesday evening at the Little Five Points Square to ""memorialize the forest defender"" that was ""murdered by the police,"" it announced on Twitter.

""Today the police shot and killed a forest defender below the canopy of our beloved forest,"" the group said. ""No one can bring our friend back to us. An innocent life has been taken and the machines continue.""

""We will not go quietly into this dark night,"" it added.

ATLANTA POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN FATAL CHRISTMAS EVE SHOOTING

""Police killed a forest defender today, someone who loved the forest, someone who fought to protect the earth & its inhabitants,"" the group continued in a tweet.

""This is why we organize to stop Cop City. And we will. In honor of their life, and the lives of everyone killed and imprisoned by the police.""

The group also announced another event on Saturday, where members are encouraged to ""wear black in mourning"" for the dead member.

These events come amid heightened tension between protesters and the police, involving several arrests over several months over the APD construction.

""The Atlanta Police Department seeks to turn 300 acres of forest into a tactical training compound featuring a mock city. This project was announced to the shock of community members who had been given no opportunity to weigh in on the proposal. The entire process has been shadier than the forest itself,"" Defend the Atlanta Forest's website reads.

According to the group, they are explicitly protesting the new ""Cop City"" as it will ""hyper-militarize law enforcement"" and ""will serve as a national model of police militarization and budgetary bloat.""

The group names the 2020 death of George Floyd and others as its motivation to protest police violence.

The group also claims it does not advocate for violence and that ""no one has been harmed by participants in this movement.""

Last week, anarchists in Atlanta also targeted Brasfield & Gorrie, the general contractor of the police facility, and spray-painted graffiti on its buildings.

""B&G stop cop city,"" the graffiti read, according to photos. ""We have the numbers,"" another spray-painted message read.

Also, last month, police arrested five people at the APD site location. They were also charged with domestic terrorism.

""Prior to yesterday’s operation, APD and other agencies had made several arrests over the past few months for the ongoing criminal activity at the site location. Some of the criminal activities include carjacking, various crimes against persons, destruction of property, arson, and attacks against public safety officials.

The arrested individuals included Francis Carroll, 22, of Maine; Nicholas Olson, 25, of Nebraska; Serena Hertel, 25, of California; Leonardo Vioselle, 20, of Macon, Georgia; and Arieon Robinson, 22, of Wisconsin.

Atlanta mayor rebukes those claiming anti-police riots aren’t violent: ‘Domestic terrorism’,"Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens rebuked those claiming that the anti-police riots seen overnight were not violent, saying that the charges against the six protesters arrested will include ""domestic terrorism.""

Dickens, a Democrat, pushed back on CBS host Margaret Brennan during an appearance on ""Face The Nation"" Sunday morning. During a panel slated to discuss crime and violence plaguing American cities, Brennan asked for an update on the protests in response to the death of 26-year-old environmental activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran.

Teran reportedly went by the name Tortuguita, identified as nonbinary, and used they/it pronouns. Authorities said Teran first shot and wounded a state trooper tasked with clearing protesters from the construction site of a new public safety training center.

Teran was allegedly killed by Georgia State Patrol officers who returned fire, and Brennan noted how the protests in downtown Atlanta Saturday came in response to police saying body-camera footage of the shooting doesn’t exist. Dickens, instead, emphasized how the peaceful protests devolved into violence, noting how individuals ""had explosives,"" ""burned down a police car"" and ""broke windows at businesses.""

ATLANTA POLICE ARREST 6 IN NIGHT OF CHAOS AFTER VIOLENT PROTESTERS LIT COP CAR ABLAZE, SMASHED WINDOWS

""And so our police department, along with our state and federal partners, took swift action within two blocks and brought that situation under control,"" Dickens said Sunday. ""And the violence stopped, and those six individuals were arrested. And it should be noted that these individuals were not Atlanta or Georgia residents. Most of them traveled into our city to wreak havoc. And so, we love to support people when they're doing right, peaceful protest is a part of the American -- our freedoms, but when you are violent, we will make sure that you get held accountable.""

""When you say people from out of town, they're carrying explosives. Is this an organized movement here?"" Brennan responded, noting how Atlanta newspapers cite possible links to ""environmental activists, radical anarchist and black revolutionaries."" Brennan also cited claims from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., blaming Democrats for condoning Black Lives Matter and Antifa.

While Dickens declined to respond to Greene’s remarks, he agreed the riots constitute ""domestic terrorism.""

""The crimes range from violence to domestic terrorism to assault battery and some other things,"" the mayor said. ""But yes, it is violent when someone turns to burn down a police car or breakout windows or have explosives on them. I don't get into the names. I don't know all the organizations. I'll let y'all decide who did it. I just know they're arrested. And if they come into Atlanta, again, to wreak havoc, they will be arrested again.""

""But do you believe your city is being targeted by organized groups?"" Brennan pressed.

""Yes, those individuals that are protesting against ‘Cop City,’ as they call it, it's really a public safety training center,"" Dickens said. ""They don't want to see the very things that they asked for more police training, we can't train imaginary, we have to do it in a facility that allows for police firefighters in the community to train together. And so this is bringing about the change that we wanted to see in 2020. And now while we're doing it, these individuals don't want to see any resources go towards that training, so we're going to develop this training center and those individuals will have to come to a halt.""

Dickens' interview comes after CNN and ABC News coverage of the Atlanta riots received backlash online.

CNN guest David Peisner caught flak Saturday for claiming that the only violence taking place in the fiery uproar in Atlanta was being instigated by police.

Chicago biker gang violence reportedly escalating after years of relative peace: 'A lot of bad blood',"Violent tension between biker gangs in Chicago, Illinois, is reportedly escalating following years of relative peace.

Chicago’s infamous Outlaws Motorcycle Club is warring against the Mongol Nation Motorcycle Club, a rival group that has reportedly been crowding in on the Outlaws' turf in the city, according to bikers and police sources who spoke to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Multiple shootings between the gangs have recently taken place in the city, according to Chicago police reports.

In one incident, four Outlaws members and a member of the Mongols were reportedly struck during a shoot-out at a birthday party at a bar on the South Side, which was shut down last week by police as a public nuisance.

DOZENS SHOT IN CHICAGO WEEKEND VIOLENCE, INCLUDING 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL STRUCK IN NECK DURING MORNING DRIVE-BY

Approximately 20 Outlaws sought revenge when they walked into the bar, according to a law enforcement source who spoke to the outlet.

The shooting left one of the Outlaws wounded in the left elbow, and while most of the bikers shot were not wounded seriously, one who was shot in the chest was left in critical condition.

One Mongol member who was struck in the right arm had also been wounded in a 2021 shootout, according to police reports and court records reported on by the outlet.

People in the bar reportedly cleaned up evidence in the establishment such as shell casings, the law enforcement source said.

MAN BEATEN BY MICHIGAN BIKER CLUB AFTER ACCIDENTALLY BUMPING INTO MEMBER: POLICE

The source went on to say that the bikers who were wounded have not cooperated with investigators, that no guns were found at the bar and no one has been charged yet.

The Mongols came to Chicago in recent years from California, which has reportedly rankled the Outlaws who believe the city is their territory, leading to various alleged acts of provocation and occasional violence.

David Santillan, who served as president of the Mongols until members gave him the boot last year, said he was involved with the decision to bring the group to Chicago, but maintained that it was never intended to provoke the Mongol group.

""We don’t fish out of the same pond,"" Santillan said, according to the outlet, which noted the gang typically recruits among young Latinos. ""We’re looking at a different demographic.""

""If you’re our friends, and we coexist in other areas, why can’t we coexist in Chicago?"" Santillian asked.

""They feel like they have to defend their real estate,"" he said, explaining how the shootouts that have taken place have been unfortunate, but could have been much more terrible.

""A bunch of guys could have ended up dead,"" he said.

"Nation's capital grapples with violence, juvenile crime as DC leaders look for answers","Crime has been rising in Washington, D.C., since the spring of 2020, as local officials continue to disagree over the root causes of the violence.

""You'll get a group of kids that steals a car at gunpoint. And there could be violence there, where they assault somebody or pistol-whip somebody,"" Gregg Pemberton, chair of the D.C. Police Union, told Fox News Digital. ""We see people shot during armed carjackings. Then, they'll take the car and use the stolen car to commit other crimes. They'll drive to other neighborhoods, rival neighborhoods, and they'll shoot people. Then they'll leave. They'll commit robberies of gas stations or convenience stores.""

Pemberton says politics has gotten in the way of public safety. Other local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have blamed the rising crime trend on ""the easy access of weapons."" Officials have also pointed to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Statistics

In 2021, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) reported 226 homicides — the highest annual murder count seen in the nation’s capital in nearly 20 years. Only 42% of those homicide investigations were closed.

In 2022, homicides are down 6% year-to-date, with 59 reported so far this year compared to 63 at this time last year. The number of assault incidents with deadly weapons remains unchanged, with 457 reported this year compared to 455 reported last year, and robberies are up 54%, with 803 incidents reported this year compared to 521 at the same time last year.

DC HOMICIDES COST TAXPAYERS $1.53M PER MURDER, NEARLY $1B PRICE TAG FOR ALL SHOOTINGS LAST YEAR: STUDY

Total violent crime is up 25%, and property crime is up 7%.

Examples

On April 22, four people were injured in a shooting in D.C.'s Van Ness neighborhood after suspect Raymond Spencer fired an estimated 200 rounds from an apartment window before killing himself, according to authorities. The shooting occurred less than two weeks after four people were injured in a shooting near Nationals Park.

""Unfortunately, I had to look in parents' eyes tonight who are terrified, and they were terrified thinking of what might happen to their children,"" Bowser said during an April 22 press conference after the shooting. ""And we have experienced this too much in our country — the epidemic of gun violence. The easy access of weapons has got to stop. People should not be scared taking their children to school.""

Motor vehicle theft, theft from auto and ""other"" auto incidents are also up compared to last year, and experts say auto-related incidents often lead to violence. Juveniles have made up the majority of carjacking suspects over the last two years.

MPD has arrested multiple juveniles between the ages of 13 and 15 in recent weeks ranging from unarmed and armed carjackings to armed robberies. On April 21, authorities announced the arrest of a 13-year-old boy charged in connection to two stolen auto incidents, two assaults, two unarmed carjackings and three armed carjackings, one of which included an assault with a hammer.

D.C. City Council candidate Nate Fleming became the victim of an armed carjackin g that occurred in broad daylight at a gas station in January.

DC ALLEGED ‘SNIPER' FIRED MORE THAN 200 ROUNDS FROM 5TH FLOOR, SET UP CAMERAS TO WATCH COPS: POLICE

""I’m shocked, angry and a bit embarrassed,"" Fleming said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""To be threatened at gunpoint is shocking, but I am not surprised to have been attacked given the crisis we are facing with carjackings and violence in general in our city. Increasing public safety is at the heart of why I’m running for a citywide Council seat.""

In February, an armed suspect carjacked a vehicle near Capitol Hill with the victim and her 11-month-old child still inside. The victim told police the suspect said, ""Keep screaming and I'm gonna stab you,"" according to a police report.

Guns

Mayor Bowser and President Biden have blamed gun violence and ghost guns for rising crime in not only the nation's capital but in other major U.S. cities, as well.

Last year alone, there were approximately 20,000 suspected ghost guns reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) after being recovered by law enforcement in criminal investigations— which the White House said is a ""ten-fold increase"" from 2016. In D.C., specifically, the number of ghost guns recovered from the streets jumped to a record high in 2021. District authorities recovered 25 ghost guns in 2018, 116 in 2019, 282 in 2020 and 313 in 2021, according to NBC 4 Washington.

BIDEN ANNOUNCED RULE MAKING ‘GHOST GUNS’ ILLEGAL AS PART OF COMPREHENSIVE GUN CRIME STRATEGY

Biden on April 11 announced that the Justice Department had issued its long-awaited final rule to rein in the proliferation of ""ghost guns,"" making it illegal for a business to manufacture firearms without serial numbers. The president has also recently called for ""universal background checks,"" an ""assault weapons"" ban and a ban on ""high-capacity magazines.""

Bowser on April 25 announced a new Violent Crime Impact Team comprised of local and federal partners to help recover illegal firearms and apprehend criminals.

""We cannot allow people to terrorize our communities with guns,"" Bowser said in a statement at the time. ""This is about using a whole-of-government approach, but it’s also about focusing our attention and resources on exactly where we know the problem is. Our message is clear – we will continue to offer people in our city a better path forward, but if people choose to engage in violence, then they will be held accountable.""

Bowser had also introduced a plan for the MPD to reach 4,000 sworn-in MPD officers through her 2023 Fair Shot Budget, which invests $30 million for hiring, recruitment, and retention incentives for the department.

Politics

While Pemberton, chair of the D.C. Police Union, agrees that part of the issue of rising crime in D.C. is the lingering impact of the pandemic, he also blames the trend on politics.

When police question juveniles ""about their involvement"" in a crime, the juveniles ""are telling the detectives that they know there's no penalty, so they don't care,"" Pemberton explained, naming D.C. District Attorney Karl Racine's Restorative Justice Model as a reason why.

The model allows juveniles charged with violent crimes to take part in a restorative program that includes connecting with victims and therapy instead of being prosecuted with the goal of decreasing the likelihood that the same juvenile offender will commit future crimes. The office of the attorney general is the sole prosecutor for juvenile offenses.

""There's just this lackadaisical sort of laissez-faire attitude about committing these crimes because they know that even when they go in front of a judge in D.C. Superior Court, and even if they're convicted, it's likely not going to be any significant penalty,"" Pemberton said.

Pemberton also blames D.C. City Council policies introduced since the May 2020 killing of George Floyd — a tragedy that occurred shortly after COVID-19 swept across the U.S. and led local and national lawmakers to hastily introduce police-reform bills.

2 VICTIMS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT AFTER ENTERING CAR THEY THOUGHT WAS THEIR RIDESHARE IN DC

Such policies ""have multiple consequences,"" one of which includes officer retention rates, Pemberton said.

""We've seen almost 700 officers leave over the past two years, and that's a significant number of them,"" the union chair said. ""… Right now, it's our total strength in sworn-in police officers is right around 3,500. The mayor is saying that we need 4,000. The chief agrees with that. The union agrees with that. I think … the minimum that we should have is 4,000.""

The D.C. Police Union directly blames increasing D.C. crime on City Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, as well as Judiciary and Public Safety Committee Chairman Charles Allen, in a new advertisement campaign. Allen introduced the"" Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Act"" in 2020, and Mendelson introduced the ""Strengthening Oversight and Accountability of Police Amendment Act"" in 2021.

Pemberton specifically took issue with Mendelson's bill, introduced in July of last year, which publicizes an officer's entire personnel record for the entirety of that officer's career. It also makes public certain victim and witness information.

""Wat it does is it takes the Office of Police Complaints [OPC], which is a civilian agency outside of the MPD … that handles complaints, and just completely gives them carte blanche to investigate any police officer about any issue,"" Pemberton said. ""This is [a] very biased agency that comes up with some pretty ridiculous allegations against our officers. And of the allegations they make against our officers … only 8% of the complaints that come in are sustained against our members.""

Pemberton added that the council is ""not willing to listen"" to police, who want accountability within the MPD but do not want policies that will make police recruitment and retention more difficult.

D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee said during an October 2021 hearing that Mendelson's bill ""goes too far,"" not because he does not want ""police accountability"" but because it treats MPD officers, ""the overwhelming majority of whom serve our community faithfully, unfairly.""

""It is because it will bog the Department down in endless bureaucracy that will prevent the agency from effectively and efficiently serving the city. And it is because it does not protect the privacy interests of everyone who is victimized by crime or chooses to work with the Department,"" Contee said at the time.

Mendelson's office shared a statement from the chairman last month saying the legislation ""would strengthen police accountability.""

DC MEN CHARGED WITH IMPERSONATING FEDERAL AGENTS PLEAD NOT GUILTY

""This has nothing to do with public safety, as they’ve alleged. Creating a Deputy Auditor of Public Safety, and making it harder for the [fraternal order of police] to defend one of their own for excessive use of force does not increase carjackings or homicides,"" the council chairman said. ""Moreover, the legislation says nothing about the number of officers, nor the police budget. What it does is makes sure DC Police are held accountable. I am not against an increase in Police officers, I want more police. But I want the kind of police who can be held responsible for wrongdoing.""

The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital. Allen and several other councilmembers also did not respond or declined comment.

Impact

D.C.'s population fell by about 3%, representing a loss of more than 20,000 residents, in 2021, the D.C. Policy Center reported on March 25, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The percentage represents a record-high exodus from the District over the last two decades, the Policy Center reported.

Additionally, D.C.'s population growth rate is -2.9% compared to the national rate of 0.12% and the Washington metropolitan area rate of 0.46%.

""The District had the lowest rates of domestic and net migration among all states, and though its birth, international migration, and natural growth rates ranked second, third, and fourth respectively, those gains were not at all enough to compensate the losses,"" the Policy Center said in its report.

Pemberton said victims of crime are being left out of the conversation.

""People who have been raped or robbed or shot or burglarized or whose families have been murdered — those are the voices that get silenced in this debate,"" he said. ""It's really just an issue between activists on one side that say policing is aggressive and all of the other rhetoric that gets spewed out. And police officers who are saying, ‘Hey, we need to be able to do our job to protect these communities.’ That's the debate. But what you're not hearing is all of the individuals who've been victimized by crime is traumatized.""

Data show there have been 22 times more attacks on pro-lifers than pro-choice groups since Supreme Court leak,"EXCLUSIVE: There have been 22 times more attacks against pro-life groups since the leak in early May of a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade compared to attacks on pro-choice organizations, new data show.

""The overwhelming narrative in the media is the claim those on the right are responsible for most of the politically motivated violence in the U.S. It has been a theme in the news media after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision was leaked, with many claiming that there was disproportionate violence against pro-choice providers. But a review of cases shows over 22 times more violence against pro-life advocates,"" John Lott, the founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), told Fox News Digital on Monday.

Following the unprecedented leak on May 2 detailing that the Supreme Court had a majority of justices ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, headlines warned that pro-choice supporters and organizations would likely face an increase in attacks. A report from the National Abortion Federation found there was an increase in attacks against pro-choice organizations and supporters in 2021, which experts projected would only get worse following the Roe leak and the eventual confirmation that the nation’s highest court effectively ended the recognition of abortion as a constitutional right.

Though the data show there were a handful of attacks from May 3 to Sept. 24 of this year against pro-choice groups and supporters, the number was dwarfed by attacks against pro-life centers.

PRO-LIFE NY LEADERS SLAM HOCHUL, AG JAMES FOR 'MISERABLY' FAILING STATE AT REOPENING OF 'FIREBOMBED' OFFICE

A research team at CPRC found there were 135 attacks against pro-life organizations and supporters compared to six attacks on pro-choice groups and supporters.

""The media has uncritically accepted pro-choice claims of violence without asking for a list of cases,"" Lott said.

Attacks on pro-life centers exploded soon after the historic leak in early May. In June, the radical abortion group Jane's Revenge even took credit for some attacks and declared it ""open season"" on pro-lifers.

LETTER SIGNED BY RADICAL ABORTION GROUP JANE'S REVENGE DECLARES ‘OPEN SEASON’ ON PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS

""From here forward, any anti-choice group who closes their doors, and stops operating will no longer be a target. But until you do, it’s open season, and we know where your operations are,"" a letter from Jane’s Revenge dated June 14 reads.

CPRC compiled a spreadsheet of such attacks allegedly carried out by Jane’s Revenge members and other abortion supporters. The list includes graffiti attacks on pro-life offices, a center that was ""firebombed"" in Buffalo, New York, Catholic churches that were vandalized and even ignited on fire. The list also includes church worship and Catholic Masses that were interrupted by abortion rights advocates, including in June when women stripped during a service at Joel Osteen’s church in Houston and shouted ""Overturn Roe, Hell No.""

ZERO ARRESTS IN AT LEAST 17 JANE'S REVENGE ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE ORGANIZATIONS

The nonprofit noted that such attacks have been documented by sources such as the Catholic News Agency and the House Republican Committee on Energy and Commerce.

For attacks on pro-choice members, compiling the data was not as easy, according to CPRC. Research members reached out to the National Abortion Federation for data on 2022 attacks – citing that the organization tracked such incidents in 2021 – but were directed to the DC Abortion Fund. The DC Abortion Fund did not respond to numerous requests for data, according to the CPRC report.

""We obtained the cases from news searches and various sources, but the pro-abortion organizations refused to respond to repeated requests for additional cases despite efforts over three weeks,"" CPRC said in its report released this week.

Fox News Digital also reached out the DC Abortion Fund and National Abortion Federation for data and comment, but did not receive a reply by time of publishing.

The list compiled by CPRC includes a man charged with arson of an organization receiving federal funding after allegedly setting a Michigan Planned Parenthood on fire, a man in New York accused of physically obstructing access to a Planned Parenthood, and a woman in Wyoming accused of setting fire to an abortion clinic, as well as three other attacks.

CPRC’s report comes one week ahead of Election Day. Voters have often cited abortion as one of their top concerns, following the economy, and ranked among other issues such as rampant crime and immigration.

ABORTION REMAINS KEY ISSUE FOR SOME VOTERS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS

The report charged that the ""US DOJ is selectively targeting pro-life leaders,"" which linked to a news article detailing 11 pro-life advocates who were indicted this year for demonstrating at an abortion clinic. The CPRC report also pointed to the recent arrest of pro-life activist Mark Houck over an altercation he had with a Planned Parenthood escort in Philadelphia in October 2021.

Additionally, the Department of Justice keeps a running list of ""federal prosecutions of recent cases of violence and other conduct directed at reproductive health care providers,"" according to its website. The CPRC study notes that no such list exists for attacks against pro-lifers.

When approached for comment if the DOJ has a similar list of recent federal prosecutions of cases involving people who have targeted pro-life centers, a spokesperson said ""all of our FACE prosecutions are included in this list."" The Freedom of Access Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act, makes it a federal crime to use force with the intent to injure, intimidate and interfere with anyone because that person provides reproductive health care.

Florida sheriff's deputy killed responding to domestic violence call on Christmas Eve: 'We are heartbroken',"A Florida community is mourning the loss of a sheriff's deputy after he was shot and killed by a domestic violence suspect on Christmas Eve.

The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office announced Cpl. Ray Hamilton, a five-year veteran of the department, was fatally injured when 43-year-old Timothy Price-Williams allegedly opened fire on the deputy from inside his residence.

Hamilton, who served on the Special Response Team, died shortly after 3 p.m. Saturday at the Fort Walton Beach - Destin Hospital.

The department said deputies responded to the townhome at 710 North Park Blvd. to present a warrant against Price-Williams for a domestic violence battery charge.

The victim reported that Price-Williams slapped her in the face and shoved her during an argument on Friday. She also said he took her phone away, so she couldn't call 911 for help.

When deputies arrived at the home around 9 a.m. Saturday they made contact with Price-Williams. He reportedly refused to leave the residence, prompting the Special Response Team to come to the scene to try and negotiate a peaceful surrender.

The sheriff's office said several deputies, including Hamilton, entered an area behind the backyard fence of the premises to help establish a safe perimeter.

Once they were set up around 12:40 p.m., Price-Williams fired shots out of a window, which struck Hamilton and ultimately led to his death. The sheriff's office noted Price-Williams was shot in the arm when law enforcement returned fire.

Price-Williams is charged with first-degree premeditated murder. He received medical attention for his small injury and was transported to the jail after.

In a statement posted to its Facebook page, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said the grief from losing Hamilton is devastating, calling him a ""ray of sunshine"" who was ""dedicated to protecting others.""

""We appreciate the endless stream of words of support that have come in for his family and his co-workers as we face this heartbreaking loss of a profoundly loved and respected friend, public servant, and hero,"" Aden said.

Hamilton's death makes him the 61st officer killed by gunfire in 2022.

FOP president blames ‘pandering prosecutors’ and ‘cynical politicians’ for increased violence against police,"The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) released a report Wednesday morning compiling the attacks on law enforcement over the past year.

With 10 days left in 2022, the National FOP reports 323 officers have been shot in the line of duty this year. Of those shot, 60 have died. Those statistics do not include the situations where officers were shot at, but not injured.

In response to the report, National FOP President Patrick Yoes labeled this past year as ""one of the most dangerous years for law enforcement in recent history.""

Yoes said the uptick in violence toward police officers, and the crime crisis in general, is a result of criminals feeling emboldened by the ""failed policies of pandering prosecutors and cynical politicians.""

'DEFUND THE POLICE' AFTERMATH CREATED 'RIPPLE EFFECT' THAT ENDANGERS EVERYONE, LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE SAYS

Though 2021 was the worst year for attacks on law enforcement, with 346 officers shot and 63 killed, since the FOP started recording data in 2015, this year isn't too far behind. The stats from both years are significantly worse than 2019 and 2020.

Yoes said the surge in violence is unlike anything he has ever seen as a 36-year veteran, adding that there were 87 ambush-style attacks on law enforcement this year, which resulted in 31 of the 60 deaths.

""Many will often look at this data and just see numbers. We MUST remember that they represent heroes — fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters,"" Yoes wrote. ""Thankfully, because of dramatic improvements in medical trauma science and anti-ballistic technology, the lethality of these attacks would be much greater.""

POLICE, LAW ENFORCEMENT LINE OF DUTY DEATHS IN 2021 JUMPED 55% FROM YEAR BEFORE

prev Image 2 of 2

Yoes said it is his ""sincere hope"" Congress will pass the Protect and Serve Act, which would address the national problem of ambushes and unprovoked attacks on America's officers.

He also said he can't begin to fathom the ""heinous acts"" violent, brazen criminals are willing to commit against law-abiding citizens if they are willing to attack men and women in law enforcement. He added that law-abiding citizens in America are justifiably living in fear wondering if they will be the next victim.

Placing some of the blame on ""rogue prosecutors,"" Yoes said more people will continue to break the law when they are no consequences for doing so.

""Law-abiding citizens saw the real-life consequences of what happens when elected officials embrace pro-criminal, revolving-door policies and make decisions that put the interests of violent offenders ahead of public safety,"" Yoes wrote. ""These decisions — failures to prosecute violent offenders for their crimes or, even worse, releasing repeat offenders arrested for crimes who show a propensity for escalation of violence—make our communities less safe.""

Yoes ended his response by saying ""enough is enough"" and calling on Americans in every community across the country to join law enforcement by taking a stand against the rampant violence.

""Truthfully, the violence against those sworn to serve and protect is beyond unacceptable; it’s a stain on our society, and it must end. It is incumbent upon our elected officials and community leaders to stand up, support our heroes, and speak out against the violence against law enforcement officers,"" he wrote.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/fop-president-blames-pandering-prosecutors-cynical-politicians-increased-violence-against-police,N/A
Gabby Petito case: One year on from a domestic violence incident that could have prevented a murder,"If you or someone you know is the victim of domestic abuse, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233.

Moab police responded to a domestic violence call involving the late van life travel blogger Gabby Petito and her suspected killer ex Brian Laundrie one year ago Thursday.

The ill-fated encounter, recorded on harrowing police bodycam video, preceded Petito’s brutal strangling at Laundrie’s hands just two weeks later.

Despite a Utah statute that requires someone to be arrested or cited during a domestic response, no such action was taken.

GABBY PETITO'S PARENTS ANNOUNCE WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT AGAINST MOAB POLICE OVER BRIAN LAUNDRIE 911 CALL

The couple left on a cross-country road trip in June 2021, taking Petito’s converted Ford Transit van on a tour of national and state parks, chronicled on Petito’s Instagram and YouTube accounts.

Her disappearance under suspicious circumstances garnered international attention and spotlighted missing persons and domestic violence cases.

In the year that followed her death, her parents founded and built up a national nonprofit that continues to raise awareness.

The Gabby Petito Foundation

In response to their daughter’s tragic story, Petito’s parents and stepparents founded the Gabby Petito Foundation to raise awareness of missing persons and domestic violence.

The organization became a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit on Oct. 22, 2021, and last week announced a $100,000 donation to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

""Domestic violence can be stopped, and organizations like the Hotline are at the forefront of ensuring that survivors get the support they need to seek a safer future,"" Nichole Schmidt, Petito’s mother, said in the announcement. ""We support organizations doing this life-saving work and encourage everyone to join us by making a gift to The Hotline’s emergency campaign. Thousands of people in need are depending on us.""

Answering questions from Fox News Digital and other outlets at a news briefing Monday regarding the family’s intent to sue Moab police for their handling of the Aug. 12 call, Petito’s parents said they hope her case will encourage other people trapped in abusive relationships to seek help and get out as soon as possible.

""Reach out if you can,"" Nichole Schmidt, said during the briefing, wiping tears from her eyes. ""Reach out to someone.""

The foundation declined to comment for this story, deferring to the parents’ Monday remarks.

""All we can hope is that Gabby’s legacy will be a positive one,"" Jim Schmidt, Petito’s stepfather, said. ""That people will see her, and they recognize her and possibly compare maybe what they’re going through in their life and make a positive change.""

To that end, the National Domestic Violence Hotline says the number of calls it has received since Petito’s story seized global headlines last summer has doubled to almost 80,000 a month.

""People care; we care; there are people that care,"" Joseph Petito, Gabby’s father, added. ""And we think everyone out there should know that there are people who will do whatever we can to help.""

GABBY PETITO HOMICIDE: TIMELINE OF DISAPPEARANCE WITH BRIAN LAUNDRIE

The Moab Incident

After Petito’s mother, Nichole Schmidt, reported her missing on Sept. 11, 2021, Fox News Digital was the first media outlet to uncover the Moab domestic violence call – in which a witness told police he saw Laundrie hitting and slapping Petito and attempting to drive off without her.

Petito climbed in through the window, according to the witness, and Laundrie slammed the car into a curb when police pulled the couple over outside town on the entrance ramp to Arches National Park a few minutes later.

The crossroads city’s police department drew scrutiny after a pair of bodycam videos were released in response to public records requests. Petito appeared in hysterics – upset the entire time, crying, motioning at her face and neck, where she suggested Laundrie had grabbed and scratched her. Lawyers for her parents earlier this week said a previously unreleased photo will show blood smeared over her face – something not clearly visible in the bodycam footage.

Laundrie was calm and collected and struck up a conversational tone with officers – despite lying to them about having a cellphone.

Laundrie told the officers that he didn’t have a phone and was afraid Petito was the one who would drive off on him and leave him without a way to communicate.

GABBY PETITO'S MOTHER SLAMS BRIAN LAUNDRIE'S NOTEBOOK CONFESSION

""I was holding onto the keys because I didn’t want to go anywhere, and my big fear is, I don’t have my phone. I don't really – I don’t have a phone. So if she goes off without me…I’m on my own,"" he said in the bodycam video.

About 40 minutes later, they asked him for his phone number. He took a phone out of his pocket. But the officers never pressed him on this inconsistency.

Police made no arrests or citations despite a Utah statute requiring one to be issued in domestic violence incidents. After interviewing both Petito and Laundrie, as well as another witness, officers ruled out domestic violence and deemed the incident a ""mental health break.""

An outside investigation into Moab police’s handling of the Aug. 12 stop found ""unintentional mistakes"" – and issued recommendations on how the department should move forward.

Moab has not provided Fox News Digital with any documents, comment or confirmation that any of these recommendations had been followed. A city spokesperson declined to comment Monday citing a policy on pending litigation.

Price, Utah, Police Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, who conducted the outside review, did not respond to requests for an interview.

""I am confident and comfortable in stating the mistakes that were made were not made intentionally,"" he wrote in the report.

Pratt, who also did not respond to an interview request and is named in a pending notice of claim filed by Petito’s parents, is quoted in Ratcliffe’s report as skeptical of Laundrie’s innocence.

BRIAN LAUNDRIE SEARCH: FAMILY LAWYER ADDRESSES RUMORS PARENTS PLANTED EVIDENCE IN FLORIDA SWAMP

""Brian didn't get away with anything for being cute, and Brian showed more red flags than a Chinese Communist rally going on that he was a s----- boyfriend,"" Pratt told Ratcliffe. But, he claimed, ""I couldn't charge him. The fingernail thing, the way it was described by [the redacted witness] and Gabby, even if I didn't clarify it with him, that's not something I can arrest him for.""

Police ultimately ordered the couple to split up for the night. They left Petito with the converted camper van and drove Laundrie to a motel on Main Street, where the manager told Fox News Digital he could not confirm that the 23-year-old actually spent the night.

""We believe that these officers were negligent, and their negligence contributed to Gabby’s death,"" said Bryan Stewart, a Salt Lake City-based attorney representing the Petito and Schmidt families. ""They did not understand the law and did not apply the law properly in Gabby’s situation.""

Brian’s Break and Gabby’s Final Days

The couple's Aug. 12 fight, in part, grew out of an argument they'd had at a Moab coffee shop as Petito worked on her travel videos, according to conversations captured on police bodycam.

On Aug. 17, 2021, Laundrie flew home to Florida alone. During this break, Petito posted a video to her Van Life YouTube channel, painting a peachy portrait of the first half of the couple’s journey. Her REI water bottle, hung prominently in the back of the van in this video, would later turn up near Laundrie’s remains.

Laundrie returned to Utah where he and Petito resumed their road trip on Aug. 23.

Petito made her final Instagram post on Aug. 25. That’s also the last day she spoke with her family, according to her mother, Nichole Schmidt.

On or around Aug. 28, according to a lawsuit filed by Petito’s parents against Laundrie’s, the aspiring travel blogger was killed in Bridger-Teton National Forest north of Jackson, Wyoming. An FBI-led search effort found her remains there on Sept. 19. Laundrie confessed to the killing in a notebook entry found near his remains the following October, as Fox News Digital was first to report.

After Petito’s death, Laundrie drove cross-country from Wyoming to his parent’s house in North Port, Florida. He arrived on Sept. 1 and refused to speak with police or answer questions from the public. The Laundrie family went camping from Sept. 6 to 8, as Petito’s parents were still desperate for answers. Within days, Laundrie snuck off into the nearby Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park and shot himself in the head, according to the FBI.

BRIAN LAUNDRIE FOUND: PARENTS MAY HAVE JUST MISSED UNCOVERING REMAINS THEMSELVES

Fox News Digital was in the park with Laundrie’s parents and investigators five weeks later – when they found his partial remains and a dry bag that contained a handwritten confession, in which he wrote, ""I ended her life.""

""I thought it was merciful, that it is what she wanted, but I see now all the mistakes I made,"" he continued. ""I panicked. I was in shock.""

Laundrie was the only person of interest and suspect in Petito’s death. She was beaten and strangled, according to the Teton County coroner Dr. Brent Blue.

The Lawsuit Against Moab Police

In addition to a pair of lawsuits filed against Laundrie’s parents, Petito’s family has also filed a $50 million notice of claim against the Moab Police Department, Officers Eric Pratt and Daniel Robbins, as well as former Assistant Chief Braydon Palmer and former Chief Bret Edge. They are alleging negligence and poor training on behalf of the city are to blame for their daughter’s death.

But such claims are hard to prove, according to legal experts.

Mike Padden, a St. Paul-based civil rights attorney who has battled Minneapolis police in a wrongful death case, said the Moab police will likely claim immunity.

""With a case like that, it’s difficult, I think it’s gonna be a really tough case for the plaintiff,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""The lawyers representing law enforcement have probably taken the position that their clients are entitled to immunity – and I think that will be a really strong argument.""

He predicted a motion to dismiss could come quickly.

He also said the court might find Ratcliffe’s independent investigation inadmissible.

""That’s evidence that would invade the province of the jury,"" he said. ""That would typically not be admissible because it’s an entity that’s looking at the facts and reaching a conclusion – and that’s for the jury to decide.""

Or, he said, the report could help the defense.

""They may have made the wrong decision, but that’s the whole point here – that’s why they have immunity,"" he said. ""It’s a difficult decision, and even if they ultimately didn’t make the right decision, they should not be treated unfairly for not making the right decision.""

Neama Rahmani, a Los Angeles-based trial attorney and former federal prosecutor who has been following the Petito story since it began, agreed.

""The Petito lawsuit against the Moab Police Department will likely be dismissed,"" he said. ""Law enforcement is generally immune from civil liability for a failure to act, unless there is a specific legal duty like a duty to provide medical aide.""

He said the Petito’s have a better case against Laundrie’s parents, if they can prove they helped their son escape after the slaying.

""Though the Moab officers probably should have arrested Laundrie, or both Laundrie and Petito, that failure is not actionable under civil law,"" he said.

Padden said he thinks the Petito-Schmidt family could fare better with a federal lawsuit against Moab than in Utah state court.

Attorneys for the Petito-Schmidt family said they would argue that immunity in this case is unconstitutional and would allow the department to escape responsibility for its own actions.

Steve Bertolino, an attorney for Laundrie’s parents, said their son had not told them about the Moab incident, and they only learned of it when Fox News Digital exposed the Moab 911 call last September.

"George Floyd protests in NYC turn violent: Officers punched, pelted, more than 40 people arrested","New York City police arrested more than 40 demonstrators Thursday evening after violent protests that followed the death of a man in police custody in Minnesota earlier in the week, police said.

Demonstrators turned out to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after an encounter with Minneapolis police on Monday. Video of the incident went viral and has led to protests around the U.S. -- including incidents of looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The NYPD told Fox News that multiple officers sustained injuries, including one who was struck in the head with a garbage can and another who was punched in the face.

Some protesters spit at officers -- despite mandates to wear a mask in public and practice social distancing in the city hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.

Another protestor attempted to remove an officer's gun from its holster, a police spokesperson told Fox News.

""Peaceful protest is always the best way to protest,"" the spokesperson urged.

In total, the FDNY confirmed to Fox News four police officers were injured and transported to nearby hospitals.

GEORGE FLOYD UNREST IN MINNESOTA: FEDS, LAW ENFORCEMENT CALL FOR CALM, TIME TO INVESTIGATE AMID RIOTS

One woman who was arrested allegedly was carrying a knife, police said.

Some of the protesters hurled bottles at officers, resulting in more than five arrests near Union Square Park, the New York Post reported. As the day went on, the marchers moved downtown and the number of protesters arrested continued to climb, with police confirming that more than 40 people had been arrested by 9:30 p.m.

Those arrested included the individual who allegedly threw a garbage can at an officer's head and another person accused of punching a female NYPD inspector in the chest.

An abundance of videos shared on social media showed protesters clashing with police, as well as scenes of more peaceful marching and chanting.

In some videos, the crowd could be heard chanting “Black lives matter” or “Hands up, don’t shoot.”

Demonstrations continued as the sun went down, with throngs of people packing the streets in various parts of Manhattan.

In one video, a police officer holding a camcorder repeatedly told protesters to “back up” as other officers made an arrest behind him and a swarm of masked, young people surrounded them.

Although most of the protesters and police officers could be seen wearing face masks, many in the crowd appeared to flout the city’s social-distancing guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic.

One Twitter user noted the irony, writing, “very hard to social distance on the steps,” along with a photo that showed a throng of people outside a city building.

The New York protests erupted even after the city’s police commissioner, Dermot Shea, condemned the Minnesota incident.

“This is not acceptable anywhere,” he tweeted about Floyd’s death.

Protests have broken out in other cities as well.

Fox LA journalist Bill Melugin tweeted a video Thursday evening that showed a crowd of protesters surrounding a California Highway Patrol cruiser in the middle of the street. At least one person kicked it as multiple people shouted profanities.

In Denver, at least five gunshots rang out near a protest at the Colorado state Capitol, officials said; no injuries were reported.

Local and federal investigations were underway in Minnesota into the police officers’ handling of Floyd’s arrest, and U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said Thursday that both President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr actively were monitoring the situation.

Shootings on Saturday – a newly declared federal holiday honoring Juneteenth – were reported during events in Colorado, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana and South Carolina, among others, with at least 33 wounded, according to authorities and multiple reports.

Speaking to reporters following multiple shootings in her city on Saturday, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw noted that many began the day celebrating the designation of Juneteenth as a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery but ""we again found ourselves lamenting as an otherwise beautiful afternoon had been sullied with gun violence.""

Parades, picnics and lessons in history were offered Saturday to commemorate Juneteenth in the U.S., just two days after Congress and President Joe Biden created a federal holiday to observe the end of slavery.

But the day was also marked with tragedy for some.

A 22-year-old San Francisco man was killed and six others were wounded in a shooting in Oakland near a Juneteenth celebration, police said. It wasn't known whether the violence was connected with the event, police said.

The shooting occurred shortly before 6:30 p.m. about a mile north of the Lake Merritt Amphitheater, where about 1,000 people had gathered throughout the day to commemorate June 19, 1865, police said.

The other five victims, males ages 16 to 27, and two adult women were hospitalized in stable condition, police said.

Investigators said they were trying to determine a motive for the shooting and identify suspects. Police said two men running from the scene with guns were arrested, but it was unclear if they were responsible for the shooting, the Bay Area News Group reported.

Andrew Simpson was jogging near the lake when he heard gunshots, according to the report.

""Out of the corner of my eye I saw a guy with a gun pointing at a car. Everyone started sprinting and screaming,"" Simpson told the Bay Area News Group.

Witnesses said some people ran into the water when shots rang out.

""Tonight a joyous occasion at our Lake Merritt was marred by a senseless act of gun violence,"" said Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf in a statement.

The Oakland Police Department and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering a reward of up to $40,000 for information leading to arrests.

PHILADELPHIA

Police say a triple shooting killed two men and wounded a 3-year-old boy in West Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon.

The gunfire shortly before 2:30 p.m. Saturday hit two 23-year-old men multiple times, police said. Both were taken to Presbyterian Hospital by private vehicle and pronounced dead minutes later. The child was shot three times in the leg and was listed in stable condition at the hospital.

SHERIFF’S DEPUTY SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES BY ARMED SUSPECT, FULL-BLOWN MANHUNT UNDERWAY

According to WTXF, two unidentified shooters are believed to have opened fire after exiting a white vehicle. They then fled the scene in the car.

Outlaw described the shooting as ""disturbing and sickening,"" according to the report.

""We should never tolerate violence against our children, as all of us - not just the police - are charged with the responsibility to keep them safe from danger and harm,"" Outlaw said in an emailed statement to the local FOX station.

Later in the day, three others were shot at a graduation party around 7:30 p.m. The victims were two men, ages 18 and 21, and a 36-year-old woman, the report states.

BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA

Two people were killed and four others were wounded during a shooting early Saturday morning following a concernt at a Baton Rouge bar, according to a local report.

The Advocate reported that Capital Park Bar and Grill had just closed about 2 a.m. Saturday following a concert when the gunfire erupted at an adjacent parking lot. The bar reportedly insisted in an Instagram post that the shooting ""didn't happen in or on Capital Park property.""

According to the report, numerous people opened fire after a dispute broke out between bar patrons after they left the property. The deceased victims were reportedly identified as Ladarius Alexander, 20, and 25-year-old Kyren Walton.

GRANGER, INDIANA

Five people were shot, one fatally, during an overnight Juneteenth party in Granger.

A large crowd of people was attending a ""Juneteenth Summer Bash"" around 4 a.m. Sunday at a shopping center in Granger when the shooting occurred, according to St. Joseph County Metro Homicide and local news station WSBT.

Police identified the victim as 26-year-old Victor Anthwan Kyle, Jr. The other four victims’ injuries were not considered life-threatening.

In a statement, St. Joseph County Metro Homicide Unit said a ""very large crowd"" had attended a party held in a bar at the shopping center and ""multiple weapons were discharged.""

Further details, including the motive, were not immediately released.

One person died and four others were wounded in an early Sunday morning shooting during a gathering ""related to a Juneteenth celebration,"" according to police and the Denver Post.

According to the report, the crowd had gathered in a strip mall’s parking lot when shots rang out around 4:10 a.m. The Denver Post cited police in reporting that the group had begun to congregate in the parking lot after organizers of a Juneteenth-related event at one of the strip mall’s locations began denying people entry.

""At some point earlier in the evening the presumed organizers of the celebration began denying access to the unit,"" police said in a statement obtained by the news outlet. ""This led many attendees to gather in the parking lot.""

The victims were four men and one woman, police said. According to the report, one of the male victims ultimately could not be saved.

Police said the shooting was ""possibly gang-related"" and that investigators had recovered at least 114 shell casings were recovered as of Sunday.

CLOVER, SOUTH CAROLINA

At least three people were shot during a late-night Juneteenth celebration on Saturday, the York County Sheriff’s Office said in a related press release.

Sheriff officials said the shots ""were fired during a Juneteenth celebration"" around 11:30 p.m. at the intersection of Oakridge Road and Bellaire Circle. One of the victims was a 17-year-old boy, officials said. The ages of the other two victims were not provided.

Authorities said multiple cars were also struck by gunfire.

Just 35 minutes earlier, a victim told police he, his wife, and their 8- and 11-year-old kids were leaving the same celebration when a road rage incident ensued.

""The victim tells Detectives that a car leaving the same Juneteenth celebration abruptly pulled in front of their car which nearly caused a collision,"" authorities said. ""The victim told Detectives he honked his horn and flashed his headlights at the car. Moments later, the suspect car pulled beside the victim and fired shots into the side of the car.""

No one was injured, but a bullet hole was discovered in the rear of the car where one of the kids was sitting.

FLINT, MICHIGAN

A 19-year-old Michigan woman died after exchanging gunfire with a police officer who was controlling traffic near a weekend Juneteenth parade, authorities said.

‘LAWLESSNESS:’ Cataloguing Portland’s Year of Violence,"Residents of Oregon's most populous city dealt with unprecedented homicides, rising property crime and a general feeling of ""lawlessness"" during 2022, but Portland leaders have taken some steps to set a different tone for the new year.

""The rise in crime and the houseless and homeless population, that continues to be a challenge that I think the city is starting to get their arms wrapped around,"" business owner Katherine Sealy told Fox News.

PORTLAND STORE SHUTS DOWN, POSTS BLISTERING NOTE ON FRONT DOOR SLAMMING RAMPANT CRIME: 'CITY IS IN PERIL'

The city set a new homicide record for the second year in a row, with more than 90 recorded killings so far. The city is considering a proposal to put controversial gunshot detection technology in the five most violent Portland neighborhoods, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.

Total violent crime increased marginally in 2022, but property crime rose 16% between January and October compared to the same period last year. Thefts, vandalism and frightening encounters with people experiencing mental health crises have prompted many businesses to leave the city.

""With the police force overburdened, people think they can do anything now,"" Carol, a longtime Portland resident, told Fox News in September. ""I feel like it won't always be like this, but right now we're in the midst of … lawlessness.""

Police response times to emergencies hit levels not seen in at least a decade, according to Portland Police Bureau data, with the average high-priority call waiting upwards of 20 minutes for a response in October. Loretta Guzman, whose café was vandalized after advertising a Coffee with a Cop event, said her customers tell her it's like the police have ""almost disappeared.""

""They have questions like, ‘Where are the police? How come they can’t come?’"" Guzman said in late October. ""We used to see them all the time.""

Police have blamed the problem on staffing shortages, but the bureau may soon get some relief. There are now 804 sworn members, building back from a low of 773 in September, according to the bureau.

Voters ousted far-left City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty in favor of the more moderate Democrat Rene Gonzalez, whose campaign offices were vandalized twice in the run-up to the election. Portlanders also voted to overhaul their government by more than doubling the number of City Council members and scrapping the city's commission system.

Lead cop on Gabby Petito 911 call accused of domestic violence himself,"EXCLUSIVE: A Utah woman claims she received death threats from a former police chief who resigned from his job and later played a prominent role as a patrol officer in the 2021 traffic stop of Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie.

""He has no business being a f---ing cop,"" the woman, who has asked not to have her name published out of concerns for her safety, told Fox News Digital.

She was talking about Eric Pratt, one of two Moab police officers who interacted with Petito and Laundrie in the entranceway to Arches National Park just two weeks before her strangling death in Wyoming.

She is accusing him of telling her he'd smash her with a crowbar after she threatened to go public with sultry details of their 2017 affair.

GABBY PETITO BODYCAM FOOTAGE: WHO IS OFFICER ERIC PRATT?

""If the officer responding to Gabby’s situation is an abuser himself who would threaten a girlfriend’s life, it makes sense why he believed Gabby’s abuser and ignored her injuries,"" Nichole Schmidt, Petito’s mother, told Fox News Wednesday. ""With him in charge, I don’t think Gabby stood a chance.""

The handling of the Petito-Laundrie call, first reported by Fox News Digital, resulted in no arrests or citations despite a Utah law requiring such actions following domestic violence incidents, prompted an independent investigation that faulted the officers for ""unintentional mistakes"" after they deemed Petito, not Laundrie to be the aggressor.

The Utah woman said she contacted attorneys for Petito’s parents after learning Pratt had been promoted to detective and made a school resource officer in Moab. He had resigned from his role as Salina police chief in 2017, according to a letter he wrote at the time. She says the move came after she confronted the mayor about his alleged mistreatment of her.

In 2017, the woman said, she was going through a divorce, and Pratt was still married to the ex-wife he mentions on bodycam video during a conversation with Laundrie.

UTAH GABBY PETITO COP HAD ROMANTIC RIVAL ARRESTED IN 2019 DOMESTIC INCIDENT THAT WAS LATER DISMISSED

The two had known each other for years, and began a sexual relationship that morphed into an ""emotional friendship,"" she said. At one point, she said, her conscience caught up with her and she disclosed her affair and other alleged trysts to Pratt’s then-wife.

They had a contentious falling out, she said, and she told the mayor to get him to leave her alone, or she’d go public with the affair and intimate details.

""I had already gone to mayor, [and] he was preparing to resign,"" she said.

It had been about two weeks since they’d last spoke, and she was shopping at Walmart with her daughter when she ran into him.

GABBY PETITO AND BRIAN LAUNDRIE: BOMBSHELL VIDEO EMERGES SHOWING HOURS BEFORE MURDER

He followed her out of the parking lot to a gas station in Richfield, she said, flashing the lights of his personal vehicle behind her.

""He went to back seat and started talking to my daughter, telling her how adults don’t always see eye-to-eye but in the end hopefully everybody can be friends,"" she said.

Then he went in, bought the girl some candy.

""He came around to my window and told me that if anything ever got out he’d kill me with a crowbar,"" the woman alleged.

About a year later, she claimed he asked her to meet him at a Denny’s restaurant. She did, they had a long talk, and she left with ""peace of mind.""

""I didn’t have to be looking over my shoulder anymore, anything like that,"" she said.

LISTEN TO TRUE CRIME PODCASTS FROM FOX NEWS

But, she said, he allegedly made another alarming statement during the conversation: ""Had this been the day prior, there would have been a grave dug and you would’ve been in it.""

""I asked him what changed his mind about not wanting to kill me anymore, and he said he had decided that it wasn’t me that had ruined his life, it was one of the other girls that he had an affair with,"" she claimed.

Pratt did not respond to a request for comment.

The Utah Department of Public Safety told Fox News Digital it had no record of any ethical, criminal or other complaints filed against him during his time as chief in Salina.

He is named in a wrongful death lawsuit that Petito’s parents have announced against the city of Moab and its police department. Also named are former Moab Police Chief Bret Edge, former Assistant Chief Braydon Palmer and Officer Daniel Robbins, who initiated the stop.

The city has declined to comment on the pending litigation.

GABBY PETITO MURDER: BRIAN LAUNDRIE'S NOTEBOOK CONFESSION REVEALED, ‘I ENDED HER LIFE’

The Petito family lawsuit alleges that Pratt and Robbins failed to handle the call properly after a witness reported seeing Laundrie hitting Petito, grab her phone and try to drive off without her outside an organic grocer in the heart of town.

In Pratt’s bodycam footage, he is heard asking fellow responding officer Daniel Robbins, ""How far do you want to go with this?""

WATCH THE MOAB BODYCAM:

""You know why the domestic assault code is there. It's there to protect people,"" Pratt continued. ""The reason why they don't give us discretion on these things is because too many times women at risk want to go back to their abuser, they just wanted him to stop, they don't want to have to be separated, they don't want him to be charged, they don't want him to go to jail and then they end up getting worse and worse treatment and end up getting killed.""

This remark in the bodycam footage also caught the attention of the former fling. She said it reminded her of part of the 2019 podcast interview in which he talked about finding ""loopholes"" to get out of charging people during stops.

The family filed a notice of claim for Petito's wrongful death in August and is expected to make an announcement in connection with the case Thursday morning.

""The allegations made against Officer Pratt, that he harassed and threatened to kill a former girlfriend, are deeply troubling but may explain why he handled the investigation in such a biased manner and failed to protect Gabby,"" Petito attorney Brian C. Stewart of the law firm of Parker & McConkie said. ""These allegations and other misconduct by Pratt should have been disqualifying for employment Moab City Police Department.""

As Fox News Digital reported last week, Pratt had also left the Moab Police Department for some time after an incident in 2019.

He played a role in the domestic violence-related arrest of a romantic rival while having an affair with his wife, according to court documents. The case was later dropped, and the record was expunged.

Miami Beach violence driven by gun-toting spring breakers coming in by car,"Miami Beach is packed with visitors from around the country – and the world – as spring break aligns with a major dance music festival, at the same time city officials declared a state of emergency over a spike in violence.

""Certainly, the guns that are here didn’t come on an airplane, so we know much of the worse conduct is coming from people who live somewhere near South Florida,"" Mayor Dan Gelber told reporters during a news briefing.

He’s talking about a lot of guns – at least 100 seized in the past five weeks during the spring break season in addition to two shootings earlier this week that left five people injured in the heart of South Beach’s Ocean Drive nightlife scene.

The pair of shootings prompted city officials to impose a curfew for South Beach in a bid to stop the violence.

MIAMI BEACH TO IMPOSE SPRING BREAK CURFEW THIS WEEKEND AFTER SHOOTINGS INJURE 5

Separately, police said they’d arrested 618 people between the start of the season and March 20. Sunday was also the busiest day in history at Miami International Airport, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

""Since Feb. 18, which is when we amplified staffing, more than 50% of citywide arrests were of people who reside in Miami-Dade County,"" a Miami Beach Police spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

One of them is 19-year-old Derrick Mitchell, a resident of nearby Hialeah who police accuse of injuring two women during a shootout on Ocean Drive around 1 a.m. Monday. The other gunman remains at large.

A day earlier and just a block away, three other people were wounded in another shooting. Police said they were still investigating Thursday and could not announce any arrests.

The city also reported at least six other incidents involving shots fired.

Fox News Digital witnessed three arrests in as many hours Tuesday night, after the city declared a state of emergency, but before the curfew was scheduled to go into effect.

One involved a blue Dodge Charger speeding down Ocean Drive, allegedly weaving from lane to lane with a passenger hanging out of the window, all with throngs of pedestrians packing the bar and restaurant lined sidewalk.

Of the five people inside, who police initially handcuffed at 14th Street and Collins Avenue, two were taken away in separate squad cars. The other three were released at the scene.

Police documents identify the detained men as a 21-year-old driver from Brooklyn, New York, who was charged with reckless driving, and a 19-year-old who police said provided a fake ID.

""As officers approached the vehicle, the occupants of the vehicle became irate and belligerent,"" a police report reads. One of them allegedly reached for an unidentified object, prompting police to draw their weapons, but the incident came to a conclusion without any injuries.

JORGE MASVIDAL ACCUSED OF FELONY BATTERY IN BRAWL AT MIAMI BEACH RESTAURANT

Just two blocks away later in the evening, patrons at a crowded restaurant helped apprehend an armed teen after a security guard said he saw it in his waistband.

A customer told police he saw the suspect walking toward him on 11th Street and that the 15-year-old lifted his shirt, revealing the weapon. Based on his approach and the way he allegedly flashed the gun, the man, who was wearing a large gold chain, told police he believed he was about to be robbed.

He confronted the teen and a security guard recovered the gun, according to a police report. When police arrived, they took control of the scene and eventually discovered the gun had been reported lost just five days earlier on March 17.

The suspect, from Miami Gardens, faces a felony charge of concealed carry of a firearm.

As police worked to rein in the spring break crowds, UFC star Jorge Masvidal on Monday allegedly assaulted fellow fighter Colby Covington at the Papi Steak restaurant Monday, just weeks after losing a sanctioned bout with the same opponent.

The curfew is an attempt to reign in the chaos after violence shocked the tourist hot spot, where international travelers and Americans have flocked this week for spring break, the nearby Ultra music festival and the beautiful oceanfront beaches.

But it also reveals the difficulty local police face trying to both protect the mix of visitors, locals and businesses while playing the side role of public relations on behalf of the community, according to Betsy Brantner Smith, a former police sergeant and spokesperson for the National Police Association.

""It’s no longer just about open containers and underage drinking,"" she told Fox News Digital Wednesday. ""You’ve also got multiple shootings…in South Beach, you’re balancing spring breakers with more discerning travelers and consumers.""

On top of that, she added, ""criminals, whether it’s gang members or drug dealers or whoever, they go on vacation too. And a lot of them drive in there carrying firearms.""

One business owner on Washington Avenue, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of scaring away customers, told Fox News Digital that the annual spring break crowd has gotten larger and rowdier over the 15 years she’s been in business at that location.

""Spring break was more like young kids coming to have a good time,"" she said. ""During these times, you’ve got hotels that don’t even want to rent…Things changed. They’re carrying guns around.""

And the arrival of spring breakers also attracts other people, she said – including nonstudents who are college aged, panhandlers and more. Last Sunday, she said, two apparent bums broke out brawling out in front of her store over a stolen wallet.

It took more than a half hour for police to arrive, she said, because they had their hands full a few blocks away.

To assist with enforcement, city police have asked for and received additional resources from Miami-Dade County.

Authorities told Fox News Digital that those resources may include help with traffic enforcement, K-9 units and the county police helicopter.

Even before the curfew took effect, however, things looked to be slowing down. After Tuesday’s wild night, Wednesday saw dramatically smaller crowds. Open parking spaces were visible on many streets.

One Ocean Drive doorman said it looked like the slowest night since spring break season kicked off in February.

Staff at the Clevelander bar, a major part of the South Beach nightlife, said they expected to lose money due to the curfew but weren’t opposed to going home early.

Nearby, police pulled over a young man driving a car with Georgia plates. They wrote him a ticket for an unspecified traffic infraction, ""not speeding,"" and he drove off.

By 11 p.m., many bars and restaurants were closed and people had begun clearing out, some of them congregating around the few places that still had the music playing.

When asked where everyone had gone, one police officer looked up and down the street and joked, ""Don’t jinx us.""

Due to differing schedules at schools around the country, the spring break season can span two to six weeks in destination cities like Miami Beach, from mid-February to the end of March.

Minneapolis gang violence intensifies after police defunding: 'It's like you're playing Russian roulette',"In North Minneapolis, at the intersection of North Lyndale and West Broadway, a crowd gathers every night. They loiter, they smoke, they drink, they deal drugs and do drugs. The open-air drug market takes on the form of a street party, until the gunfire rings out – and that happens almost every night.

Two nights we were in Minneapolis and both nights there was gunfire at the intersection. The first night, two people were shot. It is so severe, the gas station on the corner has been nicknamed by the locals: murder station. People who live close say the violence, drug use and gang activity in North Minneapolis has become intolerable.

THOMAS LANE, EX-MINNEAPOLIS COP, SENTENCED TO 3 YEARS FOR MANSLAUGHTER IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH

The spike in violent crime times out with the defund/disband police movement. Year to date violent crime currently shows a 29% increase over 2019, the year before George Floyd was murdered. The year of the riots, violent crime jumped 20% in Minneapolis. ""I think it really flared after the George Floyd situation,"" says King. After budget cuts and a public campaign by the Minneapolis city council to do away with the Minneapolis Police, the MPD is down 300 officers. As a result, people in the trouble spots complain it can take as long as an hour to get a response to a 911 call. ""It takes police forever to get here now,"" says King.

""There’s definitely a belief among the youth and young adults that there are no consequences for their behavior because they see a reduced number of police officers,"" He says noting that police are so short-staffed, investigators are tasked with day to day policing. ""So there’s no kind of proactive work going on.""

I spoke with an older, but still active member of the Gangster Disciples in the Twin Cities. He didn’t want to use his name but tells me the break-down of the gang structure contributes to the violence. The gangs have digressed to armed cliques. There is no central or enduring leadership. When a decision is made to shoot someone over a petty dispute, there is no heavyweight within the gang to stop it. ""Now these days these gangs are reckless, real reckless,"" the gangster says. ""There used to be structure in there, no women no kids. Now, it’s just a free for all, anybody can get involved."" Martin has a similar observation of the gangs. ""They’re younger, less organized and they’re out there carrying guns because they’re not getting stopped as often and when they run into rivals they use those guns.""

The gangster says people can get shot anywhere. But the people loitering and drinking on the street, the way they do at Broadway and Lyndale, are only having fun until the next shooting.

“The violence must stop,” Brown wrote in the Thursday statement. “There is no place for white supremacy or vigilantism in Oregon. All who perpetrate violent crimes must be held equally accountable.”

While she didn’t specifically mention left-wing protesters who have thrown objects at police officers, vandalized and set buildings on fire, a spokesman said her statement “is a collective call to action for an end to violence in Portland and affirms that those who commit violent acts must be held accountable.”

PORTLAND POLICE CHIEF URGES ELECTED OFFICIALS TO 'HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE' FOR 'NIGHTLY VIOLENCE'

Last Saturday, Aaron “Jay” Danielson, a member of the conservative Patriot Prayer group, was shot and killed during a clash between racial injustice protesters and Trump supporters as they drove a caravan through downtown.

Michael Forest Reinoehl, a person of interest in the fatal shooting and antifa supporter, was reportedly shot dead by authorities Thursday evening after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

He was shot by law enforcement after drawing a gun on officers, the Associated Press said.

In a Thursday Vice report, Reinoehl said he had acted in self-defense.

Brown's condemnation of violence was also signed by almost two-dozen state and local politicians, a host of organizations including the local NAACP chapter, and the city's professional sports teams: the Trailblazers NBA team, the Timbers soccer team and the Thorns women's soccer squad.

Philadelphia reached 500 homicides as gun violence continues to plague city streets,"Philadelphia reached 500 homicides this week amid concerns from elected officials about how to respond to violent crime playing out in city streets.

Despite the milestone, the murder rate for 2022 is slightly lower than last year, according to police data. In 2021, the city reported 562 killings. Aside from last year, the number of slayings this year is the highest the city has seen in years.

""As of today, 500 people’s lives have been cut short by senseless violence in our city,"" Mayor Jim Kenney said during a Monday news conference. ""That's 500 of our friends, neighbors, colleagues and family members.

Philadelphia has seen a steady increase in murders since 2016, when 268 people were killed.

PHILADELPHIA TODDLER TRIPLETS LOSE FATHER AND MOTHER DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN MURDER-SUICIDE

This year's murder statistic came a day after the Philadelphia District Attorney's office announced the arrests of multiple gang members engaged in gun trafficking, shootings and killings related to a July 4, 2021, mass shooting and the murder of a 15-year-old boy months earlier.

The city has tried taking steps to curb the gun violence. In October, a judge blocked officials from imposing a weapons ban at its parks and recreation facilities and playgrounds after Kenney signed an executive order.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department and Kenney's office for comment.

Philadelphia's crime problem has caught the attention of state lawmakers, who took the unprecedented step last month of impeaching District Attorney Larry Krasner over the violence. Critics have cited his progressive policies as part of a pattern that enables criminals.

The state House impeached Krasner 107-85, alleging he engaged in misconduct in office and obstructed a House committee investigation. Krasner characterized the impeachment as a Republican-led power play.

""They have impeached me without presenting a single shred of evidence connecting our policies to any uptick in crime,"" he said at the time. ""We were never given the opportunity to defend our ideas and policies – policies I would have been proud to explain. That Pennsylvania Republicans willfully avoided hearing the facts about my office is shameful.""

"Pro-life pregnancy clinics still being targeted by violence, 3 months after Supreme Court leak","Pro-life pregnancy clinics are still being targeted by violence three months after the infamous Supreme Court leak revealed the court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Police in Minnesota are looking for the vandals responsible for smashing windows and spray-painting in red, ""if abortion isn’t safe, neither are you,"" at Abria Pregnancy Resources in St. Paul late Sunday or early Monday, a local ABC affiliate reported.

The clinic’s director, Angela Franey, previously spoke out in support of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to an abortion, which was ultimately handed down in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on June 24, nearly eight weeks after a draft opinion of the decision leaked to the press.

The clinic remained closed on Monday as staff cleaned up the damage but reopened as usual on Tuesday.

ELIZABETH WARREN ACCUSED PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS OF ‘TORTURING’ WOMEN. HERE'S WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO

""It’s safe now and no one was hurt,"" Franey told The Catholic Spirit, the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. ""Our goal is to make things safe and secure again, to pick up the pieces, to meet the challenge face to face and continue to overcome these things with good, because that’s what we do.""

The incident followed acts of vandalism against three other pro-life clinics in St. Paul, Minneapolis and Northfield in recent weeks. The Northfield Women’s Clinic, about 40 miles south of the Twin Cities, was vandalized last week with its front window smashed and the words, ""Fake Clinic Not Safe,"" spray-painted on the building.

MIAMI PRO-LIFE CLINIC VANDALIZED: ‘IF ABORTIONS AREN’T SAFE, NEITHER ARE YOU

The center’s director, Teresa Edwards, told the Northfield News, ""It has been a sad week.""

""Ever since the overturn of Roe, we have been getting suspicious calls and emails,"" she said. ""What’s especially sad is that we offer so many pregnancy resource services to the community.""

The vandalism in Minnesota makes up only a fraction of the attacks on crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) across the country since the May Supreme Court leak. Within a week of the leak, at least five CPCs were attacked and dozens more have been targeted since then. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America issued a study in June reporting more than 40 ""incidents of violence, vandalism and intimidation"" since the leak.

Progressive politicians, such as Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have also verbally attacked CPCs. Last month, Warren accused the clinics of ""torturing"" pregnant women seeking abortion information and called on the federal government to ""shut them down all around the country.""

""In Massachusetts right now, those crisis pregnancy centers that are there to fool people who are looking for pregnancy termination help outnumber true abortion clinics by three to one,"" Warren told NBC 10 Boston.

Democrats like Warren say crisis pregnancy centers, or CPCs, disseminate misinformation about the risks associated with abortion in an effort to persuade women to give birth. She introduced the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act in June, which would direct the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe rules ""prohibiting disinformation"" in the advertising of abortion services.

CPCs are typically faith-based and offer reproductive health care, prenatal care and counseling to help expecting parents choose life over abortion. Most centers offer free STI testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal vitamins, ultrasounds, post-abortion care, parenting classes, adoption referrals, and even free baby clothes and diapers once the baby is born. The centers receive funding primarily through private donations and grants from religious organizations, but many states also allocate public money to the centers via programs like ""Choose Life"" license plates, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute.

AT LEAST 5 PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS VANDALIZED WITHIN A WEEK OF SCOTUS OPINION LEAK

""Long-term data shows that pro-life pregnancy centers consistently have customer satisfaction rates above 95 percent, and a significant number of women find support at pro-life pregnancy centers through word-of-mouth referrals in their community,"" Nichole Wilson, executive director of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said Wednesday in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. ""The inflammatory rhetoric of pro-abortion politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, flies in the face of reason.""

""Here are the facts,"" she continued. ""In 2019, more than 2,700 pro-life pregnancy centers served roughly two million women, men, and youth with nearly $270 million in services, most at little or no charge, and community-based care facilities for women, including Federally Qualified Health Centers and pro-life pregnancy centers, outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 14 to 1.""

""This is what supporting women actually looks like. Attacking pro-life pregnancy centers? Not so much,"" she added.

PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY CLINIC HIRED 24-HOUR SECURITY, SHUT DOWN MOBILE CLINIC, DIRECTOR SAYS IN SENATE HEARING

Heidi Matzke, director of the Alternatives Pregnancy Center in California, said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month that her clinic has been forced to hire 24-hour security amid recent leftist attacks on facilities like hers.

""Just last week… a man approached our care center with an armed machete,"" Matzke said during the July 12 hearing.

""We have been forced to hire 24-hour on site security. We have had to reinforce doors and bullet-proof our walls,"" Matzke continued. ""We've had to paint our building with anti-graffiti coating. We've added cameras, armed our staff with pepper spray and stopped running our mobile clinic because of threats of violence.""

Republicans are demanding that the Department of Justice work to prosecute groups, including one called Jane's Revenge, that are attacking pro-life centers.

""The lack of a response from both the Justice Department and the White House is extremely, extremely disappointing,"" Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said during the hearing. ""Along with the threats against the justices, threats against pro-life and crisis pregnancy centers have dramatically increased since the leak of the Dobbs decision by pro-abortion extremists.""

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., unveiled legislation on July 14 to protect CPCs and houses of worship.

""The Biden Administration has turned a blind eye while radical leftists attack pregnancy care centers and houses of worship,"" said the senator. ""And now left-wing politicians are trying to shut them down.""

The senator's bill would enhance penalties for such attacks by making it a felony punishable with a criminal fine upwards of $25,000. It would also require a seven-year mandatory minimum prison sentence when such attacks result in arson.

Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, both Democrats, have been outspoken against CPCs. Smith last month called the centers a ""sham"" and signaled support for Warren’s comments about shutting them down. Klobuchar slammed the centers as being ""disguised as clinics"" and asked Google to intervene is stopped disinformation from CPCs.

In June, Klobuchar and Smith joined Warren in a letter to Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai, demanding that Google limit the appearance of ""anti-abortion fake clinics.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Klobuchar’s and Smith’s offices to find out if the senators denounce the recent vandalism against CPCs in their state, or if they support Hawley’s bill.

""Senator Klobuchar condemns all violence against these centers,"" Klobuchar spokesperson Jane Meyer told Fox News Digital.

Smith's office did not respond.

Texas police chiefs decry surging violence: 'There's a lack of value for life... no fear of consequences',"A mix of surging crime rates, unprecedented officer attrition, and weak prosecution of violent crime have imperiled the largest police departments in Texas over the last few years, the police chiefs of Houston, San Antonio, and Austin said at the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday.

""There's a lack of value for life and people's health,"" San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said. ""On the street, I think there is no fear of consequences.""

There have been 183 homicides in San Antonio so far this year, an 86.7% increase over the same time frame in 2021, with the deaths of 53 migrants during a human trafficking operation in June inflating the numbers.

Houston saw a massive crime spike in 2021 as the city experienced 473 homicides last year, up from 261 in 2020. Texas' largest city has seen 323 murders so far in 2022, a slight decline from the 327 homicides that were reported during the same time frame last year.

FORT HOOD SOLDIER CHARGED WITH MURDER OF TEXAS WOMAN, BOND SET AT $1 MILLION

Troy Finner, the chief of the Houston Police Department, laid the blame on the coronavirus pandemic's shutdown of the court system and a ""fractured criminal justice system.""

""The DAs are arguing with the police chiefs. Police chiefs are arguing with the judges. Everybody has to come together, but more importantly, you cannot excuse and just act like it's not there,"" Finner said on Saturday. ""

""It's very frustrating to me, as a chief, when our men and women are running to danger and dealing with all of this crap that's out there right now, and nobody wants to talk about the common sense things,"" Finner continued.

""You've got to have a system where violent individuals are tried – they deserve their fair trial – convicted, and put in jail. There's a place for violent offenders. And when we do that, we get it cranked up right, you'll see a reduction in crime, guaranteed.""

TEXAS SHOOTING LEAVES 17-YEAR-OLD AND 5-YEAR-OLD DEAD

Austin saw 89 homicides last year, a record high for the city but still a relatively low number given the state capital's population of about one million. The Austin Police Department's ability to respond to rising crime rates has been complicated by a high level of attrition.

Joseph Chacon, the chief of APD, said that before the coronavirus pandemic, five to seven police officers would leave the force per month on average, but that number jumped to 25 or more a month in the spring of 2020.

""It was really a one-two punch, with COVID hitting in March of 2020, and then the George Floyd incident happening in May,"" Chacon said.

""Between those two, I saw a record number of people resigning and retiring.""

Honduras declares state of emergency over gang violence in the country,"Honduras became the second country in Central America to declare a state of emergency to fight gang crimes like extortion.

For years, street gangs have charged protection money from bus and taxi drivers and store owners in Honduras, as in neighboring El Salvador.

Late Thursday, Honduran President Xiomara Castro proposed a measure to limit constitutional rights so as to round up gang members.

""This social democratic government is declaring war on extortion, just as it has, since the first day, declared wars on corruption, impunity and drug trafficking,"" Castro said. The measure must still be approved by Congress. ""We are going to eradicate extortion in every corner of our country.""

HONDURAS TO LEGALIZE USE OF MORNING-AFTER PILL FOR RAPE VICTIMS

On Friday, Jorge Lanza the leader of the bus operators in Honduras, supported the move, saying bus drivers were tired of being threatened and killed for not paying protection money. Lanza said drivers had been asking for a crackdown for years.

""We can't put up any longer with workers being killed and paying extortion,"" Lanza said. ""We hope these measures work and remain in place.""

Lanza said that 50 drivers have been killed so far in 2022, and a total of 2,500 have been killed over the last 15 years. He estimated the companies and drivers have paid an average of about $10 million per month to the gangs in order to operate.

TOP HONDURAN OFFICIAL SAYS MASS MIGRATION TO US 'POSSIBLE' WHEN TITLE 42 ENDS, STRESSES ECONOMIC HELP

Honduras hasn't specified exactly what the state of emergency would entail, but normally such measures temporarily suspend normal rules regulating arrests and searches; sometime limits on freedom of speech and assembly are implemented as well.

In neighboring El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele requested Congress grant him extraordinary powers after gangs were blamed for 62 killings on March 26, and that emergency decree has been renewed every month since then. It suspends some Constitutional rights and gives police more powers to arrest and hold suspects.

That measure has proved popular among the public in El Salvador, and has resulted in the arrest of more than 56,000 people for alleged gang ties.

"Mexico President Lopez Obrador urges calm amid cartel violence, US government staff told to shelter in place","Mexico President André Manuel López Obrador is urging calm after his country was rocked by several days of cartel-fueled violence.

""I want to tell the people of Mexico to be calm, that there is governance, there is stability,"" López Obrador said during an address from the National Palace in Mexico City.

The president then suggested his adversaries, ""the conservatives,"" were trying to amplify the situation for their own agenda.

""At the same time, there is an interest on the part of our adversaries, the conservatives, to magnify things, to do tabloid, sensationalist journalism,"" he said. ""I don't know if there was a connection, a hidden hand, if this had been set up. What I do know is that our opponents, the corrupt conservatives, help in the black propaganda.""

MEXICO NABS FBI MOST WANTED CARTEL BOSS ACCUSED OF ‘80S KIDNAPPING, MURDER OF DEA AGENT’

Days of widespread drug cartel arson and shootings in four states last week have killed at least 11 people, including a young boy and four radio station employees who were randomly shot on the streets of the border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas on Thursday.

Two days earlier, more than two dozen convenience stores owned by a well-known national chain were set ablaze in the northern state of Guanajuato. Cars and buses were commandeered and burned in neighboring Jalisco state. And two dozen vehicles were hijacked and set on fire in cities on the California border Friday.

The federal government deployed soldiers and National Guard troops to calm residents' fears, but the outbursts of violence raised questions about López Obrador's approach of putting all responsibility for security in the hands of the military rather than civilian police forces.

Over the weekend, U.S. government employees in Tijuana, Mexico were instructed to stay sheltered and out of public places as a precaution.

"Sinaloa, Mexico, engulfed by violence, chaos after El Chapo son arrest, ahead of Biden visit to country","The state of Sinaloa, Mexico, is being hit with a wave of violence, officials say, following the arrest of the son of jailed drug cartel kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzmán in the days leading up to President Biden’s visit to the country.

Sinaloa state governor Ruben Rocha told Reuters that so far seven members of Mexico’s security forces have been killed and 21 were injured in a dozen clashes within the northern Sinaloa state, home to the cartel with the same name that once was run by El Chapo. Ovidio Guzmán, his son, was arrested there Thursday by Mexican authorities, officials confirmed.

Rocha also said there have been 25 acts of looting and 250 vehicles have been set on fire to block roads, with most of the unrest happening in the city of Culiacan.

""We continue to work on controlling the situation,"" Cristobal Castaneda, the region’s public security chief, said Thursday as authorities shuttered schools and urged residents to stay indoors.

EL CHAPO’S SON HAS BEEN CAPTURED IN SINALOA IN MEXICAN MILITARY OPERATION

Mexican authorities previously detained Ovidio Guzmán in 2019, but quickly released him to avoid a massive confrontation with cartel forces.

Culiacan’s airport also has been swept up in the violence, with airline Aeromexico reporting that one of its planes was hit with bullets ahead of a scheduled flight to Mexico City, according to Reuters.

UN condemns Haitian gang violence spike,"A powerful gang has taken over numerous communities in central Haiti in recent weeks, killing at least 69 people and forcing authorities to abandon several police stations, the United Nations said Friday.

An additional 83 people have been injured amid a surge in violence reported in the Artibonite Valley that officials blame on a local gang called ""Baz Gran Grif,"" which roughly translates into ""Big Claw.""

The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti known as BINUH said the gang has ""established a climate of terror, characterized by looting, assassinations, kidnappings, destruction, extortion, hijacking of goods and trucks and acts of rape on young girls and women.""

SUSPECTED HAITIAN GANG MEMBER TIED TO MURDERS OF 6 COPS ARRESTED

BINUH said it is ""alarmed by the speed with which the gang has extended its activities to new areas, and by the fleeing of police in multiple communities.""

The gang is accused of killing seven officers with Haiti’s National Police in a single day in late January as part of continuing attacks that have forced one hospital that serves some 700,000 people in the region to suspend all services a week ago. Schools also remain closed, while commercial activity and public transportation have slowed, the U.N. said.

Gang activity had been largely confined to Port-au-Prince, with gangs controlling an estimated 60% of the capital, but they have become increasingly powerful and violent elsewhere.

U.N. officials said that thousands of people in the central communities of Liancourt, Verrettes, Petite Rivière de l ’Artibonite and Estère have fled to other neighborhoods to escape the ongoing violence.

VIOLENT GANGS IN HAITI COULD POSE SIMILAR THREAT TO US AS MS-13, SEN. CASSIDY SAYS: 'MIGHT BE A RHYTHM THERE'

""This cycle of violence absolutely must be stopped,"" BINUH said. ""We urge the authorities to do everything to protect the inhabitants of the region as well as their property.""

The increase in violence in Haiti’s central region comes as Prime Minister Ariel Henry continues to plead for the deployment of foreign troops, a request first made in October. The international community has instead opted to impose sanctions and send military equipment and other resources.
